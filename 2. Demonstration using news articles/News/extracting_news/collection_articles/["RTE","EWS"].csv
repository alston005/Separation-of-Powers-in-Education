States in turn are to reimburse a certain amount of money for every RTE admission.

However, it turns out that the Maharashtra government is looking around for ways to not pay these schools the money it owes them.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Maharashtra, led by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, can claim credit for many successes, especially with the irrigation project Jalyukt Shivar and an impressive infrastructure upgrade topping the list. However, its record on one front has been abysmal, i.e., in fulfilling its responsibility under the Right to Education (RTE) Act.

According to Section 12 of the RTE, non-minority unaided private schools are required to reserve 25 per cent of the seats in entry-level classes (either primary level or Class 1) for students belonging to disadvantaged groups (DGs) [Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), etc] and economically weaker sections (EWS) [income less than a certain amount]. The state in return is supposed to pay these schools, for every RTE admission, an amount fixed by the government or the tuition fee of a school, whichever is less. Maharashtra has fixed an amount of Rs 17,000 a year for RTE students.

But it goes to great lengths to avoid reimbursing this amount to schools. Though the schools have been reserving seats under RTE since 2012, the government tried to get out of its commitment by simply agreeing to pay dues for only one academic year. Then, there was disagreement over the actual amount due and how it should be calculated. The government said it owed Rs 300 crore while the schools said the amount was more than 1,000 crore.

This mismatch in estimates came about because the government wanted to pay only for fresh RTE admissions while the schools were asking to be compensated for all RTE admissions (new and repeat/old students - explained in detail here).

Even to date, the dues of past academic years have not been fully released to all the private schools. Now, the Maharashtra government has come up with a new plan to avoid paying the money it owes to these institutions. In a government resolution released recently, it has modified the norms for RTE reimbursement stating that ""if a private school is using any government land and benefiting from the same then the school would not receive reimbursement for students who have been admitted in 25 per cent RTE quota,"" Mumbai Mirror reported.

Through this order, the government has effectively imposed a retrospective binding of sorts in an agreement that is in force for years and it has done so in a one-sided manner. This is a textbook definition of ""breach of contract"". When the government leased out land, it didn't impose a condition that schools will have to reserve 25 per cent seats for EWS/DG category students. Nor does the RTE Act mandate that those schools that have received land from the government at concessional rates will not be compensated for fulfilling the RTE quota. Hence, both from the RTE Act and the leasing agreement, the government's action is prima facie illegal. Less said about the ethical aspect of its action, the better.

Independent English Schools Association (IESA) secretary Rajendra Singh told Swarajya that ""the government's action is not just illogical but outright illegal. The RTE and land leasing are two separate contracts. In any case, under the RTE Act, the government gives reimbursement for only tuition fees and not for infrastructure costs the school has to bear. Land comes under the latter category. How can the two be clubbed? If the government was paying per student reimbursement for infrastructure costs also, then they had a case. In such a scenario, they could have deducted this from total reimbursement, but how can they not reimburse the tuition fees?""

Singh further explained that the government simply ""doesn't have the data to ascertain how many schools have the land leasing agreement with the government. Nor it has the manpower to determine this number. It will take anywhere between one to two years to collect the data. This is nothing but their latest attempt to delay payments to private schools."""

To maintain uniformity in admissions under the Economically Weaker Section (EWS)/ Disadvantaged Group (DG) category for entry-level classes in all private unaided recognised schools of Delhi except minority schools, the Directorate of Education will conduct the process online from the 2019-20 session onwards.

A circular released by the DoE has asked all district-level officers to verify and update the list of all private unaided schools in Delhi along with their GPS coordinates. Schools have been given time till Thursday to check EWS/DG vacancies and update the information in case of any discrepancy from the records available with the DoE.

""If no representation is received from the school concerned, then it will be presumed that the data available with the DoE is correct and students will be allotted accordingly through computerised draw of lots. Thereafter, school shall not deny admission, "" added the DoE circular.

It added in case admission is denied once it has been allotted by draw of lots, necessary action will be taken against the school.

According to the RTE Act 2009, all private unaided recognised schools are under obligation to admit in entry-level classes at least 25% of the class strength children belonging to weaker sections and disadvantage group from the neighbourhood, and provide free and compulsory elementary education till its completion"

The income-declaration form has been made available only in English.

The parents of children competing for reserved seats under the Right to Education (RTE) Act had struggled to fill even the registration form for different private schools, as those too were in English. Parents allege that it has been done to discourage poor families who want good education for their children. ""Not just the forms, even the guidelines and admission notice were printed in English. They don't want our children to even qualify,"" said a disgruntled parent from the slum colony of Bapu Dham.

Some of the parents even had to ask the document-centre people to fill their form for a price. They others asked their employers to help them. Some of the parents were pleading with people at e-Sampark centres to interpret the form for them. ""I asked a Sampark-centre employee to tell me what was written in the form, but he said he was too busy to help. So I requested the customers who had come to deposit their utility bills to translate the form so that I could know what documents to arrange for my child's admission,"" said Shashi Pal, who had come to the e-Sampark centre of Sector 10.

Chandigarh parents Association president Nitin Goyal said: ""Most of the families from the EWS (economically weaker section) category have poor literacy level, with hardly any proficiency in English. The EWS applicants don't know what to do with the form, as they cannot read English. The administration should provide them with forms in Hindi and Punjabi versions, too.""

RTE consultant Chanchal Singh of the Chandigarh Commission for the Protection of Child Rights, who is also former deputy director of school education, said: ""The forms for admission and income declaration should be in both Hindi and English, so that these are easier for people to interpret. Otherwise, it will be a disadvantage to parents from poor class. The information mismatch might lead to cancellation of the form, even if the case is genuine. And if it is not genuine, the parents will have an excuse that they were not aware, as they got someone else to fill their form."""

This is forcing the schools to discontinue the admissions of a few students from the Open category.

Even as admissions for pre-primary sections began in October, many schools in the city are not assuring promotion to selected children from senior kg to the 1st grade. As a result, aggrieved parents are running from one school to another to seek admission for their children.

A parent from South Mumbai said, ""Earlier, the school would give admission forms which the parents would take home to fill them up and submit the next day. But, now the schools are asking parents to fill the forms the same day in the school itself, and return them immediately. This is all because they don't want parents to click pictures of the admission forms and send it to the media to expose them. The schools are mentioning in the forms that there's no guarantee of a child getting promoted to class 1. When we went to one of the South Mumbai schools to fill the form, we saw read this and were very disappointed.""

Jayant Jain, president of Forum for Fairness in Education, said, ""Most of the schools still don't guarantee admission of children in class 1 after taking them in pre-primary as they wanted to conduct fresh admissions in class 1 and also fill the 25 per cent quota under RTE. But this is all wrong and this practice should be stopped. Parents first have to buy so many admission forms and spend so much money on them and the prospectus, and yet they have to be insecure about their child's admission.""

New Delhi: Private schools in India have over 20 lakh seats reserved each year for children from the economically weaker sections (EWS) of society, but only 20 per cent of them get filled, a report by legislative rights group Indus Action has revealed.

Under Section 12 (1) (c) of the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, 25 per cent of seats from private, unaided schools are reserved for EWS children. However, over the years, many schools and even state governments have not taken the Act seriously.

States like Delhi, Gujarat and Rajasthan have performed very well, but others are yet to catch up, the report said.

Indus Action is a Delhi-based organisation, which works closely with the state and Central governments on the implementation of legislative rights like RTE.

From an all-India enrolment figure of 5.1 lakh in 2013-14, the first year that the Act was seriously implemented by schools, the number declined to 4.8 lakh in 2014-15, then rose to 6 lakh in 2015-16, and finally hit a low of 4.3 lakh in 2016-17. The data has been collated by the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), which is the official data collecting platform of the government of India.

The 2015-16 figure represented 27 per cent enrolment on EWS seats, while for the other three years, the percentage has hovered around the 20 per cent mark.

The report also showed that many schools are still not opening their doors to children from poor families. The number of schools that offered EWS seats was just 16 per cent in 2016-17.

""Lack of school participation is one of the biggest reasons for a low fill rate,"" said the report.

Looking at the low rates of admission in the EWS category, the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development sent a letter to all the states earlier this month, asking them to submit reports on the issue. The ministry, however, said it could only play a monitoring role, and not force states to adopt the rule, as education is a state subject.

There are many reasons for low admissions in the EWS category, ranging from private schools not willing to give admission to students to parents not approaching schools because of lack of awareness.

""A major factor which affects enrolment in this category is the social stigma. Many schools don't open up their doors to children from the weaker section of society, thinking that they will not be able adjust with the rest of the children,"" said Kanika Verma, strategy head of Indus Action.

""Also, many parents are not aware that their children can get admission in private schools, so they end up sending them to government schools only. That is where we are trying to step in and create awareness about the Act,"" she said.

A private school teacher who wished to remain anonymous pointed to another factor. ""Apart from social factors, another factor that plays a part in EWS admissions being low is because there is a very big government school lobby in states, which pushes private schools to not admit children under EWS category, fearing a drop in (government school) numbers,"" the teacher said.

The EWS category is also misused by well-to-do people who are not able to get admission for their children through regular methods. Nursery admission is a major problem for parents, especially in Delhi. Earlier this year, the Delhi Police had arrested a man who produced a fake EWS certificate to get his son admitted in a reputed private school.

The Indus Action report said while the Act is supposed to cover both economically and socially-disadvantaged sections of the society, the breakdown of admissions data between the two categories indicates that the latter group is not getting anywhere near adequate coverage.

""These categories include child in need of care and protection, orphan children, children with special needs, child labourers, transgender children, HIV+ children, among others,"" it said.

""In Delhi, in 2018, only 1 per cent of admissions were under the disadvantaged category. In Gujarat in 2018, less than 1 per cent of admitted students were covered by students in disadvantaged categories.

""While several states have a policy to ensure gender equity in admissions, the policy has not been successful in admitting vulnerable children at a disadvantage,"" the report said."
