A DAY after a 14-year-old student allegedly committed suicide in a residential school for tribal children in Thane district, the principal and deputy principal of the school were booked on Wednesday for abetting suicide after the girl named them in her suicide note.

The deceased was a Class VIII student at an ashram shala, a residential school run by the government for tribal children. A few months ago, the girl was allegedly asked by the school authorities to vacate her hostel room over her frequent unsanctioned visits to her family. Students are expected to stay in school hostels and leave for home only with written permission from the authorities, the police said.

""At the start of the new academic year in June, the principal and deputy principal asked her to vacate the hostel and make the daily commute to school from her home. The girl was very upset. It was only when her father pleaded with the school authorities that they agreed to take her back,"" said a police officer.

However, earlier this month, the girl went home for three days and pleaded with her parents to be taken out of the hostel. ""Her father reported that she was unhappy and withdrawn,"" added the officer.

In her room, the police found a note in which the girl allegedly held the principal and his deputy responsible for her death. ""The note was addressed to her parents, saying that she was being troubled by the principal and deputy principal and that if they wanted to see her alive, they should pull her out of the school,"" said the officer.

On the basis of a complaint lodged by the parents, the police registered a case on Wednesday."

According to a local source, the GA High School in Lalganj Vaishali, which has over 1,000 students enrolled in Classes IX and X, divided the students on the basis of their religion and caste and asked them to sit in separate classrooms accordingly. Their attendance registers also mention their caste along with their names, so as to ensure that all students stuck to the religion and caste-based division while sitting in the classrooms.

""The issue came to the fore when some students of the school raised an objection to the caste-based segregation, following which the district administration probed the matter and ordered action against the principal, Meena Kumari,"" the source added.

Kumari, in her defence, said she only continued with the seating plan decided by her predecessor as it was convenient to implement the various welfare schemes of the government if the students were seated accordingly. She also denied that the students had ever been discriminated due to their religion or caste.

The local officials of the education department have sent a detailed report on the matter to the senior officials for information and further recommendation.

According to principal Jha's statement, the victims were standing outside to either use the washroom or to drink water. Since he was busy inside the school as examinations were going on, he didn't know the exact sequence of the event, said police officials.

Five children were trapped under the rubble of the boundary wall when it collapsed. All five had been rushed to nearby hospitals after they were extricated from the debris by the locals, the police and a team from NDRF.

Two of the students identified as Vivek Yadav (7) and Bhupendra Singh (11) died while three others were critically injured. One of the injured students was discharged from the hospital on Tuesday while the other two continue to recuperate.

According to police, construction work was in progress on the adjoining plot. The sand from the construction site was kept along the boundary wall of the school, which was about 10-feet high, and the weight of it allegedly weakened it thereby, leading to its collapse.

Police had registered an FIR against six persons, including the management of the school and the neighbour on whose plot the construction was taking place.

However, the owner of the school, who identifies himself as a leader of Samajwadi Party's youth wing Yuvjan Sabha, is absconding.

The principal, Sanjeev Jha, an original resident of Sitamarhi district in Bihar, was arrested by Sector 49 police from near Arogyadhan Maharshi Ashram, Sector 107 on Tuesday.

While Amit Bhati, who identifies himself as the state secretary of Yuvjan Sabha, is the chairman and owner of KM Public School, his uncle Deshraj Bhati is the owner of the adjacent plot where an earthmover was levelling the land, resulting in the wall collapse.

The students were sitting near the wall in the open and writing an exam when the wall collapsed on them. While two students died, five others were injured.

So far, Sector 49 police has booked Amit Bhati, his uncle Deshraj Bhati, Deshraj's son Sumit Bhati, school manager Raghvendra Solanki, principal Sanjeev Jha and the unidentified driver of the earthmover.

Meanwhile, a visit to the spot indicates that Amit is well-known in the area. A board installed at the entry of the lane to his three-storey house reads: Amit Bhati, pradesh sachiv (state secretary), Samajwadi Party Yuvjan Sabha. He is also well-known as the owner of multiple properties in the village, most of which have been given on rent.

Since Monday morning, when the tragedy struck, Amit and his kin have gone missing while his house remains locked. ""They are not here. The family has gone missing since the incident,"" said a neighbour.

Asked whether Amit was active in the party's youth wing, Gajendra, a villager, told TOI that Amit was seen during different campaigns and activities of the party. ""You can see the board installed here right at the entry of the lane. The family belongs to the village and owns land here,"" he said, pointing to the board.

In the village, many don't want to talk about Amit and his family.

""We live in the building rented out by the family. They own many buildings here,"" said the aunt of one of the children who got injured in the wall collapse.

While the party has officially denied that Amit was a member, some leaders admitted that he had indeed been associated with the party's activities and had even participated in meetings of the Yuvajan Sabha in Noida prior to the disbanding of the youth outfit last year.

""He used to follow a cabinet minister from the state and was actively involved in the party prior to the feud between the Shivpal and Akhilesh factions,"" said a local leader.

Surendra Nagar, Rajya Sabha MP from the SP, told TOI that Amit does not hold even primary membership of the party. ""There are some people who tend to use the party's name. However, he is not even a primary member,"" he said.

According to villagers, the school had been running for the past years but its responsibility was handed over to Solanki and Jha on profit-sharing basis. The responsibility to manage the school was handed over to the duo after changing its name from Khajan memorial to KM Public School last year.

Meanwhile, the students who had been recuperating in two different hospitals are out of danger.

One of the children, Akash (9), who was seriously injured, underwent two surgeries at Yatharth hospital on Tuesday in his right leg and thigh and a rod has been inserted in his leg.

Akhilesh Kumar, father of seven-year-old Amit told TOI that the children -Amit, Naitik and Ashish -- are yet to recover from their injuries. SSP Ajay Pal Sharma told TOI that the teams are out to hunt for the other accused."

Chanchal and her elder sister Pratibha study in the village school now.

Several people from the village who shifted to Jodhpur city just to provide better education to their wards have returned to the village. Some private schools in the area have shut down due to shortage of students, say villagers. The Chopasni Government School is getting students from nearby villages, too, said block education officer Manohar Singh.

The school's transformation began in 2015 when an alumnus, Himmat Singh Ratnoo, became its principal. The school has recorded 100% results since then. The school has a projector room, computer labs, CCTV cameras, library and RO water facility.

""My first aim was to bring the children out of the inferiority complex of studying in a government school. Along with the villagers, I wrote a letter to ONGC and HPCL requesting help to construct two separate toilets for girls and boys as part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR). The school thus got two toilets that cost Rs 3.5 lakh each,"" said Ratnoo.

""Several girls who dropped out after a certain age due to lack of toilet facilities in school returned to study here,"" said Tima Ram Dhandhu, a villager.

""The next step was ensuring sufficient number of teachers. At present, there are 17 teachers in the school. I contacted several philanthropists and wrote letters to many others requesting financial assistance. The Rotary Club donated a projector and we raised over Rs 4 lakh to construct gated boundary walls and a prayer ground. Several others, including the village panchayat, contributed to construct classrooms in the school and install CCTV cameras,"" said Ratnoo.

""Having a school like this in a village like ours where the health facilities could not reach is an achievement. The entire village made it a vision to get better education facilities for our children. The panchayat collected money to make four new rooms in the school,"" said Gehlot.

Suresh Ratnoo, panchayat shayak, said he went door-to-door along with the teachers of the school explaining the developments in the school to the villages and motivating children, especially girls, to join the school. ""We told the people that the school has better education facilities and toilets. Now the number of girls and boys who study in the school is almost the same.

The Principal of a secondary school in Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh, Chand Mian has been suspended for beating students who did not wish him with the Arabic greeting As-Salaam-Alaikum, Press Trust of India has reported.

Principal secretary and nodal officer of the district Dimple Verma was informed of this when she went on an inspection to Bilhari Secondary School in Tilhar area. ""As-Salaam-Alaikum"" is an Arabic greeting which means ""Peace be upon you"".

A class 6 student told that the principal was beating up students who were not able to spell out the greeting. Chief Development Officer Prerana Sharma was quoted as saying that the victim student showed injury marks on the neck.

The student was later sent for medical examination by authorities. A preliminary inquiry report has been handed over to Basic Shiksha Adikari (BSA) Rakesh Kumar.

Chand Mian though rejected the allegations by claiming that he was being defamed as part of some conspiracy.

The Yogi Adityanath led Uttar Pradesh government had earlier cancelled the accreditation and registration of a madrasa in Maharajganj which had forced its students not to sing the national anthem during Independence Day celebrations earlier this year."

The high court has held that even the school administrator's failing to address the issue immediately amounts to abetting a crime listed under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. Justice Fateh Deep Singh's verdict, which upholds the Chandigarh district court's decision of asking the

school administrator to come and face charges under the Pocso Act, is meant to deter all those school managements that sit on child-abuse complaints.

Even though the district court had not summoned the principal, the high court ordered the local court to summon her as well. The verdict says that the summoning orders of August 5, 2017 (issued by an additional sessions judge who is also judge of the special court) appear to have missed this material point. For the sake of justice, the high court deems it ""essential to exercise the powers under Section 482 of the CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure) and direct the court where the matter is pending to ensure that even the principal, who had the knowledge of this incident..., is not let off.""

Dismissing the petition of the school administrator against his summoning to face prosecution, justice Singh observed that since the matter was brought to the notice of the school authorities, the administrator's duty was to ensure due redress, in matters concerning child abuse especially. The court observed: ""He (the school administrator) cannot hide behind the facade of lack of knowledge or information.""

So that matters like these are not brushed under the carpet and the purpose of the Pocso Act is met by all means, the high court has said that the district magistrate and the UT director of school education must fulfil their obligations under UN convention and Section 43 (public awareness of the law) of the Pocso Act."

The man had been troubling a milk contractor and asking for commission for clearning his bills. The aggrieved party used to supply milk under the Annapurna scheme for school children. The ACB has registered a case and is investigating the school principal.

According to ACB sleuths, the accused principal has been identified as one Gamer Lal, a resident of Udaipur, currently posted as principal of government primary school at Tekri near Udaipur.

""Recently the Udaipur wing of the ACB received a complaint against the Principal. In his grievance, the complainant - identified as Hira Lal, a resident of Agarwal Colony at Udaipur - claimed he used to supply milk for the children studying at the primary school at Tekri,"" ACB officials investigating the case said. This was being done under the Annapurna Scheme floated by the Vasundhara Raje government under which schoolkids are provided with free milk.

However, over the past several weeks he had stopped receiving his payments for the milk supplied to the school. When the contractor approached the principal to inquire about the non-payment of his bills, the school principal demanded Hira Lal pay him Rs 8,500 as commission, instead of making the payment.

""The accused also assured him that once the money is handed over, he would clear all his bills,"" officials said. When several attempts at getting the principal to forego the commission failed, the complainant approached the ACB for help.

""After the complaint was registered, a bid to verify the same was initiated. When the demand was verified, it was decided to lay a trap and nab the man red-handed,' an official said. On Tuesday afternoon the ball was set rolling.

The complainant was handed over the commission money and sent to the principal's office. As soon as the money exchanged hands, the complainant gave a signal to the ACB sleuths who raided the school premises and nabbed the principal red-handed while he was collecting the money.

All are enrolled at the Presbyterian Secondary School in Bamenda, capital of Cameroon's Northwest Region -- one of two areas where surging anglophone separatist militancy has been met with a brutal crackdown by authorities.

Communications Minister Issa Bakary Tchiroma said ""all 79 students"" seized on Monday ""have been released,"" without giving details of the circumstances under which they were set free.

File image of Security forces in Cameroon. Reuters

The students were kidnapped with their principal, a teacher and a driver, but Tchiroma said their fate was not yet clear.

Separately, the Presbyterian Church, which runs the school, said that 11 other pupils were taken on 31 October but they have now been freed.

News of their disappearance had been withheld to enable negotiations with the kidnappers, the church said.

It said the school, located on the outskirts of Bamenda where there is a negligible presence by the security forces, would remain shuttered ""until further notice"".

On Tuesday, a leading member of the church, Reverend Foki Samuel Forba, said he had been negotiating with the kidnappers, who were not demanding a ransom but the closure of the school.

The kidnappings were the first such mass abductions seen in Cameroon and coincide with an upsurge of political tensions in the majority French-speaking country.

The release was announced a day after Cameroon's 85-year-old President Paul Biya was sworn in for a seventh term in office.

A six-minute video seen by AFP on Monday, but which could not be confirmed independently, showed 11 boys apparently aged about 15 giving their identity and name of the school in English, and adding that they were abducted by the ""Amba Boys"" -- a name for anglophone separatists.

Unprecedented in Cameroon

Such mass kidnappings were previously unknown in Cameroon, though they are notorious in neighbouring Nigeria.

The Islamist group Boko Haram snatched more than 200 schoolgirls from Nigeria's Borno state town of Chibok in April 2014, sparking worldwide condemnation and the #FreeOurGirls movement on Twitter.

Some 107 girls have since been released or found, but the Islamist group abducted scores more schoolgirls from the neighbouring Yobe state in February this year.

Cameroon's Biya on Tuesday promised to pursue policies of decentralisation to address ""frustrations and aspirations"" in English-speaking regions.

It was his first public acknowledgement of resentments that have spilled over in the country's anglophone Northwest and neighbouring Southwest Region.

In 2016, anger at perceived discrimination in education, the judiciary and the economy fanned demands for autonomy in the anglophone regions.

But Biya refused any concessions and a year later, radicals declared an independent state -- the ""Republic of Ambazonia"" -- taking up arms soon after.

Separatists have since attacked troops and police, boycotted and torched schools and attacked other state symbols, prompting a severe official crackdown.

At the start of the school year in September, several secondary schools were attacked, a headmaster was killed and a teacher was badly wounded.

At least 400 civilians and more than 175 members of the security forces have been killed in the year to September, according to a toll compiled by non-governmental organisations.

More than 300,000 others have fled the violence, some crossing into neighbouring Nigeria.

Around a fifth of Cameroon's 22 million people are English-speaking -- a minority whose presence dates back to the colonial period.

The orders were issued on Monday night after Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh received an inquiry report, which found the incident to be a case of ""gross negligence, indifference and insensitivity"" on the part of the teachers of the school, he said.

School headmaster Kuldeep Kaur and teacher Jyoti have been suspended on the directives of the chief minister, the spokesperson said. A charge sheet will also be issued under Rule 8 of the Conduct Rules against Kaur and Jyoti, who have been placed under suspension, he said.

The incident, which came to light last week, was brought to the chief minister's notice after a video showed students crying and complaining that they had been stripped by the teachers in the school premises. The teachers were reportedly trying to find out who was wearing a sanitary pad, after a soiled one was found in the school toilet.

The HC said the teachers were supposed to be the custodians and guardians of the minor girl but they committed the heinous crime.

A division bench of Justices Sambhaji Shinde and Ajay Gadkari said, ""In the present case though there is delay of about two months in lodging the FIR, considering the fact that the victim was minor girl at the relevant time the offence took place. The offence was committed by her teacher, who was supposed to be her custodian and guardian during school hours.""

""It also needs to be remembered that if such ghastly and heinous crime take place in the villages, it creates serious impact on the minds of the villagers and puts question marks on future of minor victim girls,"" the judges observed. The bench accordingly, upheld the conviction and 18-years rigorous imprisonment of professor - Datta Jadhav (43) and also the 16-years rigorous imprisonment of principal - Vanita Patil (56).

Both Jadhav and Patil were employees of a Zilla Parishad school in Raigad. They had petitioned the bench of Justice Shinde, challenging their conviction by a sessions court. According to the prosecution case, Jadhav had molested several minor girl students of his school by abusing his post as a professor. He had even raped a 12-year-old girl and had even clicked obscene photos of 13 minor girls of his school. These photographs were later recovered from Jadhav's cell phone.

As far as Patil is concerned, she was convicted by the sessions court for abetting the crime by pushing the minor girl inside a room, where Jadhav committed rape on the girl. It was learnt that Patil stood outside the room and ensured that no one enters the room until Jadhav comes out after raping the girl. She had even bolted the doors of the room.

To their defence, the convicted duo argued that no rape took place and they were falsely implicated and arrested under political pressure. They blamed the sarpanch of the survivor's village, who, the duo claimed had got the FIR registered against them.

Having considered the submissions, the bench trashed the argument saying, ""The victim was from a socio-economic backward village and it is a matter of common knowledge that such villagers had no courage to face such uncommon incidents, and so in such a situation they always try to take the help of known person in the village when they had to go to police station."""

In the video, the kidnappers were seeing forcing several students to reveal their names and the names of their parents. The children say they were kidnapped late on Sunday but they don't know where they are being held.

The men who identify themselves as the kidnappers say they will only release the children when they achieve what they want.

While the video could not be independently verified, parents have been reacting on social media saying they recognise their children in the video.

It comes after elections on October 7 that saw President Paul Biya, 85, who has ruled the country with an iron fist for 35 years, secure a seventh term in office.

Biya was credited with 71.3 percent of the vote, although the ballot was marred by allegations of widespread fraud, low voter turnout and violence. He takes his oath of office on Tuesday.

Around a fifth of Cameroon's 22 million people are English-speaking - a minority whose presence dates back to the colonial period.

Cameroon, once a German colony, was divided between Britain and France after World War I.

The French colony gained independence in 1960, becoming Cameroon. The following year, the British-ruled Southern Cameroons was amalgamated into it, giving rise to the Northwest and Southwest regions.

But resentment at perceived discrimination at the hands of the francophone majority, especially in education and the judiciary, began to build.

In 2016, demands for greater autonomy grew but met with a rebuff by Biya.

As radicals took ascendancy, the anglophone movement declared the creation of the ""Republic of Ambazonia"" in the Northwest and neighbouring Southwest Region on October 1, 2017.

No country has recognised the self-declared state.

The separatists have gunned down troops and police, boycotted and torched schools and attacked other perceived symbols of the Cameroonian state.

The authorities have responded with a massive crackdown by police and troops.

At least 400 civilians have been killed this year as well as more than 175 members of the security forces, according to a toll compiled by non-governmental organisations.

According to UN figures, 246,000 people in the Southwest Region have fled their homes, and 25,000 have sought shelter in neighbouring Nigeria, many of them living hand-to-mouth in the forests."

Attaullah Marwat, who is also the school's owner, was arrested in this city after police registered a case against him on July 14, 2017, on the complaint of a boy student.

A sessions court here handed a total of 105 years in prison to the principal on charges of child abuse, pornography, rape, blackmail and maintaining illicit relations.

All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) MLA Aminul Islam said in a Facebook post, ""There cannot be any harm if some girl students go to college in 'hijab' (veil worn by Muslim women) and 'niqab' (clothing that covers the face)"" as reported by TOI.

Responding to the allegation by the opposition leader, principal of Anandaram Dhekial Phookan (ADP) College Dr Surajit Kumar Bhagowati on Friday said he did not ban any religious outfit and only issued a notice before the Autumn vacation asking students to wear ""proper uniform"".

He further added that out of the 20 per cent Muslim students of the college, only the MLA's daughter wears a burqa in college. He was feeling threatened and has lodged a police complaint over the Facebook post of the AIUDF leader, the principal said.

On being asked whether he has banned 'hijab' and 'niqab' in the college, the principal said he neither ordered any such ban nor did he ask any student not to wear burqa in the campus.

The MLA, a former student of the ADP College, asked in the post written in Assamese, ""Is the college your paternal property? What was so bothersome about a few students attending the college wearing 'hijab' or 'niqab'? Does wearing decent clothes affect the college environment?""

The college's Students Union and the Teachers' Council have criticised the MLA for the social media post. The Muslim students have also come out in support of the move of the principal.

They said before journalists that if students of different religious communities insist on coming in their respective outfits to the institute, the secular environment of the college will be vitiated."

Three former students of a Catholic school in Chandigarh have levelled sexual harassment charges against the former principal and co-founding director of the school on social media.

Harold Carver, who is the principal of the school has been accused of sexual harassment by Manraj Singh.

Manraj, a student of the 1980 batch, has called Carver a sexual predator on his Facebook page. He said that he and his hostel mates were aware of the principal's activities. He mentioned that he was a Class 7 student when the accused called him to his office and initiated an uncomfortable conversation with him.

Earlier, a 42-year-old Delhi based journalist Sanjay Austa had accused Harold Carver of sexually harassing him and his hostel mates when he was a student in the school. Austa had said in his blog that he was a Class 9 student when Carver abused him in his office.

""Harold Carver is a sexual predator whose choice was children. Ever since I learnt that Harold Carver was back in Chandigarh, I started getting worried. How many children would he have abused in his entire career? How many like me who knew he was a pedophile were silenced? How many kids couldn't have walked out of his office the way I did that day,"" said Sanjay Austa.

Another former student Navin Chhetri, who is currently in Colorado, US, has also accused Harold of sexual harassment.

However, it is not for the first time that Harold has been accused of sexual harassment by his students. Carver was also sentenced to prison for one month 30 years ago for allegedly abusing half a dozen students. Navin Chhetri, who was one of the students had also appeared in the court. The complaint was later withdrawn.

The school management has refuted the allegations against Harold Carver saying that he is a ""man of intense integrity"" and accusations levelled against him are false, baseless and extremely hurtful.

Harold Carver has also termed the allegations as baseless.

""I have an unblemished record and cannot even imagine committing such an act. I sanguinely feel that the whole game is to malign the reputation of the school,"" Harold Carver said.

The reason is said to be a property dispute. Ironically, the victim, Ranganath Nayaka, had gone to the school to discuss the same issue with a local leader who offered to mediate.

The attack took place around 10 am in Havanur Public School in Agrahara Dasarahalli on Magadi Road. About five hours later, the police were able to trace the main attacker Muniraju alias Babli in Mahalakshmi Layout, where they were forced to open fire at him and nab him. The rest are absconding. The dispute pertains to a building owned by one Gangamma on a site adjacent to the school, which had encroached upon the school property. The encroaching part of the building was demolished by the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) two days ago based on a court order.

Ranganath Nayaka, a resident of Housing Board Colony near Rajajinagar, has retired as assistant manager at RBI. Nayaka owned the school, which he set up in 2003 after he retired. The family hails from Pavagada in Tumakuru district and had settled in the city. A police officer said the incident took place when Nayaka and the school's administrative staff were at a meeting with a local leader, Rajashekar, to resolve the same property dispute.

Lokesh Gowda, an employee, and Yathish, an assistant, rushed to Nayaka's rescue, but the duo too was attacked by the gang which then fled the scene. The attackers included Gangamma's two sons. Gowda and Yathish sustained stab injuries. Lokesh Gowda said, ""The gang stabbed Nayaka in his chest, thigh and stomach.""

Preliminary investigation has revealed that a portion of a residential building belonging to one Gangamma, located next to the school, had encroached upon the school property. Nayaka had approached the court over the encroachment as it was creating a problem for the school. The court had ordered demolition of the encroaching portion and BDA officials had demolished it with police protection two days ago.

Gangamma's sons Prasad and Mahesh had reportedly nurtured a grudge against Nayaka over the demolition and had allegedly planned to kill him.

Prasad along with his gang came and allegedly attacked Nayaka in his chamber, stabbing him to death.

Babli, who was among the first to attack, was arrested within five hours of the murder, while Prasad, Mahesh and three others are absconding. The police have formed a special team to nab them, a police officer said. ""We are yet to ascertain whether Babli and his gang had taken any 'supari' contract from Prasad to kill Nayaka,"" an investigation officer added.

Nayaka's elder brother Nagendraiah told The New Indian Express that Gangamma had passed away recently after which her two sons Prasad and Mahesh got into a dispute with Nayaka over the encroachment.

He said Rajashekhar, a local leader, who was also known to Prasad and Mahesh, had offered to mediate between the two parties to resolve the dispute. ""My brother was being called to the school since two days. But he could not go as he had undergone an eye surgery a week ago. On Sunday he sought the doctor's advice before going to the school,"" Nagendariah said."

According to a local source, the GA High School in Lalganj Vaishali, which has over 1,000 students enrolled in Classes IX and X, divided the students on the basis of their religion and caste and asked them to sit in separate classrooms accordingly. Their attendance registers also mention their caste along with their names, so as to ensure that all students stuck to the religion and caste-based division while sitting in the classrooms.

The local officials of the education department have sent a detailed report on the matter to the senior officials for information and further recommendation.

The Government of Bihar not just provides scholarships but also funds for buying the uniform and cycle to the students, most of which is now directly transferred to their bank accounts, if the students have 75% attendance."

Another FIR has been filed by the education department on Monday against the same accused for running the unauthorised school.

""In August 2017, we had shut a similar unauthorised school at the same site. However, soon after they changed the name of the school and reopened it. We are hopeful that the accused will be arrested soon,"" said basic education officer, Balmukund Prasad.

The incident occurred around 9.30 am on Monday in Salarpur village, while an exam was going on inside the school.

According to principal Jha's statement, the victims were standing outside to either use the washroom or to drink water. Since he was busy inside the school as examinations were going on, he didn't know the exact sequence of the event, said police officials.

Five children were trapped under the rubble of the boundary wall when it collapsed. All five had been rushed to nearby hospitals after they were extricated from the debris by the locals, the police and a team from NDRF.

Two of the students identified as Vivek Yadav (7) and Bhupendra Singh (11) died while three others were critically injured. One of the injured students was discharged from the hospital on Tuesday while the other two continue to recuperate.

According to police, construction work was in progress on the adjoining plot. The sand from the construction site was kept along the boundary wall of the school, which was about 10-feet high, and the weight of it allegedly weakened it thereby, leading to its collapse.

Police had registered an FIR against six persons, including the management of the school and the neighbour on whose plot the construction was taking place. The persons who have been booked are Amit and Sumit Bhati (owners), Deshraj Bhati (neighbouring plot owner), Sanjiv Jha (principal), Raghvendra Solanki (school manager) and the operator of the earthmover ( yet to be identified).

However, the owner of the school, who identifies himself as a leader of Samajwadi Party's youth wing Yuvjan Sabha, is absconding.

The principal, Sanjeev Jha, an original resident of Sitamarhi district in Bihar, was arrested by Sector 49 police from near Arogyadhan Maharshi Ashram, Sector 107 on Tuesday.

While Amit Bhati, who identifies himself as the state secretary of Yuvjan Sabha, is the chairman and owner of KM Public School, his uncle Deshraj Bhati is the owner of the adjacent plot where an earthmover was levelling the land, resulting in the wall collapse.

The students were sitting near the wall in the open and writing an exam when the wall collapsed on them. While two students died, five others were injured.

So far, Sector 49 police has booked Amit Bhati, his uncle Deshraj Bhati, Deshraj's son Sumit Bhati, school manager Raghvendra Solanki, principal Sanjeev Jha and the unidentified driver of the earthmover.

Meanwhile, a visit to the spot indicates that Amit is well-known in the area. A board installed at the entry of the lane to his three-storey house reads: Amit Bhati, pradesh sachiv (state secretary), Samajwadi Party Yuvjan Sabha. He is also well-known as the owner of multiple properties in the village, most of which have been given on rent.

Since Monday morning, when the tragedy struck, Amit and his kin have gone missing while his house remains locked. ""They are not here. The family has gone missing since the incident,"" said a neighbour.

Asked whether Amit was active in the party's youth wing, Gajendra, a villager, told TOI that Amit was seen during different campaigns and activities of the party. ""You can see the board installed here right at the entry of the lane. The family belongs to the village and owns land here,"" he said, pointing to the board.

In the village, many don't want to talk about Amit and his family.

""We live in the building rented out by the family. They own many buildings here,"" said the aunt of one of the children who got injured in the wall collapse.

While the party has officially denied that Amit was a member, some leaders admitted that he had indeed been associated with the party's activities and had even participated in meetings of the Yuvajan Sabha in Noida prior to the disbanding of the youth outfit last year.

""He used to follow a cabinet minister from the state and was actively involved in the party prior to the feud between the Shivpal and Akhilesh factions,"" said a local leader.

Surendra Nagar, Rajya Sabha MP from the SP, told TOI that Amit does not hold even primary membership of the party. ""There are some people who tend to use the party's name. However, he is not even a primary member,"" he said.

According to villagers, the school had been running for the past years but its responsibility was handed over to Solanki and Jha on profit-sharing basis. The responsibility to manage the school was handed over to the duo after changing its name from Khajan memorial to KM Public School last year.

Meanwhile, the students who had been recuperating in two different hospitals are out of danger.

One of the children, Akash (9), who was seriously injured, underwent two surgeries at Yatharth hospital on Tuesday in his right leg and thigh and a rod has been inserted in his leg.

Akhilesh Kumar, father of seven-year-old Amit told TOI that the children -Amit, Naitik and Ashish -- are yet to recover from their injuries. SSP Ajay Pal Sharma told TOI that the teams are out to hunt for the other accused."

Several people from the village who shifted to Jodhpur city just to provide better education to their wards have returned to the village. Some private schools in the area have shut down due to shortage of students, say villagers. The Chopasni Government School is getting students from nearby villages, too, said block education officer Manohar Singh.

The school's transformation began in 2015 when an alumnus, Himmat Singh Ratnoo, became its principal. The school has recorded 100% results since then. The school has a projector room, computer labs, CCTV cameras, library and RO water facility.

""My first aim was to bring the children out of the inferiority complex of studying in a government school. Along with the villagers, I wrote a letter to ONGC and HPCL requesting help to construct two separate toilets for girls and boys as part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR).

""The next step was ensuring sufficient number of teachers. At present, there are 17 teachers in the school. I contacted several philanthropists and wrote letters to many others requesting financial assistance. The Rotary Club donated a projector and we raised over Rs 4 lakh to construct gated boundary walls and a prayer ground.

""Having a school like this in a village like ours where the health facilities could not reach is an achievement. The entire village made it a vision to get better education facilities for our children. The panchayat collected money to make four new rooms in the school,"" said Gehlot.

Suresh Ratnoo, panchayat shayak, said he went door-to-door along with the teachers of the school explaining the developments in the school to the villages and motivating children, especially girls, to join the school. ""We told the people that the school has better education facilities and toilets. Now the number of girls and boys who study in the school is almost the same.

Justice Fateh Deep Singh's verdict, which upholds the Chandigarh district court's decision of asking the

school administrator to come and face charges under the Pocso Act, is meant to deter all those school managements that sit on child-abuse complaints.

Even though the district court had not summoned the principal, the high court ordered the local court to summon her as well. The verdict says that the summoning orders of August 5, 2017 (issued by an additional sessions judge who is also judge of the special court) appear to have missed this material point. For the sake of justice, the high court deems it ""essential to exercise the powers under Section 482 of the CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure) and direct the court where the matter is pending to ensure that even the principal, who had the knowledge of this incident..., is not let off.""

Dismissing the petition of the school administrator against his summoning to face prosecution, justice Singh observed that since the matter was brought to the notice of the school authorities, the administrator's duty was to ensure due redress, in matters concerning child abuse especially. The court observed: ""He (the school administrator) cannot hide behind the facade of lack of knowledge or information.""

So that matters like these are not brushed under the carpet and the purpose of the Pocso Act is met by all means, the high court has said that the district magistrate and the UT director of school education must fulfil their obligations under UN convention and Section 43 (public awareness of the law) of the Pocso Act."

The man had been troubling a milk contractor and asking for commission for clearning his bills. The aggrieved party used to supply milk under the Annapurna scheme for school children. The ACB has registered a case and is investigating the school principal.

According to ACB sleuths, the accused principal has been identified as one Gamer Lal, a resident of Udaipur, currently posted as principal of government primary school at Tekri near Udaipur.

""Recently the Udaipur wing of the ACB received a complaint against the Principal. In his grievance, the complainant - identified as Hira Lal, a resident of Agarwal Colony at Udaipur - claimed he used to supply milk for the children studying at the primary school at Tekri,"" ACB officials investigating the case said. This was being done under the Annapurna Scheme floated by the Vasundhara Raje government under which schoolkids are provided with free milk.

However, over the past several weeks he had stopped receiving his payments for the milk supplied to the school. When the contractor approached the principal to inquire about the non-payment of his bills, the school principal demanded Hira Lal pay him Rs 8,500 as commission, instead of making the payment.

""The accused also assured him that once the money is handed over, he would clear all his bills,"" officials said. When several attempts at getting the principal to forego the commission failed, the complainant approached the ACB for help.

""After the complaint was registered, a bid to verify the same was initiated. When the demand was verified, it was decided to lay a trap and nab the man red-handed,' an official said. On Tuesday afternoon the ball was set rolling.

The complainant was handed over the commission money and sent to the principal's office. As soon as the money exchanged hands, the complainant gave a signal to the ACB sleuths who raided the school premises and nabbed the principal red-handed while he was collecting the money.

All are enrolled at the Presbyterian Secondary School in Bamenda, capital of Cameroon's Northwest Region -- one of two areas where surging anglophone separatist militancy has been met with a brutal crackdown by authorities.

Communications Minister Issa Bakary Tchiroma said ""all 79 students"" seized on Monday ""have been released,"" without giving details of the circumstances under which they were set free.

File image of Security forces in Cameroon. Reuters

The students were kidnapped with their principal, a teacher and a driver, but Tchiroma said their fate was not yet clear.

Separately, the Presbyterian Church, which runs the school, said that 11 other pupils were taken on 31 October but they have now been freed.

News of their disappearance had been withheld to enable negotiations with the kidnappers, the church said.

It said the school, located on the outskirts of Bamenda where there is a negligible presence by the security forces, would remain shuttered ""until further notice"".

On Tuesday, a leading member of the church, Reverend Foki Samuel Forba, said he had been negotiating with the kidnappers, who were not demanding a ransom but the closure of the school.

The kidnappings were the first such mass abductions seen in Cameroon and coincide with an upsurge of political tensions in the majority French-speaking country.

The release was announced a day after Cameroon's 85-year-old President Paul Biya was sworn in for a seventh term in office.

A six-minute video seen by AFP on Monday, but which could not be confirmed independently, showed 11 boys apparently aged about 15 giving their identity and name of the school in English, and adding that they were abducted by the ""Amba Boys"" -- a name for anglophone separatists.

Unprecedented in Cameroon

Such mass kidnappings were previously unknown in Cameroon, though they are notorious in neighbouring Nigeria.

The Islamist group Boko Haram snatched more than 200 schoolgirls from Nigeria's Borno state town of Chibok in April 2014, sparking worldwide condemnation and the #FreeOurGirls movement on Twitter.

Some 107 girls have since been released or found, but the Islamist group abducted scores more schoolgirls from the neighbouring Yobe state in February this year.

Cameroon's Biya on Tuesday promised to pursue policies of decentralisation to address ""frustrations and aspirations"" in English-speaking regions.

It was his first public acknowledgement of resentments that have spilled over in the country's anglophone Northwest and neighbouring Southwest Region.

In 2016, anger at perceived discrimination in education, the judiciary and the economy fanned demands for autonomy in the anglophone regions.

But Biya refused any concessions and a year later, radicals declared an independent state -- the ""Republic of Ambazonia"" -- taking up arms soon after.

Separatists have since attacked troops and police, boycotted and torched schools and attacked other state symbols, prompting a severe official crackdown.

At the start of the school year in September, several secondary schools were attacked, a headmaster was killed and a teacher was badly wounded.

At least 400 civilians and more than 175 members of the security forces have been killed in the year to September, according to a toll compiled by non-governmental organisations.

More than 300,000 others have fled the violence, some crossing into neighbouring Nigeria.

Around a fifth of Cameroon's 22 million people are English-speaking -- a minority whose presence dates back to the colonial period.

The orders were issued on Monday night after Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh received an inquiry report, which found the incident to be a case of ""gross negligence, indifference and insensitivity"" on the part of the teachers of the school, he said.

School headmaster Kuldeep Kaur and teacher Jyoti have been suspended on the directives of the chief minister, the spokesperson said. A charge sheet will also be issued under Rule 8 of the Conduct Rules against Kaur and Jyoti, who have been placed under suspension, he said.

The incident, which came to light last week, was brought to the chief minister's notice after a video showed students crying and complaining that they had been stripped by the teachers in the school premises. The teachers were reportedly trying to find out who was wearing a sanitary pad, after a soiled one was found in the school toilet.

The HC said the teachers were supposed to be the custodians and guardians of the minor girl but they committed the heinous crime.

A division bench of Justices Sambhaji Shinde and Ajay Gadkari said, ""In the present case though there is delay of about two months in lodging the FIR, considering the fact that the victim was minor girl at the relevant time the offence took place. The offence was committed by her teacher, who was supposed to be her custodian and guardian during school hours.""

""It also needs to be remembered that if such ghastly and heinous crime take place in the villages, it creates serious impact on the minds of the villagers and puts question marks on future of minor victim girls,"" the judges observed. The bench accordingly, upheld the conviction and 18-years rigorous imprisonment of professor - Datta Jadhav (43) and also the 16-years rigorous imprisonment of principal - Vanita Patil (56).

Both Jadhav and Patil were employees of a Zilla Parishad school in Raigad. They had petitioned the bench of Justice Shinde, challenging their conviction by a sessions court. According to the prosecution case, Jadhav had molested several minor girl students of his school by abusing his post as a professor. He had even raped a 12-year-old girl and had even clicked obscene photos of 13 minor girls of his school. These photographs were later recovered from Jadhav's cell phone.

As far as Patil is concerned, she was convicted by the sessions court for abetting the crime by pushing the minor girl inside a room, where Jadhav committed rape on the girl. It was learnt that Patil stood outside the room and ensured that no one enters the room until Jadhav comes out after raping the girl. She had even bolted the doors of the room.

To their defence, the convicted duo argued that no rape took place and they were falsely implicated and arrested under political pressure. They blamed the sarpanch of the survivor's village, who, the duo claimed had got the FIR registered against them.

Having considered the submissions, the bench trashed the argument saying, ""The victim was from a socio-economic backward village and it is a matter of common knowledge that such villagers had no courage to face such uncommon incidents, and so in such a situation they always try to take the help of known person in the village when they had to go to police station."""

It comes after elections on October 7 that saw President Paul Biya, 85, who has ruled the country with an iron fist for 35 years, secure a seventh term in office.

Biya was credited with 71.3 percent of the vote, although the ballot was marred by allegations of widespread fraud, low voter turnout and violence. He takes his oath of office on Tuesday.

Around a fifth of Cameroon's 22 million people are English-speaking - a minority whose presence dates back to the colonial period.

Cameroon, once a German colony, was divided between Britain and France after World War I.

But resentment at perceived discrimination at the hands of the francophone majority, especially in education and the judiciary, began to build.

In 2016, demands for greater autonomy grew but met with a rebuff by Biya.

As radicals took ascendancy, the anglophone movement declared the creation of the ""Republic of Ambazonia"" in the Northwest and neighbouring Southwest Region on October 1, 2017.

No country has recognised the self-declared state.

The separatists have gunned down troops and police, boycotted and torched schools and attacked other perceived symbols of the Cameroonian state.

The authorities have responded with a massive crackdown by police and troops.

Another former student Navin Chhetri, who is currently in Colorado, US, has also accused Harold of sexual harassment.

However, it is not for the first time that Harold has been accused of sexual harassment by his students. Carver was also sentenced to prison for one month 30 years ago for allegedly abusing half a dozen students. Navin Chhetri, who was one of the students had also appeared in the court. The complaint was later withdrawn.

The school management has refuted the allegations against Harold Carver saying that he is a ""man of intense integrity"" and accusations levelled against him are false, baseless and extremely hurtful.

Harold Carver has also termed the allegations as baseless.

""I have an unblemished record and cannot even imagine committing such an act. I sanguinely feel that the whole game is to malign the reputation of the school,"" Harold Carver said.

The reason is said to be a property dispute. Ironically, the victim, Ranganath Nayaka, had gone to the school to discuss the same issue with a local leader who offered to mediate.

The attack took place around 10 am in Havanur Public School in Agrahara Dasarahalli on Magadi Road. About five hours later, the police were able to trace the main attacker Muniraju alias Babli in Mahalakshmi Layout, where they were forced to open fire at him and nab him. The rest are absconding. The dispute pertains to a building owned by one Gangamma on a site adjacent to the school, which had encroached upon the school property. The encroaching part of the building was demolished by the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) two days ago based on a court order.

Ranganath Nayaka, a resident of Housing Board Colony near Rajajinagar, has retired as assistant manager at RBI. Nayaka owned the school, which he set up in 2003 after he retired. The family hails from Pavagada in Tumakuru district and had settled in the city. A police officer said the incident took place when Nayaka and the school's administrative staff were at a meeting with a local leader, Rajashekar, to resolve the same property dispute.

Lokesh Gowda, an employee, and Yathish, an assistant, rushed to Nayaka's rescue, but the duo too was attacked by the gang which then fled the scene. The attackers included Gangamma's two sons. Gowda and Yathish sustained stab injuries. Lokesh Gowda said, ""The gang stabbed Nayaka in his chest, thigh and stomach.""

Preliminary investigation has revealed that a portion of a residential building belonging to one Gangamma, located next to the school, had encroached upon the school property. Nayaka had approached the court over the encroachment as it was creating a problem for the school. The court had ordered demolition of the encroaching portion and BDA officials had demolished it with police protection two days ago.

Gangamma's sons Prasad and Mahesh had reportedly nurtured a grudge against Nayaka over the demolition and had allegedly planned to kill him.

Prasad along with his gang came and allegedly attacked Nayaka in his chamber, stabbing him to death.

Babli, who was among the first to attack, was arrested within five hours of the murder, while Prasad, Mahesh and three others are absconding. The police have formed a special team to nab them, a police officer said. ""We are yet to ascertain whether Babli and his gang had taken any 'supari' contract from Prasad to kill Nayaka,"" an investigation officer added.

Nayaka's elder brother Nagendraiah told The New Indian Express that Gangamma had passed away recently after which her two sons Prasad and Mahesh got into a dispute with Nayaka over the encroachment.

He said Rajashekhar, a local leader, who was also known to Prasad and Mahesh, had offered to mediate between the two parties to resolve the dispute.

However, the owner of the school, who identifies himself as a leader of Samajwadi Party's youth wing Yuvjan Sabha, is absconding.

The principal, Sanjeev Jha, an original resident of Sitamarhi district in Bihar, was arrested by Sector 49 police from near Arogyadhan Maharshi Ashram, Sector 107 on Tuesday.

While Amit Bhati, who identifies himself as the state secretary of Yuvjan Sabha, is the chairman and owner of KM Public School, his uncle Deshraj Bhati is the owner of the adjacent plot where an earthmover was levelling the land, resulting in the wall collapse.

The students were sitting near the wall in the open and writing an exam when the wall collapsed on them. While two students died, five others were injured.

So far, Sector 49 police has booked Amit Bhati, his uncle Deshraj Bhati, Deshraj's son Sumit Bhati, school manager Raghvendra Solanki, principal Sanjeev Jha and the unidentified driver of the earthmover.

Meanwhile, a visit to the spot indicates that Amit is well-known in the area. A board installed at the entry of the lane to his three-storey house reads: Amit Bhati, pradesh sachiv (state secretary), Samajwadi Party Yuvjan Sabha. He is also well-known as the owner of multiple properties in the village, most of which have been given on rent.

Since Monday morning, when the tragedy struck, Amit and his kin have gone missing while his house remains locked. ""They are not here. The family has gone missing since the incident,"" said a neighbour.

Asked whether Amit was active in the party's youth wing, Gajendra, a villager, told TOI that Amit was seen during different campaigns and activities of the party. ""You can see the board installed here right at the entry of the lane. The family belongs to the village and owns land here,"" he said, pointing to the board.

In the village, many don't want to talk about Amit and his family.

""We live in the building rented out by the family. They own many buildings here,"" said the aunt of one of the children who got injured in the wall collapse.

While the party has officially denied that Amit was a member, some leaders admitted that he had indeed been associated with the party's activities and had even participated in meetings of the Yuvajan Sabha in Noida prior to the disbanding of the youth outfit last year.

""He used to follow a cabinet minister from the state and was actively involved in the party prior to the feud between the Shivpal and Akhilesh factions,"" said a local leader.

Surendra Nagar, Rajya Sabha MP from the SP, told TOI that Amit does not hold even primary membership of the party. ""There are some people who tend to use the party's name. However, he is not even a primary member,"" he said.

According to villagers, the school had been running for the past years but its responsibility was handed over to Solanki and Jha on profit-sharing basis. The responsibility to manage the school was handed over to the duo after changing its name from Khajan memorial to KM Public School last year.

Meanwhile, the students who had been recuperating in two different hospitals are out of danger.

One of the children, Akash (9), who was seriously injured, underwent two surgeries at Yatharth hospital on Tuesday in his right leg and thigh and a rod has been inserted in his leg.

Akhilesh Kumar, father of seven-year-old Amit told TOI that the children -Amit, Naitik and Ashish -- are yet to recover from their injuries. SSP Ajay Pal Sharma told TOI that the teams are out to hunt for the other accused."

Several people from the village who shifted to Jodhpur city just to provide better education to their wards have returned to the village. Some private schools in the area have shut down due to shortage of students, say villagers. The Chopasni Government School is getting students from nearby villages, too, said block education officer Manohar Singh.

The school's transformation began in 2015 when an alumnus, Himmat Singh Ratnoo, became its principal. The school has recorded 100% results since then. The school has a projector room, computer labs, CCTV cameras, library and RO water facility.

""My first aim was to bring the children out of the inferiority complex of studying in a government school. Along with the villagers, I wrote a letter to ONGC and HPCL requesting help to construct two separate toilets for girls and boys as part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR). The school thus got two toilets that cost Rs 3.5 lakh each,"" said Ratnoo.

""Several girls who dropped out after a certain age due to lack of toilet facilities in school returned to study here,"" said Tima Ram Dhandhu, a villager.

""The next step was ensuring sufficient number of teachers. At present, there are 17 teachers in the school. I contacted several philanthropists and wrote letters to many others requesting financial assistance. The Rotary Club donated a projector and we raised over Rs 4 lakh to construct gated boundary walls and a prayer ground. Several others, including the village panchayat, contributed to construct classrooms in the school and install CCTV cameras,"" said Ratnoo.

""Having a school like this in a village like ours where the health facilities could not reach is an achievement. The entire village made it a vision to get better education facilities for our children. The panchayat collected money to make four new rooms in the school,"" said Gehlot.

Suresh Ratnoo, panchayat shayak, said he went door-to-door along with the teachers of the school explaining the developments in the school to the villages and motivating children, especially girls, to join the school. ""We told the people that the school has better education facilities and toilets. Now the number of girls and boys who study in the school is almost the same.

The high court has held that even the school administrator's failing to address the issue immediately amounts to abetting a crime listed under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. Justice Fateh Deep Singh's verdict, which upholds the Chandigarh district court's decision of asking the

school administrator to come and face charges under the Pocso Act, is meant to deter all those school managements that sit on child-abuse complaints.

Even though the district court had not summoned the principal, the high court ordered the local court to summon her as well. The verdict says that the summoning orders of August 5, 2017 (issued by an additional sessions judge who is also judge of the special court) appear to have missed this material point. For the sake of justice, the high court deems it ""essential to exercise the powers under Section 482 of the CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure) and direct the court where the matter is pending to ensure that even the principal, who had the knowledge of this incident..., is not let off.""

Dismissing the petition of the school administrator against his summoning to face prosecution, justice Singh observed that since the matter was brought to the notice of the school authorities, the administrator's duty was to ensure due redress, in matters concerning child abuse especially. The court observed: ""He (the school administrator) cannot hide behind the facade of lack of knowledge or information.""

So that matters like these are not brushed under the carpet and the purpose of the Pocso Act is met by all means, the high court has said that the district magistrate and the UT director of school education must fulfil their obligations under UN convention and Section 43 (public awareness of the law) of the Pocso Act."

The man had been troubling a milk contractor and asking for commission for clearning his bills. The aggrieved party used to supply milk under the Annapurna scheme for school children. The ACB has registered a case and is investigating the school principal.

According to ACB sleuths, the accused principal has been identified as one Gamer Lal, a resident of Udaipur, currently posted as principal of government primary school at Tekri near Udaipur.

""Recently the Udaipur wing of the ACB received a complaint against the Principal. In his grievance, the complainant - identified as Hira Lal, a resident of Agarwal Colony at Udaipur - claimed he used to supply milk for the children studying at the primary school at Tekri,"" ACB officials investigating the case said. This was being done under the Annapurna Scheme floated by the Vasundhara Raje government under which schoolkids are provided with free milk.

However, over the past several weeks he had stopped receiving his payments for the milk supplied to the school. When the contractor approached the principal to inquire about the non-payment of his bills, the school principal demanded Hira Lal pay him Rs 8,500 as commission, instead of making the payment.

""The accused also assured him that once the money is handed over, he would clear all his bills,"" officials said. When several attempts at getting the principal to forego the commission failed, the complainant approached the ACB for help.

""After the complaint was registered, a bid to verify the same was initiated. When the demand was verified, it was decided to lay a trap and nab the man red-handed,' an official said. On Tuesday afternoon the ball was set rolling.

The complainant was handed over the commission money and sent to the principal's office. As soon as the money exchanged hands, the complainant gave a signal to the ACB sleuths who raided the school premises and nabbed the principal red-handed while he was collecting the money. A case under Prevention of Corruption Act has been registered in the matter and further action is being taken, the official said."

All are enrolled at the Presbyterian Secondary School in Bamenda, capital of Cameroon's Northwest Region -- one of two areas where surging anglophone separatist militancy has been met with a brutal crackdown by authorities.

Communications Minister Issa Bakary Tchiroma said ""all 79 students"" seized on Monday ""have been released,"" without giving details of the circumstances under which they were set free.

The students were kidnapped with their principal, a teacher and a driver, but Tchiroma said their fate was not yet clear.

Separately, the Presbyterian Church, which runs the school, said that 11 other pupils were taken on 31 October but they have now been freed.

News of their disappearance had been withheld to enable negotiations with the kidnappers, the church said.

It said the school, located on the outskirts of Bamenda where there is a negligible presence by the security forces, would remain shuttered ""until further notice"".

On Tuesday, a leading member of the church, Reverend Foki Samuel Forba, said he had been negotiating with the kidnappers, who were not demanding a ransom but the closure of the school.

The kidnappings were the first such mass abductions seen in Cameroon and coincide with an upsurge of political tensions in the majority French-speaking country.

The release was announced a day after Cameroon's 85-year-old President Paul Biya was sworn in for a seventh term in office.

A six-minute video seen by AFP on Monday, but which could not be confirmed independently, showed 11 boys apparently aged about 15 giving their identity and name of the school in English, and adding that they were abducted by the ""Amba Boys"" -- a name for anglophone separatists.

Unprecedented in Cameroon

Such mass kidnappings were previously unknown in Cameroon, though they are notorious in neighbouring Nigeria.

The Islamist group Boko Haram snatched more than 200 schoolgirls from Nigeria's Borno state town of Chibok in April 2014, sparking worldwide condemnation and the #FreeOurGirls movement on Twitter.

Some 107 girls have since been released or found, but the Islamist group abducted scores more schoolgirls from the neighbouring Yobe state in February this year.

Cameroon's Biya on Tuesday promised to pursue policies of decentralisation to address ""frustrations and aspirations"" in English-speaking regions.

It was his first public acknowledgement of resentments that have spilled over in the country's anglophone Northwest and neighbouring Southwest Region.

In 2016, anger at perceived discrimination in education, the judiciary and the economy fanned demands for autonomy in the anglophone regions.

But Biya refused any concessions and a year later, radicals declared an independent state -- the ""Republic of Ambazonia"" -- taking up arms soon after.

Separatists have since attacked troops and police, boycotted and torched schools and attacked other state symbols, prompting a severe official crackdown.

At the start of the school year in September, several secondary schools were attacked, a headmaster was killed and a teacher was badly wounded.

At least 400 civilians and more than 175 members of the security forces have been killed in the year to September, according to a toll compiled by non-governmental organisations.

More than 300,000 others have fled the violence, some crossing into neighbouring Nigeria.

Around a fifth of Cameroon's 22 million people are English-speaking -- a minority whose presence dates back to the colonial period.

The orders were issued on Monday night after Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh received an inquiry report, which found the incident to be a case of ""gross negligence, indifference and insensitivity"" on the part of the teachers of the school, he said.

School headmaster Kuldeep Kaur and teacher Jyoti have been suspended on the directives of the chief minister, the spokesperson said. A charge sheet will also be issued under Rule 8 of the Conduct Rules against Kaur and Jyoti, who have been placed under suspension, he said.

The incident, which came to light last week, was brought to the chief minister's notice after a video showed students crying and complaining that they had been stripped by the teachers in the school premises. The teachers were reportedly trying to find out who was wearing a sanitary pad, after a soiled one was found in the school toilet.

The HC said the teachers were supposed to be the custodians and guardians of the minor girl but they committed the heinous crime.

A division bench of Justices Sambhaji Shinde and Ajay Gadkari said, ""In the present case though there is delay of about two months in lodging the FIR, considering the fact that the victim was minor girl at the relevant time the offence took place. The offence was committed by her teacher, who was supposed to be her custodian and guardian during school hours.""

""It also needs to be remembered that if such ghastly and heinous crime take place in the villages, it creates serious impact on the minds of the villagers and puts question marks on future of minor victim girls,"" the judges observed. The bench accordingly, upheld the conviction and 18-years rigorous imprisonment of professor - Datta Jadhav (43) and also the 16-years rigorous imprisonment of principal - Vanita Patil (56).

Both Jadhav and Patil were employees of a Zilla Parishad school in Raigad. They had petitioned the bench of Justice Shinde, challenging their conviction by a sessions court. According to the prosecution case, Jadhav had molested several minor girl students of his school by abusing his post as a professor. He had even raped a 12-year-old girl and had even clicked obscene photos of 13 minor girls of his school. These photographs were later recovered from Jadhav's cell phone.

As far as Patil is concerned, she was convicted by the sessions court for abetting the crime by pushing the minor girl inside a room, where Jadhav committed rape on the girl. It was learnt that Patil stood outside the room and ensured that no one enters the room until Jadhav comes out after raping the girl. She had even bolted the doors of the room.

To their defence, the convicted duo argued that no rape took place and they were falsely implicated and arrested under political pressure. They blamed the sarpanch of the survivor's village, who, the duo claimed had got the FIR registered against them.

Having considered the submissions, the bench trashed the argument saying, ""The victim was from a socio-economic backward village and it is a matter of common knowledge that such villagers had no courage to face such uncommon incidents, and so in such a situation they always try to take the help of known person in the village when they had to go to police station."""

In the video, the kidnappers were seeing forcing several students to reveal their names and the names of their parents. The children say they were kidnapped late on Sunday but they don't know where they are being held.

It comes after elections on October 7 that saw President Paul Biya, 85, who has ruled the country with an iron fist for 35 years, secure a seventh term in office.

Biya was credited with 71.3 percent of the vote, although the ballot was marred by allegations of widespread fraud, low voter turnout and violence. He takes his oath of office on Tuesday.

Around a fifth of Cameroon's 22 million people are English-speaking - a minority whose presence dates back to the colonial period.

Cameroon, once a German colony, was divided between Britain and France after World War I.

The French colony gained independence in 1960, becoming Cameroon. The following year, the British-ruled Southern Cameroons was amalgamated into it, giving rise to the Northwest and Southwest regions.

But resentment at perceived discrimination at the hands of the francophone majority, especially in education and the judiciary, began to build.

In 2016, demands for greater autonomy grew but met with a rebuff by Biya.

As radicals took ascendancy, the anglophone movement declared the creation of the ""Republic of Ambazonia"" in the Northwest and neighbouring Southwest Region on October 1, 2017.

No country has recognised the self-declared state.

The separatists have gunned down troops and police, boycotted and torched schools and attacked other perceived symbols of the Cameroonian state.

The authorities have responded with a massive crackdown by police and troops.

At least 400 civilians have been killed this year as well as more than 175 members of the security forces, according to a toll compiled by non-governmental organisations.

Manraj, a student of the 1980 batch, has called Carver a sexual predator on his Facebook page. He said that he and his hostel mates were aware of the principal's activities. He mentioned that he was a Class 7 student when the accused called him to his office and initiated an uncomfortable conversation with him.

The reason is said to be a property dispute. Ironically, the victim, Ranganath Nayaka, had gone to the school to discuss the same issue with a local leader who offered to mediate.

The attack took place around 10 am in Havanur Public School in Agrahara Dasarahalli on Magadi Road. About five hours later, the police were able to trace the main attacker Muniraju alias Babli in Mahalakshmi Layout, where they were forced to open fire at him and nab him. The rest are absconding. The dispute pertains to a building owned by one Gangamma on a site adjacent to the school, which had encroached upon the school property. The encroaching part of the building was demolished by the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) two days ago based on a court order.

Ranganath Nayaka, a resident of Housing Board Colony near Rajajinagar, has retired as assistant manager at RBI. Nayaka owned the school, which he set up in 2003 after he retired. The family hails from Pavagada in Tumakuru district and had settled in the city. A police officer said the incident took place when Nayaka and the school's administrative staff were at a meeting with a local leader, Rajashekar, to resolve the same property dispute.

Gowda and Yathish sustained stab injuries. Lokesh Gowda said, ""The gang stabbed Nayaka in his chest, thigh and stomach.""

Preliminary investigation has revealed that a portion of a residential building belonging to one Gangamma, located next to the school, had encroached upon the school property. Nayaka had approached the court over the encroachment as it was creating a problem for the school. The court had ordered demolition of the encroaching portion and BDA officials had demolished it with police protection two days ago.

Gangamma's sons Prasad and Mahesh had reportedly nurtured a grudge against Nayaka over the demolition and had allegedly planned to kill him.

Prasad along with his gang came and allegedly attacked Nayaka in his chamber, stabbing him to death.

Babli, who was among the first to attack, was arrested within five hours of the murder, while Prasad, Mahesh and three others are absconding. The police have formed a special team to nab them, a police officer said. ""We are yet to ascertain whether Babli and his gang had taken any 'supari' contract from Prasad to kill Nayaka,"" an investigation officer added.

Nayaka's elder brother Nagendraiah told The New Indian Express that Gangamma had passed away recently after which her two sons Prasad and Mahesh got into a dispute with Nayaka over the encroachment.

He said Rajashekhar, a local leader, who was also known to Prasad and Mahesh, had offered to mediate between the two parties to resolve the dispute.

KM Public School's principal was arrested on Tuesday, a day after a wall collapsed there, killing two children and injuring five. The incident took place in Noida's Salarpur when a construction vehicle moving piles of sand next to the school boundary weakened the structure, ostensibly leading to the collapse. Students of Class 1 and 2 were taking an examination next to the wall.

""School principal Sanjeev Kumar was arrested from his residence in Sector 107. We have started questioning the accused for any lapses on part of the school. So far, he has not said anything about the legalities of the institution. We will question him about where those who run the school, including the owner, are,"" SHO (Sector 49) Girija Shankar Tripathi said.

District Magistrate (Gautam Budh Nagar) B N Singh said, ""We are awaiting reports of the magisterial enquiry, which will throw light on many aspects, including construction details and school certification.

However, the owner of the school, who identifies himself as a leader of Samajwadi Party's youth wing Yuvjan Sabha, is absconding.

The principal, Sanjeev Jha, an original resident of Sitamarhi district in Bihar, was arrested by Sector 49 police from near Arogyadhan Maharshi Ashram, Sector 107 on Tuesday.

While Amit Bhati, who identifies himself as the state secretary of Yuvjan Sabha, is the chairman and owner of KM Public School, his uncle Deshraj Bhati is the owner of the adjacent plot where an earthmover was levelling the land, resulting in the wall collapse.

The students were sitting near the wall in the open and writing an exam when the wall collapsed on them. While two students died, five others were injured.

So far, Sector 49 police has booked Amit Bhati, his uncle Deshraj Bhati, Deshraj's son Sumit Bhati, school manager Raghvendra Solanki, principal Sanjeev Jha and the unidentified driver of the earthmover.

Meanwhile, a visit to the spot indicates that Amit is well-known in the area. A board installed at the entry of the lane to his three-storey house reads: Amit Bhati, pradesh sachiv (state secretary), Samajwadi Party Yuvjan Sabha. He is also well-known as the owner of multiple properties in the village, most of which have been given on rent.

Since Monday morning, when the tragedy struck, Amit and his kin have gone missing while his house remains locked. ""They are not here. The family has gone missing since the incident,"" said a neighbour.

Asked whether Amit was active in the party's youth wing, Gajendra, a villager, told TOI that Amit was seen during different campaigns and activities of the party. ""You can see the board installed here right at the entry of the lane. The family belongs to the village and owns land here,"" he said, pointing to the board.

In the village, many don't want to talk about Amit and his family.

""We live in the building rented out by the family. They own many buildings here,"" said the aunt of one of the children who got injured in the wall collapse.

While the party has officially denied that Amit was a member, some leaders admitted that he had indeed been associated with the party's activities and had even participated in meetings of the Yuvajan Sabha in Noida prior to the disbanding of the youth outfit last year.

""He used to follow a cabinet minister from the state and was actively involved in the party prior to the feud between the Shivpal and Akhilesh factions,"" said a local leader.

Surendra Nagar, Rajya Sabha MP from the SP, told TOI that Amit does not hold even primary membership of the party. ""There are some people who tend to use the party's name. However, he is not even a primary member,"" he said.

According to villagers, the school had been running for the past years but its responsibility was handed over to Solanki and Jha on profit-sharing basis. The responsibility to manage the school was handed over to the duo after changing its name from Khajan memorial to KM Public School last year.

Meanwhile, the students who had been recuperating in two different hospitals are out of danger.

One of the children, Akash (9), who was seriously injured, underwent two surgeries at Yatharth hospital on Tuesday in his right leg and thigh and a rod has been inserted in his leg.

Akhilesh Kumar, father of seven-year-old Amit told TOI that the children -Amit, Naitik and Ashish -- are yet to recover from their injuries. SSP Ajay Pal Sharma told TOI that the teams are out to hunt for the other accused."

While Mr. Bhati had been running the school for the past five years, he had given the responsibility to manage the school to the principal and manager on profit basis.

The wall collapse on Monday had prompted Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to order a magisterial-level inquiry.

The government school in her home town, Chopasni village, can now give competition to city schools after it was upgraded with help from donors. Chanchal and her elder sister Pratibha study in the village school now.

Several people from the village who shifted to Jodhpur city just to provide better education to their wards have returned to the village. Some private schools in the area have shut down due to shortage of students, say villagers. The Chopasni Government School is getting students from nearby villages, too, said block education officer Manohar Singh.

The school's transformation began in 2015 when an alumnus, Himmat Singh Ratnoo, became its principal. The school has recorded 100% results since then. The school has a projector room, computer labs, CCTV cameras, library and RO water facility.

""My first aim was to bring the children out of the inferiority complex of studying in a government school. Along with the villagers, I wrote a letter to ONGC and HPCL requesting help to construct two separate toilets for girls and boys as part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR). The school thus got two toilets that cost Rs 3.5 lakh each,"" said Ratnoo.

""Several girls who dropped out after a certain age due to lack of toilet facilities in school returned to study here,"" said Tima Ram Dhandhu, a villager.

""The next step was ensuring sufficient number of teachers. At present, there are 17 teachers in the school. I contacted several philanthropists and wrote letters to many others requesting financial assistance. The Rotary Club donated a projector and we raised over Rs 4 lakh to construct gated boundary walls and a prayer ground. Several others, including the village panchayat, contributed to construct classrooms in the school and install CCTV cameras,"" said Ratnoo.

Jay Narayan Gehlot, sarpanch of Chopasni village, said that the entire village made it a vision to give a good school to the children of the village. ""Having a school like this in a village like ours where the health facilities could not reach is an achievement. The entire village made it a vision to get better education facilities for our children. The panchayat collected money to make four new rooms in the school,"" said Gehlot.

Suresh Ratnoo, panchayat shayak, said he went door-to-door along with the teachers of the school explaining the developments in the school to the villages and motivating children, especially girls, to join the school. ""We told the people that the school has better education facilities and toilets. Now the number of girls and boys who study in the school is almost the same. From a single village we managed to bring 50-60 new students to join the school, ""said Suresh.

Justice Fateh Deep Singh's verdict, which upholds the Chandigarh district court's decision of asking the

school administrator to come and face charges under the Pocso Act, is meant to deter all those school managements that sit on child-abuse complaints.

""After the complaint was registered, a bid to verify the same was initiated. When the demand was verified, it was decided to lay a trap and nab the man red-handed,' an official said. On Tuesday afternoon the ball was set rolling.

The complainant was handed over the commission money and sent to the principal's office. As soon as the money exchanged hands, the complainant gave a signal to the ACB sleuths who raided the school premises and nabbed the principal red-handed while he was collecting the money. A case under Prevention of Corruption Act has been registered in the matter and further action is being taken, the official said."

All are enrolled at the Presbyterian Secondary School in Bamenda, capital of Cameroon's Northwest Region -- one of two areas where surging anglophone separatist militancy has been met with a brutal crackdown by authorities.

Communications Minister Issa Bakary Tchiroma said ""all 79 students"" seized on Monday ""have been released,"" without giving details of the circumstances under which they were set free.

The students were kidnapped with their principal, a teacher and a driver, but Tchiroma said their fate was not yet clear.

Separately, the Presbyterian Church, which runs the school, said that 11 other pupils were taken on 31 October but they have now been freed.

News of their disappearance had been withheld to enable negotiations with the kidnappers, the church said.

It said the school, located on the outskirts of Bamenda where there is a negligible presence by the security forces, would remain shuttered ""until further notice"".

On Tuesday, a leading member of the church, Reverend Foki Samuel Forba, said he had been negotiating with the kidnappers, who were not demanding a ransom but the closure of the school.

The kidnappings were the first such mass abductions seen in Cameroon and coincide with an upsurge of political tensions in the majority French-speaking country.

The release was announced a day after Cameroon's 85-year-old President Paul Biya was sworn in for a seventh term in office.

A six-minute video seen by AFP on Monday, but which could not be confirmed independently, showed 11 boys apparently aged about 15 giving their identity and name of the school in English, and adding that they were abducted by the ""Amba Boys"" -- a name for anglophone separatists.

Unprecedented in Cameroon

Such mass kidnappings were previously unknown in Cameroon, though they are notorious in neighbouring Nigeria.

The Islamist group Boko Haram snatched more than 200 schoolgirls from Nigeria's Borno state town of Chibok in April 2014, sparking worldwide condemnation and the #FreeOurGirls movement on Twitter.

Some 107 girls have since been released or found, but the Islamist group abducted scores more schoolgirls from the neighbouring Yobe state in February this year.

Cameroon's Biya on Tuesday promised to pursue policies of decentralisation to address ""frustrations and aspirations"" in English-speaking regions.

It was his first public acknowledgement of resentments that have spilled over in the country's anglophone Northwest and neighbouring Southwest Region.

In 2016, anger at perceived discrimination in education, the judiciary and the economy fanned demands for autonomy in the anglophone regions.

But Biya refused any concessions and a year later, radicals declared an independent state -- the ""Republic of Ambazonia"" -- taking up arms soon after.

Separatists have since attacked troops and police, boycotted and torched schools and attacked other state symbols, prompting a severe official crackdown.

At the start of the school year in September, several secondary schools were attacked, a headmaster was killed and a teacher was badly wounded.

At least 400 civilians and more than 175 members of the security forces have been killed in the year to September, according to a toll compiled by non-governmental organisations.

More than 300,000 others have fled the violence, some crossing into neighbouring Nigeria.

Around a fifth of Cameroon's 22 million people are English-speaking -- a minority whose presence dates back to the colonial period.

The orders were issued on Monday night after Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh received an inquiry report, which found the incident to be a case of ""gross negligence, indifference and insensitivity"" on the part of the teachers of the school, he said.

School headmaster Kuldeep Kaur and teacher Jyoti have been suspended on the directives of the chief minister, the spokesperson said. A charge sheet will also be issued under Rule 8 of the Conduct Rules against Kaur and Jyoti, who have been placed under suspension, he said.

The incident, which came to light last week, was brought to the chief minister's notice after a video showed students crying and complaining that they had been stripped by the teachers in the school premises. The teachers were reportedly trying to find out who was wearing a sanitary pad, after a soiled one was found in the school toilet.

The chief minister has issued strict instructions to show no laxity in the matter as the respect and dignity of the students could not be allowed to be compromised at any cost.

The HC said the teachers were supposed to be the custodians and guardians of the minor girl but they committed the heinous crime.

A division bench of Justices Sambhaji Shinde and Ajay Gadkari said, ""In the present case though there is delay of about two months in lodging the FIR, considering the fact that the victim was minor girl at the relevant time the offence took place. The offence was committed by her teacher, who was supposed to be her custodian and guardian during school hours.""

""It also needs to be remembered that if such ghastly and heinous crime take place in the villages, it creates serious impact on the minds of the villagers and puts question marks on future of minor victim girls,"" the judges observed. The bench accordingly, upheld the conviction and 18-years rigorous imprisonment of professor - Datta Jadhav (43) and also the 16-years rigorous imprisonment of principal - Vanita Patil (56).

Both Jadhav and Patil were employees of a Zilla Parishad school in Raigad. They had petitioned the bench of Justice Shinde, challenging their conviction by a sessions court. According to the prosecution case, Jadhav had molested several minor girl students of his school by abusing his post as a professor. He had even raped a 12-year-old girl and had even clicked obscene photos of 13 minor girls of his school. These photographs were later recovered from Jadhav's cell phone.

As far as Patil is concerned, she was convicted by the sessions court for abetting the crime by pushing the minor girl inside a room, where Jadhav committed rape on the girl. It was learnt that Patil stood outside the room and ensured that no one enters the room until Jadhav comes out after raping the girl. She had even bolted the doors of the room.

To their defence, the convicted duo argued that no rape took place and they were falsely implicated and arrested under political pressure. They blamed the sarpanch of the survivor's village, who, the duo claimed had got the FIR registered against them.

Having considered the submissions, the bench trashed the argument saying, ""The victim was from a socio-economic backward village and it is a matter of common knowledge that such villagers had no courage to face such uncommon incidents, and so in such a situation they always try to take the help of known person in the village when they had to go to police station."""

The kidnapper, who call themselves Amba boys, have also released a video on social media.

In the video, the kidnappers were seeing forcing several students to reveal their names and the names of their parents. The children say they were kidnapped late on Sunday but they don't know where they are being held.

The men who identify themselves as the kidnappers say they will only release the children when they achieve what they want.

While the video could not be independently verified, parents have been reacting on social media saying they recognise their children in the video.

It comes after elections on October 7 that saw President Paul Biya, 85, who has ruled the country with an iron fist for 35 years, secure a seventh term in office.

Biya was credited with 71.3 percent of the vote, although the ballot was marred by allegations of widespread fraud, low voter turnout and violence. He takes his oath of office on Tuesday.

Around a fifth of Cameroon's 22 million people are English-speaking - a minority whose presence dates back to the colonial period.

Cameroon, once a German colony, was divided between Britain and France after World War I.

The French colony gained independence in 1960, becoming Cameroon. The following year, the British-ruled Southern Cameroons was amalgamated into it, giving rise to the Northwest and Southwest regions.

But resentment at perceived discrimination at the hands of the francophone majority, especially in education and the judiciary, began to build.

In 2016, demands for greater autonomy grew but met with a rebuff by Biya.

As radicals took ascendancy, the anglophone movement declared the creation of the ""Republic of Ambazonia"" in the Northwest and neighbouring Southwest Region on October 1, 2017.

No country has recognised the self-declared state.

The separatists have gunned down troops and police, boycotted and torched schools and attacked other perceived symbols of the Cameroonian state.

The authorities have responded with a massive crackdown by police and troops.

At least 400 civilians have been killed this year as well as more than 175 members of the security forces, according to a toll compiled by non-governmental organisations.

According to UN figures, 246,000 people in the Southwest Region have fled their homes, and 25,000 have sought shelter in neighbouring Nigeria, many of them living hand-to-mouth in the forests."

Responding to the allegation by the opposition leader, principal of Anandaram Dhekial Phookan (ADP) College Dr Surajit Kumar Bhagowati on Friday said he did not ban any religious outfit and only issued a notice before the Autumn vacation asking students to wear ""proper uniform"".

Three former students of a Catholic school in Chandigarh have levelled sexual harassment charges against the former principal and co-founding director of the school on social media.

Harold Carver, who is the principal of the school has been accused of sexual harassment by Manraj Singh.

Manraj, a student of the 1980 batch, has called Carver a sexual predator on his Facebook page. He said that he and his hostel mates were aware of the principal's activities. He mentioned that he was a Class 7 student when the accused called him to his office and initiated an uncomfortable conversation with him.

Earlier, a 42-year-old Delhi based journalist Sanjay Austa had accused Harold Carver of sexually harassing him and his hostel mates when he was a student in the school. Austa had said in his blog that he was a Class 9 student when Carver abused him in his office.

""Harold Carver is a sexual predator whose choice was children. Ever since I learnt that Harold Carver was back in Chandigarh, I started getting worried.

Carver was also sentenced to prison for one month 30 years ago for allegedly abusing half a dozen students. Navin Chhetri, who was one of the students had also appeared in the court. The complaint was later withdrawn.

The school management has refuted the allegations against Harold Carver saying that he is a ""man of intense integrity"" and accusations levelled against him are false, baseless and extremely hurtful.

Harold Carver has also termed the allegations as baseless.

""I have an unblemished record and cannot even imagine committing such an act. I sanguinely feel that the whole game is to malign the reputation of the school,"" Harold Carver said.

The reason is said to be a property dispute. Ironically, the victim, Ranganath Nayaka, had gone to the school to discuss the same issue with a local leader who offered to mediate.

The attack took place around 10 am in Havanur Public School in Agrahara Dasarahalli on Magadi Road. About five hours later, the police were able to trace the main attacker Muniraju alias Babli in Mahalakshmi Layout, where they were forced to open fire at him and nab him. The rest are absconding. The dispute pertains to a building owned by one Gangamma on a site adjacent to the school, which had encroached upon the school property. The encroaching part of the building was demolished by the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) two days ago based on a court order.

Ranganath Nayaka, a resident of Housing Board Colony near Rajajinagar, has retired as assistant manager at RBI. Nayaka owned the school, which he set up in 2003 after he retired. The family hails from Pavagada in Tumakuru district and had settled in the city. A police officer said the incident took place when Nayaka and the school's administrative staff were at a meeting with a local leader, Rajashekar, to resolve the same property dispute.

Lokesh Gowda, an employee, and Yathish, an assistant, rushed to Nayaka's rescue, but the duo too was attacked by the gang which then fled the scene. The attackers included Gangamma's two sons. Gowda and Yathish sustained stab injuries. Lokesh Gowda said, ""The gang stabbed Nayaka in his chest, thigh and stomach.""

Preliminary investigation has revealed that a portion of a residential building belonging to one Gangamma, located next to the school, had encroached upon the school property. Nayaka had approached the court over the encroachment as it was creating a problem for the school. The court had ordered demolition of the encroaching portion and BDA officials had demolished it with police protection two days ago.

Gangamma's sons Prasad and Mahesh had reportedly nurtured a grudge against Nayaka over the demolition and had allegedly planned to kill him.

Prasad along with his gang came and allegedly attacked Nayaka in his chamber, stabbing him to death.

Babli, who was among the first to attack, was arrested within five hours of the murder, while Prasad, Mahesh and three others are absconding. The police have formed a special team to nab them, a police officer said. ""We are yet to ascertain whether Babli and his gang had taken any 'supari' contract from Prasad to kill Nayaka,"" an investigation officer added.

Nayaka's elder brother Nagendraiah told The New Indian Express that Gangamma had passed away recently after which her two sons Prasad and Mahesh got into a dispute with Nayaka over the encroachment.

He said Rajashekhar, a local leader, who was also known to Prasad and Mahesh, had offered to mediate between the two parties to resolve the dispute. ""My brother was being called to the school since two days. But he could not go as he had undergone an eye surgery a week ago.

However, the owner of the school, who identifies himself as a leader of Samajwadi Party's youth wing Yuvjan Sabha, is absconding.

The principal, Sanjeev Jha, an original resident of Sitamarhi district in Bihar, was arrested by Sector 49 police from near Arogyadhan Maharshi Ashram, Sector 107 on Tuesday.

While Amit Bhati, who identifies himself as the state secretary of Yuvjan Sabha, is the chairman and owner of KM Public School, his uncle Deshraj Bhati is the owner of the adjacent plot where an earthmover was levelling the land, resulting in the wall collapse.

The students were sitting near the wall in the open and writing an exam when the wall collapsed on them. While two students died, five others were injured.

So far, Sector 49 police has booked Amit Bhati, his uncle Deshraj Bhati, Deshraj's son Sumit Bhati, school manager Raghvendra Solanki, principal Sanjeev Jha and the unidentified driver of the earthmover.

Meanwhile, a visit to the spot indicates that Amit is well-known in the area. A board installed at the entry of the lane to his three-storey house reads: Amit Bhati, pradesh sachiv (state secretary), Samajwadi Party Yuvjan Sabha. He is also well-known as the owner of multiple properties in the village, most of which have been given on rent.

Since Monday morning, when the tragedy struck, Amit and his kin have gone missing while his house remains locked. ""They are not here. The family has gone missing since the incident,"" said a neighbour.

Asked whether Amit was active in the party's youth wing, Gajendra, a villager, told TOI that Amit was seen during different campaigns and activities of the party. ""You can see the board installed here right at the entry of the lane. The family belongs to the village and owns land here,"" he said, pointing to the board.

In the village, many don't want to talk about Amit and his family.

""We live in the building rented out by the family. They own many buildings here,"" said the aunt of one of the children who got injured in the wall collapse.

While the party has officially denied that Amit was a member, some leaders admitted that he had indeed been associated with the party's activities and had even participated in meetings of the Yuvajan Sabha in Noida prior to the disbanding of the youth outfit last year.

""He used to follow a cabinet minister from the state and was actively involved in the party prior to the feud between the Shivpal and Akhilesh factions,"" said a local leader.

According to villagers, the school had been running for the past years but its responsibility was handed over to Solanki and Jha on profit-sharing basis. The responsibility to manage the school was handed over to the duo after changing its name from Khajan memorial to KM Public School last year.

Meanwhile, the students who had been recuperating in two different hospitals are out of danger.

The government school in her home town, Chopasni village, can now give competition to city schools after it was upgraded with help from donors. Chanchal and her elder sister Pratibha study in the village school now.

Several people from the village who shifted to Jodhpur city just to provide better education to their wards have returned to the village. Some private schools in the area have shut down due to shortage of students, say villagers. The Chopasni Government School is getting students from nearby villages, too, said block education officer Manohar Singh.

The school's transformation began in 2015 when an alumnus, Himmat Singh Ratnoo, became its principal. The school has recorded 100% results since then. The school has a projector room, computer labs, CCTV cameras, library and RO water facility.

""My first aim was to bring the children out of the inferiority complex of studying in a government school. Along with the villagers, I wrote a letter to ONGC and HPCL requesting help to construct two separate toilets for girls and boys as part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR). The school thus got two toilets that cost Rs 3.5 lakh each,"" said Ratnoo.

""Several girls who dropped out after a certain age due to lack of toilet facilities in school returned to study here,"" said Tima Ram Dhandhu, a villager.

""The next step was ensuring sufficient number of teachers. At present, there are 17 teachers in the school. I contacted several philanthropists and wrote letters to many others requesting financial assistance. The Rotary Club donated a projector and we raised over Rs 4 lakh to construct gated boundary walls and a prayer ground. Several others, including the village panchayat, contributed to construct classrooms in the school and install CCTV cameras,"" said Ratnoo.

Jay Narayan Gehlot, sarpanch of Chopasni village, said that the entire village made it a vision to give a good school to the children of the village. ""Having a school like this in a village like ours where the health facilities could not reach is an achievement. The entire village made it a vision to get better education facilities for our children. The panchayat collected money to make four new rooms in the school,"" said Gehlot.

Suresh Ratnoo, panchayat shayak, said he went door-to-door along with the teachers of the school explaining the developments in the school to the villages and motivating children, especially girls, to join the school. ""We told the people that the school has better education facilities and toilets. Now the number of girls and boys who study in the school is almost the same. From a single village we managed to bring 50-60 new students to join the school, ""said Suresh.

Sarla Ratnoo, a student of class 12, said: ""I can dream big now as I can continue with my education. Had the school been far away or without facilities, it would not have been possible.""

The school has a strength of more than 350 students and provides Identity cards and uniforms. ""CCTV cameras have been installed in the classes. The teachers and I keep watch over every activity in the school. We keep organising sports and other extra-curricular activities from time to time to give boost students' exposure,"" said the proud principal."

Justice Fateh Deep Singh's verdict, which upholds the Chandigarh district court's decision of asking the

school administrator to come and face charges under the Pocso Act, is meant to deter all those school managements that sit on child-abuse complaints.

The ACB has registered a case and is investigating the school principal.

According to ACB sleuths, the accused principal has been identified as one Gamer Lal, a resident of Udaipur, currently posted as principal of government primary school at Tekri near Udaipur.

""Recently the Udaipur wing of the ACB received a complaint against the Principal. In his grievance, the complainant - identified as Hira Lal, a resident of Agarwal Colony at Udaipur - claimed he used to supply milk for the children studying at the primary school at Tekri,"" ACB officials investigating the case said.

All are enrolled at the Presbyterian Secondary School in Bamenda, capital of Cameroon's Northwest Region -- one of two areas where surging anglophone separatist militancy has been met with a brutal crackdown by authorities.

Communications Minister Issa Bakary Tchiroma said ""all 79 students"" seized on Monday ""have been released,"" without giving details of the circumstances under which they were set free.

File image of Security forces in Cameroon. Reuters

The students were kidnapped with their principal, a teacher and a driver, but Tchiroma said their fate was not yet clear.

Separately, the Presbyterian Church, which runs the school, said that 11 other pupils were taken on 31 October but they have now been freed.

News of their disappearance had been withheld to enable negotiations with the kidnappers, the church said.

It said the school, located on the outskirts of Bamenda where there is a negligible presence by the security forces, would remain shuttered ""until further notice"".

On Tuesday, a leading member of the church, Reverend Foki Samuel Forba, said he had been negotiating with the kidnappers, who were not demanding a ransom but the closure of the school.

The kidnappings were the first such mass abductions seen in Cameroon and coincide with an upsurge of political tensions in the majority French-speaking country.

The release was announced a day after Cameroon's 85-year-old President Paul Biya was sworn in for a seventh term in office.

A six-minute video seen by AFP on Monday, but which could not be confirmed independently, showed 11 boys apparently aged about 15 giving their identity and name of the school in English, and adding that they were abducted by the ""Amba Boys"" -- a name for anglophone separatists.

Unprecedented in Cameroon

Such mass kidnappings were previously unknown in Cameroon, though they are notorious in neighbouring Nigeria.

The Islamist group Boko Haram snatched more than 200 schoolgirls from Nigeria's Borno state town of Chibok in April 2014, sparking worldwide condemnation and the #FreeOurGirls movement on Twitter.

Some 107 girls have since been released or found, but the Islamist group abducted scores more schoolgirls from the neighbouring Yobe state in February this year.

Cameroon's Biya on Tuesday promised to pursue policies of decentralisation to address ""frustrations and aspirations"" in English-speaking regions.

It was his first public acknowledgement of resentments that have spilled over in the country's anglophone Northwest and neighbouring Southwest Region.

In 2016, anger at perceived discrimination in education, the judiciary and the economy fanned demands for autonomy in the anglophone regions.

But Biya refused any concessions and a year later, radicals declared an independent state -- the ""Republic of Ambazonia"" -- taking up arms soon after.

Separatists have since attacked troops and police, boycotted and torched schools and attacked other state symbols, prompting a severe official crackdown.

At the start of the school year in September, several secondary schools were attacked, a headmaster was killed and a teacher was badly wounded.

At least 400 civilians and more than 175 members of the security forces have been killed in the year to September, according to a toll compiled by non-governmental organisations.

More than 300,000 others have fled the violence, some crossing into neighbouring Nigeria.

Around a fifth of Cameroon's 22 million people are English-speaking -- a minority whose presence dates back to the colonial period.

School headmaster Kuldeep Kaur and teacher Jyoti have been suspended on the directives of the chief minister, the spokesperson said. A charge sheet will also be issued under Rule 8 of the Conduct Rules against Kaur and Jyoti, who have been placed under suspension, he said.

The incident, which came to light last week, was brought to the chief minister's notice after a video showed students crying and complaining that they had been stripped by the teachers in the school premises. The teachers were reportedly trying to find out who was wearing a sanitary pad, after a soiled one was found in the school toilet.

The chief minister has issued strict instructions to show no laxity in the matter as the respect and dignity of the students could not be allowed to be compromised at any cost. Singh has reiterated his government's commitment to providing a favourable environment for education and empowerment of girls.

The chief minister had on Friday ordered a probe into the allegations of stripping made by some of the students and their parents. The chief minister had also directed Secretary Education Krishan Kumar to complete the investigation by Monday and take further action if necessary.

The inquiry report said the students were checked twice on the directions and with full knowledge of the school principal and the teacher. The girls were checked with their clothes on the first time and then the two women got them checked again by senior girl students of class 8 with their clothes taken off, as per the SDM Abohar, at whose office the statements of Kuldeep and Jyoti were recorded on Monday.

The HC said the teachers were supposed to be the custodians and guardians of the minor girl but they committed the heinous crime.

A division bench of Justices Sambhaji Shinde and Ajay Gadkari said, ""In the present case though there is delay of about two months in lodging the FIR, considering the fact that the victim was minor girl at the relevant time the offence took place. The offence was committed by her teacher, who was supposed to be her custodian and guardian during school hours.""

""It also needs to be remembered that if such ghastly and heinous crime take place in the villages, it creates serious impact on the minds of the villagers and puts question marks on future of minor victim girls,"" the judges observed. The bench accordingly, upheld the conviction and 18-years rigorous imprisonment of professor - Datta Jadhav (43) and also the 16-years rigorous imprisonment of principal - Vanita Patil (56).

Both Jadhav and Patil were employees of a Zilla Parishad school in Raigad. They had petitioned the bench of Justice Shinde, challenging their conviction by a sessions court. According to the prosecution case, Jadhav had molested several minor girl students of his school by abusing his post as a professor. He had even raped a 12-year-old girl and had even clicked obscene photos of 13 minor girls of his school. These photographs were later recovered from Jadhav's cell phone.

As far as Patil is concerned, she was convicted by the sessions court for abetting the crime by pushing the minor girl inside a room, where Jadhav committed rape on the girl. It was learnt that Patil stood outside the room and ensured that no one enters the room until Jadhav comes out after raping the girl. She had even bolted the doors of the room.

To their defence, the convicted duo argued that no rape took place and they were falsely implicated and arrested under political pressure. They blamed the sarpanch of the survivor's village, who, the duo claimed had got the FIR registered against them.

Having considered the submissions, the bench trashed the argument saying, ""The victim was from a socio-economic backward village and it is a matter of common knowledge that such villagers had no courage to face such uncommon incidents, and so in such a situation they always try to take the help of known person in the village when they had to go to police station."""

According to Governor Deben Tchoffo, the kidnapping took place near Bamenda, the capital of the troubled English-speaking region late on Sunday.

The kidnapper, who call themselves Amba boys, have also released a video on social media.

In the video, the kidnappers were seeing forcing several students to reveal their names and the names of their parents. The children say they were kidnapped late on Sunday but they don't know where they are being held.

The men who identify themselves as the kidnappers say they will only release the children when they achieve what they want.

While the video could not be independently verified, parents have been reacting on social media saying they recognise their children in the video.

It comes after elections on October 7 that saw President Paul Biya, 85, who has ruled the country with an iron fist for 35 years, secure a seventh term in office.

Biya was credited with 71.3 percent of the vote, although the ballot was marred by allegations of widespread fraud, low voter turnout and violence. He takes his oath of office on Tuesday.

Around a fifth of Cameroon's 22 million people are English-speaking - a minority whose presence dates back to the colonial period.

Cameroon, once a German colony, was divided between Britain and France after World War I.

The French colony gained independence in 1960, becoming Cameroon. The following year, the British-ruled Southern Cameroons was amalgamated into it, giving rise to the Northwest and Southwest regions.

But resentment at perceived discrimination at the hands of the francophone majority, especially in education and the judiciary, began to build.

In 2016, demands for greater autonomy grew but met with a rebuff by Biya.

As radicals took ascendancy, the anglophone movement declared the creation of the ""Republic of Ambazonia"" in the Northwest and neighbouring Southwest Region on October 1, 2017.

No country has recognised the self-declared state.

The separatists have gunned down troops and police, boycotted and torched schools and attacked other perceived symbols of the Cameroonian state.

The authorities have responded with a massive crackdown by police and troops.

At least 400 civilians have been killed this year as well as more than 175 members of the security forces, according to a toll compiled by non-governmental organisations.

According to UN figures, 246,000 people in the Southwest Region have fled their homes, and 25,000 have sought shelter in neighbouring Nigeria, many of them living hand-to-mouth in the forests."

Responding to the allegation by the opposition leader, principal of Anandaram Dhekial Phookan (ADP) College Dr Surajit Kumar Bhagowati on Friday said he did not ban any religious outfit and only issued a notice before the Autumn vacation asking students to wear ""proper uniform"".

He further added that out of the 20 per cent Muslim students of the college, only the MLA's daughter wears a burqa in college. He was feeling threatened and has lodged a police complaint over the Facebook post of the AIUDF leader, the principal said.

On being asked whether he has banned 'hijab' and 'niqab' in the college, the principal said he neither ordered any such ban nor did he ask any student not to wear burqa in the campus.

The college's Students Union and the Teachers' Council have criticised the MLA for the social media post. The Muslim students have also come out in support of the move of the principal.

Three former students of a Catholic school in Chandigarh have levelled sexual harassment charges against the former principal and co-founding director of the school on social media.

Harold Carver, who is the principal of the school has been accused of sexual harassment by Manraj Singh.

Manraj, a student of the 1980 batch, has called Carver a sexual predator on his Facebook page. He said that he and his hostel mates were aware of the principal's activities. He mentioned that he was a Class 7 student when the accused called him to his office and initiated an uncomfortable conversation with him.

Earlier, a 42-year-old Delhi based journalist Sanjay Austa had accused Harold Carver of sexually harassing him and his hostel mates when he was a student in the school. Austa had said in his blog that he was a Class 9 student when Carver abused him in his office.

""Harold Carver is a sexual predator whose choice was children. Ever since I learnt that Harold Carver was back in Chandigarh, I started getting worried. How many children would he have abused in his entire career? How many like me who knew he was a pedophile were silenced? How many kids couldn't have walked out of his office the way I did that day,"" said Sanjay Austa.

Another former student Navin Chhetri, who is currently in Colorado, US, has also accused Harold of sexual harassment.

However, it is not for the first time that Harold has been accused of sexual harassment by his students. Carver was also sentenced to prison for one month 30 years ago for allegedly abusing half a dozen students. Navin Chhetri, who was one of the students had also appeared in the court. The complaint was later withdrawn.

The school management has refuted the allegations against Harold Carver saying that he is a ""man of intense integrity"" and accusations levelled against him are false, baseless and extremely hurtful.

Harold Carver has also termed the allegations as baseless.

""I have an unblemished record and cannot even imagine committing such an act. I sanguinely feel that the whole game is to malign the reputation of the school,"" Harold Carver said.

The reason is said to be a property dispute. Ironically, the victim, Ranganath Nayaka, had gone to the school to discuss the same issue with a local leader who offered to mediate.

The attack took place around 10 am in Havanur Public School in Agrahara Dasarahalli on Magadi Road. About five hours later, the police were able to trace the main attacker Muniraju alias Babli in Mahalakshmi Layout, where they were forced to open fire at him and nab him. The rest are absconding. The dispute pertains to a building owned by one Gangamma on a site adjacent to the school, which had encroached upon the school property. The encroaching part of the building was demolished by the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) two days ago based on a court order.

Ranganath Nayaka, a resident of Housing Board Colony near Rajajinagar, has retired as assistant manager at RBI. Nayaka owned the school, which he set up in 2003 after he retired. The family hails from Pavagada in Tumakuru district and had settled in the city. A police officer said the incident took place when Nayaka and the school's administrative staff were at a meeting with a local leader, Rajashekar, to resolve the same property dispute.

Lokesh Gowda, an employee, and Yathish, an assistant, rushed to Nayaka's rescue, but the duo too was attacked by the gang which then fled the scene. The attackers included Gangamma's two sons. Gowda and Yathish sustained stab injuries. Lokesh Gowda said, ""The gang stabbed Nayaka in his chest, thigh and stomach.""

Preliminary investigation has revealed that a portion of a residential building belonging to one Gangamma, located next to the school, had encroached upon the school property. Nayaka had approached the court over the encroachment as it was creating a problem for the school. The court had ordered demolition of the encroaching portion and BDA officials had demolished it with police protection two days ago.

Gangamma's sons Prasad and Mahesh had reportedly nurtured a grudge against Nayaka over the demolition and had allegedly planned to kill him.

Prasad along with his gang came and allegedly attacked Nayaka in his chamber, stabbing him to death.

Babli, who was among the first to attack, was arrested within five hours of the murder, while Prasad, Mahesh and three others are absconding. The police have formed a special team to nab them, a police officer said. ""We are yet to ascertain whether Babli and his gang had taken any 'supari' contract from Prasad to kill Nayaka,"" an investigation officer added.

Nayaka's elder brother Nagendraiah told The New Indian Express that Gangamma had passed away recently after which her two sons Prasad and Mahesh got into a dispute with Nayaka over the encroachment.

He said Rajashekhar, a local leader, who was also known to Prasad and Mahesh, had offered to mediate between the two parties to resolve the dispute. ""My brother was being called to the school since two days. But he could not go as he had undergone an eye surgery a week ago. On Sunday he sought the doctor's advice before going to the school,"" Nagendariah said."
