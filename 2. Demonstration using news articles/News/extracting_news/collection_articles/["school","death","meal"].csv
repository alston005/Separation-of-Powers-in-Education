Making it to your 100th birthday is not altogether beyond our control, as these centenarians testify. They've made lifestyle choices to improve their odds of a long and healthful life. Simplicity, discipline, and an active life seem to be their main allies.

""Growing old is a natural process everyone experiences,"" says A Susai, born the year that saw the end of the First World War. ""The secret to getting to this age is work. I have never stopped; it keeps me going,"" he says, flashing a toothless smile. Susai retired as the Head Postmaster of Nagapattinam in 1978 and remains active in his retired life, working as a farmer. Father to 12 children, grandfather to 26, and great-grandfather to 13, his family is settled in different parts of the world. ""They take turns to visit me,"" he says.

From the day he retired, Susai turned to tilling the land he owns in his backyard. On three acres he has been growing paddy, guava, banana, papaya, mango, jackfruit, coconut, greens and a variety of vegetables that go into preparing his daily meals. ""My wife passed away in 2015 at the age of 90. She enjoyed cooking, and for four decades I had only home food. A house help now cooks for me.""

The farm-to-fork fresh food keeps Susai healthy. He does not miss a meal, but eats light and is particular about eating greens at least four days a week. ""I am not on any medication,"" he says.

It is his daily habit of walking in the fields that keeps him fit for his age. ""My knees are not cooperating now,"" says Susai, who has a steel implant in his leg following an accident in 2008. Until 10 years ago, he was using public transport, but after he fell down while alighting from a bus and underwent surgery, it has slowed him down.

Yet, the love for greenery draws him to the fields every day. ""I use a walking stick to move around, checking and talking to my plants,"" he says, adding, ""Being in communion with Nature is balm for the mind and the body.""

Susai could not attend college because as the oldest of four siblings he needed to take care of his family following his father's early death. ""After finishing school, I worked as a construction worker on daily wages, earning 18 annas a week in the 1930s. After joining the Postal Department, my job took me to various places,"" says Susai, who is now penning his life's story. Every night, he writes a page or more and it has a cathartic effect, he says.

Does loneliness get to him? ""After waking up every day, I talk to my wife's photograph by the bedside. I ask her whether she remembers me each day as I do her. This little conversation keeps me energised."" Afternoons are spent listening to Carnatic and church music. ""It keeps me relaxed and peaceful."" But he's also happy when people around him are happy. ""The positive vibes from them add years to my life,"" says Susai.

Aleykutty Thomas came to the house in Kuravilangadu in 1930, as a young bride and raised her family of nine children. A farmer at heart, she grows paddy, tapioca and other root vegetables and continues to enjoy the fruits of her labour.

""A long, healthy life requires good habits,"" says Aleykutty, who wakes up at 5 am to say her prayers and take a walk around the house. ""Genes play a role, but the rest is up to you,"" she shares over a telephone conversation. She has always done manual labour, she says, along with lots of walking, and that is what has helped her reap the rewards with almost no health complaints. She does not rely on any daily medication. ""My eyesight is good and I don't have BP, sugar or cholesterol,"" she says. ""My medicine is my food. All my life I have eaten plenty of greens and root vegetables and that is the secret to my long and healthy life,"" she declares.

She would go to the fields with her husband, return, and cook the family meal. Even today, Aleykutty maintains that discipline. ""I wash my clothes, help my daughter-in-law in the kitchen and babysit when she is away,"" says the grandmother of 16 and great grandmother of 28.

Aleykutty says her husband inculcated the habit of reading in her. ""I made it a habit to read the local Malayalam daily after my morning cup of tea. It is important to stay mentally sharp, and when I keep myself abreast with current news, my company is livelier.""

Fond of music, Aleykutty also loves to sing devotional songs. ""It keeps my mind calm,"" says the God-fearing woman of few words. She attributes her longevity to more than just good genes: ""I am positive, have faith in life and people and am blessed by God."" That she has outlived four of her children hurts her. But having attended the weddings of all her grandchildren and even a few great grandchildren brings back the joy."

And 2018 gave us enough stories to cheer, cry and think. 1,250,000,000

That is the number of sessions you readers spent on indianexpress.com in 2018, resulting in more than double the number of pageviews. This is why we have been consistently among the top three news websites in the country. But then our story is never about the numbers, it is always about the stories. And 2018 gave us enough stories to cheer, cry and think.

While there were many events of massive reader interest from important elections to the football World Cup, it was the passing away of three legends that gripped them the most. Our top read story was the news about Sridevi's death, first confirmed by indianexpress.com. The story was read by millions of people within the first few hours and, with close to half a million shares, it is one of our most social stories ever. Similarly, the news of the deaths of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and M Karunanidhi were also read across the country, underlining the importance of the most influential political figures of our times.

The Karnataka elections and the prolonged drama that ensued was the biggest political story of the year, even more than Congress victories in three states towards the end of the year. Among events, the Kerala floods and the Amritsar train tragedy were among the top read.

While education stories, especially all the result announcements, understandably get a lot of readership, in sports the IPL auctions had millions of readers. Indian cricket team's many wins also figure prominently in our list of top read stories.

Advertising

And if you ask us which was the biggest movie of the year, it has to be Rajinikant's 2.0, which collectively got us more readers than any other event. Vijay's Sarkar was a close second, underlining that the south is more online when it comes to reading about its stars and their endeavours. In Bollywood, Sanju seems to have gone one up on Zero when it comes to how our readers accepted the movies. Meanwhile, the Bigg Boss franchise continues to find readership, don't ask us why.

In technology, the most read story was one telling people how to port out of bankrupt telco Aircel's network. Out of all the launches through the year, Xiaomi got the most eyeballs, followed by OnePlus and Apple. Android and Reliance Jio both continued to draw traffic as top topics with huge user interest.

10 million social followers

The Indian Express social media properties now have over 10 million followers and they have a mind of their own. Our most popular social media story was a video on Dadi Ki Rasoi, the man who offers a meal for just Rs 5 in Noida.

The story of Sikh volunteers cooking meals for those affected by floods in Kerala was also shared widely. So was the recent post on Barack Obama's Santa avatar.

Mary Kom's sixth gold medal at the world championships was also a winner for us on Facebook.

On Twitter, our most viral tweet was about Hanan donating Rs 1.5 lakh to the Kerala CM's relief fund.

A tweet on the UP Police's bid to nab Bheem Army's Vinay Ratan also amused readers, understandably so.

Our thread on the first girls in Sainik School was also widely retweeted.

Meanwhile, one of our best kept secrets is the IndianExpress Instagram account managed by our hugely talented photo team. While it is a showcase of the best of our photography and our unparalleled archives, this post of youngsters serving tea and biscuits and wished to policemen in Mumbai on new year duty found a lot of traction.

New beginnings

This was the year we started our extensive coverage of the Northeast, with reporters in Assam, Tripura, Manipur and Mizoram. We knew the stories there had to be told and and taken to a wider audience, a hunch that was proven true by the wide acceptance to some of the stories from there, including the fascinating story of Assam's Hima Das. We also started a dedicated section on parenting and our own brand of podcasts with Express Audio and the Bengali version of the site.

With a crucial election year on the anvil, we know you will come back for more of our stories... stories only we will tell."

Puranjit Dasgupta, who plays Genie, says he doesn't watch the film too often. ""Genie was scripted around Robin Williams, not the other way around. Genie is a very interesting character; Aladdin and he share a bond. Aladdin is played by two actors: Siddharth Menon and Taaruk Raina. The young heroes say that the best part about the play is that it's the story of hope -- an underdog who finds a full life.

Around two years ago, conservation architect Rahul Chemburkar started the Mumbai Pyaav Project on social media to campaign for the restoration of the 30-odd colonial-era water fountains (pyaavs). Having restored the Kothari Pyaav this year, Chemburkar is now focusing on the Anand Vithal Koli Pyaav and Sir Cowasji Jehangir's Pyaav.

Kunal Kapoor, who runs Prithvi Theatre today, is reviving seven of his grandfather, Prithviraj Kapoor's, plays. The first one, Deewar, directed by Sunil Shanbag, was staged in November, and the second one, Kisaan, directed by Abhishek Majumdar, will be staged in the new year. ""These are things [issues] we're still dealing with today,"" says Kapoor. ""That's why I think they have a life. Definitely, we need to adapt them, [just] like Shakespeare. Prithviraj Kapoor would have 50-60 people onstage; his plays would go on for four-and-a-half hours. That's not feasible today. So, you need to edit them and bring them up to speed. The idea is [to have] a director's interpretation or his approach to the classics.""

Still/Life at JNAF presents the Dutch obsession with the humble, the boring, the drab. Sixteen photographers are represented in the show, with 48 photographs and five videos, with a thread of irony binding them all. Marcel Feil, curator of the show, says about the Bouquet series (pictured above), which is a shot of cutouts of flowers and fruits, ""For most people, these are visually related to the Dutch painterly tradition of still-life painting in the 17th century, with flowers and fruits. But, it's not what you think it is. The original paintings are appreciated because of their naturalistic qualities. In the 17th century, when an artist decided to paint fruit, it was quite exceptional, because fruit in itself is not so special.""

Auckland-based textile artist Areez Katki's debut solo exhibition was inspired by the fabrics he found in his Parsi nani's house in Tardeo. ""I'm here on an artist's residency, to finish my first body of work,"" he says. To open on February 2, 2019, at Malcolm Smith Gallery, in Auckland, it will carry Mumbai in its threads, as Katki carries his heritage in his heart. ""I have attached this great romance to this house and this colony and this community."" His designs will appear on rags, towels, doilies and tablecloths.

Book lovers have clearly surprised the publishing world with their insurmountable appetite for South Indian literature. It's no surprise why several new translations, including that of KR Meera, Perumal Murugan and Sangeetha Sreenivasan were so warmly received. In 2019, will see more translations and writings.

Co-founded by five music lovers, Hamsadhwani is a series of baithaks held in a Borivli home. For instance, their inaugural baithak in August 2017 was led by Aditya Khandwe, shishya of Padma Shri recipient Ulhas Kashalkar. Khandwe says, ""In an auditorium, the music may not reach every person, but in chamber music, if it's set up as intimately as Hamsadhwani is, then the game changes because the music reaches every individual."" To ensure that, Amritha and Raghuram have converted a 3BHK house into a music venue.

The antique stores of Mumbai -- Moorthy's in Tardeo, Phillips Antiques in Colaba, Camelot in Kemps Corner -- specialise in restoration and resale. But, what they have started paying particular attention to, because the Indian buyer has furniture from the Art Deco and mid-century period, antiques as young as 100 years old. In 2018, Moorthy's launched Pooranawalla, a dedicated space that will only sell Art Deco and mid-century furniture. As RK Moorthy, owner of Moorthy's, says, ""Mid-century furniture is commanding absolutely fantastic value in some of the auction houses.""

We agree that Taimur Ali Khan could easily be the cutest star kid around. But that's not all that is making him so popular. Crazy fan accounts and paparazzi photographers, are fuelling his celebrity status. They stake out his haunts, and post details about his outfits. There is even an Instagram account dedicated to his nanny. With Taimur returning the love, the New Year is going to be special.

If Hannah Gadsby's stand-up special Nanette was radical, our comedians from the LGBTQI community aren't too far behind. Navin Noronha, who is Mumbai's first openly gay stand-up comedian, has been discussing everything from religion to homophobia. Noronha started out with his show Coming out Soon, and will continue to regale us in the New Year with his special, The Good Child.

One of India's greatest abstractionists, who passed away in 2018, Mehlli Gobhai's canvasses showed little but spoke a lot. Shireen Gandhy's Gallery Chemould will be presenting a retrospective of his works in March 2019, along with curators Nancy Adajania and Ranjit Hoskote at the NGMA.

They are artistes who are all about the littlest of details. Their palm-sized collectibles are not only cute, but explore new materials and the need to innovate. In 2018, internationally, and in India, works by miniature artistes -- everything from food to TV show memorabilia -- became the new hip collectibles to go online shopping for. In a time and society, where extra large is the order of the day, and miniature art is a refreshing genre, 2019 promises to see more of it.

When Shaili Sathyu's Chidiya, Udd was staged in April this year, it created ripples in the theatre scene. The play explores the relationship between a bird and little child. Sathyu's next series of shows will be staged in February.

Here's a chance for proud alumni of two of the city's most prestigious educational institutions -- St Xavier's High School and St Xavier's College -- to join in their sesquicentenary celebrations. At the college alumni reunion at Cooperage, the meet and greet function, will be followed by a cultural programme and dinner.

The aim of The Hope Circuit is to ""give corporate bands the limelight they deserve,"" says musician Howard Pereira, the man behind the initiative, where a corporate band opens for a well-established band at Hard Rock Cafe every month. The bands that play are from all corporate sectors, banking being the most popular one. Most have learnt music growing up and gave it up for many reasons, monetary being the primary.

For the last few years, 30-year-old Vashi resident Arvin David, who runs the music company Connect, has been introducing students with hearing loss to the beats of the djembe -- a rope-tuned goblet drum with origins in West Africa. To accomplish this, he invented the ""vibration box"" -- a two-seater box, made with wood of a particular thickness and width, inside which speakers are placed. David's djembe is connected to the speakers via a wireless microphone. He is not alone. Breach Candy resident Nicole Fernandes recently started an electronic keyboard tutorial on YouTube, Music For The Deaf.

Kirsten Varela has turned his backyard into a no-frills calisthenics park and christened it Elysium, a place of perfect happiness. ""The best part about calisthenics is that it's mainly 90 per cent upper body,"" he says. ""Calisthenics is mixing your body with movements like mobility, stability and just trying to create a beautiful movement.""

This year saw the launch of apps like Delta, which are LGBTQ friendly, and Tinder also opened up its platform to be more inclusive. As they opened up to us, members of the LGBTQ told us why dating apps, which helped them personalise their needs, gave them an opportunity to look for exactly what they want.

If your grandparent or relative lived in pre-Independent India, and had interesting stories to share from that era, it's time you nominate them for the Citizen Archive of India's Generation 1947 project. The project will record and archive stories of Indian citizens who've witnessed India through two centuries, using oral history and material memories.

They are very young, but that doesn't stop them from giving their thousands of followers advice on issues ranging from exam stress to mental health to suicide. India's young Instagrammers, themselves vocal about their problems, make themselves relatable to their followers. They address the fans' issues through their posts, live streams (where they take questions), YouTube channel, and also private messages. As we enter 2019, they get even more important than ever before.

Punyakoti -- the first crowdsourced attempt at making a full-length 2D animated film in Sanskrit -- has reached its post production stage and will release in 2019. Over 100 people from across the country have collaborated on the project, including actor Revathi, music maestro Ilaiyaraja, National award-winning editor Manoj Kannath and puppeteers Anupama and Vidyashankar Hoskere.

Sensing the growing homophobia in schools, former student Kabir Karamchandani formed a support group titled Garv in February to address the issue. While the 20-year-old may be miles away, pursuing his higher education in Oberlin, Ohio, his legacy is being carried forward by a dedicated team of 'woke' boys and girls. Interestingly, the Garv initiative might be included as a case study in a large scale survey conducted by Humsafar Trust on bullying in schools.

In October, the Diss track trend hit India when Mumbai underground rapper Emiway took on popular singer Raftaar. When rapper Raftaar said in an interview that there was no money to be made in underground rapping and named Emiway, the 22-year-old Mumbai rapper released a diss track called Samajh Mein Aaya Kya trying to address the issue. Then Raftaar released a song, then Emiway released another... well, you get the drift. What makes it good for you is that you can follow them and enjoy some quality music.

One man's problem could well be another man's opportunity. And entrepreneurs Ameya Davda and Devak Davda's startup, Space Valet, know that well. This year, they launched a service that aims to be a one-stop storage solution that offers private, lockable and secure self-storage units of various sizes to stash your belongings. You browse the website and find a suitable storage plan, then order as many boxes as you need, and then pack and label your belongings.

What is it about Ludo King that has made it beat Temple Run, Candy Crush and Pokemon Go, to become the No. 1 free game on both Google Play Store and App Store? We dug deep to find out how this trend has seamlessly penetrated the lower rungs of the socio-economic segment, galvanising a strata that hadn't warmed up to digital games. Raamesh Gowri Raghavan, an ancient Indian games researcher and professor of archaeology at Mumbai University, believes the game has an innately competitive element which makes it addictive.

Lokesh Padmashali takes 30 seconds to make a portrait. ""A single line has endless possibilities,"" he says. A graphic designer employed at a design firm in Prabhadevi, Padmashali has mastered the technique of making a single line bend to his wishes. On his Instagram account, the artist has a virtual sketchbook, on which he has uploaded his sketches. The portraits are of friends and celebrities, and showcase the deft ways in which a line can twist and turn continuously.

This year, Pramod Rathi picked up Miko, an emotionally intelligent robot, at the IIT-B Techfest to address the relentless questions fired by his kids. His review? ""My children took to Miko immediately. Also, unlike its Chinese counterpart, Miko has an adorable voice that's not robotic. We can relate to it."" Miko is built to engage children between five and 12 years of age. To ensure an age appropriate discussion, it comes with a filter that ensures the answers are child-safe.

Go-to sculptors Mingleshwar and Benzoni Sequeira are breaking new ground in design while ensuring that their three-generation-old skill retains its traditional origins. The duo is known for iconography, statues and restoration across not just Mumbai but also across the globe. Prominent contributions in the city and suburbs include a 15-foot cross at Salvation Church in Dadar, crucifix at Mount Carmel Church in Bandra, restoration of St John the Baptist in Thane, among several others.

Little did people know that Lord Ganesha eats veggies. In several households, the Lord is greeted with a rushi panchami veg mix, which includes yam, pumpkin, okra, snake gourd, ridge gourd and sponge gourd cooked with aloo (colocasia) and amaranth leaves. Next year, when Ganeshotsav is around the corner, look out for Ranbhaji Mahostavs, organised across the city, to know what you have been missing out on.

Where: Commonly performs in Hamster Comedy, Powai; Workbay, Bandra West; Canvas Laugh Club, Lower Parel; and The Looney, The Lover and The Poet in Khar West

Thirty-three-year-old New Yorker Mike Harrington is a corporate consultant by day and stand-up comic by night. He moved to Mumbai about a year ago and has successfully cracked the local audience up with his infectious humour. Harrington's stint with comedy started three years ago in Hong Kong, after attending a bunch of open mics there. He now performs at various locations across Mumbai.

Technocrat Ankur Puranik is spearheading an initiative mooted by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region to create a grid of mini-weather stations by roping in other weather enthusiasts. The weather bureau currently receives updates only from Santacruz and Colaba. But the new initiative will allow every area in the city to have its own weather station.

For the last 27 years, Maharashtra Andha Audyogik Utpadak Sahakari Sanstha (Maryadit), a Maharashtra-based cooperative society run by the visually impaired, has been maintaining and manufacturing furniture at all state government-run institutions. Their handcrafted cane chairs and tables, and upholstery can be seen at the BMC office, Bombay High Court, sessions court, sales tax, excise and police departments. If recruitment is through word of mouth, so are contracts, which means you can order from them, too.

Makarand Deshpande, the maverick playwright, finished his 50th original script, Epic Gadbad, marking a milestone in a glorious journey onstage. A farce, it is a conclusion to his previous play, Shakespearecha Mhatara, which was a hilarious take on King Lear. While it was first staged at Prithvi Theatre in July 2018, the playwright has plans to bring it back to the city in 2019 as well.

In 2018, the iconic theatre group Awishkar Theatre brought Aranya Kiran directed by Ajit Bhagat. The play, staged 10 years after the death of its late director-playwright Chetan Datar, is set in the Mahabharata. It revolves around a self-questioning Lord Krishna (played by Sushil Inamdar) in Dwarka. The string of monologues with various lead characters -- wife Rukmini, brother Balaram, foster parents Nand and Yashoda and lastly, mother-like Gandhari -- interrogate Krishna's trickery, political moves and worldview. The play is still being staged and the next show is in January itself.

Vasudev Patkar, sculptor and plasterer; Tehmi Ghadialy, porcelain and glass restorer; Mohammed Damani (in pic), an antique clock repairer; and Swati Chandgadkar, a stained glass restorer, help the architects and conservationists conserve the city's past.

A publishing house that started a reading movement back in the '70s, is set for a new innings to revive the language of its people. The publishing house was launched in 1974 by journalists Ashok Jain, Dinkar Gangal, Arun Sadhu and Kumar Ketkar, who created an informal organisation to spread the culture of reading among Marathi speakers. Over the years, it has seen several members come and go and even survived a slump.

Samir Bharadwaj conducts paper workshops across Mumbai where he teaches how to neatly slice paper, and fold it just right, so that you can create your own automatons and pop-up books. Even if you don't become skilled at it, hand-eye coordination in adulthood is good for you.

Kahaani Designworks has culled 26 letters of the English alphabet of the original Art Deco typeface by looking at the buildings. Ruchita Madhok, principal designer, says, ""They are all geometric, not cursive, resembling the style of the building.""

The NCPA opened its 'secret garden' for open-air concerts in October. The garden is designed to provide an outdoor experience whether it be a jazz night with wine and cheese or a chamber orchestra. More such concerts will be held in 2019.

Suyash Rawat, a 32-year-old emergency medical practitioner, has set up Mumbai's first surf school, along with Krishna Lamani, who previously worked as an instructor at the Kovalam Surf Club. Rajori beach enjoys a kilometre-long stretch of grey sand and is a perfect place if you are still at an introductory stage. Call a day prior for weather conditions.

When Aneesh Bhasin, co-founder at Svami, told us his tonic water has 50 per cent fewer calories than Schweppes, its main competitor, we knew the way we had our gin and tonic was going to change forever. Made from quinine sourced from Congo, cucumber and lime from India, and grapefruit from the US, Bhasin has increased the carbonation over the months because ""Indians like their fizz"". Svami is getting ready to launch more flavours, and a ginger ale by February.

The backstory behind booze

What and Where: White Lady cocktail at The Bombay Canteen; Chanel No. 6 at House of Nomads; Sherlock In A Pickle at London Taxi; and Red Monsoon at Hakkasan

This year, Yash Bhanage, co-owner at The Bombay Canteen, and his research team soaked themselves in the history of single screen theatres as inspiration for cocktails. Not just them, several other bartenders tried to create a story out of their cocktails. For instance, Jiaan Kris J Lam, House of Nomads, created Chanel No. 6 (in pic) as an ode to the fashion house, and Ami Shroff at London Taxi, whipped up a Sherlock-inspired drink which stood out for its prominent notes of gherkin, tea and rose. Order a glass.

At, Harajuku, on Chapel Road, co-owner Saleha Bawazir wanted to bring the street food of Harajuku to Mumbai. So, the restaurant offers a wide range of sweet and savoury crepes; Dorayakis, palm-sized treats comprising a sweet filling sandwiched between two round cakes, among other things. Vikram Khatri, executive chef at Hello Guppy, also overhauled the menu to introduce a range of new items including caramelised popcorn with crispy bacon, beetroot rice cracker and tuna nachos pizza. ""Everybody knows about sushi and ramen. It was time to educate people that there's a lot more that comes from Japan,"" he says.

Inspired by the legendary wrestler, Mini Punjab introduced The Dara Singh thali on its menu this year. Not for the weak-hearted, it packs in the best of unlimited eating. It features 33 items, and includes aloo paratha, chur chur de naan, makki di roti, murg mussalam rice, lamb yoghurt curry, chicken Amritsari and more. If you're in for a man-versus-food contest, here's your best bet.

Development consultant Ragini Kashyap, who started Third Culture Cooks -- a multinational supper club -- likes to tell a story with a bite. Her venture, Bordered dinner, explores border conflict by pairing food with peoples' stories and history. We sampled the Tamil-Sinhala conflict in Sri Lanka, and returned knowing a lot more about our neighbour's culinary diversity.

If you are severely intolerant to gluten, there is a chance you have stayed away from vodka, which is made from wheat, barley, or rye. Well, Tito's Handmade Vodka that is produced in Austin at Texas's oldest legal distillery is now available in Mumbai. The drink is made using corn. Tito Beveridge, who came up with the recipe, distilled the corn mash six times, because it was believed that corn retains some of its smoothness even after distillation. The process of making the corn-based vodka is similar to that of the making of single malts and high-end French cognacs.

It's not every day that you come across pepper in your pannacota, which is why pastry chef Husna Jumani's timut-infused creamy Italian dessert is noteworthy. It's the pronounced flavour of the Nepalese pepper -- spicy with hints of grapefruit -- that propelled her to pick this as the hero ingredient. However, it is an acquired taste, she warns.

The ingredients of Du Rhone might be a well-kept secret, but not its stellar reputation. So when the 140-year-old gourmet chocolate brand opened their first store in May this year, we were the first to rush for a blind tasting evening. Our favourite was the Coline which is a dark ganache with 70 per cent cocoa beans from Brazil and Papua New Guinea.

The last one year saw a rise in the number of gourmet delivery joints in the city. The menu at these kitchens range from Bento Buddha bowls to coconut-panko crusted shrimps with orange and ginger dips. The food, then, is the biggest selling point. We'd recommend the Mis Malaysian Seafood Bisque from Hello Green.

The wandering Maharaj is invited for weddings and funerals, casual get-togethers and Diwali dos, any affair in which the party size is too significant for a regular cook, and when guests need to be impressed. Om Maharaj specialises in sweets, such as rasgulla and ghevar; and Lallan Maharaj, who has also trained in restaurants and five-stars for 13 years, can be trusted to pull off Italian and Chinese dishes convincingly. Lallan says, ""In this line of work, the person who knows his job, doesn't need the title. I have not kept my name maharaj. It's all of you who call me maharajji. So, now, it has become a surname.""

From kombucha to vegetable broth, mixologists discuss what you can replace your calorie-laden mixer with. The almond milk soda cocktail at Colaba's Bombay Vintage has an interesting backstory. Here, Sean Pereira, bar operations manager, uses doodh soda consumed by farmers in Peshawar to keep themselves hydrated.

A food service in Bandra has been made special by autistic students, who have donned chefs' hats to make the lunch break worthwhile. The students belong to the Support for Autistic Individuals (SAI), a charitable trust set up by Kamini Lakhani and her husband, Anil. The young autistic cooks need a fair amount of support. ""It will take them anywhere between one and eight months for them to understand all the steps,"" says Lakhani.

What can you expect when the power couple behind The Table teams up with the boys behind The Woodside Inn? Miss T, a gastro Asian cocktail bar and restaurant. Every cocktail we sampled was characterised by an adventurous, refreshing and comforting tag. The Quixotic (R850) came with peanut butter-infused Jim Beam bourbon, hints of saffron and orange bitters. In the food menu, we liked the chicken and tender coconut curry (R900) that came with pandan rice. The curry was light without lacking depth. We liked the food for its simple execution of flavours and lack of pretentiousness, which is just what an Asian meal should be.

One of Goa's most loved restaurants, House of Lloyd, made its Mumbai debut this year. We met the chef for a taste of the Goa-inspired menu. He has selected the choicest of dishes including rassa omelette, pork chops and clams masala. Now you know where to head for a susegad experience.

Chef Scott Linquist (who runs the Miami favourite Coyo Taco) and Jason Hudanish introduced chapulines or grasshoppers as an off-the-menu dish at Mexican restaurant Xico. The grasshoppers don't have a distinct taste and the texture is close to crunchy prawns. A rich source of protein, you can either eat the dried grasshoppers directly, or on tortilla.

A hoppumm is a marriage between Sri Lanka's hoppers, a type of fermented pancakes, and South Indian appams, and three school friends from Bombay Scottish brought it to Bandra this year. Hoppumm is a 15-seater restaurant, exuding architectural influences from Sri Lanka. The highlight is the bowl-shaped Sri Lankan pancakes filled with a range of fragrant curries. To make it flexible, they offer combinations where you can pair a base staple -- hopper, string hopper (idiyappam), neer dosa, paratha or kothu roti -- with a flavourful filling.

Mastani is a milkshake that comes topped with a dollop of hand-churned ice cream. Some people also add fresh cut fruits, dry fruits and whipped cream.

In the summer of 1927 also, he came to Kashmir for six weeks. The Kashmir administration had failed to inform Maharaja Hari Singh about Jinnah's presence in Srinagar of which he had come to know through a news report published in the daily Pratap, Lahore on 11 May 1927. The Minister of Police and Public Works, GEC Wakefield was in writing asked to explain the failure to report the development.

During his last visit in May 1944, Jinnah, like in 1936, was accompanied by his sister, Fatima Jinnah. Before driving into the territory of Jammu & Kashmir on 8 May, he made a brief stopover at Gujranwala, Punjab where a small public meeting was also held. He entered the State territory from Suchetgarh on the same day. A joint reception was accorded to him by leaders of the Muslim Conference and the National Conference including Chowdhary Ghulam Abbas, Allah Rakha Sagar and Bakhshi Ghulam Mohammad. Abbas recalls the warm reception Jinnah was accorded at Jammu:

""On the 18-mile long road from Suchetgarh to Jammu, there were continuous lines of his admirers eagerly waiting for him. In the city of Jammu, Muslim men and women - old and young, rich and poor, villagers and city dwellers - all were animatedly looking for the arrival of the Quaid-e-Azam, their beloved leader. The route of the procession was decorated so elegantly that even the Hindus admitted that such beautification and a sea of people were not witnessed even at the coronation of Hari Singh and his ancestors.""

The Quaid-e-Azam was taken in a procession to Jammu city in an open car where he addressed a public meeting in the evening during which he attributed the rising of the people of Jammu & Kashmir against an autocratic rule to the injustices meted out to them. He told the gathering that the 100 million Muslims of India would not leave their brethren in Jammu & Kashmir in lurch. The reception accorded to him at Jammu was ""unprecedented"". At one point, when his car was unable to negotiate a sharp turn it was physically lifted by the crowd so that it could make the turn. At Jammu, Jinnah stayed in the Dak Bungalow where he met political leaders, especially the youth. Here, he developed a kind of addiction to the hookah of a Muslim Conference leader, Abdullah Bhalli, and almost forgot his favourite cigar.

Next day, Jinnah along with Abbas set out on his journey to Kashmir and had a night halt at Banihal. As per the programme, he had to reach Srinagar the same day but ""given the huge number of people who had descended on the Srinagar-Jammu road after trekking forty to fifty kos mountainous trudge to have a glimpse of the Quaid-e-Azam"", the schedule was changed with night halt at Banihal. On 10 May, he left for Srinagar at 2 p.m. The Mirwaiz of Kashmir, Molvi Mohammad Yusuf Shah drove to Banihal to receive him. The road journey of 107 kilometers [66.48 miles] from Banihal to Srinagar was covered in five hours. En-route, there was hardly any spot where people had not gathered in large numbers to greet Jinnah. At Qazigund, thousands of National Conference and Muslim Conference workers accorded warm reception to him and he responded their affection and love with broad smiles.

There were skirmishes and exchange of fist blows also between the workers of the National Conference and the Muslim Conference at Qazigund, Khanabal and Bijbihara. The police report squarely blamed the former for abusing the Muslim Conference workers, when the latter arrived at Qazigund, resulting in fist blows. Bakhshi Ghulam Mohammad and Mohammad Amin kept the warring workers of their respective parties at bay. At Qazigund, people in large numbers jostled one another to have a glimpse of the leader. His car could move forward with great difficulty. An interesting development occurred there when two tyres of the Mirwaiz's vehicle, bearing the registration number 2675 J&K, flattened and he had to board the car of his political rival, Bakhshi Ghulam Mohammad, in which the former's colleague, Chowdhary Ghulam Abbas was also accommodated. The back windshield of the Mirwaiz's car was broken but the police could not say how and by whom. The car was reportedly attacked by National Conference workers.

At Khanabal, an enthusiastic crowd of about 10,000 people greeted Jinnah. There was a stampede and many people were run over by a fervent throng. The Muslim Conference had arranged tea for the visiting dignitary at the Khanabal Dak Bunglow and disallowed workers of the National Conference to enter the premises. At this point, the National Conference leader, Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg, scaled the gate of the Dak Bungalow and jumped inside. He opened the gate and let his workers in, which resulted in a scuffle with the host party. The flags of the Muslim Conference were snatched and torn. At Bijbihara, similar clashes took place between the supporters of the two parties albeit after Jinnah had left the spot. Earlier, the two parties had agreed to an arrangement of positioning their supporters on the two sides of the road. However, as Jinnah drove past, the two groups started abusing and assaulting each other. Muhammad Ismail, teacher of Islamia High School, Anantnag, approached the Assistant Superintendent of Police and the Sub-Divisional Magistrate on spot and identified Amir Sheikh, Assadullah Beg, Rasul Bandi, Hassan Malla, and Habib Nagara as the culprits who assaulted him, tore his clothes and removed from his pocket his wallet containing Rs. 45. An FIR was lodged under No. 10 U/S 147/379 RPC against the accused.

Scenes of 'emotional welcome' were also witnessed at Awantipore, Letapore, Pampore, Athwajan, Batwara and Sonawar. On the outskirts of Srinagar city, Jinnah was received by the top leadership of the National Conference including Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah, Ghulam Mohammad Sadiq and Mohammad Syed Masoodi.

At Pampore, a private band presented ceremonial salute to Jinnah who made a brief speech thanking people for the grand reception accorded to him. Welcome arches and buntings were erected at Sonawar. Here, the band of Gilania Middle School Sonawar played a welcome song. From Sonawar to the Pratap Park, thousands of people, including foreign tourists, were lined in rows to welcome Jinnah who waved at them. About a dozen cars drove as pilot vehicles ahead of his motor car. A grand public reception was accorded to him at the Pratap Park where the gathering was estimated to be about one lakh. Jinnah entered the Pratap Park from its western gate. After the conclusion of the public meeting, he told Chowdhary Ghulam Abbas that the volume of the gathering could be 70,000 to 80,000. Impressed by people's warmth, Jinnah described the reception as a 'royal welcome'. He was also taken to Drugjan where the Muslim Conference presented a welcome address. Both at the Pratap Park and Drugjan, Jinnah made speeches.

The Pratap Park reception was an effort by Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah to impress the Quaid-e-Azam about his own influence on Kashmiris and win him over to his side as against the Muslim Conference but the latter refused to play the ball. The public meeting began with the recitation of Allama Iqbal's nationalistic song, 'Saaray jahan se achha Hindustan hamara' sung by Pran Nath Jalali. On behalf of the NC, Jialal Kilam welcomed the guest. Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah led Jinnah to the stage. Abdullah introduced him to them and spoke of people's love and regard for Jinnah which, he said, was amply demonstrated by the public meeting. Hinting at his opposition to Jinnah's political ideology, he said that he would not like to raise debatable issues here. However, he took pains in making the point that the grand reception for the visiting guest was arranged by his National Conference.

In his speech, Jinnah thanked the people of Kashmir for according him a majestic welcome and said that he would never forget their love and warmth for him. He laid stress on communal amity and prayed for their welfare. He sought to refute Abdullah's claim by saying that the honour shown to him by the people of Kashmir was because of his being the President of the All India Muslim League, and asked the Muslims of Kashmir to close their ranks, recalling that ""We have one God, One Prophet, one Quran and one Ka'ba. Let us have one organisation, one platform, one flag and one leader"". At this point, Kilam left the venue in a huff.

For Abdullah, the Pratap Park reception did not have the desired effect. Adding to his discomfiture was the advice that Jinnah gave to him. He asked him to lead the Muslim Conference instead of the National Conference, reminding that he had started his movement for the protection of rights of the Muslims and his support base also comprised only Muslims. He assured him that he would ask Chowdhary Ghulam Abbas to return to his legal profession and the Mirwaiz to religious preaching, and urge them to leave politics. Recalling his personal experiences with the Congress, Jinnah told Abdullah that he had quit that party after seeing double face of its leaders. The Congress, he cautioned him, will ""deceive you after its interests are met and you will repent one day."" The speech and advice of Jinnah were not to make any impact on Abdullah other than making him bitter.

During his stay in Kashmir, Jinnah first stayed in a bungalow at Ishbar, Nishat. It was in this house that NC President, Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah and leaders of the Muslim Conference, Chowdhary Ghulam Abbas, Mirwaiz Muhammad Yusuf Shah and Allah Rakha Sagar, separately met Jinnah. Abdullah had a long meeting with him on 13 May which began at 5.45 p.m. and lasted till 8 p.m. On the conclusion of the meeting, Jinnah took Abdullah to the garage to show his car which was giving some trouble. Abdullah promised to send someone to inspect the vehicle and a mechanic did actually arrive while the Muslim Conference delegation was still there. About the Jinnah-Abdullah meeting, the official organ of the National Conference, daily Khidmat, reported that no third person was present and neither of the two leaders disclosed the details of their deliberations. Later, when asked what transpired between him and Jinnah, Abdullah replied, ""It was a normal discussion on current situation which could have no relation with speculations in the media."" On 5 June, National Conference leaders, Mohammad Sayeed Masoodi and Khawaja Ghulam Mohi ud Din also met Jinnah.

On 1 July, Jinnah shifted to the State Guest House No. 4 where he moved in at the invitation of the Prime Minister, B. N. Rau. However, he curtailed his stay there as no minister paid a courtesy call on him. Hari Singh was in Europe as Member of the Imperial War Council but when he returned on 23 July, six days before Jinnah was scheduled to leave, the Maharaja turned down his request for a meeting on the pretext that he had other commitments and his time was fully taken for the next few days. The Jinnah siblings then shifted to a houseboat, Queen Elizabeth, on the Jhelum at Lal Mandi.

Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah claims that Jinnah took shelter in the houseboat as a state guest after a public reaction against him that the former generated by responding to his Pratap Park speech and ""exposing his arguments on Pakistan's usefulness for the Muslims."" That, however, is not true. Jinnah had shifted from the Nishat house to the State Guest House on the invitation of the Prime Minister but immediately moved out of it when he felt due courtesy was not extended to him. At the Guest House, he told K. H. Khurshid whom he later picked as his private secretary, that although he was a guest of the State his hosts seemed afraid to see him. Khurshid recalls: ""Rau invited him to dinner at his residence and once the formality of the meal was over, Mr. Jinnah noticed Rau looking ill at ease. Why are they afraid? he asked me."" Chowdhary Ghulam Abbas, who accompanied Jinnah from Jammu and met him every second or third day at Srinagar and accompanied him on his return journey, corroborates Khurshid's account.

In Srinagar, Jinnah attended a reception hosted in his honour by the Aligarh Old Boys' Association. He met several deputations of political workers, students, religious leaders, journalists and representatives of the minorities. His engagements in the city included a speech, on 17 June, at the historic Jama Masjid. The function was held to observe the Annual Day of the Muslim Conference and the venue was jam-packed with people. Some suggest the number as one lakh. He was warmly greeted by people and his address began at 10 p.m. only after it took a while for the organizers to quieten the cheering crowd. Muhammad Yusuf Saraf claims that Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah, with his two close aides, watched the proceedings from a nearby house of one of his party supporters. In his speech, Jinnah thanked the people for ""the honour accorded to me"" and felt confident that Kashmiris had now awakened under the banner of the Muslim Conference. He said that during his stay in Srinagar he met all sections of the people and from them came to know about their problems and hardship. On the basis of what transpired between him and the people who called on him, he observed that ""99% Kashmiris supported the Muslim Conference while there were some who felt that they should join the National Conference."" He said that he had not come to Kashmir to support or oppose one against the other group. ""It is my duty as a Muslim to advise you correctly as to which course would be proper and ensure your success"", he told the gathering. He said that if the doors of the National Conference were kept open for six years for the non-Muslims and yet they have, as a whole, kept aloof from the party it would be a mistake to keep these doors open again. This, he warned, would divide the Muslims in two camps of the Muslim Conference and the National Conference and bring about tension between them.

He reminded the leadership of the party that Hindus and Sikhs, unlike the Muslim majority of the State, do not demand Responsible Government from the Maharaja. He said it would be a matter of happiness for him if they wanted such a Government. He emphasized that the Responsible Government was not a cake that the Maharaja would present to them and that its attainment required organising ""your nation"" and improvement in ""the educational, economic and social conditions of the Muslims."" There was only one way to do this, he said ""and that is unity, solidarity, a single flag, a single platform and an ideal. If you are able to achieve them, you must succeed.""

On 28 May, Jinnah attended a garden party at the Amar Singh Club, Sonawar, arranged by a famous Kashmiri jeweler, Khawaja G. Ahmad Joo.

The Kashmir Government had kept a close watch on people meeting Jinnah. The visitors included government officials against whom C. I. D diary was sent to the Administration. Among such persons were Aga Muzaffar, Assistant Superintendent of Police, Mr. Agha, Registrar Cooperatives Department and M. A. Sheikh of Accounts Department. Begum Zafar Ali, Head Mistress, Government Girls High School who later rose to become a prominent social activist of Kashmir, was also reported against for meeting with Fatima Jinnah on 15 June.

At Srinagar, Jinnah received a letter from Gandhi which Khurshid, as one of his first assignments as Jinnah's private secretary, was tasked to translate into English. The letter led to Jinnah-Gandhi talks in September 1944. Gandhi, after he had been released from jail on 6 May 1944 due to illness, had offered to meet Jinnah who proposed a meeting at his Bombay house on his return.

Jinnah was still in Kashmir when his close aide and confidante, Liaquat Ali Khan accompanied by his wife, Rana Liaquat Ali, also arrived in the Valley. The couple joined the Jinnah's and together they visited some tourist places also. They were seen walking on the Bund near the General Post Office one afternoon while Khan was carrying a fly-whisk. In K. H. Khurshid's Memories of Jinnah, there is a photograph in which besides Jinnah, Rana and Liauqat, is seen a young and pretty girl. The caption of the photograph reads: ""The Quaid - a rare moment of relaxation in Kashmir with his daughter, Dina and Nawabzada and Begum Liaquat Ali Khan."" Jinnah is seen in a semi reclining position with his left cheek rested on the right shoulder of his daughter. What is significant about the picture is that it shows that Dina had accompanied Jinnah on his last visit to Kashmir which fact, otherwise, is not known.

The Quaid-e-Azam also had a meeting with Sayyid Jamaat Ali Shah, a Muslim spiritual personality reverentially called as Amir-i-Millat (Leader of the Faithful), while both were in Kashmir.

On his return via the Jhelum Valley Road on 25 July, Jinnah addressed a public meeting at Baramulla which was disrupted by a group of National Conference workers led by Mohammad Maqbool Sherwani. In his speech, Jinnah asked people to unite under one banner to see their misery coming to an end. As the Muslim Conference supporters were raising pro-Jinnah and pro-Muslim Conference slogans, Sherwani, who had sneaked into the public meeting along with some of his supporters, started raising pro-Sheikh Abdullah and pro-National Conference slogans which led to commotion and disruption of the public meeting. The disruption was a deliberate attempt by the National Conference after the party had failed to win over Jinnah's support during his stay at Srinagar. It was also meant to show him that Abdullah alone was the leader in Kashmir. In the scuffle between the supporters of the two parties, Inayat Ullah Kakroo of the Muslim Conference was injured while Sant Singh Taigh of the National Conference was beaten up. In the evening, the Muslim Conference supporters chased Sherwani who, in order to save himself, jumped into the River Jhelum and swam across to safety. Jinnah also addressed people at Uri and Muzaffarabd.

Sadly for Muhammad Ali Jinnah, his two and a half month long stay in Kashmir failed to bring about reconciliation between the National Conference and the Muslim Conference, the two ideologically opposite political parties of Jammu and Kashmir. The reason was rigidity on either side. While Jinnah was spearheading a movement for a separate country for Muslims of the subcontinent and could not be expected to support a different stand for the Muslim majority Kashmir, Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah had mentally thrown his lot with Jawaharalal Nehru and his politics much before the events of 1947 unfolded.

The Kashmir visit of 1944 was very tiring for Jinnah during which he remained awfully busy. On 22 August, after an exhausting tour, he wrote to a friend, ""I broke down because of the crushing, gushing affection of the people, from the day I started from Srinagar. I had to pay the penalty for having satisfied them to the utmost of my capacity. But I am glad to tell you that I am almost all right and will soon be able to resume my work.""

Jinnah's desire to again visit Kashmir in 1947 was not met with favourable response from the Kashmir Government. On the eve of the Partition, while several prominent politicians of India including Mahatma Gandhi, Acharya Kriplani, then President Indian National Congress and Sikh rulers of Kapurthala, Faridkot and Patiala states visited Maharaja Hari Singh, Jinnah's wish to visit Kashmir was turned down by the latter. In the words of Chaudhri Muhammad Ali, ""The Quaid-e-Azam himself wanted to go to Kashmir about the middle of September; he hoped to have a friendly talk with the Maharaja, but the Maharaja did not want him to come."" From August, the situation in Kashmir changed fast. On Gandhi's intervention, Prime Minister Ram Chander Kak, a votary of an independent Kashmir, had been removed and a pro- India Mehar Chand Mahajan was in his seat. After the Partition, as the situation in Kashmir was fluid with Hari Singh still being undecided about the accession of Jammu & Kashmir with either of the two newly created States, Jinnah asked his military secretary, Colonel William Birnie, to go to Kashmir and arrange for him to spend a couple of weeks there. Birnie returned after five days to convey that the ruler of Kashmir did not agree to his visit. ""The turn of events in Kashmir had an adverse effect on the Quaid-e-Azam's health. At the time of Partition he had been confident of Kashmir's accession to Pakistan because of its Muslim population and geographical situation...Now he felt deceived, and his earlier optimism gave way to a deep disappointment"", writes Ali. One of his close aides quoted him saying, ""We have been put on the wrong bus.""

The last year of Muhammad Ali Jinnah's life was ""saddened by his despair over the fate of Kashmir"". Till his demise on 11 September 1948, Kashmir emotionally remained nearest to his heart. On his first death anniversary in September 1949, Fatima Jinnah in her broadcast from Radio Pakistan told her countrymen that ""the question of Kashmir was nearest to the Quaid-e-Azam's heart during the last few days of his life. The only news which interested him whether on the Radio or in the papers was regarding Kashmir, he always felt very unhappy that this problem was being delayed."" Next year, on the same occasion, Fatima Jinnah said that the ""Quaid-e-Azam died with Kashmir as his constant care."""

You don't know whether to be disappointed in yourself, or chuffed. But you certainly know the symptoms intimately.

It's the point in time that comes with the realisation you've reached the point where you don't know whether to be disappointed in yourself or impressed by such determination. Your belly feels like a piñata which, if whacked, would see some kind of devil spawn come running out. Scientists, however, will label this as 'severe bloating'. There are also the symptoms of lethargy, nausea, stomach upset and a general feeling of self-loathing.

Ideally, you'd retire to your bedroom to slumber while the effects of your gluttony wear off. But it's the holiday season and while your friends and family may all be vying for your attention and your time, no one feels like carrying your limp body around all night.

To help you relish the festive season and its allure of overindulgence, we've found the best cures that work, and the ones that don't, to help you combat the food hangover without relying on days of bed rest or a fistful of antacids.

What causes a food coma?

The term 'food coma' has become so popular that in 2014, it was added to the Oxford dictionary. But despite its prevalence in English lexicon, there are some misconceptions concerning the science behind what causes it.

According to David McCulloch, form Group health Cooperative, when you take a bit of food, it's broken down in your stomach and then your blood sugar level rises, triggering your pancreas to start producing insulin.

""Insulin travels through the blood to your body's cells. It tells the cells to open up and let glucose in,"" McCulloch explains. ""Once inside, the cells convert glucose into energy or store it to use later.""

While this process is underway, the increased insulin levels in our bloodstreams allow a chemical called tryptophan - the same substance inside turkey that people often incorrectly cite as making them sleepy - to reach our brains, creating serotonin. This chemical tends to make us sleepy.

The food coma really becomes a problem when we've been gorging on foods with a high glycaemic index. These include carbohydrates like bread and pasta and, as we all know, they're delicious and tend to be a staple on the Holiday Feast menu. But however tasty they are, these foods cause a spike in blood sugar levels that our pancreas can't catch up with. This means that an insane amount of insulin is created, which in turn causes a bunch of serotonin and tryptophan to be produced, too.

Basically, a food hangover isn't about the amount you eat but caused instead by what you eat. If you eat a lot of bread with a heavy meal, you'll likely enter a food coma. But if it's mainly low-carb foods like meats and fish, the food coma might not strike. Whilst the cure bellows are proven to fight a food coma, the best way to avoid one is to pick the right foods to feast on.

Chewing Gum

Yep, we're going back to the high school classic - gum. Though you're most likely going to have to wait out the food coma, Jennifer Stack, assistant professor of nutrition at the Culinary Institution of America, suggests chewing gum can help.

""It stimulates saliva, which stimulates the stomach acid and helps move the stomach contents to the small intestine - though it'll take a while,"" says Stack.

Get Walking

We wouldn't recommend hitting the high-intensity workout straight after your big meal, but some light exercise after a meal can help eliminate some of the blood sugar coursing through your body. This will allow your pancreas to adjust and save you the feeling of drowsiness.

Stack recommends taking a walk. ""It doesn't burn off calories but, compared to lying or sitting down, might prompt the digestive tract to keep food moving. And since you're upright, it limits the chance of acid reflux.""

Hydrate

If salt was your poison, then you need to be sipping on the water bottle more frequently than Adam Sandler in The Water Boy.

""We need plenty of water to excrete the excess sodium,"" says Stack. ""And a glass of water or fluid can help dilute the stomach acid, which is a preventative way to avoid acid reflux or acid burn.""

If you've overindulged in salt, also aim to eat high-fibre foods like vegetables. These will work to absorb water and get your digestive engines running smoothly again.

Avoid the booze

The festive season is synonymous with drinks, but stay away from alcohol if you want to beat the food hangover, particularly after eating processed foods. The alcohol will only dehydrate you further and the pairing of booze with salty junk food is basically like signing your own death warrant: it's just going to aggravate your food coma.

That said, even after the most extraordinarily salty dinner, you will survive. ""There will be some people with a hypertensive attack - the blood pressure goes up, and it's potentially dangerous if there's a weak artery that could burst or cause an aneurysm - but it should pretty much ameliorate after a couple hours,"" says David Levitsky, a professor of nutrition and psychology at Cornell University.

Put the cookie down

The sugar hangover doesn't come on slowly. This is a one-two-knockout punch and the effects are felt immediately. The more common symptoms are a surge of energy, followed by the so-called sugar crash shortly afterward.

The sugar rush is characterised by a rise in blood-glucose level. Your pancreas responds by pumping out insulin, which lowers your blood-glucose level and causes your body to produce too much insulin. That's when the sugar rush becomes a sugar low.

When this happens, opt for protein and a little bit of fat with that sugar to slow down digestion with it. Then make sure your next meal or snack is more balanced, with a slower-reacting carb, like a whole-grain starch.

Ditch the espresso

If you feel yourself to be on the verge of a food coma, don't indulge in an after-dinner coffee as it will only make matters worse. Caffeine lowers esophageal-sphincter pressure which translates to you becoming a hot mess, albeit a bloated, lethargic one.

Trust time

If you can't pinpoint if yours is a sugar, salt or caffeine-related food hangover, chances are you're like the rest of us and simply gorged yourself to the precipice of the self-hating glutton. Look, it's the festive season and these things not only happen, but are deserved. After all, who amongst us really has the means or the desire to resist a third mince pie? Or a third plate of ham and turkey with all the trimmings? Isn't the Christmas overindulgence the sole reason New Year's resolutions exist?

In this instance, your best option is to wait it out. ""Time is the greatest healer we have,"" Levitsky says. ""The G.I. tract will take care of everything. It will absorb all those nutrients, which will be deposited on your body, but you can just eat less for the next week or two. No irreconcilable harm done, even by gorging.""

Hear that, ladies and gents? The food coma is real, sure, but you'll survive.

8 food supplement myths that are probably ruining your health

It is early morning in early summer, and I am tracing my way through the woods of central North Carolina, steering cautiously around S-curves and braking hard when what looks like a small rise turns into a narrow bridge. I am on my way to meet Tami McGraw, who lives with her husband and the youngest of their kids in a sprawling development of old trees and wide lawns just south of Chapel Hill. Before I reach her, McGraw emails. She wants to feed me when I get there:

""Would you like to try emu?"" she asks. ""Or perhaps some duck?""

These are not normal breakfast offerings. But for years, nothing about McGraw's life has been normal. She cannot eat beef or pork, or drink milk or eat cheese or snack on a gelatine-containing dessert without feeling her throat close and her blood pressure drop. Wearing a wool sweater raises hives on her skin; inhaling the fumes of bacon sizzling on a stove will knock her to the ground. Everywhere she goes, she carries an array of tablets that can beat back an allergy attack, and an auto-injecting EpiPen that can jolt her system out of anaphylactic shock.

McGraw is allergic to the meat of mammals and everything else that comes from them: dairy products, wool and fibre, gelatine from their hooves, char from their bones. This syndrome affects some thousands of people in the USA and an uncertain but likely larger number worldwide, and after a decade of research, scientists have begun to understand what causes it. It is created by the bite of a tick, picked up on a hike or brushed against in a garden, or hitchhiking on the fur of a pet that was roaming outside.

The illness, which generally goes by the name 'alpha-gal allergy' after the component of meat that triggers it, is a trial that McGraw and her family are still learning to cope with. In much the same way, medicine is grappling with it too. Allergies occur when our immune systems perceive something that ought to be familiar as foreign. For scientists, alpha-gal is forcing a remapping of basic tenets of immunology: how allergies occur, how they are triggered, whom they put in danger and when.

For those affected, alpha-gal is transforming the landscapes they live in, turning the reliable comforts of home ­- the plants in their gardens, the food on their plates - into an uncertain terrain of risk.

In 1987, Dr Sheryl van Nunen was confronted with a puzzle. She was the head of the allergy department at a regional hospital in the suburbs of Sydney, Australia, and had a reputation among her colleagues for sorting out mysterious episodes of anaphylaxis. This time, a man had been sent to see her who kept waking up, in the middle of the night, in the grip of some profound reaction.

Van Nunen knew at once that this was out of the ordinary, since most allergic reactions happen quickly after exposure instead of hours later. She also knew that only a few allergens affect people after they have gone to bed. (Latex, for instance - someone sensitive to it who has sex using a latex condom might fall asleep and wake up in the midst of an allergy attack.) She checked the man for the obvious irritants and, when those tests came up negative, took a thorough look at his medical history and did a skin test for everything he had eaten and touched in the hours before bedtime. The only potential allergen that returned a positive result was meat.

This was weird (and dismaying, in barbecue-loving Australia). But it was the only such case Van Nunen had ever seen. She coached the patient on how to avoid the meals that seemed to be triggering his reactions, put it down mentally to the unpredictability of the human immune system, and moved on.

Then a few more such patients came her way. There were six additional ones across the 1990s; by 2003, she had seen at least 70, all with the same problem, all apparently affected by meat they had eaten a few hours before. Groping for an explanation, she lengthened the list of questions she asked, quizzing the patients about whether they or their families had ever reacted to anything else: detergents, fabrics, plants in their gardens, insects on the plants.

""And invariably, these people would say to me: 'I haven't been bitten by a bee or a wasp, but I've had lots of tick bites,"" Van Nunen recalls.

In her memory, Tami McGraw's symptoms began after 2010. That was the year she and her husband Tom, a retired surgeon, spied a housing bargain in North Carolina, a development next to a nature reserve whose builder had priced the big houses to sell. The leafy spread of streams and woodland pockets was everything she wanted in a home. She didn't realise that it offered everything that deer and birds and rodents, the main hosts of ticks, want as well.

She remembers one tick that attached to her scalp, raising such a welt the spot was red for months afterwards, and a swarm of baby ticks that climbed her legs and had to be scrubbed off in a hot bath laced with bleach. Unpredictably, at odd intervals, she began to get dizzy and sick.

""I'd have unexplained allergic reactions, and I'd break out in hives and my blood pressure would go crazy,"" she told me. The necklines of all her T-shirts were stretched, because she tugged at them to relieve the feeling she couldn't take a deep breath. She trekked to an array of doctors who diagnosed her with asthma or early menopause or a tumour on her pituitary gland. They prescribed antibiotics and inhalers and steroids. They sent her for MRI scans, pulmonary function tests, echocardiograms of her heart. Nothing yielded a result.

Looking back, she realises she missed clues as to the source of her problem. She always seemed to need to use an asthma inhaler on Wednesdays - the day she spent hours in her car, delivering steaming-hot dinners for Meals on Wheels. She would feel short of breath, and need to visit an urgent-care clinic, on Saturdays - which always started, in her household, with a big breakfast of eggs and sausages.

Then a close friend had a scary episode, going for a run, arriving home and passing out on the hot concrete of her driveway. Once she was recovered, McGraw quizzed her. Her friend said: ""They thought I got stung by a bee while I was running. But now they think maybe I have a red-meat allergy.""

McGraw remembers her first reaction was: That's crazy. Her second was: Maybe I have that too.

She Googled, and then she asked her doctor to order a little-known blood test that would show if her immune system was reacting to a component of mammal meat. The test result was so strongly positive, her doctor called her at home to tell her to step away from the stove.

That should have been the end of her problems. Instead it launched her on an odyssey of discovering just how much mammal material is present in everyday life. One time, she took capsules of liquid painkiller and woke up in the middle of the night, itching and covered in hives provoked by the drug's gelatine covering.

When she bought an unfamiliar lip balm, the lanolin in it made her mouth peel and blister. She planned to spend an afternoon gardening, spreading fertiliser and planting flowers, but passed out on the grass and had to be revived with an EpiPen. She had reacted to manure and bone meal that were enrichments in bagged compost she had bought.

She struggled with the attacks' unpredictability, and even more with the impact on her family. ""I think I'm getting better, and then I realise I'm not,"" she says. ""I'm more knowledgeable about what I can and can't do.""

The discovery of new diseases often follows a pattern. Scattered patients realise they are experiencing strange symptoms. They find each other, face to face in a neighbourhood or across the world on the internet. They bring their experience to medicine, and medicine is sceptical. And then, after some period of pain and recalcitrance, medicine admits that, in fact, the patients were right.

That is the story of the discovery of CFS/ME and Lyme disease, among others. But it is not the story of alpha-gal allergy. An odd set of coincidences brought the bizarre illness to the attention of researchers almost as soon as it occurred.

The story begins with a cancer drug called cetuximab, which came onto the market in 2004. Cetuximab is a protein grown in cells taken from mice. For any new drug, there are likely to be a few people that react badly to it, and that was true for cetuximab. In its earliest trials, one or two of every 100 cancer patients who got it infused into their veins had a hypersensitivity reaction: their blood pressure dropped and they had difficulty breathing.

That 1-2 per cent stayed consistent as cetuximab was given to larger and larger groups. And then there was an aberration. In clinics in North Carolina and Tennessee, 25 of 88 recipients were hypersensitive to the drug, with some so sick they needed emergency shots of epinephrine and hospitalisation. At about the same time, a patient who was receiving a first dose of cetuximab in a cancer clinic in Bentonville, Arkansas, collapsed and died.

The manufacturers, ImClone and Bristol-Myers Squibb, checked every obvious thing about the trial: the drug's ingredients, the cleanliness of the manufacturing plants, even the practices at the medical centres where cetuximab had been administered. Nothing stood out. The most that researchers could guess at the time was that the unlucky recipients might have some kind of mouse allergy.

Then the first coincidence occurred: a nurse whose husband worked at the Bentonville clinic mentioned the death to Dr Tina Hatley, an immunologist in private practice in Bentonville. Hatley had recently finished postgraduate training at the University of Virginia's allergy centre, and she mentioned the death to her former supervisor, Dr Thomas Platts-Mills.

The bad responses to the drug looked like allergic reactions, and they were common enough - and far enough from the manufacturer's expectations - to be an intriguing research opportunity.

Platts-Mills pulled together a team, looping in Hatley and several current research fellows as well. Fairly quickly, they discovered the source of the problem. People were reacting to the drug because they had a pre-existing sensitivity, indicated by a high level of antibodies (called immunoglobulin E, or IgE for short) to a sugar that is present in the muscles of most mammals, though not in humans or other primates. The name of the sugar was galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose, known for short as alpha-gal.

Alpha-gal is familiar to many scientists because it is responsible for an enduring disappointment: its ability to trigger intense immune reactions is the reason that organs taken from animals have never successfully been transplanted into people. The puzzle was why the drug recipients were reacting to it. To have an allergic reaction, someone needs to have been primed with a prior exposure to a substance - but the trial recipients who reacted badly were all on their first dose of cetuximab.

Team members scrutinised the patients and their families for anything that could explain the problem. The reactions appeared regional - patients in Arkansas and North Carolina and Tennessee experienced the hypersensitivity, but ones in Boston and northern California did not. They investigated parasites, moulds and diseases that occur only in pockets of the USA.

Then Dr Christine Chung, a Nashville researcher recruited to the team, stumbled on an intriguing clue. Almost one in five of the patients enrolled at a cancer clinic at her hospital had high levels of IgE to alpha-gal. But when she checked those patients' near neighbours, treating them as a control group - that is, people who lived their lives in the same way, but did not have cancer and had no reason to have received the drug - almost one in five had antibodies to alpha-gal as well.

Almost a decade later, that correlation still makes Platts-Mills chuckle. The alpha-gal reaction ""had nothing to do with cancer,"" he says. ""It had everything to do with rural Tennessee.""

The question then became: what in rural Tennessee could trigger a reaction like this? The answer arose from a second coincidence. Dr Jacob Hosen, a researcher in Platts-Mills's lab, stumbled across a map drawn by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showing the prevalence of an infection called Rocky Mountain spotted fever. It exactly overlapped the hot spots where the cetuximab reactions had occurred.

Rocky Mountain spotted fever is transmitted by the bite of a tick: Amblyomma americanum, one of the most common ticks in south-eastern USA. It's known as the lone star tick for a blotch of white on the back of the female's body.

The researchers wondered - if the mystery reactions shared a footprint with a disease, and ticks caused the disease, could ticks be linked to the reactions too?

It was an intriguing hypothesis, and was reinforced by a new set of patients who came trickling into Platts-Mills's clinic at about the same time. They were all adults, and that was odd to start with, because allergies tend to show up in childhood. They had never had an allergic reaction before, but now they were experiencing allergy symptoms: swelling, hives and in the worst cases anaphylactic shock. They too had high levels of IgE antibodies to alpha-gal.

None of them, though, were cancer patients. They told the physicians that they had no proof of what was causing their reactions - but more than a few of them sensed it had something to do with eating meat.

Dr Scott Commins, another postgraduate fellow in Platts-Mills's group, took it upon himself to phone every new patient to ask whether they'd ever suffered a tick bite. ""I think 94.6 per cent of them answered affirmatively,"" he says. ""And the other few per cent would say, 'You know, I'm outdoors all the time. I can't remember an actual tick that was attached, but I know I'd get bites.'""

Meat from mammals inevitably contains alpha-gal - so in already sensitised individuals, eating meat might constitute a second exposure, in the same way infusing cetuximab had been.

If tick bites had sensitised them, then the alpha-gal reaction might be a food allergy as well as a drug reaction. But the connection was speculative, and cementing cause and effect would take one final, extraordinary coincidence.

As it happens, Platts-Mills likes to hike. One weekend he took off across the central Virginia hills, tramping through grassy underbrush. He came home five hours later, peeled off his boots and socks, and discovered his legs and feet were speckled with tiny dots. They looked like ground pepper, but they were dug into his skin - he had to use a dull knife to scrape them off - and they itched something fierce. He saved a few, and sent them to an entomologist. They were the larval form of lone star ticks.

This, he realised, was an opportunity. As soon as the work week started, he had his lab team draw his blood and check his IgE levels. They were low to start with, and then week by week began to climb. Platts-Mills is English - his father was a Member of Parliament - and in the midst of having his IgE tracked, he went to an event at the Royal Society of Medicine in London. ""And at that point,"" he says cheerfully, ""I ate two lamb chops and drank two glasses of wine.""

In the middle of the night, he woke up covered in hives.

The lone star tick doesn't receive much attention in the USA. It's the black-legged tick, Ixodes scapularis, that has the dubious honour of being the most well-known, as it's the carrier of Lyme disease, which causes an estimated 300,000 cases of illness in the USA each year.

The lone star tick doesn't transmit Lyme disease, but is the vector for other serious illnesses, including Q fever, ehrlichiosis, Heartland virus, Bourbon virus and tularaemia, an infection so serious that the US government classifies the bacteria that cause it as a potential agent of bioterrorism.

While Lyme clusters in the north-east and the northern Midwest, the diseases carried by Amblyomma stretch from the coast of Maine to the tip of Florida, the Atlantic to the middle of Texas, and the southern shores of the Great Lakes all the way to the Mexican border.

And that range appears to be expanding. ""The northern edge of where these ticks are abundant is moving,"" says Dr Rick Ostfeld, a disease ecologist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, north of New York City. ""It is now well-established further north, into Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York and well up into New England.

""Climate change is likely playing a role in the northward expansion,"" Ostfeld adds, but acknowledges that we don't know what else could also be contributing.

It's a universal complaint among tick scientists that we don't know as much about ticks as we should. Tick-transmitted illnesses are more common in the USA than mosquito-borne ones - according to the CDC's most recent accounting, in 2017 tickborne diseases were 2.6 times more common than when the agency began counting in 2004 - yet it's mosquitoes that receive the most public health attention and funding, from national surveillance programmes to local mosquito-control campaigns. (In fact, the CDC was founded in 1942 because of mosquito-borne disease; its original title was the Office of Malaria Control in War Areas.)

What is known about where ticks live, what they feed on, and how they are affected by changes in land use and climate has mostly been assembled out of the findings of scientists fighting for scarce research funding.

It's impossible to talk to physicians encountering alpha-gal cases without hearing that something has changed to make the tick that transmits it more common - even though they don't know what that something might be.

The lone star tick is a sturdy, stealthy predator. It isn't picky about conditions - it tolerates the damp of Atlantic beaches, and its western expansion only stopped when it ran up against the Texas desert - and it's content to feed from dozens of animals, from mice all the way up the tree of life.

It loves birds, which might have helped it move north so rapidly, and it has a special lust for the white-tailed deer that have colonised American suburbs. And, unlike most ticks, it bites humans in all three stages of its lifecycle: as an adult, as a nymph and as the poppy seed-sized larvae that attacked Platt-Mills, which linger on grass stalks in clusters and spring off hundreds at a time.

Ticks detect scent with organs embedded in their first pair of legs, and what they're sniffing for is carbon dioxide, the exhaled breath of an animal full of warm oxygenated blood. When lone star ticks catch wind of it, they take off. ""The Lyme disease tick is a slow tick,"" says Dr William Nicholson, a microbiologist at the CDC. ""Amblyomma will run to you.""

There has been so little research into alpha-gal allergy that scientists can't agree on exactly what stage of the bite starts victims' sensitisation. It is possible that a fragment of a previous blood meal, from a mouse, bird or deer, lingers in a tick's guts and works its way up through its mouth and into its human victim. It's also possible that some still-unidentified compound in tick saliva is chemically close enough to alpha-gal to produce the same effect.

One aspect of its epidemiology is becoming clear, though. The allergy isn't only caused by the lone star tick.

In Australia, Van Nunen (who is now a clinical associate professor at the University of Sydney School of Medicine) couldn't understand how her patients' tick bites solved the mystery of their meat allergy. But she could see something else. The beaches that fringe the coast north and south of Sydney are rife with ticks. If bites from them were putting people at risk of a profound allergy, she felt compelled to get the word out.

In 2007, Van Nunen wrote up a description of 25 meat-allergic patients whose reactions she had confirmed with a skin-prick test. All but two had had severe skin reactions to a tick bite; more than half had suffered severe anaphylaxis. That abstract formed the basis of a talk she gave later that year to an Australian medical association, which was then indexed - but not published in full - in an Australian medical journal. It took until 2009 for the Virginia group to catch up to it, after they had already published their first alert.

That was unfortunate, because the crucial detail in Van Nunen's research wasn't just that her cases were earlier than the first round of American ones. It was that they were caused by bites from a different tick: Ixodes holocyclus, called the paralysis tick. Alpha-gal allergy was not just an odd occurrence in one part of the USA. It had occurred in the opposite hemisphere, making it literally a global problem.

And so it has proved. Alpha-gal reactions linked to tick bites have now been found in the UK, France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Japan, South Korea, Sweden, Norway, Panama, Brazil, Côte d'Ivoire and South Africa. These cases trace back to at least six additional tick species. (An online map on which patients list themselves includes over a dozen more countries.)

Wherever ticks bite people - everywhere other than the Arctic and Antarctic - alpha-gal allergy has been recorded. In Belgium, patients reacted badly to a drug produced in rabbit cells. In the Italian Alps, men who went hunting in the forests were more at risk than women who stayed in their village. In Germany, the most reactive food was a traditional delicacy, pork kidneys. In Sweden, it was moose.

Van Nunen herself has now seen more than 1,200 patients. ""The next busiest clinic, about 350,"" she says. Those cases have all occurred in two decades, less than the span of a single human generation. As in America, the surge leaves Van Nunen mystified as to what the cause might be. She reasons that the rise cannot be due to something in her patients; neither genetic nor epigenetic change could occur so quickly.

""It has to be environmental,"" she says.

It's a sunny early morning at the University of North Carolina Medical Center in Chapel Hill. Commins, who moved here in 2016 to become an associate professor, has 11 patients to see before the end of the day. Seven of them have alpha-gal allergy.

Laura Stirling, 51, is fretting over a list of questions. She does not live nearby; she flew down from Maryland, drawn by Commins's reputation. In 2016, she found a fat lone star tick attached to her, and afterwards had fierce indigestion whenever she ate or smelled pork - a challenge, because her husband likes to tinker with a smoker on weekends. In 2017, she was bitten again, and her symptoms worsened to midnight hives and lightheadedness that sent her to her doctor's office. She immediately cut all meat and dairy from her diet. A year later, she wants to know if she can add anything back.

""Can I eat dairy?"" she asks. ""Can I cook dairy? Can I eat it if it doesn't have animal rennet in it?"" She pauses. ""I've been symptom-free, because I don't take risks.""

Commins walks her through a protocol he's developed, a method for adding back mammal products one dose at a time. He has a hypothesis that alpha-gal reactions are linked to the fat content of food; that might explain why they take so many hours to occur, because the body processes fat via a slower metabolic pathway than protein or carbs.

He recommends that patients start with a spoonful of grated dry cheese, because its fat content is low, and graduate by slow steps up to full-fat yogurt and milk and then to ice cream. If those foods don't provoke reactions, he suggests tiny doses of lean meat, starting with deli ham.

Stirling lights up at that. ""I dream of charcuterie,"" she sighs.

Because Commins was part of Platt-Mills's earliest research, he has been seeing alpha-gal patients for more than a decade now. He estimates he has treated more than 900 men and women; five new patients arrive every week. He has coached a significant number of them back to eating some mammal products and managing their exposures to the things they can't handle, so their worst experience is hunting for an emergency Benadryl, not being rushed to the ER.

Not every patient can do this. Julie LeSueur, who is 45 and lives in Richmond, Virginia, has been monitored by Platts-Mills for four years. (He is one of several doctors she has seen for the condition, after years of severe stomach issues escalated to repeated attacks of anaphylaxis that put her in hospital. One physician, frustrated she wasn't getting better, told her: ""This is all in your head."")

What started as an allergy to meat expanded into reactions to anything with an animal connection, including gelatine in medications and animal products in cosmetics, and then to sensitising her immune system to an array of other irritants, from nuts to mould. She buys vegan soap and shampoo, has prescriptions formulated by a compounding pharmacy, and mostly works from home to avoid unintended exposures. Reluctantly, she cut back a hobby that meant the world to her: fostering animals that have been rescued from abuse.

""I'm at home all the time now,"" she tells me by phone. ""I'm lucky to get off the couch.""

Commins and Platts-Mills named alpha-gal allergy a decade ago, and Van Nunen saw her first patient 20 years before that. A lab test for the allergy, the one that Tami McGraw received, has been on the market since 2010. (Platts-Mills and Tina Hatley, now Merritt, share the patent.) That makes it hard to understand why patients still struggle to be diagnosed and understand the limits of what they can eat or allow themselves to be exposed to. But alpha-gal allergy defies some of the bedrock tenets of immunology.

Food allergies are overwhelmingly caused by proteins, tend to surface in childhood and usually trigger symptoms quickly after a food is consumed. Alpha-gal is a sugar; alpha-gal patients tolerate meat for years before their reactions begin; and alpha-gal reactions take hours to occur. Plus, the range of reactions is far beyond what's normal: not only skin reactions in mild cases and anaphylaxis in the most serious, but piercing stomach pain, abdominal cramps and diarrhoea as well.

But alpha-gal reactions are definitely an allergy, given patients' results on the same skin and IgE tests that immunologists use to determine allergies to other foods. That leads both Van Nunen and Commins to wonder whether the syndrome will help to reshape allergy science, broadening the understanding of what constitutes an allergy response and leading to new concepts of how allergies are triggered.

Merritt, who estimates she has seen more than 500 patients with alpha-gal allergy, has it herself; she has had bad reactions to meat all her life, since being bitten by seed ticks at Girl Scout camp, and was re-sensitised by a lone star tick bite last year. She is sensitive enough to react not only to meat, but to other products derived from mammal tissues - and as she has discovered, they are threaded throughout modern life.

The unrecognised dangers aren't only sweaters and soaps and face creams. Medical products with an animal origin include the clotting drug heparin, derived from pork intestines and cow lung; pancreatic enzymes and thyroid supplements; medicines that include magnesium stearate as an inert filler; vaccines grown in certain cell lines; and other vaccines, and intravenous fluids, that contain gelatine.

""We have enormous difficulty advising people about this,"" Van Nunen says. ""Sometimes you have to sit down for seven hours, write seven emails and have four telephone conversations to be able to say to a 23-year-old woman who's about to travel: 'Yes, you may have this brand of Japanese encephalitis vaccine because they do not use bovine material. The vaccine is made in [cells from] the African green monkey and I have looked up that monkey and it does not contain alpha-gal.'""

Some replacement heart valves are grown in pigs; they may cause alpha-gal sensitisation that could trigger an allergy attack later. And cardiac patients who have alpha-gal allergy seem to use up replacement heart valves more quickly than normal, putting them at risk of heart failure until they can get a replacement.

There's also a growing sense that alpha-gal may be an occupational hazard. Last year, researchers in Spain treated three farm workers who developed hives and swelling and had difficulty breathing after being splashed with amniotic fluid while they were helping calves to be born. All three of them - a 36-year-old woman, a 56-year-old woman and a 53-year-old man - already knew they had alpha-gal sensitivity, but had never imagined that skin contact would be risky.

Commins has treated hunters who developed reactions after being splashed with blood after field dressing deer; those cases raise the possibility that meat-processing workers could be at risk. In the two main Facebook groups where patients gather, it's common to hear school cafeteria workers fret about reactions from breathing the fumes of meat cooking.

Last summer, researchers working with Commins reported that people with alpha-gal allergy may have greater allergic reactions to the stings of bees and wasps, potentially endangering landscapers and other outdoor workers.

It's hard to know how many people may be sensitised to alpha-gal without knowing it. A project at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that studies unexplained occurrences of anaphylaxis found last year that 9 per cent of the cases weren't unexplained after all: they were alpha-gal patients whose sensitivity had never been diagnosed.

Platts-Mills points out that the prevalence of high levels of alpha-gal IgE in his earliest studies was up to 20 per cent in some communities, ""but that was absolutely not the prevalence of allergic reactions to meat,"" he says. ""So there are clearly plenty of people out there who've got the antibody but don't have this syndrome.""

What this all means is that there are almost certainly people for whom a meat-containing meal or medical intervention could trigger an alpha-gal reaction of unknown severity.

There may be further peril awaiting them. In June, Platts-Mills and other researchers revealed that more than a quarter of patients who came to the University of Virginia's medical centre for cardiac catheterisation, to clear out life-threatening blood-vessel blockages, were sensitised to alpha-gal without knowing it.

The patients with the undetected allergy had more arterial plaque than the ones without, and, most worrisome to the researchers, their plaques were of a type that is more likely to break away from the arterial wall and cause heart attacks and strokes. Though the research is early - done in one group of 118 patients, in a known hotspot for alpha-gal - Platts-Mills worries it presages a risk for heart disease that is larger than anyone expects.

When a new disease surfaces in the USA, it's usually the CDC that investigates, pouring epidemiologists and data scientists into the field to track down connections and bring back samples for lab analysis. But investigation of alpha-gal is caught in a bureaucratic quirk of federal science. The CDC is responsible for infections spread by insects and arthropods - but alpha-gal syndrome is not an infection. That makes it the responsibility of NIH - which has abundant lab scientists, but no shoe-leather disease detectives.

NIH does seem to be taking an interest. In June 2018, it hosted an invitation-only one-day IgE-mediated Meat Allergy Workshop; in the past, such meetings have indicated the giant agency is considering launching a research programme. But just reading the workshop's programme provides a hint of how new alpha-gal research is; participants called the problem by multiple different names, displaying that there isn't even yet any agreed nomenclature for it. Similarly, the US-run universal search engine for journal articles, PubMed, indexes papers on alpha-gal under ""allergy to galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose"", ""mammalian meat allergy"", ""delayed red meat allergy"", ""galactose-α-1,3-galactose syndrome"" and more.

Platts-Mills was one of the workshop's invited speakers and gave the opening statement. Commins was there as well, along with researchers from New York, Germany, South Africa and Sweden.

Dr Marshall Plaut, who convened the meeting and is now chief of the Food Allergy, Atopic Dermatitis, and Allergic Mechanisms Section at NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, describes it as the earliest step in possibly committing to a research programme. (Platts-Mills and Commins have already received some NIH funding.) ""It signals that NIH has some interest in understanding more about the disease,"" he says. ""There are a lot of things that need to be understood.""

In August, Commins gave a talk on alpha-gal allergy at the International Conference on Emerging Infectious Diseases, a conference held every two or so years and sponsored by the CDC that often surfaces the earliest signals of illnesses that are destined to become big problems.

The CDC's director of foodborne illness was in the audience; so was its director of vector-borne diseases, the department that deals with ticks. Afterwards, they both zoomed up to ask him questions. ""I kind of had the impression this was just a weird, small thing,"" Dr Lyle Petersen, the vector-borne director, told him. ""But this seems like kind of a big deal.""

With NIH and the CDC paying attention, research into alpha-gal might be reaching a threshold, a moment at which isolated investigations might coalesce into answers. For the patients, who feel isolated too, that can't come soon enough."

This was the India-South Africa one-day international game at Nagpur. It was March 19, 2000; IPL wasn't yet born. India wasn't used to watching spinners bowl to opening batsmen. It was also the winter when a bunch of Delhi policemen became more insightful about the game than most top cricket pundits. While getting wiser, they would also get disillusioned.

Within 18 days, Inspector Ishwar Singh had filed a complaint with charges of match-fixing against Cronje, London-based businessman Sanjeev Chawla and four of his associates. It had details of how Chawla and Cronje fixed team scores, and mentioned the role of four other South African players, including Herschelle Gibbs. A couple of years later, Cronje died in a plane crash. Now, 18 years after he left the country, last month, a UK court ordered Chawla's extradition.

Recalling the untimely death of the cricket fan inside him, Om Prakash, now 49 and a head constable, laments, ""I loved Ajay Jadeja, but it all changed. I haven't seen a game since 2000.""

-- --

Nothing had prepared the two constables for the role they were to play in cricket's coincidental unmasking -- which started with their boss, Inspector Ishwar Singh, asking them to be part of an extortion investigation in early 2000. It was a textbook case of those times -- a suspected Chhota Shakeel and

D Company operative from Dubai, Shaheen Haitheley, had threatened an Old Delhi businessman to cough up Rs 5 crore.

A background check of those in touch with Haitheley threw up a Bollywood name -- Krishan Kumar, a failed actor and brother of late T-Series founder Gulshan Kumar. BSNL was roped in -- whenever Kumar's cellphone rang, a landline on the top floor of the Delhi Police's R K Puram office too came alive.

Ishwar is tickled as he recalls those early days of phone-tapping. ""It was all very primitive, nothing like the computers of today. We would strip the landline wires of their plastic cover and twist the metal wire inside tightly to a tape-recorder, that had those good old audio cassettes.""

Little did Ishwar or his men know then that this rudimentary contraption would connect them to cricket's seedy betting syndicate that dealt in hundreds of crores, and lead them to a catch that they would boast about for years to come.

Om Prakash and Ajit continued to work in shifts, hanging onto every word that Krishan Kumar spoke on the phone. With no headway, the surveillance was extended. After Kumar's Call Data Record analysis, it was decided to also closely observe his friends, Rajesh Kalra, Sunil Dara, and Man Mohan Khattar. The Crime Branch office was buzzing, the policemen were busy and the recorded cassettes were piling up.

On February 20, 2000, the Delhi Police got lucky. Kumar handed over his compromised phone to a London-based friend, Sanjeev Chawla, who had just landed in Mumbai and checked into Hotel Taj Mahal, that was also the base of the South African cricket team. Chawla was now being snooped on by proxy.

Meanwhile, the constables, programmed to look for extortion clues, were getting restless. One fine day, after another late-night vigil, Om Prakash bumped into DCP Pradeep Srivastava on the steps of the police headquarters. ""I casually asked Om Prakash about the case. He said there was no terror angle, all he got to hear was 'catch pakad liya', 'catch nahin pakda', 'out kiya'. I told him these could be code words, they might have been talking about money. He replied, 'Nahin janaab, aap hi sun lijeye (No sir, you hear yourself)',"" recalls Srivastav who, after retiring as DG, Chandigarh, lives in Delhi's Civil

When Srivastav heard the cassettes, he agreed with his junior. But what stuck in his mind was the unusual chatter. ""There was someone speaking in chiseled accented English to someone who spoke tooti-phooti angrezi (broken English). The man speaking broken English was complaining... 'You said you will do this but you didn't',"" says Srivastav.

A breakthrough came via yet another happenstance. A few days later, Srivastav was watching cricket at home when, during a game, South African skipper Hansie Cronje came to the commentary box. ""That's when it struck me, 'Aawaz jaani pehchaani lag rahi hai (The voice sounds familiar)'."" The mystery of the man who spoke that chiseled English had been solved.

Inspector Ishwar got in touch with Doordarshan for the game tapes to compare the voices. In the coming days, Om Prakash's ears would wait for the 'chiseled English' chatter to appear again. On March 14, 2000, it did. He would shout out to his senior in the next room. ""Sir kuchch English mein hai (There is something in English)!""

Ishwar still recalls Chawla's three words: ""Hello, Hi Hansie!"" And the reply: ""Hello,

Hi Sanjeev!""

In the rukka (short note of complaint) filed by Ishwar, as part of the chargesheet, ""Hello, Hi Hansie!"" would figure

Almost overnight, for Om Prakash and Ajit, watching cricket became work itself. On most days, thanks to the phone calls, they would have prior information on the playing eleven, the toss or, say, that Crookes would bowl the first over. It was watching sports without the thrill of suspense. Sometimes, when the game wouldn't go as per the pre-decided script, the landline in the R K Puram office would ring off the hook.

What was once whispered in hushed tones in the cricket circuit was now on page one of newspapers. As soon as the Delhi Police filed the FIR in the first week of March 2000, every cricket-playing nation had its eyes on India. The transcript of Cronje's conversations with bookies went viral.

Cricket's axis of evil -- the player-punter-bookie nexus -- was no longer a mere conspiracy theory. The rot, triggered by the proliferation of the game's shorter version, coinciding with the broadcasting boom and the multi-fold escalation in mobile phone users, and aided by India's weak anti-gambling law, ran deep. Anybody with a phone connection could have a syndicate of his own that was affiliated to big sharks abroad. Match-fixing had become the underworld's new ATM.

The controversy triggered probes around the world and forced the International Cricket Council (ICC) to form an anti-corruption unit. Kings Commission in South Africa and the CBI investigation in India found the game's leading lights, including Cronje, Gibbs, and Indian stars Mohammad Azharuddin and Ajay Jadeja, guilty. All were banned, for varying periods.

As for Chawla, he took a flight out of the country on March 15, 2000, four days before the final ODI. Police officials knew he was on way to the airport, but could only watch helplessly. ""The South Africans were still in India. Making an arrest would have meant naming the South African players he was in touch with and that might have meant a diplomatic issue. So we had to wait for the South Africans to leave,"" says an investigator.

The South Africans left on March 20.

Eighteen years later, Chawla happens to be the only accused in this case who hasn't been questioned by either the Delhi Police, CBI or Kings Commission; this despite figuring prominently in all the probe reports.

Arvind Kumar, then Operation Hansie's foot soldier, now ACP, Crime Branch, first calls Chawla the pivot, thinks for a while and changes it to ""sutradhar (main link)"". ""Woh Mahabharat dekha tha na TV pe aapne, Chawla 'Samay' hai (You saw serial Mahabharat on TV, didn't you? Chawla was the character 'Samay'),"" he says.

Anticipating his return, Ishwar smiles, ""Maybe he can even name a few Indian players.""

The CBI report did talk about Chawla's association with Indian players and his visits to the gym at Delhi's Hotel Park Royal, the watering hole where the key characters of this saga allegedly hung around. Everybody, from alleged punters Kalra, Dara, Krishan Kumar to players Ajay Jadeja, Manoj Prabhakar, Nikhil Chopra, reportedly regularly bumped into each other at this Nehru Place haunt. Kalra, the report also says, called the then India offie Chopra, on Chawla's insistence, before the Nagpur ODI (the Crookes game) to check if he was in the playing eleven. The CBI report, however, found nothing against Chopra.

In the almost two decades long lull, and the virtual closure of the case after Cronje's death in 2002, most of the tainted cricketers have got rid of the 'fixer' tag. They are now talking heads, coaches and selectors, and the return of the ghost from the past could be unsettling.

Chawla, 51, a UK passport holder, currently in London with his wife and two sons, tried his best to stonewall India's request. Westminster Magistrate's Court judgment shows how he raised issues of passage of time, prison conditions in India, human rights and right to family life. The hearing also discussed Chawla's wife's health issues, and mentioned the family's catering business and a restaurant let out on lease.

In his long career, Ishwar says, he has dealt with many suspects who run to court to avoid arrest. Back in 2000, Krishan Kumar too was a minor celebrity -- with hit songs like Sanam bewafa, Aacha sila diya tune mere pyaar ka, behind him, and those caterpillar-like eyebrows.

With policemen on his heels, Kumar first got himself admitted to Noida's Kailash Hospital and later moved the High Court to get anticipatory bail. The Delhi Police went to the Supreme Court for cancellation of bail.

Fifty-six-year-old Ishwar, now an ACP in the Capital's West District, remembers clearly the judge's caustically funny observation. ""R K Anand was Kumar's lawyer. The judge told him, 'Are you withdrawing the bail petition or should I pass an order? I was watching the match till 2 o'clock and wasting my time. If this isn't match-fixing, what is?' Ek minute mein bail plea uda di (He dismissed the bail plea in a minute), said go and surrender,"" says Ishwar, laughing heartily.

Srivastav too has one vivid memory from the episode. It was a line he heard in the Chawla-Cronje cassettes, after a game where apparently Gibbs was to score less than 20 runs but went on to make much more, thanks to several chances gifted by Indian fielders. ""I still remember Hansie's reply, 'If your b.....ds can't join their two hands, then what do I do?',"" Srivastav recalls, cracking up.

There was another, lesser-known character in this story: an Indian-origin restaurateur from Johannesburg who was ""the best friend"" of every Indian cricketer who stepped onto South African soil, a charismatic wheeler-dealer with that unforgettably dramatic name -- Hamid Banjo Cassim.

Touring Indian cricketers have a rather endearing nickname for men like Banjo. They are called ""Mamu"", the quintessential maternal uncles who spoil nephews during visits. These fans-turned-hangers-on-turned-groupies take a time-tested route to the heart of cricketers -- via the stomach.

On long tours, the easiest way to break the ice with India's cricketers is by arranging vegetarian food for home-sick players. If indulged, ""Mamus"" can be banked on for free SIMs and even all-paid shopping trips. In return, they ask for free match-day passes, selfies, signed memorabilia, and sometimes, a pound-and-a-half of flesh.

A giant of a man, Banjo was a school dropout and a failed entrepreneur. The father of three had a candy shop called Sweet Junction in Johannesburg's Fordsburg area, famous for a halal restaurant that served spicy curries.

Among the '90s South African players, he was the ""biltong"" man, someone who never tired of providing them the strictly carnivore nation's favourite snack, those dried and seasoned meat strips. He was more than a ""Mamu"" for the South Africans, especially Cronje. Records show he called the Porteas skipper 180 times in six months.

Indian cricketers from the 1996 tour remember Banjo for his extraordinary biryani delivery to the dressing room, lifted to the balcony from the grass banks by a rope. You could always trust Banjo to make things happen.

He told the Kings Commission that Kapil Dev was a good friend, close enough to introduce him to his wife. He wasn't lying, Kapil told the CBI about how he knew ""Hamid Mamu"" very well.

Banjo also flaunted how he arranged South African players for some friendly games that Kapil organised in India and how once, while driving the Indian star late one night in Johannesburg, he pranked his nephew. The young boy stood stunned at the counter of his truck shop seeing Kapil walk in and ask for a drink.

During the Kings Commission hearing, Banjo also said he had arranged SIM cards and phones for Bollywood stars when they visited South Africa. One pay-on-go SIM he provided to Amisha Patel -- that era's next big thing after her 2000 blockbuster Kaho Na Pyaar Hai -- was later used by Banjo to make calls to Chawla. Banjo also proudly told the Commission he had asked South African star Lance Klusener to arrange tickets for Patel for a Test at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.

So when Chawla wanted to get introduced to Cronje in South Africa in January 2000, a month before their India tour, Banjo was the obvious go-between. Details discussed during the Kings Commission hearing show Chawla was received by Banjo and taken to his shop for a meal.

A day before South Africa's tri-series ODI game against Zimbabwe on February 1, 2000, Banjo told the Commission, Chawla handed the South African skipper $15,000 at a Durban hotel in front of him. ""Mr Cronje took that envelope and I was surprised. He (Chawla) said, 'Keep this and I will talk to you at a later stage',"" Banjo said in his testimony.

During South Africa's subsequent series in India, Chawla kept talking to Cronje and, when he didn't take his calls, there was always Banjo who would mediate from Johannesburg. All through the hearing, the candy shop owner kept insisting that he was just a cricket enthusiast trying to be helpful. The advocates questioning him weren't always convinced. Chawla's return to India might add a new layer to this investigation.

This case has had a history of unexpected twists and turns. At every dead end, the Delhi Police have been lucky to find a new opening. DCP Srivastav has seen it first hand. The cold response of the government in the aftermath of the first FIR was disheartening for the team. ""My immediate superior, Joint CP, Crime, Dr K K Paul, was very supportive. But no one else was ready to believe us. The government asked why the FIR was filed prematurely, without proper evidence, and how it doesn't fall within the four walls of the law,"" he says.

The Delhi Police saw this as a case of cheating, both Chawla and Cronje were booked under IPC Sections 420 and 120B, but legal opinion was different. According to the law, cheating can only be established if somebody loses and somebody gains. Legal luminaries would ask: Whose loss is it if a match is fixed? That even if the outcome of a game was pre-decided, the spectators didn't know, they got their money's worth. Don't people pay to watch World Wrestling Entertainment, knowing those matches are fixed?

The Delhi Police tried to argue that the game wasn't ""fair"", which is what the fans pay for. ""We did register a case of cheating but there was always this grave doubt about it being tenable or not,"" says Srivastav.

And then came the turnaround. Another phone call, another accented voice. Srivastav was home for lunch when he was told by his helper that there was someone on line speaking ""angrezi"". ""I got on the line and heard English with a French accent. He was a reporter from a foreign agency. He said, 'Deputy Commissioner, you must be a very happy man. Each bit that you alleged against Hansie has been confessed by him last night',"" recalls Srivastav, adding how he will remain eternally grateful to the South African skipper for ""unburdening his conscience"".

Within minutes, the government's tone changed. Srivastav's voice has a crackle as he recalls, ""On television was then NSA himself, Brajesh Mishra. He came on screen to say: 'Satyamev jayate (Truth always prevails)... Whatever our officers were saying has been confirmed by Hansie himself'.""

Once again, the policemen gathered in front of the Crime Branch office television and exchanged amused smiles. It was a winter of crazy coincidences.

A new panic seizes the public imagination every few years. (Mohit Suneja/HT)

Mass hysteria breaks out in India every few years and is increasingly being fuelled by paranoia about the internet.

To the world, Manish Sarki was the perfect all-rounder.

A strapping boy of 18, Sarki worked hard in school during the day and sent fielders scurrying after his shots at the neighbourhood cricket ground in the evenings. He would never get home later than dinner time even when his friends were out chatting, his mother Chandra Maya remembers, and his closest friends joked about how he would blush talking to girls.

Everyone in the village of St Mary's Hill knew Sarki would grow up to be a policeman or join the army. Maybe because he was so well-behaved, no one noticed when he went quiet. They only noticed on the night of August 20 when he didn't come back home.

The village gathered around the Sarki house around 9pm. A chill was enveloping the small mountain village on the outskirts of Darjeeling in northern Bengal, but a small group of men and women trekked to the local police station a couple of kilometers away. Boys go missing all the time, they were told.

Undeterred, the villagers split into smaller search parties and fanned out into the jungles, determined to find Sarki. Their hopes were dashed around 1.30am when a search team stumbled on Sarki's body hanging from the ceiling of an empty pig warehouse on top of a hill.

Below, in spray paint, were the words ""half blood prince was here"" in what everyone recognised was Sarki's handwriting. On the wall behind was drawn a hangman with two victims, an older boy, and more chillingly, a younger one. Every wall of the building had been scribbled on - the words ""illuminati"", ""last king"", ""savage"", ""doped up"" and the number ""666"" appearing repeatedly.

In the light of day, some of the graffiti might have appeared benign - after all, some the walls displayed banalities like ""be the change you want to see"" or ""the thing you fear the most is fear itself"". But in the eerie quiet of a cold mountain night, the villagers were convinced Sarki's death was the doing of the satan. ""I was heartbroken for my son but also scared out of my wits. We were all scared about who the younger boy could be,"" said Chandra Maya.

By the time police arrived two hours later, a mist of rumours had cloaked the village. Wasn't Sarki always on his phone for the past few weeks? And, wouldn't he go out to the graveyard, barely a kilometer away, every night with his phone? ""I think he was going crazy. That's when I heard about the game,"" added Chandra Maya.

By sunrise, everyone had heard of the game: a shadowy application called the Momo Challenge that had apparently killed Sarki. Several explanations were offered. ""For the past few days, he was very sad and distracted. He would be lost in his phone. He never said anything to me, later I found out that he was playing the Momo game,"" said Sarki's friend Deekchen.

But how did he find out? Villagers say the local police first told them of the game, but the police deny ever saying anything. ""In fact, we have not been able to confirm any role of any Momo Challenge game. We never told the locals about the game. Maybe the graffiti made them think that,"" said Hare Krishna Pai, additional superintendent of police.

The next day, a second death, that of 26-year-old Aditi Goyal in Kurseong town, was also attributed to the Momo Challenge, turning the creeping fear into full-blown panic. By then, local politicians had put out statements about the supposedly lethal game, and everyone in the hills was talking about it.

""The whole area was in trauma and everyone was scared of their phones. We found young boys from Class 7 had started playing it. We started spreading awareness and seized phones from those who seemed vulnerable. Someone even sent a message to my daughter,"" said Raju Gurung, a local from Kurseong.

Hindustan Times spoke to at least 20 people in the area and everyone claimed to know a relative, friend or neighbour who had had a close shave with the game. But everyone had a different notion.

Some described the game, which supposedly sets self-harm challenges that finally end in suicide, as an app, some as a Whatsapp message. Some said they received texts, some described a phone number. Indeed, beyond the ubiquitous image of the oblong faced, bulbous eyed doll that has come to signify the game, every detail was foggy. ""Sometimes people are faking names and photos and sending messages 'Hi, I am momo. Let us play a game.' The fear of the game has hypnotised us,"" said Junita Rana, a schoolteacher in Kurseong.

It began with the braids. In June last year, a girl in Rajasthan claimed someone chopped off her braid while she was asleep. Dozens of women across Rajasthan followed up with similar claims. Over the following months, the pattern spread across north India like an epidemic: Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Delhi. By November, over 200 cases of braid chopping had been reported in Kashmir where the trend took its most vicious turn. Many women claimed to have seen Godmen, witches or cats before losing their consciousness. After finding their braids gone, many complained of aches and pains for days after. The police couldn't really find any culprits, so the people took the matter in their hands. In August, a poor woman was killed by a mob in Agra on the suspicion of chopping braids. In October, an old man in Anantnag was killed for the same reason.

Then there was the Blue Whale. In July, a schoolboy's suicide stoked the hysteria around the web-based game created by a Russian tech geek targeting teengers. The 50 challenges begin differently - from shutting yourself in or watching a horror film - proceed incrementally, and end the same way: suicide. Through 2017, more than 150 cases of young suicides across India - West Bengal, Delhi, Indore, Solapur, Dehradun - were blamed on the Blue Whale, often with no more proof that the young person was obsessed with smartphone and videogames. Every case was rife was contradictions and yet, websites were blocked, advisories issued, and in some cases, smartphones banned in schools.

Experts say that underneath the web-fuelled hysteria, something more sinister is going on with the mental health of young people. Samir Parikh, director of the Department of Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences at Fortis Healthcare, insisted that we cannot dismiss these phenomena, but the focus should be on greater media literacy, on making children understand what is right and wrong content, and on teaching people to seek help if they are feeling vulnerable.

""Is there a component of hysteria in all this? Of course, there are lots of stories in the media and they have an impact. But we cannot deny the fact that there are pressures and problems that young people go through silently. If help and access is not given, they can be misused,"" he added.

Parikh is clear that any approach that aims at shutting down access to the internet is wrong, mainly because it is impossible. ""We need to understand that be it Blue Whale or Momo, if you are vulnerable, you might be pulled towards it. So you give people skills and teach people to not bottle it up, tell parents, block or involve authorities.""

India has had a long history of public panic. From a half-man half-monkey roaming the streets in Delhi, sometimes wearing a helmet, to the Munhnochwa (face ripper) of Mirzapur, claimed to be a flying object emitting beams of green or red light, sending shock waves through anyone who came in its contact, and leaving them with bites and scratches on their faces, to the Rathakaatteri (vampire) of Gundalpatti who allegedly sucked the blood of the village cattle, a new panic seizes the public imagination every few years. Many of these have been analysed as incidents of mass hysteria. The patterns have been revealing. Women are more likely to end up as victims than men, children turn to be more vulnerable than adults. The trends pick up in regions or communities marked by oppression of women, economic uncertainty or social anxiety.

Yet, questions remain about why a particular fear grips a set of people at a given time. Did every woman who complained of braid chopping do it herself? Was every alleged case of Blue Whale suicide made up by the parents or the police to evade responsibility? What do the women whose braids were chopped say now? And, did a year of fear and panic leave us any wiser?

In Kanganhedi, a village of 700 houses on the Delhi-Haryana border, Munesh Devi's hair has grown back just enough to tie it in a ponytail. A lot more has changed in her life since last year besides her hairstyle. ""I can no longer work in our field. I hardly leave the house, except being taken to the doctor by my son every two weeks. Any exertion leaves me tired. Even going to funerals gets up my blood pressure. I lie in bed almost all day. Daughters-in-law press my feet.They also bring me rotis to eat in bed,"" said Devi, sitting on a double bed in the living room. Its doors remain shut and its light dimmed to prevent Devi's recurring headache.

They began in July 2017, immediately after she found her braid chopped at the neck. It was there when she finished feeding the cows in the family's farm, she said, but gone when she got back home and slipped back her pallu. ""Must have gone missing while I was travelling home on the back of my son's motorcycle,"" she added. She remembers fainting after the realisation struck. She continues to feel giddy. ""My head spins. My whole body aches. My feet go numb. My teeth hurt."" She doesn't know what ails her; neither does her doctor. He prescribes her pills for each of her symptoms. She shows off the stash to people asking her how she has been doing since ""the incident.""

Munesh Devi's was one of three braids found missing in the area in the course of one eventful day. The other two women don't know, either, who chopped their braids or why they continue to suffer. Sri Devi said she lost her braid while sitting on a couch in the courtyard of her house. One moment it was hanging down her waist, the next moment it was lying on the floor. She had heard of the braid-chopping phenomenon only hours before. ""My uncle, who was visiting us from Pataudi, had told me about a video he had seen on Facebook. I said, 'Mama, please don't say such things.'"" Her son had called 100 after she fainted at the sight of her severed braid. ""The police are yet to tell us if they found anything,"" she said.

Devi also visited a psychiatrist in Dwarka along with her son, at the urging of the police. ""He asked my son some questions. Gave us no answers,"" she said. Her braid was taken away by a forensics team sent in by the police for further investigations. ""We haven't heard from them."" Perturbed by three incidents in a week, people in the village even consulted a tantrik (mystic). ""He spoke about the presence of a mysterious cat in the village. But no such cat or dog has been found,"" she said.

For many women, the disappearance of braids has been transformative. It has allowed them rightful rest after a lifetime's slog at home and farm, won them the nurturing attention of their families, and given them the chance to talk about themselves for the first time. The third ""victim"" in Kangnahedi, Ombati, a daily-wage labourer who found her braid gone while working around the house, is still waiting for her life to change, however. ""No government compensation, no one has even come to offer me a glass of juice,"" she said, lying on a cot and complaining of a headache.

""We sent a team to that village for a couple of hours after a request from the concerned division of the Delhi police, but we haven't received any formal communication from the top brass,"" explained Nimesh Desai, director of the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences, which had investigated the phenomenon of Delhi's Monkey-man in 2001. ""From the preliminary impressions of our team, in all probability, the incidents in Kanganhedi fit into the pattern of mass hysteria, which tends to subside on its own.""

In Kashmir, the last region to be swept up in the storm, over 100 FIRs were registered over six months. Many women alleged masked men entered their homes when they were alone, sprinkled sedatives in the air, and chopped their braids while they lay unconscious. Separatist leaders accused the Indian government, and armed militants suspected the evil hand of intelligence agencies. As locals flooded the streets in protest, shutting down shops and schools, the police resorted to extreme measures, from announcing an award of Rs 6 lakh for information to unleashing riot-control tactics to disperse the crowds. Several vigilante groups armed with lathis and axes emerged to patrol the streets at night. A 70-year-old man in Anantnag died after being hit by a brick by a group of people who suspected him to be a braid chopper.

But now, police say the paranoia and panic was fuelled by nothing substantive.

""Almost all the cases turned out to be without any substance. There were a few cases where the women had cut their hair themselves. In one case, a maid had cut the hair of a girl,"" said additional director general of police (law and order), Muneer Khan. In Kulgam, where 21 cases had been registered, the state government had formed a special investigation team(SIT). Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP), Kulgam, Aijaz Ahmad, who was part of the SIT, said that most of the cases have been closed because the allegations had no factual basis.

""In some of the cases, the culprits remain untraced, while maximum cases turned out to be of hysteria,"" Ahmad said. He said the lack of a single eyewitness in all of the cases was particularly baffling.

Across the valley, the police arrested between 70 and 80 people, including members of vigilante groups, for ""raising false alarm about braid chopping and creating disturbances"".

""We felt that this [braid chopping] was being done by agencies. It was a matter of honour of our women. Everybody wanted this should end. Stone pelting was the only option with us. Surprisingly it did end abruptly after that,"" said a villager from north Kashmir who requested anonymity. Some of them are still visiting the courts for hearings.

It was around 5pm on July 29 last year when Manpreet Singh Sahani climbed on the ledge of his fifth-floor apartment. As he teetered on the edge, neighbours and witnesses on the street below called out to him but could only watch helplessly as he jumped. Initial investigations by local police and testimonies of his friends exposed talk of the Blue Whale Challenge. Several of them took to social media to blame the game and link it to Sahani's death.

In 24 hours, reports of the supposedly lethal game had inundated media, and reports of copycat cases were streaming in from all parts of India, ratcheting up paranoia about mobile phone and internet use among teenagers and their parents. Over the next two months, more than 150 deaths or injuries across the country were alleged to be linked to the game.

But while police initially suspected the boy was an avid gamer and could have been influenced by the Blue Whale Challenge, detailed investigation indicated more offline triggers.

""The boy was in love with a girl who had left him for some other boy. We had gone through his email accounts and mobile phone and found a draft on the phone which clarified his intention to commit suicide,"" said Navin Reddy, deputy commissioner of police Zone 10.

This might not be an isolated phenomenon. Earlier this year, Union minister of state for home Hansraj Ahir told Lok Sabha that a committee formed under the chairmanship of the director general of the Computer Emergency Response Team-India (CERT-In) couldn't establish the involvement of the Blue Whale Challenge in any case.

""The committee analysed the internet activities, device activities, call records and other social media activity, other forensic evidences and also interacted with rescued victims associated with these incidents,"" the minister told the lower house.

Of course, by then several other central ministries, a number of state governments, the Central Board of Secondary Education and even the Supreme Court had got involved, with the apex court calling the game a ""national problem"".

But experts say official agencies may have jumped the gun. ""It was definitely a hoax. We need to shift focus from these voyeuristic things and to suicides, which is a big problem that kills a quarter of a million people. Some of these hoaxes have a life of their own because media makes them into a big story. We need long-term institutional solutions,"" said Soumitra Pathare, director of the Centre for Mental Health Law and Policy.

Back in St Mary's hill, Chandra Maya Sarki has gone back to her old routine -- wake up at the crack of dawn to draw water, fix food for her husband before he leaves for his daily wage work, and then clean their small wooden house. She likes to keep the television on and stray dialogues from the afternoon soaps animate the living room. She stares not at the screen, however, but at the the small framed photo of Sarki hanging on the blue wall, wondering why the mysterious admins of the Momo Challenge chose her child as their prey.

She doesn't know yet that the cyber cell of the West Bengal police has completed its forensic probe of his phone and found no trace of any Momo Challenge. ""If any application is downloaded, the forensic machine would find a trace, even if it is an unknown application. But we have found no such application, or any message on WhatsApp motivating people to play the game. We have found nothing so far,"" said a senior official of the cyber cell on the condition of anonymity.

She doesn't know that police has ruled out any links between the game and the death of Aditi Goyal and that at least two other cases in the state have been found to be hoaxes traced back to mischief makers sending scary messages through WhatsApp. She doesn't know that Sarki's teacher Sarita Sharma has a simple explanation for why he and his friends would go to the graveyard at night -- the mobile network was the best at that spot.

All she knows is that her beloved younger son will no longer come back home at 8pm every day. That she will never make him his favourite meal of dal-aloo and dum-eggs. The money she had been saving with her husband to send him to Bengaluru for higher studies now seems meaningless. Sometimes she talks to Sarki's sister, now in college, about him and the day that took him away from her. She will probably never know what really happened to Sarki or what troubled him enough to withdraw from his friends. Momo Challenge or not, that is the biggest tragedy of all.

At the Delhi Police's Crime Branch Office at R K Puram, two constables of the Anti-Extortion Cell, Om Prakash and Ajit Singh, exchanged amused smiles as seasoned television commentators dropped their jaws watching Hansie Cronje toss the new ball to off-spinner Derek Crookes. This was the India-South Africa one-day international game at Nagpur. It was March 19, 2000; IPL wasn't yet born. India wasn't used to watching spinners bowl to opening batsmen. It was also the winter when a bunch of Delhi policemen became more insightful about the game than most top cricket pundits. While getting wiser, they would also get disillusioned.

Within 18 days, Inspector Ishwar Singh had filed a complaint with charges of match-fixing against Cronje, London-based businessman Sanjeev Chawla and four of his associates. It had details of how Chawla and Cronje fixed team scores, and mentioned the role of four other South African players, including Herschelle Gibbs. A couple of years later, Cronje died in a plane crash. Now, 18 years after he left the country, last month, a UK court ordered Chawla's extradition.

Recalling the untimely death of the cricket fan inside him, Om Prakash, now 49 and a head constable, laments, ""I loved Ajay Jadeja, but it all changed. I haven't seen a game since 2000.""

Nothing had prepared the two constables for the role they were to play in cricket's coincidental unmasking -- which started with their boss, Inspector Ishwar Singh, asking them to be part of an extortion investigation in early 2000. It was a textbook case of those times -- a suspected Chhota Shakeel and

D Company operative from Dubai, Shaheen Haitheley, had threatened an Old Delhi businessman to cough up Rs 5 crore.

A background check of those in touch with Haitheley threw up a Bollywood name -- Krishan Kumar, a failed actor and brother of late T-Series founder Gulshan Kumar. BSNL was roped in -- whenever Kumar's cellphone rang, a landline on the top floor of the Delhi Police's R K Puram office too came alive.

Ishwar is tickled as he recalls those early days of phone-tapping. ""It was all very primitive, nothing like the computers of today. We would strip the landline wires of their plastic cover and twist the metal wire inside tightly to a tape-recorder, that had those good old audio cassettes.""

Little did Ishwar or his men know then that this rudimentary contraption would connect them to cricket's seedy betting syndicate that dealt in hundreds of crores, and lead them to a catch that they would boast about for years to come.

Om Prakash and Ajit continued to work in shifts, hanging onto every word that Krishan Kumar spoke on the phone. With no headway, the surveillance was extended. After Kumar's Call Data Record analysis, it was decided to also closely observe his friends, Rajesh Kalra, Sunil Dara, and Man Mohan Khattar. The Crime Branch office was buzzing, the policemen were busy and the recorded cassettes were piling up.

On February 20, 2000, the Delhi Police got lucky. Kumar handed over his compromised phone to a London-based friend, Sanjeev Chawla, who had just landed in Mumbai and checked into Hotel Taj Mahal, that was also the base of the South African cricket team. Chawla was now being snooped on by proxy.

Meanwhile, the constables, programmed to look for extortion clues, were getting restless. One fine day, after another late-night vigil, Om Prakash bumped into DCP Pradeep Srivastava on the steps of the police headquarters. ""I casually asked Om Prakash about the case. He said there was no terror angle, all he got to hear was 'catch pakad liya', 'catch nahin pakda', 'out kiya'. I told him these could be code words, they might have been talking about money. He replied, 'Nahin janaab, aap hi sun lijeye (No sir, you hear yourself)',"" recalls Srivastav who, after retiring as DG, Chandigarh, lives in Delhi's Civil

When Srivastav heard the cassettes, he agreed with his junior. But what stuck in his mind was the unusual chatter. ""There was someone speaking in chiseled accented English to someone who spoke tooti-phooti angrezi (broken English). The man speaking broken English was complaining... 'You said you will do this but you didn't',"" says Srivastav.

A breakthrough came via yet another happenstance. A few days later, Srivastav was watching cricket at home when, during a game, South African skipper Hansie Cronje came to the commentary box. ""That's when it struck me, 'Aawaz jaani pehchaani lag rahi hai (The voice sounds familiar)'."" The mystery of the man who spoke that chiseled English had been solved.

Inspector Ishwar got in touch with Doordarshan for the game tapes to compare the voices. In the coming days, Om Prakash's ears would wait for the 'chiseled English' chatter to appear again. On March 14, 2000, it did. He would shout out to his senior in the next room. ""Sir kuchch English mein hai (There is something in English)!""

Ishwar still recalls Chawla's three words: ""Hello, Hi Hansie!"" And the reply: ""Hello,

Hi Sanjeev!""

In the rukka (short note of complaint) filed by Ishwar, as part of the chargesheet, ""Hello, Hi Hansie!"" would figure

Almost overnight, for Om Prakash and Ajit, watching cricket became work itself. On most days, thanks to the phone calls, they would have prior information on the playing eleven, the toss or, say, that Crookes would bowl the first over. It was watching sports without the thrill of suspense. Sometimes, when the game wouldn't go as per the pre-decided script, the landline in the R K Puram office would ring off the hook.

What was once whispered in hushed tones in the cricket circuit was now on page one of newspapers. As soon as the Delhi Police filed the FIR in the first week of March 2000, every cricket-playing nation had its eyes on India. The transcript of Cronje's conversations with bookies went viral.

Cricket's axis of evil -- the player-punter-bookie nexus -- was no longer a mere conspiracy theory. The rot, triggered by the proliferation of the game's shorter version, coinciding with the broadcasting boom and the multi-fold escalation in mobile phone users, and aided by India's weak anti-gambling law, ran deep. Anybody with a phone connection could have a syndicate of his own that was affiliated to big sharks abroad. Match-fixing had become the underworld's new ATM.

The controversy triggered probes around the world and forced the International Cricket Council (ICC) to form an anti-corruption unit. Kings Commission in South Africa and the CBI investigation in India found the game's leading lights, including Cronje, Gibbs, and Indian stars Mohammad Azharuddin and Ajay Jadeja, guilty. All were banned, for varying periods.

As for Chawla, he took a flight out of the country on March 15, 2000, four days before the final ODI. Police officials knew he was on way to the airport, but could only watch helplessly. ""The South Africans were still in India. Making an arrest would have meant naming the South African players he was in touch with and that might have meant a diplomatic issue. So we had to wait for the South Africans to leave,"" says an investigator.

The South Africans left on March 20.

Eighteen years later, Chawla happens to be the only accused in this case who hasn't been questioned by either the Delhi Police, CBI or Kings Commission; this despite figuring prominently in all the probe reports.

Arvind Kumar, then Operation Hansie's foot soldier, now ACP, Crime Branch, first calls Chawla the pivot, thinks for a while and changes it to ""sutradhar (main link)"". ""Woh Mahabharat dekha tha na TV pe aapne, Chawla 'Samay' hai (You saw serial Mahabharat on TV, didn't you? Chawla was the character 'Samay'),"" he says.

Anticipating his return, Ishwar smiles, ""Maybe he can even name a few Indian players.""

The CBI report did talk about Chawla's association with Indian players and his visits to the gym at Delhi's Hotel Park Royal, the watering hole where the key characters of this saga allegedly hung around. Everybody, from alleged punters Kalra, Dara, Krishan Kumar to players Ajay Jadeja, Manoj Prabhakar, Nikhil Chopra, reportedly regularly bumped into each other at this Nehru Place haunt. Kalra, the report also says, called the then India offie Chopra, on Chawla's insistence, before the Nagpur ODI (the Crookes game) to check if he was in the playing eleven. The CBI report, however, found nothing against Chopra.

In the almost two decades long lull, and the virtual closure of the case after Cronje's death in 2002, most of the tainted cricketers have got rid of the 'fixer' tag. They are now talking heads, coaches and selectors, and the return of the ghost from the past could be unsettling.

-- -

Chawla, 51, a UK passport holder, currently in London with his wife and two sons, tried his best to stonewall India's request. Westminster Magistrate's Court judgment shows how he raised issues of passage of time, prison conditions in India, human rights and right to family life. The hearing also discussed Chawla's wife's health issues, and mentioned the family's catering business and a restaurant let out on lease.

In his long career, Ishwar says, he has dealt with many suspects who run to court to avoid arrest. Back in 2000, Krishan Kumar too was a minor celebrity -- with hit songs like Sanam bewafa, Aacha sila diya tune mere pyaar ka, behind him, and those caterpillar-like eyebrows.

With policemen on his heels, Kumar first got himself admitted to Noida's Kailash Hospital and later moved the High Court to get anticipatory bail. The Delhi Police went to the Supreme Court for cancellation of bail.

Fifty-six-year-old Ishwar, now an ACP in the Capital's West District, remembers clearly the judge's caustically funny observation. ""R K Anand was Kumar's lawyer. The judge told him, 'Are you withdrawing the bail petition or should I pass an order? I was watching the match till 2 o'clock and wasting my time. If this isn't match-fixing, what is?' Ek minute mein bail plea uda di (He dismissed the bail plea in a minute), said go and surrender,"" says Ishwar, laughing heartily.

Srivastav too has one vivid memory from the episode. It was a line he heard in the Chawla-Cronje cassettes, after a game where apparently Gibbs was to score less than 20 runs but went on to make much more, thanks to several chances gifted by Indian fielders. ""I still remember Hansie's reply, 'If your b.....ds can't join their two hands, then what do I do?',"" Srivastav recalls, cracking up.

There was another, lesser-known character in this story: an Indian-origin restaurateur from Johannesburg who was ""the best friend"" of every Indian cricketer who stepped onto South African soil, a charismatic wheeler-dealer with that unforgettably dramatic name -- Hamid Banjo Cassim.

Touring Indian cricketers have a rather endearing nickname for men like Banjo. They are called ""Mamu"", the quintessential maternal uncles who spoil nephews during visits. These fans-turned-hangers-on-turned-groupies take a time-tested route to the heart of cricketers -- via the stomach.

On long tours, the easiest way to break the ice with India's cricketers is by arranging vegetarian food for home-sick players. If indulged, ""Mamus"" can be banked on for free SIMs and even all-paid shopping trips. In return, they ask for free match-day passes, selfies, signed memorabilia, and sometimes, a pound-and-a-half of flesh.

A giant of a man, Banjo was a school dropout and a failed entrepreneur. The father of three had a candy shop called Sweet Junction in Johannesburg's Fordsburg area, famous for a halal restaurant that served spicy curries.

Among the '90s South African players, he was the ""biltong"" man, someone who never tired of providing them the strictly carnivore nation's favourite snack, those dried and seasoned meat strips. He was more than a ""Mamu"" for the South Africans, especially Cronje. Records show he called the Porteas skipper 180 times in six months.

Indian cricketers from the 1996 tour remember Banjo for his extraordinary biryani delivery to the dressing room, lifted to the balcony from the grass banks by a rope. You could always trust Banjo to make things happen.

He told the Kings Commission that Kapil Dev was a good friend, close enough to introduce him to his wife. He wasn't lying, Kapil told the CBI about how he knew ""Hamid Mamu"" very well.

Banjo also flaunted how he arranged South African players for some friendly games that Kapil organised in India and how once, while driving the Indian star late one night in Johannesburg, he pranked his nephew. The young boy stood stunned at the counter of his truck shop seeing Kapil walk in and ask for a drink.

During the Kings Commission hearing, Banjo also said he had arranged SIM cards and phones for Bollywood stars when they visited South Africa. One pay-on-go SIM he provided to Amisha Patel -- that era's next big thing after her 2000 blockbuster Kaho Na Pyaar Hai -- was later used by Banjo to make calls to Chawla. Banjo also proudly told the Commission he had asked South African star Lance Klusener to arrange tickets for Patel for a Test at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.

So when Chawla wanted to get introduced to Cronje in South Africa in January 2000, a month before their India tour, Banjo was the obvious go-between. Details discussed during the Kings Commission hearing show Chawla was received by Banjo and taken to his shop for a meal.

A day before South Africa's tri-series ODI game against Zimbabwe on February 1, 2000, Banjo told the Commission, Chawla handed the South African skipper $15,000 at a Durban hotel in front of him. ""Mr Cronje took that envelope and I was surprised. He (Chawla) said, 'Keep this and I will talk to you at a later stage',"" Banjo said in his testimony.

During South Africa's subsequent series in India, Chawla kept talking to Cronje and, when he didn't take his calls, there was always Banjo who would mediate from Johannesburg. All through the hearing, the candy shop owner kept insisting that he was just a cricket enthusiast trying to be helpful. The advocates questioning him weren't always convinced. Chawla's return to India might add a new layer to this investigation.

This case has had a history of unexpected twists and turns. At every dead end, the Delhi Police have been lucky to find a new opening. DCP Srivastav has seen it first hand. The cold response of the government in the aftermath of the first FIR was disheartening for the team. ""My immediate superior, Joint CP, Crime, Dr K K Paul, was very supportive. But no one else was ready to believe us. The government asked why the FIR was filed prematurely, without proper evidence, and how it doesn't fall within the four walls of the law,"" he says.

The Delhi Police saw this as a case of cheating, both Chawla and Cronje were booked under IPC Sections 420 and 120B, but legal opinion was different. According to the law, cheating can only be established if somebody loses and somebody gains. Legal luminaries would ask: Whose loss is it if a match is fixed? That even if the outcome of a game was pre-decided, the spectators didn't know, they got their money's worth. Don't people pay to watch World Wrestling Entertainment, knowing those matches are fixed?

The Delhi Police tried to argue that the game wasn't ""fair"", which is what the fans pay for. ""We did register a case of cheating but there was always this grave doubt about it being tenable or not,"" says Srivastav.

And then came the turnaround. Another phone call, another accented voice. Srivastav was home for lunch when he was told by his helper that there was someone on line speaking ""angrezi"". ""I got on the line and heard English with a French accent. He was a reporter from a foreign agency. He said, 'Deputy Commissioner, you must be a very happy man. Each bit that you alleged against Hansie has been confessed by him last night',"" recalls Srivastav, adding how he will remain eternally grateful to the South African skipper for ""unburdening his conscience"".

Within minutes, the government's tone changed. Srivastav's voice has a crackle as he recalls, ""On television was then NSA himself, Brajesh Mishra. He came on screen to say: 'Satyamev jayate (Truth always prevails)... Whatever our officers were saying has been confirmed by Hansie himself'.""

Once again, the policemen gathered in front of the Crime Branch office television and exchanged amused smiles. It was a winter of crazy coincidences.

A new panic seizes the public imagination every few years. (Mohit Suneja/HT)

To the world, Manish Sarki was the perfect all-rounder.

A strapping boy of 18, Sarki worked hard in school during the day and sent fielders scurrying after his shots at the neighbourhood cricket ground in the evenings. He would never get home later than dinner time even when his friends were out chatting, his mother Chandra Maya remembers, and his closest friends joked about how he would blush talking to girls.

Everyone in the village of St Mary's Hill knew Sarki would grow up to be a policeman or join the army. Maybe because he was so well-behaved, no one noticed when he went quiet. They only noticed on the night of August 20 when he didn't come back home.

The village gathered around the Sarki house around 9pm. A chill was enveloping the small mountain village on the outskirts of Darjeeling in northern Bengal, but a small group of men and women trekked to the local police station a couple of kilometers away. Boys go missing all the time, they were told.

Undeterred, the villagers split into smaller search parties and fanned out into the jungles, determined to find Sarki. Their hopes were dashed around 1.30am when a search team stumbled on Sarki's body hanging from the ceiling of an empty pig warehouse on top of a hill.

Below, in spray paint, were the words ""half blood prince was here"" in what everyone recognised was Sarki's handwriting. On the wall behind was drawn a hangman with two victims, an older boy, and more chillingly, a younger one. Every wall of the building had been scribbled on - the words ""illuminati"", ""last king"", ""savage"", ""doped up"" and the number ""666"" appearing repeatedly.

In the light of day, some of the graffiti might have appeared benign - after all, some the walls displayed banalities like ""be the change you want to see"" or ""the thing you fear the most is fear itself"". But in the eerie quiet of a cold mountain night, the villagers were convinced Sarki's death was the doing of the satan. ""I was heartbroken for my son but also scared out of my wits. We were all scared about who the younger boy could be,"" said Chandra Maya.

By the time police arrived two hours later, a mist of rumours had cloaked the village. Wasn't Sarki always on his phone for the past few weeks? And, wouldn't he go out to the graveyard, barely a kilometer away, every night with his phone? ""I think he was going crazy. That's when I heard about the game,"" added Chandra Maya.

By sunrise, everyone had heard of the game: a shadowy application called the Momo Challenge that had apparently killed Sarki. Several explanations were offered. ""For the past few days, he was very sad and distracted. He would be lost in his phone. He never said anything to me, later I found out that he was playing the Momo game,"" said Sarki's friend Deekchen.

But how did he find out? Villagers say the local police first told them of the game, but the police deny ever saying anything. ""In fact, we have not been able to confirm any role of any Momo Challenge game. We never told the locals about the game. Maybe the graffiti made them think that,"" said Hare Krishna Pai, additional superintendent of police.

'HI, I AM MOMO. LET US PLAY A GAME'

The next day, a second death, that of 26-year-old Aditi Goyal in Kurseong town, was also attributed to the Momo Challenge, turning the creeping fear into full-blown panic. By then, local politicians had put out statements about the supposedly lethal game, and everyone in the hills was talking about it.

""The whole area was in trauma and everyone was scared of their phones. We found young boys from Class 7 had started playing it. We started spreading awareness and seized phones from those who seemed vulnerable. Someone even sent a message to my daughter,"" said Raju Gurung, a local from Kurseong.

Hindustan Times spoke to at least 20 people in the area and everyone claimed to know a relative, friend or neighbour who had had a close shave with the game. But everyone had a different notion.

Some described the game, which supposedly sets self-harm challenges that finally end in suicide, as an app, some as a Whatsapp message. Some said they received texts, some described a phone number. Indeed, beyond the ubiquitous image of the oblong faced, bulbous eyed doll that has come to signify the game, every detail was foggy. ""Sometimes people are faking names and photos and sending messages 'Hi, I am momo. Let us play a game.' The fear of the game has hypnotised us,"" said Junita Rana, a schoolteacher in Kurseong.

AN EPIDEMIC OF FEAR

It began with the braids. In June last year, a girl in Rajasthan claimed someone chopped off her braid while she was asleep. Dozens of women across Rajasthan followed up with similar claims. Over the following months, the pattern spread across north India like an epidemic: Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Delhi. By November, over 200 cases of braid chopping had been reported in Kashmir where the trend took its most vicious turn. Many women claimed to have seen Godmen, witches or cats before losing their consciousness. After finding their braids gone, many complained of aches and pains for days after. The police couldn't really find any culprits, so the people took the matter in their hands. In August, a poor woman was killed by a mob in Agra on the suspicion of chopping braids. In October, an old man in Anantnag was killed for the same reason.

Then there was the Blue Whale. In July, a schoolboy's suicide stoked the hysteria around the web-based game created by a Russian tech geek targeting teengers. The 50 challenges begin differently-- from shutting yourself in or watching a horror film-- proceed incrementally, and end the same way: suicide. Through 2017, more than 150 cases of young suicides across India -- West Bengal, Delhi, Indore, Solapur, Dehradun-- were blamed on the Blue Whale, often with no more proof that the young person was obsessed with smartphone and videogames. Every case was rife was contradictions and yet, websites were blocked, advisories issued, and in some cases, smartphones banned in schools.

FACE-RIPPERS AND VAMPIRES

Experts say that underneath the web-fuelled hysteria, something more sinister is going on with the mental health of young people. Samir Parikh, director of the Department of Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences at Fortis Healthcare, insisted that we cannot dismiss these phenomena, but the focus should be on greater media literacy, on making children understand what is right and wrong content, and on teaching people to seek help if they are feeling vulnerable.

""Is there a component of hysteria in all this? Of course, there are lots of stories in the media and they have an impact. But we cannot deny the fact that there are pressures and problems that young people go through silently. If help and access is not given, they can be misused,"" he added.

Parikh is clear that any approach that aims at shutting down access to the internet is wrong, mainly because it is impossible. ""We need to understand that be it Blue Whale or Momo, if you are vulnerable, you might be pulled towards it. So you give people skills and teach people to not bottle it up, tell parents, block or involve authorities.""

India has had a long history of public panic. From a half-man half-monkey roaming the streets in Delhi, sometimes wearing a helmet, to the Munhnochwa (face ripper) of Mirzapur, claimed to be a flying object emitting beams of green or red light, sending shock waves through anyone who came in its contact, and leaving them with bites and scratches on their faces, to the Rathakaatteri (vampire) of Gundalpatti who allegedly sucked the blood of the village cattle, a new panic seizes the public imagination every few years. Many of these have been analysed as incidents of mass hysteria. The patterns have been revealing. Women are more likely to end up as victims than men, children turn to be more vulnerable than adults. The trends pick up in regions or communities marked by oppression of women, economic uncertainty or social anxiety.

Yet, questions remain about why a particular fear grips a set of people at a given time. Did every woman who complained of braid chopping do it herself? Was every alleged case of Blue Whale suicide made up by the parents or the police to evade responsibility? What do the women whose braids were chopped say now? And, did a year of fear and panic leave us any wiser?

LOSING BRAIDS, EARNING REST

In Kanganhedi, a village of 700 houses on the Delhi-Haryana border, Munesh Devi's hair has grown back just enough to tie it in a ponytail. A lot more has changed in her life since last year besides her hairstyle. ""I can no longer work in our field. I hardly leave the house, except being taken to the doctor by my son every two weeks. Any exertion leaves me tired. Even going to funerals gets up my blood pressure. I lie in bed almost all day. Daughters-in-law press my feet.They also bring me rotis to eat in bed,"" said Devi, sitting on a double bed in the living room. Its doors remain shut and its light dimmed to prevent Devi's recurring headache.

They began in July 2017, immediately after she found her braid chopped at the neck. It was there when she finished feeding the cows in the family's farm, she said, but gone when she got back home and slipped back her pallu. ""Must have gone missing while I was travelling home on the back of my son's motorcycle,"" she added. She remembers fainting after the realisation struck. She continues to feel giddy. ""My head spins. My whole body aches. My feet go numb. My teeth hurt."" She doesn't know what ails her; neither does her doctor. He prescribes her pills for each of her symptoms. She shows off the stash to people asking her how she has been doing since ""the incident.""

Munesh Devi's was one of three braids found missing in the area in the course of one eventful day. The other two women don't know, either, who chopped their braids or why they continue to suffer. Sri Devi said she lost her braid while sitting on a couch in the courtyard of her house. One moment it was hanging down her waist, the next moment it was lying on the floor. She had heard of the braid-chopping phenomenon only hours before. ""My uncle, who was visiting us from Pataudi, had told me about a video he had seen on Facebook. I said, 'Mama, please don't say such things.'"" Her son had called 100 after she fainted at the sight of her severed braid. ""The police are yet to tell us if they found anything,"" she said.

Devi also visited a psychiatrist in Dwarka along with her son, at the urging of the police. ""He asked my son some questions. Gave us no answers,"" she said. Her braid was taken away by a forensics team sent in by the police for further investigations. ""We haven't heard from them."" Perturbed by three incidents in a week, people in the village even consulted a tantrik (mystic). ""He spoke about the presence of a mysterious cat in the village. But no such cat or dog has been found,"" she said.

For many women, the disappearance of braids has been transformative. It has allowed them rightful rest after a lifetime's slog at home and farm, won them the nurturing attention of their families, and given them the chance to talk about themselves for the first time. The third ""victim"" in Kangnahedi, Ombati, a daily-wage labourer who found her braid gone while working around the house, is still waiting for her life to change, however. ""No government compensation, no one has even come to offer me a glass of juice,"" she said, lying on a cot and complaining of a headache.

""We sent a team to that village for a couple of hours after a request from the concerned division of the Delhi police, but we haven't received any formal communication from the top brass,"" explained Nimesh Desai, director of the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences, which had investigated the phenomenon of Delhi's Monkey-man in 2001. ""From the preliminary impressions of our team, in all probability, the incidents in Kanganhedi fit into the pattern of mass hysteria, which tends to subside on its own.""

MASKED MEN OR MAIDS?

In Kashmir, the last region to be swept up in the storm, over 100 FIRs were registered over six months. Many women alleged masked men entered their homes when they were alone, sprinkled sedatives in the air, and chopped their braids while they lay unconscious. Separatist leaders accused the Indian government, and armed militants suspected the evil hand of intelligence agencies. As locals flooded the streets in protest, shutting down shops and schools, the police resorted to extreme measures, from announcing an award of Rs 6 lakh for information to unleashing riot-control tactics to disperse the crowds. Several vigilante groups armed with lathis and axes emerged to patrol the streets at night. A 70-year-old man in Anantnag died after being hit by a brick by a group of people who suspected him to be a braid chopper.

But now, police say the paranoia and panic was fuelled by nothing substantive.

""Almost all the cases turned out to be without any substance. There were a few cases where the women had cut their hair themselves. In one case, a maid had cut the hair of a girl,"" said additional director general of police (law and order), Muneer Khan. In Kulgam, where 21 cases had been registered, the state government had formed a special investigation team(SIT). Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP), Kulgam, Aijaz Ahmad, who was part of the SIT, said that most of the cases have been closed because the allegations had no factual basis.

""In some of the cases, the culprits remain untraced, while maximum cases turned out to be of hysteria,"" Ahmad said. He said the lack of a single eyewitness in all of the cases was particularly baffling.

Across the valley, the police arrested between 70 and 80 people, including members of vigilante groups, for ""raising false alarm about braid chopping and creating disturbances"".

""We felt that this [braid chopping] was being done by agencies. It was a matter of honour of our women. Everybody wanted this should end. Stone pelting was the only option with us. Surprisingly it did end abruptly after that,"" said a villager from north Kashmir who requested anonymity. Some of them are still visiting the courts for hearings.

BLUE WHALES AND PHONE BANS

It was around 5pm on July 29 last year when Manpreet Singh Sahani climbed on the ledge of his fifth-floor apartment. As he teetered on the edge, neighbours and witnesses on the street below called out to him but could only watch helplessly as he jumped. Initial investigations by local police and testimonies of his friends exposed talk of the Blue Whale Challenge. Several of them took to social media to blame the game and link it to Sahani's death.

In 24 hours, reports of the supposedly lethal game had inundated media, and reports of copycat cases were streaming in from all parts of India, ratcheting up paranoia about mobile phone and internet use among teenagers and their parents. Over the next two months, more than 150 deaths or injuries across the country were alleged to be linked to the game.

But while police initially suspected the boy was an avid gamer and could have been influenced by the Blue Whale Challenge, detailed investigation indicated more offline triggers.

""The boy was in love with a girl who had left him for some other boy. We had gone through his email accounts and mobile phone and found a draft on the phone which clarified his intention to commit suicide,"" said Navin Reddy, deputy commissioner of police Zone 10.

This might not be an isolated phenomenon. Earlier this year, Union minister of state for home Hansraj Ahir told Lok Sabha that a committee formed under the chairmanship of the director general of the Computer Emergency Response Team-India (CERT-In) couldn't establish the involvement of the Blue Whale Challenge in any case.

""The committee analysed the internet activities, device activities, call records and other social media activity, other forensic evidences and also interacted with rescued victims associated with these incidents,"" the minister told the lower house.

Of course, by then several other central ministries, a number of state governments, the Central Board of Secondary Education and even the Supreme Court had got involved, with the apex court calling the game a ""national problem"".

But experts say official agencies may have jumped the gun. ""It was definitely a hoax. We need to shift focus from these voyeuristic things and to suicides, which is a big problem that kills a quarter of a million people. Some of these hoaxes have a life of their own because media makes them into a big story. We need long-term institutional solutions,"" said Soumitra Pathare, director of the Centre for Mental Health Law and Policy.

THE BIGGEST TRAGEDY

Back in St Mary's hill, Chandra Maya Sarki has gone back to her old routine -- wake up at the crack of dawn to draw water, fix food for her husband before he leaves for his daily wage work, and then clean their small wooden house. She likes to keep the television on and stray dialogues from the afternoon soaps animate the living room. She stares not at the screen, however, but at the the small framed photo of Sarki hanging on the blue wall, wondering why the mysterious admins of the Momo Challenge chose her child as their prey.

She doesn't know yet that the cyber cell of the West Bengal police has completed its forensic probe of his phone and found no trace of any Momo Challenge. ""If any application is downloaded, the forensic machine would find a trace, even if it is an unknown application. But we have found no such application, or any message on WhatsApp motivating people to play the game. We have found nothing so far,"" said a senior official of the cyber cell on the condition of anonymity.

She doesn't know that police has ruled out any links between the game and the death of Aditi Goyal and that at least two other cases in the state have been found to be hoaxes traced back to mischief makers sending scary messages through WhatsApp. She doesn't know that Sarki's teacher Sarita Sharma has a simple explanation for why he and his friends would go to the graveyard at night -- the mobile network was the best at that spot.

All she knows is that her beloved younger son will no longer come back home at 8pm every day. That she will never make him his favourite meal of dal-aloo and dum-eggs. The money she had been saving with her husband to send him to Bengaluru for higher studies now seems meaningless. Sometimes she talks to Sarki's sister, now in college, about him and the day that took him away from her. She will probably never know what really happened to Sarki or what troubled him enough to withdraw from his friends. Momo Challenge or not, that is the biggest tragedy of all.

According to a Hindustan Times report, 20 students of Chikkamagii primary school in Hunagunda Taluk of Bagalkot district fell sick after a lizard reportedly fell in the sambar served to them. They were rushed to the hospital following vomiting and diarrhoea. the report added.

In the second case, 30 students from Hagalur village in Siruguppa taluk of Ballari district needed medical attention as they felt dizziness and had instant stomach ache and vomiting after having lunch at the school. However, the reason for the students' illness is yet to be traced.

""When the students started vomiting, they were rushed to the Government hospitals in Karur and Kottur. After being given medicines, some of them recovered, while a few have been shifted to Vijayanagara Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS).

According to the Siraguppa Police, students were immediately shifted to VIMS in four ambulances. Superintendent of Police Arun Rangarajan, after speaking to the hospital Superintendent and the admitted students confirmed that the students fell ill after they consumed the food served to them.

""A lizard had fallen into the food,"" he said. Hospital sources, said all the 13 students who were brought to the hospital are now out of danger. They are now kept under observation, added sources.

The incidents have been reported only a few days after the death of 15 in Karnataka's Sulavadi after consuming poisoned prasad from a temple."

Though no official instruction has been issued to the educational institutions in this regard, panicked authorities have decided to serve eggs in noon meals and substitute it with the vegetarian fare.

Last week, the death of a large number of crows and pigeons had triggered panic in the district with locals suspecting bird flu. Around 30 crows and pigeons had died mysteriously in Nayabazaar, Badapadaia, Atharbanki, Neheruabangla and Sandhkuda in Paradip. An alert was sounded and surveillance intensified in the coastal pockets. Veterinary officials had collected samples and sent those to Animal Disease Research Institute (ADRI) lab in Cuttack for tests.

Nearly 1.75 lakh students from Classes I to VIII in 1,381 Government schools are being provided with MDM. Every Wednesday and Saturday, eggs are being served to each student. Following bird flu scare, panicked parents and students urged the school authorities not to supply eggs in the noon meals.

Sarat Kanungo, headmaster of a Government-run school, said, ""We had no intention to provide bananas and 'pakodas' under MDM scheme. But following pressure from the parents, we distributed these snacks to students.""

Meanwhile, the move has not been taken lightly by the School and Mass Education department. District Education Officer (DEO) Prativa Manjari Das visited different schools and issued show-cause notices to several headmasters for supplying 'pakodas.'In view of avian influenza, Puri district administration had also prohibited eggs in schools and Anganwadi centres recently.

In February, bird flu was reported from the port township after samples collected from different poultry farms and dead crows tested positive for the H5N1 virus. Around 1,823 birds were culled and 2,109 eggs destroyed in the wake of bird flu confirmation.

ONE OF the things that Shanti, 35, the wife of the watchman and assistant cook at the Kichugutti Maramma Temple in Suluvadi village in Karnataka's backward Chamarajnagar district cannot understand is why her husband is being considered a suspect in the December 14 poisoning death of 15 people at a temple event.

""Would he have fed our own daughter if he was aware that there was poison in the tomato rice served as prasad in the temple and would he have eaten it himself?'' she asks at her home in the temple's backyard where she lives with her extended family.

Shanti lost her 12-year-old physically challenged daughter Anitha after she consumed the pesticide-laced food served at the foundation stone laying ceremony at the Kichgutti Maramma Temple on December 14. Her husband Puttaswamy -- the assistant cook and watchman at the temple -- is battling for life in a hospital in Mysuru for the past three days. His name is among seven listed in an FIR by the local police while registering a case of culpable homicide.

""My daughter was one of the first to die that day. My two younger daughters, Arathi and Lavanya, went to school but Anitha went to the temple where her father was working to eat the prasadam. My husband fed her and ate some himself. She collapsed at the temple itself and he brought her home saying she was unwell but he was unwell himself,"" Shanti said.

Along with Putaswamy, head cook Eranna and his main assistant Lokesh, who were in the kitchen that morning, figure among the list of suspects possibly involved in spiking the temple prasadam with poison on December 14. They too are in hospital.

Invesigations have found that a highly toxic pesticide -- monochrotophos -- was deliberately mixed with the food, an official involved with the probe indicated on Tuesday. Another police officer in the region, however, said the police were still waiting to question the cooks before arriving at any conclusion.

""One of the problems that we are facing is the fact that the three persons who were involved in the cooking that morning are still in hospital. We have not been able to question them as yet,"" a local police officer said.

One of the angles of investigation being pursued by the police has been to look at all those involved with preparation of the food and the temple festivities and to look closely at anybody who may have avoided eating the food knowing that it was poisonous and those who stayed away from the event despite being closely associated with the temple.

Among those who have been questioned since the poisoning incident are the temple manager Chinnapi -- a cement merchant, and a vice president who reportedly was among the first to arrive at the temple premises on the morning of the incident when the cooking began. A Lingayat seer who heads the temple trust but did not attend the foundation laying ceremony for a ""gopuram"" at the temple last Friday has also been questioned.

The Kichugutti Maramma temple is located on the fringes of forests on the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border around 200 km from Bangalore in what was two decades ago an area dominated by forest brigand Veerappan and his gang. The once obscure temple has become popular in recent years with devotees developing great faith in the diety.

On Tuesdays and Fridays, when special poojas are held, hundreds of people from surrounding villages -- including Tamil Nadu which is barely six km from Suluvadi village -- visit the temple, says Ponappa, a truck driver who lives next to the temple.

Along with the inflow of devotees, the temple's bank accounts too have grown. One of the lines of police investigation revolves around a dispute between the trustees of the temple and a seer who heads the trust with the seer being reportedly upset over being sidelined by other trustees like temple manager Chinnapi.

""The president of the trust wanted to spend Rs 80 lakh for the construction of the gopuram but the other trustees said the temple's bank accounts had only around Rs 40 lakh of funds. The president was upset after the trust went ahead with the gopuram construction plans,"" says Santosh, temple manager Chinnapi's son.

""My father and others in the temple management did not eat the meal served that day because they were busy with the pujas,"" he said.

Following the food poisoning incident, the Kichugutta Maramma Temple has been shut down by local authorities and wore a deserted look on Tuesday. ""This is not how the temple would look on a Tuesday. There will be hundreds of people,"" Nandish, a local said.

There is great anger among locals over the poisoning incident. ""Whoever is behind this must go to the gallows,"" says Kempamma, an elderly shop keeper outside the Holy Cross Hospital, located 43 km from Suluvadi where the first batch of 64 people who showed symptoms of poisoning were taken last week. Over a 100 people were affected by the poisoning."

A fascinating excerpt from heart surgeon Dr Raamesh Koirala's Charles Sobhraj, Inside The Heart Of The Bikini Killer.

'Sir, I will make the skin incision.'

'And I will cut his sternum.'

The two young doctors -- Subita and Ansu -- rattled off their wish-list in a single breath. It seemed like a pledge. Or a demand. I cannot say what exactly it was.

I was used to seeing these young doctors giggling and gossiping every day, always as cheerful and excitable as schoolgirls.

Their conversations usually seemed merry, far away from thoughts of dusty Kathmandu or its political system.

Neither of them had even bothered to register their names in the voter list for the recent local election

And yet, all of a sudden, they were making demands like these. No giggles. No smiles. Just a final, unchangeable decision.

They looked at me with solemn faces, determination writ large in their eyes. After a moment's consideration, I nodded, and pretended to get back to my papers.

From the corner of my eyes, I could see their excitement -- the excitement to cut open Charles Sobhraj's chest.

Subita and Ansu had been working at the hospital for a year. They had made up their minds to resign before something happened to change the course of their lives.

It wasn't unusual in the medical community for young doctors to take time off for postgraduate entrance examinations.

But both of them had postponed their plans for one reason -- to witness the surgery that would fix Charles Sobhraj's heart

Now, not only were they getting a chance to witness the surgery but they would be an integral part of it. They would see his heart beating, almost human and yet not quite.

I was beginning to understand their excitement.

****

'Hey! Did you know I am repairing Charles Sobhraj's valves?' I was back home and called out to Poonam, my wife. She was in the kitchen, marinating a chicken for dinner

Poonam is a doctor herself and is always very interested to hear about the cases I pursue. But today, she did not answer.

Perhaps she hadn't heard me.

'I am fixing Charles Sobhraj's heart,' I repeated.

She turned around to look at me. There was no excitement on her face, no happiness for the challenging case her husband had been entrusted with. It was most unusual.

Okay,' she said.

It dawned upon me at that moment -- the reason for her cold, almost scared, response.

Poonam's father had been a junior police officer at Tihar Jail in India, the jail from where Charles Sobhraj had escaped several years ago.

Although Poonam had then been a little girl, she had watched her father fret every night, consumed by anxiety and unable to sleep.

And now her husband was talking about the same notorious man -- Charles Sobhraj.

My wife spent the next couple of hours locked up in her room. From the sound coming through the door, I could guess what she was up to.

She was watching YouTube documentaries on Charles. She wanted to find out all she could about the con man, the cold-blooded murderer who had brought untold trauma to her father and had now sprung up in her husband's life.

During dinner that night, I tried to read her emotions. It was a quiet and tense meal; Poonam's mobile phone was lying next to her plate, overheated from streaming one video after another.

I could still see a film by National Geographic on the screen, paused midway.

My wife met my eyes, voicing a question I had no idea how to answer.

'Does he even have a heart?'

In the coming week, the ICC Cricket Championship was set to start. I was eagerly waiting for it.

I was rooting for India to win, primarily because of Mahendra Singh Dhoni. I will admit, I am quite an M S Dhoni fanboy, and became a fan of the Indian cricket team mainly because of him.

The recent news about Dhoni giving up his captaincy had dismayed me, but even so, it was thrilling to see him sail through as a batsman, scoring a thousand, 5,000, and then, 10,000 ODI runs!

I was thinking about him as I finished my routine duties at the hospital.

It was Wednesday -- my outpatient clinic day. I completed my rounds of the ICU and the wards by 11:30 am and headed towards the OPD -- room number 16.

I switched on the light in the corridor. In the waiting area, patients sat waiting for me, chatting with their friends and relatives.

Some of them called out to me in greeting. I smiled at them and opened the door to my room.

And I saw him. Mr Hatchand Bhaonani Gurumukh Charles Sobhraj. The infamous con man, the serpentine murderer, now in his early seventies.

He sat there inside my cabin, handcuffed, and surrounded by four policemen.

I sat down on my chair and switched on the patient-call machine. Charles Sobhraj hurried towards me almost as soon as I had pressed 1, 2 and 3.

'Hey, doctor! Can you help me?'

'Hello,' I said, quickly looking at one of the policemen. I was distinctly uneasy, seeing four burly, uniformed men in my clinic, all guarding my patient as if he could dash off any minute.

'Please sit down,' I pointed to the stool opposite my chair.

'Can you fix a meeting with my doctor? I think I need heart surgery.'

I tried to look nonchalant. I did not particularly want to divulge that I knew all about his ailment.

Navin and I had discussed at length the specific type of surgery that Charles needed.

It had been all we had talked about ever since we first got the news. Moreover, I could guess where this conversation was headed.

'I think Dr Navin was supposed to operate on you. What happened?'

I wanted to play a purely defensive game, just like Rahul Dravid batting in front of the wickets, extremely conscious of Shane Warne's bowling.

'Not him. Can you fix a meeting with my doctor?'

'Who is your doctor?' I persisted.

As an MS Dhoni fan, I was ready for the helicopter shot, if only I was offered a relatively loose ball.

'I heard that my doctor is climbing the mountains.'

Mountains? Really? Even though I had once gone to the Annapurna base camp and had recently returned from a subalpine meadow, I was no mountaineer. 'Who?'

'They told me Dr Koirala had taken an off for climbing.'

Ah, there were two Dr Koiralas in the hospital. I jumped at the chance to hit his off-stump yorker. 'Which Koirala?'

'No, no, not that one.' For someone new to the hospital, he seemed uncannily aware of all its doctors. 'I want Dr Ramis Koirala from Gangalal.'

Oh, god.

'I'm Raamesh Koirala. Is it me you are looking for?'

His facial expression changed; his jaw dropped visibly. He probably remembered me from one of his old visits.

There was that time when he had even allowed me to click a picture. He had probably put me down as a member of the paparazzi.

For a few seconds, he didn't say a word. I enjoyed those seconds tremendously.

'Are you the Dr Ramis Koirala?'

It is Raamesh, I wanted to pinpoint again. I hated it when people mispronounced my name.

'Doctor saab, he wants you to correct him the operation,' one of the policemen -- an assistant sub-inspector -- stepped forward. 'We had to take him back last week.'

Normally, I didn't take too long to decide the cases I wanted to handle. Previously too, I had been approached by friends and relatives of my ex-patients, people who selected surgeons based on recommendations, much like the movies they watched.

But this time, it wasn't that straightforward to say yes. I knew I had to review many aspects first.

Would I be able to reschedule my operating list? Or would I need to operate him on overtime? I needed to talk to Navin -- his surgeon-in-charge -- about this swapping.

I also had to check with the hospital administration on the procedural requirements of admitting a convict of such monstrous reputation from the central jail.

But most importantly, I had to convince myself that I was steely enough to operate on a cold-blooded killer. For all my medical experience, this was something I had never done!

I found myself unable to decide. As a doctor, it was my moral -- and professional -- responsibility to attend to my patients, even if their occupation was murdering people.

But that morning, reluctance prevailed. I looked at my medical officer, Sabita. Her face was blank.

'Let's meet another day.'

Doctors are said to be bound by the Hippocratic oath that prohibits them from refusing medical treatment to anyone, on any basis.

Being the best student of my batch in medical school, I had enjoyed the rare luxury of standing next to the dean and leading the oath-taking ceremony.

But neither the original text in Latin nor its Ukrainian translation at the L'viv Medical Institute had anything about not being allowed to refuse treatment.

The fourth point of the Code of Conduct of the Nepal Medical Council did have something to that effect, but I found it incomplete:

Will not allow consideration of age, sex, religion, nationality, ethnicity, politics, or social standing to intervene between my duty and my patient.

So? I wasn't! He wasn't my patient at all, and government hospitals have a rule against the swapping of doctors without mutual consent.

I could just tell Charles Sobhraj that I was following the norms of the medical practice

Poonam was very decisive.

'No. You will not do it. Just tell them so outright.'

While I understood her sentiments, I could not share them fully.

One night, I heard her talking on the phone with her father. 'Why is this happening to me?' she said. 'Why is that sick man a part of my life in two different countries, involved with the only two men I love? Is destiny giving me an ominous sign?'

I was sitting on the balcony, sipping tea and brooding over my wife's worries, when Madan, Charles's doctor-in-charge at the central jail, called.

'Raamesh, please take over the case of Sobhraj.' No small talk, no background. Here was a senior doctor issuing an order to me, all under the guise of 'please'.

I was glad I was finally speaking to a doctor in the know-how of things, someone well-versed with Charles's case.

Surely, he could tell me why it was so important that I perform the surgery, even when Navin -- the designated surgeon -- was fully capable.

'Why must it be me?'

'His plea created a huge drama. That's why we want you to operate.' He paused.

I got the feeling that if it hadn't been for the plea and the international media coverage that followed, Charles would have probably been operated upon while I was in Khaptad.

'Dai, I don't understand. He is imprisoned for life, isn't he?'

'Yes.'

'Is there any harm to you, Nepal, or even the mankind if he dies?'

'No.'

'Will you get a promotion if he gets cured?'

'No.'

'Will you face any inquiry if he dies during or after the surgery?'

'No.'

'But he is still important for us?'

'Yes.'

'Then why am I being involved?' I was getting tired of his monosyllabic yes or no answers.

He spoke after a moment or two. 'I am pretty sure Charles Sobhraj will pass his last days in the Golghar. But we cannot afford his death during heart surgery.'

'Why not?'

'Don't be naive. It would lead to so much international defamation you cannot even imagine!'

'So, you'd rather put my reputation and entire career at risk than risk the life of a convict slated to die one day in jail?'

'You are free to think that way, bhai. Anyway, you are not well known, are you?'

I abruptly disconnected the call. I didn't like the tone that doctor took with me -- I don't have false notions of being a world-famous doctor, but I was certainly not inferior to the murderer.

Madan's phone call ruined the rest of the evening for me. I tried to seek some consolation from the India-Pakistan cricket match for the ICC Champions Trophy.

But it did me no good. I kept waiting for Dhoni to bat, to inch towards 10,000 ODI runs, but his turn never came.

He came to my outpatient clinic first, for preliminary scans. I glanced at the policemen accompanying him, peering slyly through my spectacles, and wondered what weapons they possessed.

Charles looked frail and sick, seemingly having aged several years in a few weeks. If it had been anyone else, even the prospect of 'escape' would have been ludicrous. But this was Charles Sobhraj.

A few hours earlier, we had completed our preparations for his stay. It was a deluxe cabin, charged at 3,000 rupees a day.

We decided to keep his whereabouts a secret -- no patient's name on the whiteboard, simply to trick the media.

Five gunmen had been designated to guard him continuously. Ram had also requested to keep Sobhraj handcuffed throughout his time in the hospital.

'Do I have to pay?' Charles raised his eyebrows.

'Forget about the pay. Instead, pee.' His creatinine levels, a marker of kidney function, were unnaturally high and constantly rising.

A creatinine reading of 211 micrograms per litre was not good news for a patient about to undergo heart surgery.

I administered some diuretics and also added a dopamine infusion to his medicine chart.

The dopamine, a catecholamine, would help boost his heart's pumping capacity and assist it in delivering more blood to the kidneys.

I am a heart surgeon. I had taken on many challenging cases in the past -- cases that demanded swift decisions. 'A surgeon's hands must never shake; his mind must never double guess itself,' one of my professors in medical school would always say.

And yet, that day, decisions didn't come easily to me.

I knew the slightest error in judgement could set me up for a public trial. In a feudal society, a teenager could be beaten to death for the crime of -- or merely the suspicion of -- pickpocketing.

A girl could be beaten, fed human excreta, and tied to a tree for supposedly being a witch. When the public meted out justice, everyone was the police, the law, the judiciary -- all at once.

If something happened to Charles, I knew my fate was sealed for me. I would be called Doctor Death until I breathed my last. Success was my only hope of escaping that fate.

I spoke to Charles, 'Whenever you go to the toilet, measure the amount of urine and inform the nurse. Don't forget. I need to know that the drugs are working as they should.'

Charles turned out to be a model patient. By Sunday morning, his urine volume had reached seven litres.

The swelling in his leg had gone down considerably, and his breathing had also eased a little. The creatinine levels were down to 180 micrograms per litre.

If nothing else, it was a welcome sign that his kidneys could function well, if only the heart would allow it.

It made me feel a little better to note that the catecholamine was working; it had managed to power up his heart's contractions, leading to better blood flow to his vital organs, especially his kidneys.

'I feel better, doctor.' Charles gave me a small, watery smile on Sunday afternoon while nibbling at a lychee.

Earlier that day, a representative from the French embassy had turned up with a basket of lychees and mangoes.

I couldn't imagine why the embassy held him in such high regard, calling every day to inquire about his well-being, sending people with baskets of fruit.

If only they gave half of this consideration to our campaign to free the pavement for pedestrians!

By Monday morning, Sobhraj's creatinine levels were down to 155 -- only a little higher than the average mark.

Another significant decision now faced me -- the specific type of surgery to perform on his heart valves.

I was desperate to conduct a successful operation, to see Charles emerge alive and healthy. There was no scope for error, human or otherwise.

'When do you plan to operate?' On the day of admission, Shakuntala Didi asked me.

'I am arranging for the blood donors as you asked.'

'Sometime next week,' I said vaguely. Mondays and Thursdays were my operation days, but I had yet to accept the finality of it all.
