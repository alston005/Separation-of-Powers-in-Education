Supaul, where several girls were recently brutally thrashed while playing in their school compound, claims its heritage from Sita. This did not hold much meaning for the boys and their parents involved in the incident. The official website of this border district of Bihar presents an impressive list of measures taken by the police to ensure security and peace. These measures didn't suffice to help the 10 to 14 year-old girls who protested against the lewd messages conveyed on their hostel walls.

The school where the girls reside carries the name of Kasturba Gandhi, Mahatma Gandhi's wife. Residential schools like this one were set up all over India under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA). This national flagship programme started when the Vajpayee-led NDA government pushed enrollment and retention rates in elementary classes to levels few could have imagined and many still refuse to believe. The Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (KGBV) scheme forms a glorious chapter of SSA. The purpose of setting up these schools was to give rural girls who had dropped out of school before ending the primary stage a second chance. Instead of asking them to go through the primary stage again, Kasturba schools offer a full-time residential opportunity to start at grade 6 level and finish grade 8 when everyone else does.

This goal seems tough and unrealistic when you hear about it for the first time. Only when you visit a Kasturba school do you realise what astonishing success this scheme has had. Despite extremely modest financial support, KGBVs have been doing remarkably well, in terms of retaining the girls they admit from marginalised sections, including the Schedule Castes, Scheduled Tribes, the minorities and upper castes below the poverty line. The government has announced expanding the scheme to class 8. Let us see whether this move brings substantial funds to improve teacher emoluments and living conditions for the students.

The Supaul incident raises some familiar questions once again, but it also asks us to worry about the tedious sluggishness in policy making. Press reports of the incident suggest that the girls were attacked because they resisted lewd remarks. The boys who had threatened to harm them and then carried out the threat, were from the same village where the KGBV is located. For them and their parents, who assisted them, the name Kasturba Gandhi apparently meant little. That the awful attack occurred barely a week after the fanfare of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi had started reveals how tough the task of reviving Gandhi's message of practising non-violence through self-restraint might prove in the current social climate. This climate is characterised by hostility towards girls. The mix of backgrounds among the girls who got badly injured makes us forget the common element in their lives -- poverty. Their parents prefer to let them stay at a poorly funded hostel because conditions at home are worse.

This is not the first time that a KGBV has faced a security breach. Housed in rudimentary buildings, many KGBVs are, in fact, quite insecure. The parents who send their daughters to study in these rural residential schools value the opportunity which they cannot otherwise afford. As it happens in all schemes meant for the poorest sections of society, the infrastructure and services are also minimal. The Supaul KGBV is attached to an existing junior school. Until a few years ago, the state government ran some of the KGBVs with help from the Mahila Samakhya, a reputed programme of women's empowerment. The Mahila Samakhya leadership imparted both efficiency and institutional capacity to the KGBVs under its care.

Sadly, that era is now over and KGBVs have lost their special status. The larger umbrella of SSA has been shrinking, both financially and spirit-wise. Lack of motivation and adequate funds to keep up with inflation cannot be compensated by the supply of smart boards and digital devices announced recently. Compromised provision for basic needs like food, healthcare and security has restrained the progress of many KGBVs, especially in northern India. Poorly trained staff and vulnerability of employment have also enfeebled the scheme. In the Supaul incident, the staff's role and response are being probed, and this will not be easy, given the political volatility of rural Bihar.

For years, the KGBV scheme has been waiting for a long-term policy to guide its progress. I recall the debate held more than a decade ago about the future of these schools. The question was whether they should multiply as stand-alone institutions or gradually merge into the larger system. The question derives its importance from the Right to Education (RTE) Act. If RTE is fully implemented, there will be no ""drop-outs"", hence there shall be no need for KGBVs. It is clear by now that RTE will continue to face chronic inadequacy of funds. It is also facing sloth and apathy of the old directorates of education in many states. That means KGBVs will remain in demand, and if that is the case, they will need a longer-term plan and infrastructure. Temporary arrangements will not do.

All over northern India, the structures created under SSA, including KGBVs, carry a ramshackle look. You don't need to be told that they serve the poor. Their role in improving gender parity is submerged in coping with poverty and its numerous consequences. In her book, Education, Poverty and Gender: Schooling Muslim Girls in India, Latika Gupta has examined the varied effects of poverty on girls' educational experience. Her analysis demonstrates that for schooling to make a dent on the effects of poverty, financial and pedagogic inputs will have to be radically enhanced.

A correspondent of the BBC's Hindi service spoke to one of the girls who became unconscious when she was assaulted and had to be admitted to a hospital. She recounted that the attackers had come armed with sticks. Her description invokes an ethos one can hardly associate with education. The authorities probing the attack on Supaul's KGBV should also worry about the education of boys enrolled in the nearby school.

But as the Centre has not released sufficient funds, the state government is thinking of shutting down the scheme while continue some of the projects implemented under it that can be managed through state funds.

According to sources in the Department of Primary and Secondary Education, the Central government had to allocate '1,679 crore (total project cost per year), but it has cleared only '1,007 crore. An official source from SSA said, ""Out of '1,007 crore sanctioned for Karnataka, the Centre has been giving only '577 crore which comes up to 57 per cent of the amount. This sharing of the total budget is based on a 60:40 ratio (Central and state).""

This year, the Centre has released only '266 crore which is not sufficient for the activities to be carried out throughout the state, said an official. Due to the shortage of funds, several activities under SSA were being taken up at the end of the academic year, said officials.

More than 12,000 teachers recruited under SSA have not been paid salaries for six months for which the department is blaming the Centre of not releasing funds.Department officials said '1,000 crore is needed to pay the salaries of the teachers, but the Centre has released only '320 crore and asked Karnataka to manage the rest with the state funds.

Even Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy mentioned about this during a public event recently.

Integrating three old schemes and giving it a new name for the sake of rationalising resources is no path breaking move and definitely not something the HRD Minister should take pride in.

The Minister of Human Resource Development Prakash Javadekar is undoubtedly the most reformist minister in the history of independent India when it comes to higher education. The Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Autonomy Bill, the initiative to provide graded autonomy to higher education institutions, the initiative to develop 20 institutes of eminence, mainstreaming of Study Webs of Active -Learning for Young Aspiring Minds(SWAYAM) etc. have won him his place in history books already.

Given all this, it is perplexing that his interventions in the school education department have been feeble, centralising and devoid of the spirit of deep reform. Make no mistake, the Department of School Education has done some excellent work in teacher education reforms, instituting National Assessment Survey etc. But the fundamental recasting of school education that has been crying for reforms has been met with the new Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan(SMSA).

The SMSA integrates the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) that is targeted at primary schooling (Class 1-8), Rashtriya Madhyamik Siksha Abhiyan (RMSA) that is targeted at secondary schooling (Class 9-12) and Teacher Education (TE). A new Centrally sponsored scheme, a bureaucratic behemoth, is thus created. The budget allocated for SSA and RMSA is about Rs. 30,000 crores for the fiscal year (FY) 2018.

The rationale for the integration of the new schemes, as explained by the government, is that there is a need to rationalise resources. It contends that upto school level there are personnel who deal exclusively with SSA or RMSA. New initiatives such as more allocation for Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya(KGBV), the allocation for Khelo India etc. have also been made, though these initiatives could have been carried out independent of the integration.

If the government wanted to undertake path-breaking reform and leave footprints in the sands of time, the last thing for it to do was to let the zealous bureaucracy do a rejig of bureaucratic programs to solve the problems created by the very same bureaucracy in the first place and then rechristen it with a similar name. This gives way to usual opposition jibes on the government of doing namesake reforms. If the government intends to leave an imprint in the school education system it could have looked at it as-is, at the interventions that are required, at the opportunities for liberalisation that could lead to accountability and efficiency, look for silo-breaking opportunities with the work of other ministries etc. Reforming the right to education(RTE) act, erecting a sane regulatory structure for low-cost private schools, though beyond the scope of the SSA rejig, remain pipe dreams.

The old SSA has been successful in erecting educational infrastructure in every nook and corner of the country. For primary schools, the enrolment has been close to 100 per cent. The focus now is on learning outcomes that have been exposed by the NAS and Pratham's ASER. This would have been an excellent opportunity to decentralise and place lower primary education (classes 1 to 5) in the hands of the state governments. An integration with the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) run by the Ministry of Women and Child development would have provided a seamless graduation of the child from anganwadis to primary schools. By placing the onus of lower primary schools on the states, accountability could have been fixed. The State Council Educational Research and Training (SCERTs) and District Institute of Education and Training (DIETs) would have been rejuvenated naturally to cater to the needs of primary schools, instead of the belaboured top-down approach recommended under the new SMSA. These institutes would have been tasked with creating curriculum and offering lessons in local languages. The feet of the Chief Minister and the State Education minister would have been held to the fire for outcomes. Remember, till the 1976 constitutional amendment, education in its entirety was on the state list of the constitution.

The central government could have squarely focussed on the higher primary and secondary segments, basically from class 6 to 12. Bringing together programs from the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Sports and the Ministry of Skill Development would have provided a platform for issues relevant to adolescents to be looked at in a holistic fashion. A good high school education pretty much would imbibe in a child all the skills and competencies required for it to make a decent living. College education would be for further specialisation.

The enrolment ratio of upper primary school is at 91 per cent and secondary school is at 78 per cent. The infrastructure in labs and pedagogy is still evolving. This should have been the exclusive focus of the Department of School Education under MHRD. It should have re-engineered the RMSA into incorporating exciting new advancements in technology, pedagogy and remodelled it into a flagship program destined to take our young minds into the new era. Concepts like the NITI Aayog pioneered Atal Tinkering Labs, vocational education, a remodelled curriculum on our history and culture would have been welcome.

Now under the new SMSA, both the centre and states can blame each other for underperformance. It is also strange that the ideas put forth in the forward-looking India Action Plan of 2016-19 created by the Niti Aayog are not applied in spirit.

The Congress, although, has no moral authority to criticise the new SMSA, for this would never come up if not for the mess it created. And about Arjun Singh and Kapil Sibal as HRD ministers, the less said, the better. The left-liberal intelligentsia that loves centralisation and sarkari control would have no qualms with the new RMSA, at least philosophically. This government alone could have done it.

We may have to wait for at least six years for structural reforms in school education because post-2019, neither will the National Democratic Alliance (NDA)-III want to touch it again nor will the United Progressive Alliance (UPA-) IV have the stomach for it."
