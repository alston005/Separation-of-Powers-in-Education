Higher education director Dhiren Kumar Pattnaik in a letter to the regional directors in Bhubaneswar, Sambalpur and Berhampur said the purpose of their visits may not be fulfilled unless they give the feedback on their observations in time.

There are certain rules for regional directors to visit colleges to ensure quality education as well as maintenance of proper academic ambience. They observe availability of basic amenities of the colleges, educational atmosphere, library condition and other teaching-learning related issues during their visit.

But the real purpose behind the visits is not being served as the director, higher education, is not receiving feedback at the appropriate time, said Pattanik.

He asked the regional directors, who visit the colleges, to submit a brief note, highlighting the lacuna, deficiencies and irregularities noticed in the educational institutions. The visitor will also mark a copy to the principal of the college, said the director.

The regional directors may also submit their 'detailed' reports within three days of their visit. In addition to this, if situation warrants, the regional directors may submit a detailed report along with documents to the director within three days of such visits, said Pattanik in his letter.

An official of the higher education department said the regional directors should actively report to the director on the same day so that immediate steps can be taken for solution of a problem. If they take a long time to file the report, it will affect the decision-making process and create a problems in addressing the issues immediately, the officer added."
