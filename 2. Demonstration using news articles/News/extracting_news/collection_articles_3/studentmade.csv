A norm challenged by a 22-year-old law student resulted in the Supreme Court invoking the axiom 'sun is the best disinfectant' as it turned its gaze inward to make the judiciary more transparent.

A petition filed by Swapnil Tripathi, a final year student studying for an BBA LLB at the National Law University, Jodhpur, and clubbed with a batch of pleas by a few others prompted the apex court to allow live streaming of the opaque proceedings within.

Tripathi, who hails from Kanpur and has a keen interest in Constitutional law, wanted to challenge the denial of access to interns to Supreme Court proceedings on Mondays and Fridays, days marked for fresh filings.

When he was interning with Supreme Court advocate Rishabh Sancheti during his third year of college, he felt that live streaming would give interns critical lessons in courtroom practices as well as make trials more transparent for litigants and the public at large.

""During the course of my internship, I worked on a lot of important matters which were listed on Mondays and Fridays. As interns we have plenty of theory in law schools but we can only see for ourselves the practical aspect of how arguments are made,"" he says.

When he suggested to Sancheti that the existing rule was against the interest of interns, the advocate advised him to contest it since he felt so strongly about it.

Last December, Tripathi filed a petition after thinking about the idea for a year.

Besides Tripathi, four other law students joined the cause with applications this year. The petitions included those filed by senior advocate Indira Jaising and an NGO, the Centre for Accountability and Systemic Change.

On September 26, a bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra (now retired) and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud ruled that initially a pilot project may be started by live streaming cases that are of constitutional and national importance, and excluding those involving juveniles, marital and sexual assault cases to protect identities.

According to the Constitution, courts are supposed to be open to the public. But Tripathi, left, says, that hasn't translated to actual experience for many litigants.

""I experienced it because when the case was on I had to travel from Jodhpur to Delhi each time, and I used to find out three days before the next date of hearing and had to make travel arrangements immediately.""

At times he couldn't reach or had to rely on seniors to inform him about the progress in the courtroom. He also met people who travelled from across the country but were unaware of what transpired in cases involving them.

""Live streaming allows people to see what happens when they can't physically be present in courts. People won't be misled, as sometimes even reporting can go wrong.""

The Bar Council of India requires interns to work with lawyers who practise in the Supreme Court and high courts. In his petition, Tripathi argued that the prohibition violated the fundamental right of learning for interns.

""I understand courts are extremely crowded with lots of lawyers, and constrained. So one of my prayers was that if you are not allowing interns inside the court, get a live streaming room within the premises.""

He also cited the example of the US, where the Supreme Court uploads the transcripts of all oral arguments of entire proceedings on its Web site.

A month later Jaising also petitioned for live streaming of all cases.

Article 145 of the Constitution allows the apex court to frame its own rules. Once it does so and paves the way for live streaming of cases, Tripathi feels, the Supreme Court is hinting at extending the practice to the lower judiciary depending on the success of the pilot."

The police said he wanted to avenge an assault on him last year that had made him ""a laughing stock in his village"".

Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Anto Alphonse said the arrested accused, Anshu, a resident of Haryana's Sonepat, was arrested from Delhi's Najafgarh on Tuesday, when he had come to meet his relatives. A pistol and two cartridges were recovered from his possession, the police said.

Alphonse said, ""Anshu was wanted in a double murder case that was registered at a police station in Haryana's Sonepat on September 24. His five accomplices had already been arrested by Sonepat police.""

During questioning, the DCP said, Anshu disclosed that he is a first-year (BA) student at Swami Shraddhanand College and took to crime after falling in bad company.

""Anshu had a rivalry with one Aashish alias Ashu from Haryana's Halalpur. Last year, he got into a fight with Aashish during a wedding. Aashish allegedly thrashed Anshu, who, as a result, became a laughing stock in his village,"" DCP Alphonse said, adding that Aashish had allegedly started throwing his weight around after the incident, threatening others by saying that he would beat them up the way he assaulted Anshu.

Police said Anshu has confessed that he decided to kill Aashish since he was enraged by his boastful nature. Hence, he roped in his friends Sandeep, Rohit, Mannu, Arun and Kartik, all residents of Narela, to help him kill Aashish.

On the day of the crime, the six waylaid Aashish and opened fire at him. When Aashish's brother Himanshu rushed to his rescue, the attackers shot him as well. They then fled the crime scene. The two brothers were admitted to a nearby hospital, where they succumbed to the bullet injuries during treatment.

Police said the murder case was registered on the basis of a complaint filed by the family members of the dead brothers. During probe, police identified the attackers and arrested five of them. Anshu, however, fled the city and was hiding at various places in Haryana till he was caught by the Delhi Police on Tuesday, police said."

This incident took place about two years ago however she soon began to claim that she was pregnant with the baby of this then 17-year-old boy.

As per reports by Daily Mail, the 29-year-old physics teacher named Ellie Wilson from Dursley Gloucestershire grew fond of this boy in an outdoor camping holiday to Africa. It is said while they were returning from Africa in a flight they had sex. It began from the seats of the plane wherein the teacher is said to have 'performed a sex act on the boy', and then she led him to the toilet of the flight wherein they had proper intercourse. Since the toilet was excessively small like how most flights have, the teacher 'perched on one leg in the cramped toilet.'

Reports also have it that Wilson later told the boy that she was pregnant and that she was going to opt for abortion. However, it didn't stop there they kept meeting and went on dates. As per reports, they went to Nando's and a park. The boy also got her flowers and chocolates as he believed that they were in a relationship.

However, all this would have carried on if the friends of the boy wouldn't have gotten jealous of him. His friends were envious and tried to blackmail the teacher to have sex with them, or they would reveal their secret."

Although the alleged gang-rape happened last month, the story has come to light now after the girl confided in her sister about the brutalities committed to her. This was after the class 10 student fell sick and had to be sent for medical examination, which revealed that she was pregnant.

Police have detained four students and at least five officials including the principal, administrator and hostel caretaker have been arrested.

Nivedita Kukreti, SSP of Dehradun, said, ""Our Child Welfare officers and members of the child protection committee spoke to the girl, who said that she had been raped.

According to the complaint, her seniors had called her to the school's store room on 14 August, a day before the independence day ceremony, for some programme preparations. They allegedly took turns in raping her after she reached inside the storeroom.

""The school management tried to suppress the case. The girl says she reported the case to the ayah the same day. But they tried to dissuade her to report. After a month, the crime has come to the knowledge of police,"" NDTV quoted Additional Director General of Police Ashok Kumar.

The school administration also allegedly tried to terminate her pregnancy by mixing her drinks with suspicious medicines."

He left his college education midway to land in Mumbai (then Bombay), where he went on to become not only a great singer, but also earned fame as an actor, lyricist, composer, producer, director and screenwriter.

On one hand, I know how badly it feels to be trapped under a mountain of debt - I graduated with close to $70,000 in student loans.On the other hand, I don't regret taking out loans to fund my education. It's not like I don't understand how much debt I'm in - I reported on student loans and higher education for over a year for work. It's just that I think of those loans as a necessary investment in myself and my career.

I'm a first-generation college student, and my entire life, until I graduated from high school, was focused on getting into college. I had an idea in my head of how it would play out when I got there: I would read (and understand) novels by Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, have philosophical debates with my group of new friends, and contemplate the merits of a two-party political system.

Most of all, I wanted a degree. It was the only thing I could see as the difference between having to work an endless series of part-time retail jobs in a small town (which wasn't something I wanted) and having a successful career - even if I couldn't yet see what that would look like. College was the golden ticket to a life where I had the freedom to choose how I lived.

It didn't help that I grew up with a somewhat negative relationship with money. My dad worked multiple jobs while I was a kid, and I could feel the ripples of stress that coursed through our house when money was in short supply. So, knowing from countless hours of research that four years in college could cost upwards of $200,000, I stressed about paying for it all throughout high school.

As time went on, and I saw all the hidden expenses associated with going to college, I also worried about paying for flights home, food outside the dining hall, occasional nights out with friends, and the opportunities that the rich kids never had to think twice about, like getting to a job interview downtown and looking the part.

Taking out student loans didn't seem like a choice to me - It was imperative, a fact of life. I always knew I'd have to make sacrifices and work hard for my education. And I thought the debt would ultimately be justified.Excluding my first semester, I always worked at least two part-time jobs alongside a full course load to be able to afford my new life in Boston. Of course, my close-to-minimum-wage jobs couldn't cover everything. So I ended up racking up a few thousand dollars in credit card debt over those four years, in addition to my loans. But I was just so grateful to be there.

Going to college gave me the space I needed to figure out what I wanted to do with my life, to get internships, and to make connections that enabled me to get paying gigs later on.

I may not have ever put my ""Intro to Archaeology"" knowledge to practical use, but I was able to eliminate ""archaeologist/Indiana Jones"" from my list of dream careers. And I value the fact that I was able to make a list that had room for careers as audacious as that.

If I hadn't have gone to college, I may have eventually been able to figure out that I wanted to be a writer. But I don't think I'd be where I am now, or even close to it.

That doesn't mean my career is going perfectly, or that my student loan payments have gone off without a hitch. I got laid off from my first post-grad job a week before last Thanksgiving, and it's taken almost six months to gain any real traction as a freelance journalist. But I work in an industry where that kind of instability is common. And after covering student loans as a journalist, I'm fortunate to know how to navigate my debt with confidence, even when money is tight.

Student loans can be an oppressive force, one that can prevent you from doing what you want to do and living how you want to live. And predicting the amount of debt you'll graduate with can be a difficult task. (Based on my freshman year aid package, I thought I'd graduate with about $35,000 in loans and ended up with nearly double that.) But I can't say I agree with people who insist it's better to skip college altogether than to graduate with debt.

I don't regret my student loans. And I don't think it's fair to tell people like me, those who would be the first in their family to go to college and don't come from money, that this opportunity - which has long been touted as a surefire path to upward mobility - isn't an good option."

A case of ragging has been reported from Kolkata's St. Paul's Cathedral Mission Engineering College.

Biswajit Mondal, a junior and Student's Welfare Secretary, along with some other students had objected to the money collection by a TMC affiliated union in the college.

The incident happened on May 17 when Biswajit has taken shelter in the college's union room due to heavy rain. Biswajit demanded that the account details of the Student Aid being collected by the TMC affiliated union be shown. Instead, Biswajit was harassed and beaten up. His clothes were ripped off and a nude video was also shot.

The video was then shared among the students.

Biswajit Mondal filed an FIR against three people -- the union president Arnab Ghosh, a college staff member Ananta Pramanik, who was in a drunken state and an external party member SK Inamul Haque alias 'Apu'.

In his letter to the Officer-in-Charge of the Amherst Street Biswajit Mondal wrote, ""They tortured me physically and mentally, also they took an objectional video of me. The other people present there were Abhijit Dolui and he was also in a drunken state. On being asked about the aid fund, they made the video viral"".

Scott Kelly didn't always know that he was going to be an astronaut. In fact, he wasn't even a particularly good student.

""As a student, it's just really hard, especially at first, when you don't have the habit-patterns to study and pay attention,"" Kelly told Business Insider for our podcast ""Success! How I Did It."" ""But once I got over that, I was able to go from a kid at 18 years old that was always like a very average, underperforming student and then fast forward almost to the day 18 years later, I flew in space for the first time. It was a pretty remarkable comeback, I think.""

Kelly remained an average student until he went to college, where he stumbled across Tom Wolfe's book, ""The Right Stuff.""""I read this book, and I could relate to a lot of the characteristics these guys had, with regards to their personalities, their risk-taking, their leadership abilities, ability to work as a team. That made me think,"" Kelly said.

""I related to a lot of those characteristics with one exception, and that is I wasn't a good student, especially in science and math,"" he continued. Kelly said he then thought, ""Wow, you know, if I could fix just that thing, then I could maybe be like these guys.""

""At the time I was thinking you've got to be really smart to be an engineer or scientist. What I realized is really what it takes is just hard work, and it's not any particular gift you might have.""

He continued: ""It was the spark I needed to motivate me to do more with my life than I was currently doing.""

""The Right Stuff"" inspired Kelly, but it was a phone call from his brother that showed him what hard work really looks like.

According to Kelly, his twin brother Mark, who also became a NASA astronaut, was also a mediocre students - but Mark turned things around in high school, while Scott kept skating by. Mark pinpoints his turnaround to an event Scott doesn't remember.

""I was this kid that could not pay attention. Was not a good student,"" Kelly said. ""Always wondering how in the ninth grade my brother went from being like me to getting straight A's - I never knew how that happened.""

""I, on the other hand, had no recollection whatsoever of this conversation,"" Kelly said. ""Probably only because there was like a squirrel running outside the window and I was like, 'Squirrel!' Otherwise, I probably would have been a straight-A student, too.""

In his memoir ""Endurance,"" Kelly wrote that his mind began to wander and he lost focus as a student at the State University of New York Maritime College.

His grades had risen above average and he was studying for his first calculus exam. Having decided to take a break, Kelly planned to attend a big party at Rutgers. When Mark found out about his brother's attempt to forgo more studying for a party, he scolded Kelly over the phone.

""Are you out of your goddamn mind?"" Kelly remembered Mark telling him. ""You're in school. You need to absolutely ace this exam, and everything else, if you want to get caught up.""Scott Kelly buckled down, became a NASA astronaut, and has been to space four times."

Naur Gopal Maloo (21), a Chemistry student at IIT-Delhi, committed suicide in his hostel room on Friday, police said. Maloo was found hanging from a fan in his room on the fourth floor of Nilgiri Hall of Residence, at 7.15 am. A first-year MSc student, he hailed from West Bengal's Hoogli, police said. According to DCP (southwest) Milind Mahadeo Dumbere, Maloo had tried to commit suicide by consuming sleeping pills on April 10 as well. ""He was admitted to Safdarjung Hospital and was discharged. His brother, Bachoo Ram, stayed with him and he was also counselled. The reason for the suicide is being looked into,"" the DCP said.

The youngest of three brothers, Maloo was described by his friends as a bright student, and a ""simple and sober"" person. ""He told me he had got an internship with a big company in Kolkata for two months and would be going there in May. He was also preparing for GRE as he wanted to do his PhD from Germany,"" said Shamlu, a PhD student at IIT-D and Maloo's senior from Kolkata's Presidency College.

IIT-Delhi director V Ramgopal Rao said Maloo was being treated for depression. ""He was under medication.

Today morning, the student decided to end his life. We are yet to ascertain the reason behind the step.

Delhi Police has arrested a 25-year-old man for allegedly abducting and killing a 21-year-old Delhi University student in southwest Delhi's Palam village. While police had been looking for the boy from the time he was abducted, they found his body on Wednesday night and arrested the accused on Thursday afternoon. Enraged by police inaction initially, the victim's family has alleged lapses in the investigation and claimed that ""police only acted on the complaint they had filed after recovering the body"".

Joint CP (New Delhi) Ajay Chaudhary said, ""The accused, Ishtiaq Ali. has been arrested. Ali and the victim, Ayush Nautiyal, a student of DU's Ram Lal Anand College, met 10 days ago via a social networking site. Over the last 10 days, they met thrice. Ali bludgeoned him to death with a hammer after an argument.""

Chaudhary said the accused works as a sampling manager for various export houses and is a former student of a fashion institute. ""He confessed to the killing and admitted that he did it after an altercation. He also admitted to making ransom calls to Nautiyal's parents to divert their attention so that he could dispose of the body,"" he said.

Police said Nautiyal went missing on March 21. ""He told his mother that he was going to a college fest. In the evening, his father Dinesh Nautiyal received a WhatsApp message from Ayush's phone. The message had a photo of Ayush tied up, with his mouth covered and an injury on his head. The sender demanded Rs 50 lakh ransom. The father approached police and an FIR was registered,"" police said.

""The kidnapper first asked the family to meet him in Najafgarh on March 25. But when they reached the spot, they received a message which asked them to come to Dwarka. When they reached Dwarka, he asked them to come to Mohan Garden in Uttam Nagar. On March 26, the family was asked to come to Munirka, where they were asked to put the ransom amount inside a dustbin. But soon after, he asked them to meet him the next day. On March 27, the kidnapper did not communicate with the family. On March 28, Ayush's body was found inside a drain,"" a police officer said.

Speaking on the investigation, Chaudhary said they had formed 13 teams to crack the case after the FIR was lodged. He said they tried to locate the victim based on technical surveillance and other inputs from friends and family. ""Ayush's phone was switched off and the abductor was only using WhatsApp. We questioned several people and scanned CCTV footage,"" he added.

During investigation, police found that the victim had been meeting strangers he met on social media. ""Based on the input and technical surveillance, we identified Ali, a resident of Uttam Nagar.""

During questioning, the accused confessed to killing Ayush the day he met him and disposing of his body a day after.

Following police's direction, the victim's father negotiated with the kidnapper, who was communicating with them over WhatsApp messages and calls. They finally struck a deal for Rs 10 lakh and Dinesh took loan from his relatives to arrange for the ransom amount.

Claiming carelessness on part of police, Ayush's cousin Nikhil Singh said, ""Police were not investigating the matter seriously. We requested them to involve the Crime Branch repeatedly but they kept ignoring us.""

Replying to the allegations, DCP (southwest) Milind Dumbere said, ""We were communicating with them from day one and put in all efforts to find him. It is a debatable issue if the family says they were dissatisfied with the investigation."" Dumbere, however, did not reply on why no other specialised unit was roped in to help with the probe.

Or is it a non-existent problem cooked-up by opposition parties to tarnish the Narendra Modi administration? Forget the politics of it, if you are a serious observer and are tired looking for missing government data, or are tired of surveys on employment/unemployment trends, you should probably look at what's happened in Mumbai, which suffered local train chaos earlier in the day.

Police were caning students, who, in retaliation, were throwing stones at policemen, and were shouting slogans demanding a meeting with Union Railway Minister Piyush Goyal. They are seeking an assurance on jobs. There is no better example to understand and assess how serious the jobs problem is in the country. Hundreds of youngsters thronging streets seeking jobs and livelihood assurance is something one typically observes in countries ravaged by war, terrorism or racial madness or, let's say, failing economies. Which of these problems is India facing at this juncture?

If one looks closer at the issue, what happened in Mumbai earlier today isn't unique to Mumbai but is present elsewhere in the country. According to reports, this round of protest is being carried out by activists of the All India Act Apprentice Association (AAAAA), demanding scrapping of the 20 percent quota, and jobs for all local candidates who clear the All India Railway Act Apprentice Exams. The protesters claim that they had taken up their demands with the Railway Minister Goyal, who met them. But there has been no progress in the matter.

But there is a larger issue here, as this Economic Times report shows, the Indian railways alone has received 1.5 crore applications this year for 90,000 railway jobs, which also includes 63,000 jobs in the Group D, a category that is reserved for gangmen. What does it tell us? Had India's private sector companies, start-ups, SMEs or MSMEs done their part in absorbing the new workforce, we wouldn't have seen such a large number of students desperately thronging for government jobs, including group D jobs. This is nothing but fact. India's unemployment problem isn't a non-existent one. It is present and real. As columnist Vivek Kaul points out in his piece, citing a recent estimate made by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, in 2017, two million jobs were created for 11.5 million Indians who joined the labour force during the year.

One of the biggest concerns for any observer looking at the economy is to not have enough data on what's happening on the ground. When you talk about jobs, that fear may be coming true for India. The last time the labour bureau released job data, it showed that unemployment rose to a five-year high of five percent in 2015-16. This rate was actually 4.9 percent in 2013-14. In 2015-16, the unemployment figure stood at 8.7 percent for women as compared to 4.3 percent for men, 5.1 percent in the rural sector and 4.9 percent in the urban sector. According to this report in the DNA, which cites a recent reply by Minister of State for Labour and Employment (independent charge) Santosh Kumar Gangwar in Parliament, the Labour Bureau under the ministry has not conducted any survey to find out the actual data of employment in the country since 2016.

India's unemployment rate in % under the usual principal status (UPS) approach Year In % Male Female Rural Urban 2009-10 9.3 2011-12 3.8 2.9 6.9 3.4 5.0 2012-13 4.7 4.0 7.2 4.4 5.7 2013-14 4.9 4.1 7.7 4.7 5.5 2015-16 5.0 4.0 8.7 5.1 4.9 Note: Labour Bureau did not bring out any such report for 2014-15. Source: Fifth annual employment-unemployment survey 2015-2016 at all-India level

If this is indeed the case, the government doesn't even have an account of the job situation on the ground. But there are important signals coming in, like what happened earlier today in Mumbai's suburbs. The bigger danger is when unemployment becomes the subject matter of protests; it easily connects with the unemployed youth across state boundaries. There is no caste, religion or demographic divide when it comes to a fight for jobs. Protests can spread like wildfire. A bigger problem is in the making then. Particularly, in the context of the Mumbai student protests, there have been cases of suicides in connection with the job issue. This is evident from what the protesters said. ""There has been no recruitment since last four years. We are struggling from pillars to post. Over 10 students have committed suicide. We cannot let such things happen,"" one of the protesting students has been quoted as saying.

If one looks at the job scenario in the country today, one can safely say that Narendra Modi's biggest opponent in the 2019 general elections will not be Rahul Gandhi, or a united Opposition that the Congress vice-president has been talking about -- it will be the lack of jobs for youth in India. In August, 2017, An India Today-Karvy Insights Mood of the Nation poll, conducted among a sample of 12,178 people across the country, provided some warning signals to Modi. It said 53 percent of the voters polled believe that the grim jobs scenario signals a deeper economic crisis. The scepticism on jobs is 17 percent higher than a similar survey by the same surveyor six months ago. Failure to give jobs could turn the 133 million first-time voters Modi is targeting in 2019 against him. The signals of this are already evident.

This means if this government fails to generate sufficient jobs (which is largely the case so far), the biggest challenge Modi and his campaigners will have to face will be the possibility of the same 133 million - the new workforce - turning against the government. The warning signals were present all along.

The 2016-17 Economic Survey authored by Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian said, ""Employment in India poses a great challenge in terms of its structure which is dominated by informal, unorganized and seasonal workers, and is characterised by high levels of under employment, skill shortages, with the labour markets impacted by rigid labour laws, and the emergence of contract labour."" In four years of Modi rule, the unemployment rate in India has actually gone up, going by the available data so far. The government has attempted to counter this problem through various schemes such as Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAYNULM) and Mudra loans, but what these have achieved is too little compared to the targets facing the government. The regime should first acknowledge the problem at hand, else a crisis is in the making.

According to the class 2 student's father, her daughter Meena was made to clean one of the toilets at Garhi-Harsaru Primary Government School on Thursday.

Prem Lata, district primary education officer, said, ""I have ordered an investigation into the incident. So far, what we know is that the child had thrown water in the washroom. Whatever the truth is will come out once the probe is over.""

The school principal, Veena Sharma, has refuted the allegation. ""I am the head of this school, how can I ask the students to clean the washrooms. This is not ethically right. Nothing like this has happened."" Another teacher from the same school, Shobha Sharma, said, ""After the morning assembly, some of the teachers told few children going to the washroom to flush water in the loo as a foul smell was coming. We didn't do anything wrong. We did this to encourage hygiene among the kids.""

The school has 255 students from Class 1-5 with eight teachers, two of them being male. ""We don't have a permanent sweeper. The temporary sweeper comes in the morning. We do encourage kids to flush water inside the loos to maintain cleanliness,"" said Shobha.

On Thursday, TOI found a student painting a blackboard at Government Middle School Shivaji Nagar. This was termed as an extracurricular activity of the school. ""The painter did not paint all the blackboards correctly. The paint was left in some boards. In such a situation, children can help us out. This gives them a lot of scope to learn,"" said school principal Madhu. ""The case of a child painting a black board in school is not in my notice.
