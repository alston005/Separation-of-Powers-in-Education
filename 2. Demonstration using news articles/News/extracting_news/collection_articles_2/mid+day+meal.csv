(HT File)

With some school headmasters (HMs) dragging their feet over paying penalties for allegedly inflating attendance of students, the Bihar government has finally decided to recover fines by deducting the amount from their salary.

The HMs allegedly spiked attendance of students to claim more funds under the mid-day meal(MDM) programme.

Though the government received reports of irregularities long ago and imposed financial penalty on HMs, the fines could not be fully recovered. Many of the HMs moved court for relief citing their unwanted involvement in non-academic work, while others were just indifferent.

The government has ordered the recovery of a Rs8.68-crore penalty from HMs. Of which, Rs 4.21-crore (48%) has been recovered. More than 1,000 HMs have allegedly fudged the data since 2013, when the idea of penalty was first mooted by the state education department.

RK Mahajan, principal secretary of the department of education, recently directed all district programme officers (DPOs) to deduct the penalty amount from headmasters' salary in five instalments over as many months.

""The DPOs must ensure a monthly deduction from all those who have not deposited the penalty amount within a month of the receipt of the letter, except those who have got stay from the court,"" stated a letter by Mahajan.

""During inspections, the attendance of that particular day in the school and the average of the previous week is matched. If the deviation is within 10%, there is no issue. However, if the deviation is above 10%, a penalty equivalent to the amount given in the last three months is imposed on the headmaster,"" said Vinod Kumar Singh, director of the mid-day meal programme, .

Another official said that in several cases, the accused HMs with the help of their association approached the Patna high court or the Lokayukta, claiming that they were overburdened with non-academic work like management of MDM. The court has also asked the government to find an alternative to free teachers from MDM responsibilities.

Though the Bihar government tried to hand over MDM to NGOs or self-help groups (SHGs) and also ran pilot projects, a viable alternative has not been found because of the scale of the programme. In Bihar, despite a drop in enrolment numbers, 1.20 crore students from Class 1 to Class 8 are estimated to avail MDM daily.

In a Niti Ayog meeting a few months ago, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar advocated the direct benefit transfer for the centre's flagship MDM programme to plug leakages. ""Cooking in schools has a direct bearing on education. Instead of centres of learning, schools are viewed as centres of food. Poor quality and unhygienic conditions often lead to unpleasant incidents,"" he had said.

However, to achieve this, the Centre would have to change the policy at the national level, which seems unlikely. Bihar, on its part, has been seriously mulling the option of handing over MDM to women SHGs, which are 8 lakh in the state, the highest in the country. A pilot project has been launched in one block each of Jehanabad and Muzaffarpur to assess the feasibility."

Raising concerns over the ""meagre salaries"" paid to cook-cum-helpers working under the centrally sponsored 'Mid Day Meal' scheme, CPI national secretary D Raja called it a matter of national shame and demanded their pay be hiked.

Addressing a rally of Mid Day Meal (MDM) scheme workers organised by eight different trade union bodies at Jantar Mantar here, Raja said there are about 26 lakhs MDM workers at the grass root level and 98 per cent of this work force are women.

The scheme was launched on August 15, 1995, and covered under the National Security Act, 2013.

""It is a matter of national shame that the Mid Day Meal workers are paid only Rs 1,000 per month and that too for only ten months a year,"" Raja said.

The objective of the scheme was to boost universalisation of education by increasing enrolment, retention and attendance and improving the nutrition levels of students. In 2001, the Supreme Court had made it mandatory for the government to provide cooked meal to all children in primary schools.

""Working around six to eight hours a day including in the preparation, actual cooking and distribution of foods, cleaning the vessels and premises etc, they are not even recognised as workers and not paid minimum wages,"" he alleged.

The demands of All India Federation of Mid Day Meal Workers included minimum wages of Rs 18,000 per month, implementation of the recommendation of 45th and 46th Indian Labour Conference, to give them 'worker' status, ensuring social security and recognise the mid day meal workers as the fourth grade employees among others.

On Monday, a six-member delegation led by D Raja, the Rajya Sabha MP, met Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and handed over a memorandum with demands of mid day meal workers to him.

According to the delegation, the Finance minister responded positively and promised them of an increase in monthly wage of the MDM workers at the earliest.

Tithi Bhojan is a concept of providing nutritious food with community participation. It encourages families and religious/charitable institutions to donate food on special occasions like birthdays, anniversaries, festivals and other

important days.

As per orders, the ministry wants local village residents and communities to contribute and organise a feast for kids to celebrate 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi. Following orders from MHRD, the state education department of Punjab too issued orders (dated October 12) to all schools to organise Tithi Bhoj for children on October 31. The school heads have to ensure that children are served some delicacies on October 31, not regular menu which they are served daily.

'Tithi Bhoj ' be organised with the community participation on 31/10/2018 and 2/10/2019,' say the orders.

Former HRD minister Smriti Irani had mooted the proposal to incorporate concept of Tithi Bhoj in mid-day meal in October 2014 and wanted other states to replicate Gujarat model, months after NDA government led by Narendra Modi came to power. Irani wanted all states in India to replicate Tithi Bhoj model of Gujarat where community participation is encouraged to serve food in schools. However, not many states had shown interest and it could not be implemented in all states.

Speaking to The Sunday Express, Prabhcharan Singh, general manager, Mid-Day Meal Society, Department of Education, Punjab, said that concept of Tithi Bhoj was similar to concept of 'langar' in Punjab. ""In both practices, community participation is encouraged. On special occasions, community members can contribute food for children's mid-day meal in local government schools. However, this is the first time that MHRD has issued orders to organise Tithi Bhoj on two particular days as part of Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary celebrations. It will be organised on October 31 this year and then October 2 (Gandhi Jayanti), 2019. We have ordered schools to implement it. They can either seek help of gurdwaras and local families to prepare feast for children or cook some delicacies in schools itself. Earlier too, when proposal was mooted in 2014 by former MHRD minister Smriti Irani, Punjab had no problem with it. In fact, we had even implemented it for few months and collected food materials from those who wanted to donate. But we do not collect any funds. Those who want to contribute can give food items only.""

He added that schools can organise Tithi Bhoj as per arrangements they have and there is no particular menu. ""They can prepare some desserts like kheer, halwa, other sweets or serve chana-poori, halwa-puri or something which is not served as part of regular menu. We have not given specific menu items so that teachers are not troubled but Tithi Bhoj has to be organised on October 31 and children should be served a feast in memory of Mahatma Gandhi,""

said Singh.

The Punjab education department has directed all government schools to use powdered milk (dry milk) to prepare kheer, which is served once a week as part of the mid-day meal menu to children. The powdered milk will be supplied to schools by government-run cooperative MILKFED (which runs VERKA milk plants across the state).

As per the notification issued, schools are required to use seven grams of milk powder per child for making kheer. The milk powder will cost Rs 273 per kilogram; this amount will be paid to MILKFED from the ration amount they are granted for mid-day meals. Besides increasing the sale of milk powder, sources said, this step by the government has been taken to ensure children consume kheer prepared from ""quality-tested"" milk as earlier, schools purchased milk from local dairies and other shops which do not undergo a quality check.

Also, with adulterated milk widely being sold across Punjab, one needs to ensure children are not made to consume the same.

The order, however, clarifies that MILKFED will supply 10-kg powder milk cans to schools with 150 children or above. In other words, government schools with less than 150 children (mostly primary and in far-flung villages) will have to arrange the item on their own.

Welcoming the government's decision, Amarjit Singh, a government school teacher from Mansa said, ""Some schools are already using powder milk as it is easier to handle and store. Also, it tastes better and children prefer powdered milk in the food they consume.""

Another teacher from Ludhiana, Dharamjit Singh said, ""There is not going to much of a cost difference as a kilogram of powdered milk can be used by several students when compared to liquid milk. Also, it is easier to store powdered milk.""

Punjab State Education (elementary) Director Inderjit Singh, ""We have taken this decision as MILKFED agreed to supply powdered milk to our schools. The quality of milk had become a cause of worry as adulterated milk is openly sold in the market. The powdered milk by MILKFED passes through several checks.""

Singh added, ""The only concern might be cases of theft. Some people can try and steal to take the milk powder home. We need to look for a solution for this soon.""

The incident took place in Palharia village in Sitapur district's Pisawan block. As the word spread that a 'lower' caste woman was cooking the meal, parents of the schoolchildren gathered at the school and protested against her hiring. Eventually, only six of the 76 students enrolled in the school had the food. The remaining rotis and the potato curry had to be thrown.

Palharia village has 50-odd households and is mostly populated by Yadavs and Brahmins, deemed upper caste. A few Scheduled Caste families also live here.

Parents prevented their children from eating mid day meal prepared by a lower caste cook in Uttar Pradesh's Palharia village. Rahul Arora

Golu Singh, a local journalist working with a news channel, informed that the school's regular cook is a Yadav. He said Rama Devi, who hails from the Arakh caste (listed as a Scheduled Caste), was roped in on Friday to fill in for the regular cook, who had taken a day's leave. He said that parents of the students thought the regular cook has been replaced. He also added that the caste equation continues to remain an important matter in these villages.

School principal Manoj Kumar told 101Reporters that when parents came en masse and asked their children not to have the food, he tried to reason with them but to no avail.

A Class 4 student, Ashish, who only gave his first name, told this reporter that he saw Rama peeling potatoes when he came to the school in the morning. He said she asked him if he'll have lunch and he refused. He said that for five years, they have been having food prepared by chachi (the regular cook) and they won't accept Rama. When asked what was wrong with Rama, he seemed unsure.

""What do I say! What do I say! If all the children eat, I'll also eat,"" he said defiantly, seemingly annoyed at the question.

Condemning the incident, former IPS officer and social activist SR Darapuri called for an inquiry. He said boycotting the cook is in direct violation of an order of the Uttar Pradesh government. He said the order, issued as per the direction of the Supreme Court, asks that people from socially backward castes be hired as cooks to eradicate the concept of caste-based discrimination from the minds of children.

Further, he demanded that the role of school principal and teachers too be probed as they are also responsible for shaping children's mind.

District Basic Education Officer Ajay Kumar refused to comment on the incident. Sub-divisional magistrate of Maholi town in Sitapur, Neeraj Prasad, assured an inquiry would be held. He said the administration will also take action against those found guilty if the cook chooses to file a complaint.

A minimum monthly wage of Rs 18,000 -- this was the resounding demand which united workers from across industries, and across the country, at Parliament Street on Wednesday. Prajeesh from Kerala's Kannur rattled off a list of workers at the rally from his village: ""Water authority employees, handloom workers, construction workers and mobile tower employees. Everybody is here to demand minimum wage and to protest against contractual labour. We want our jobs to be secure and permanent.""

A sizeable part of the crowd were women -- Asha workers, anganwadi employees and mid-day meal cooks. ""Fifty women who cook mid-day meals in primary schools have come together from my district,"" said Kanaklata Das (41) from Koimari village in Assam's Kamrup rural district. ""We get paid just Rs 1,000 a month -- far less than colleagues in other states -- after putting in six hours of work a day. We are even made to clean toilets and children when they soil themselves... We are not paid for two months a year -- July, during summer vacations, and December, even though schools are closed for just half the month.

Renu Devi, a widow from Bihar, claimed 200 mid-day meal workers from her district get paid Rs 1,250 per month and had come to the rally.

Each demand was similar yet different from the others. Manju Begum (35), who accompanied Kanaklata Das's delegation, is an anganwadi worker from Rampur, Assam. ""The Rs 3,000 a month I get is low anyway, but we are also made to do additional government work like paperwork for the NRC process...,"" she said.

Roshni Kamble (32), an Asha worker from Nagpur, contended that their working conditions are worse than that of anganwadi workers. ""We are on duty 24/7 as a child delivery can happen anytime. We regularly deal with tuberculosis patients. But we make Rs 500-1,000 a month,"" she said.

Many at the rally were unemployed and demanded generation of work opportunities. Among them was Gopal K (62), a mason from Kozhikode in Kerala, who said: ""I want to be given work up till my death. I used to work on a daily wage basis for Rs 500 and haven't got work for a very long time.""

Cops arrested five persons near Limbda Chowk in Rajkot and seized 2,000kg rice and 600kg wheat from them.

In Rajkot city, food is supplied under the mid-day meal programme to about 15,000 children from the 334 government primary schools and anganwadis everyday. Those arrested were identified as Rahul Dholakia, Nizamuddin Ali Hussain, Lala Khan Rahmatulla Khan, Kanavibha Bharvad and Arjun Singh Sikh. Two Delhi-based traders Ankur Jain and Niranjan Jain of Sree Shakti Traders were also booked along with the five accused for criminal breach of trust, cheating and criminal conspiracy.

Investigating officer sub-inspector P B Kavana of Pradhuman Nagar police station said that the accused used to divert about 25% of the foodgrains supplied by the central government for the mid-day meal programme into the open market every month. He added that the arrested accused Arjun Singh acted as a coordinator on behalf of Sree Shakti Traders while siphoning off foodgrains to local traders like Dholakia. Sree Shakti Traders were given contract to supply foodgrains to schools and anganwadis.

Late night on Sunday, a police team intercepted a truck and a tempo filled with foodgrains near Suchak School, where the central kitchen has been set up for supply of cooked food to children across the city.

Police said that Dholakia and Bharvad were driving the two vehicles, while Hussain and Rahmatulla Khan were labourers seated in them. When they could not produce documents for the foodgrains, they were taken into custody and questioned. Dholakia told police that he had bought the foodgrains meant for mid-say meal from Arjun Singh and late night on Sunday, he was arrested from his house in the city.

Kavana told TOI, ""The accused have been operating this racket since long. The Sree Shakti Traders was blacklisted last month by the Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) for supplying substandard foodgrains.

The civic body just can't seem to get its mid-day meals right. It turned out to be a poisonous Thursday at Bhandup's Sahyadri Vidyamandir, after 16 students and a teacher landed in hospital with complaints of stomach ache and vomiting on eating the dal rice served in the school yesterday. While all are stable now, it has once again raised serious concerns over the meal scheme.

The trigger

Though Sumit Dongarkar's mum packs a tiffin for him every day, he looks forward to the brunch served in school, and Thursday was no different, said his mother Sonali, as he loves dal rice.

The 13-year-old and his friends ate the meal with relish during the recess at 9.50 am, but shortly after, trouble started. At first, a Std VII student began vomiting, but soon, more complained of stomach ache and nausea. After other students began throwing up, the school authorities rushed 16 of them, and a teacher, Vidya Lad, who'd tasted the food as per protocol, to Mulund Agarwal Hospital. Sonali Dongarkar said, ""Sumit is doing fine now and is under observation.""

Who's responsible?

School authorities said that for the last one and a half year, around 700 students have been eating the meals prepared by Lingeshwar Mahila Bachat Gat. Parents told mid-day that VII-C is the first to receive the food every day, and while 16 from the class of 40 took ill, others remained unaffected. ""Everybody is stable now. But this has shaken the kids and our trust. Who will take the responsibility for it?"" asked Aruna Poojari, a parent.

Another, Aditi Naik, said, ""My son, Krish, had a nasal tube attached for a while. He is okay now, but I am going to tell him not to have the meal again."" Several parents complained of being kept in the dark about the incident. ""The school finishes at 12.30 am. When I went to receive my daughter, she never came out. Then, a friend of hers told me what had happened. I felt dizzy on finding out, but I rushed to the hospital,"" said Lalita Shinde.

Hospital dean Dr Usha Mohprekar said, ""All are stable now. We have moved them to the general ward for observation. Prima facie, it looks like food poisoning. An inquiry will be conducted.""

Sampling the fare

Principal Narsingh Mane told mid-day, ""The staff were prompt in giving required care to the sick children, all from one division. The food had come from Lingeshwar Mahila Bachat Gat, which has been providing it to us for a while now. So, we are not sure what went wrong. Samples of the food have been submitted to authorities for testing.""

BMC education officer Mahesh Palkar said, ""We have collected raw as well as cooked food samples from the kitchen of the organisation. The kitchen looked neat and tidy; nonetheless, experts will test the samples to end the inquiry conclusively. Until the investigation report is out, we have ordered the organisation to not supply food; its contract with the civic body will be subject to the probe report.

""The organisation provides mid-day meals to 25 other schools in the vicinity. So, while the investigation is on, all these schools will have to make alternative arrangements."""

(Representational)

At least 644 kitchen-cum-stores for mid-day meals are yet to be constructed in Manipur due to the diversion of funds amounting to Rs 14.02 crore under the National Programme of Mid-Day Meal.

According to a report by the auditor general, on March 2011, the Government of India had approved Rs 40.82 crore for the construction of 1,879 units of Kitchen-cum-Store under the scheme. However, the government released only Rs 35.79 crore.

""The Grants-in-aid should be utilised for the construction of Kitchen-cum-Store under the Mid-Day Meals scheme in accordance with the provisions of the rules and diverted for any other purpose,"" the report said.

The report said that as per an examination conducted by the AG on December 2016, the additional director of education schools/valley in 2014 showed that due to amalgamation and abolition of several schools, the requirement of kitchen-cum-stores was reduced to 1,792 units. As a result, the Manipur government refunded Rs 6.52 crore, which it had considered to be an excess amount, leaving a balance of Rs 29.27 crore.

Subsequently, the state education department deposited an amount of Rs 1.64 crore as value added tax (VAT) and the balance of Rs 27.63 crore was transferred on December 2015 to the accounts of the Nodal Officer, Mid-Day Meal.

Out of this amount, a sum of Rs 14.02 crore was diverted between February and July in 2016 for payment of cooking cost and cooking honorarium in three instalments. As per the report, the first diversion of Rs 4.05 crore took place on February 2, followed by Rs 3.08 crore on April 24 and another Rs 6.89 crore on July 2.

The total amount was used on the condition that the same would be reimbursed on the release of subsequent funds from the Centre.

The report said the diversion of Rs 14.02 crore and its subsequent non-recoupment have stalled the construction of at least 644 kitchen-cum-stores across the state.

However, the department said that the Centre had released Rs 30.97 crore to the state as the recurring component for cooking cost till the end of 2016-17 and that the diverted amount of Rs 14.02 crore will be reimbursed as and when the fund is released by the state government.

As India witnessed an all-time high production of pulses over the last two years, the Union Cabinet has decided to dispense it to states for distribution at a cheaper price through the Public Distribution System and mid-day meal, for which Rs 5,237 crore will be spent.

Under the approved scheme, state governments can pick up 34.88 lakh million ton of Tur, Chana, Masoor, Moong and Urad at a discount of Rs 15 per kg over the wholesale market price, and distribute through mid-day meal, PDS, Integrated Child Development Programmes (ICDP) etc.

""Government will spend Rs. 5,237 crore for implementation of this Scheme,"" Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs said in a statement, adding that it will be a one-time dispensation covering 12 months of demand, or complete dispensation of 34.88 lakh million ton stock, ""whichever is earlier"".

The government is also expecting good production this Kharif season as well. The decision will also help clear-up warehouses for the upcoming Kharif season commodities procured under Price Support Scheme (PSS). The government made record procurement of 45.43 lakh million ton pulses in Kharif 2017 and Rabi 2018 seasons under the PSS.

The government procured pulses from key growing states Telangana, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Maharastra, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh among others. After two great years, pulses sowing this year has fallen in comparison. However, with adequate rains in coming months, sowing activities are expected to pick-up.

Under the PSS system, the government procures oil seeds, pulses and cotton at a minimum support price (MSP) and provides remunerative prices to the farmers/growers. It is implemented in consultation with state governments, which also exempts these commodities from several levies such as mandi tax. The central nodal agencies then make logistical arrangements for the procured commodity from its storage to the creation of funds for the PSS operations."

Midday meals for 45.7 million children for a year. One day's wages for 200 million workers under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS). About 6 million new latrines. And at least 10 more Mars missions.

These were some of the things that could have been financed with the money that the current National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government spent on publicity in the four years it has governed India.

The Bharatiya Janata Party-led government spent $753.99 million on advertising its flagship schemes in the 52 months between April 2014 and July 2018, according to the information made available to the Rajya Sabha (Parliament's upper house) by Rajyavardhan Rathore, minister of state (Independent Charge) for information and broadcasting.

This amount is double the sum spent by the government's predecessor in 37 months: The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government spent $377.32 million between March 2011 and March 2014, according to this 2014 response to a Right To Information (RTI) query filed by activist Anil Galgali.

Of the Rs 48.8 billion the NDA spent on publicity, Rs 2.92 billion (7.81%) went to advertising four public schemes in three years-Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (Prime Minister's Crop Insurance Scheme) for crop insurance, Swachh Bharat Mission (Clean India Mission) for a nationwide cleanliness campaign, Smart City Mission and Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (Ideal Village Scheme for Members of Parliament) for urban and rural development.

When these figures came to light in July 2018, the government was criticised for not investing the money in public utilities.

5K Crores spent by Modi govt on advertising! Most of the advertisements are just of Modi's face. Apart from a colossal waste of public money which could have been used to build schools & hospitals etc, it gives a huge unfair advantage to party in power https://t.co/RWnxoEJxg8

-- Prashant Bhushan (pbhushan1) August 1, 2018

IndiaSpend calculations showed that the money spent by the NDA on publicity could have been used in critical government projects ranging from child nutrition to public health and sanitation.

There's been a 34 per cent rise in govt ad spend in four years

Government expenditure on advertisements rose 34 per cent from Rs 9.8 billion in 2014-15 to Rs 13.14 billion ($203.89 million) in 2017-18.

In 2016-17, the government cut down on print advertisements and channeled money into audio-visual publicity instead. But in 2017-18, it did the reverse-it spent more on print ads than audio-visual campaigns.

The 2017-18 trend seemed to have continued into this financial year too. The government's bookings in the four months to July 2018 show that it has spent double the money on print advertising over audio-visual publicity."

The State government has decided to introduce the mid-day meal scheme not just in Intermediate colleges, but in all government-run degree colleges, and polytechnic ones as well as those offering vocational courses.

The government aims to supply nutritious food to students in these colleges spread across 31 districts in the State through Akshaya Patra Foundation and the Foundation has accordingly been asked to put in place the amenities and infrastructure required for handling the task.

The Cabinet Committee headed by Deputy Chief Minister Kadiyam Srihari held discussions with the representatives of the Foundation in this regard on Friday.

The Foundation representatives informed the Cabinet panel that Akshaya Patra was implementing Annapurna scheme since the past four years without giving scope for any complaints. The Foundation has dedicated kitchens at Kandi, Narsingi, Kothagudem, Warangal and Mahabubnagar and it is in the process of setting up six more kitchens in different parts of the State.

Mr. Srihari wanted the Foundation to prepare a detailed report on the food items that would be provided to students as well as the estimated cost that would be incurred in the process by April 6. The report would be forwarded to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, who would take a final decision on the issue. The Foundation should also conduct a trial run of the scheme in selected institutions before the full-fledged implementation of the scheme.

The Foundation representatives told the Ministers that they would follow the suggestions and ensure that a report was submitted on the requirements and cost within four days.

Today's children are the future of tomorrow, and so it's important they have access to nutritious food right from birth through adolescence. However, India ranks 10th in terms of prevalence of underweight children in the world and 17th in terms of prevalence of stunting, according to UNICEF. To ensure that malnutrition doesn't affect children's cognitive development or physical growth, the ministry of women & child development (MWCD) approved the Poshan Abhiyaan (National Nutrition Mission) last year.

The initiative seeks to reduce the level of stunting, undernutrition and low birth weight by 2% each, and anaemia by 3%. It aims to reduce stunting from 38.4% (NFHS-4) to 25% by 2022. Its goal is to achieve improvement in nutritional status of children aged 0-6 years, adolescent girls, pregnant women and lactating mothers in a time-bound manner, over three years. Poshan Abhiyaan, as a policy strengthening the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), is a boon towards addressing child and maternal malnutrition.

A key idea of the initiative is to incentivise Anganwadi Workers (AWs) for using ICT-based tools, making it easier to implement and monitor the programme.

Earlier, AWs would keep beneficiary records and indicators related to the provision of services in registers, which have now been replaced by the Common Application Software (CAS) designed especially for the programme. The data is collected using smartphones provided to AWs. This data can then be accessed and analysed by supervisors using tablets, and the block, district, state and national level ICDS officers using the reporting dashboards, provided to them. It also seeks to provide performance-based incentives to AWs to encourage them to adopt and efficiently use the technology.

The rationale is that if this data is made available to the MWCD in real time, it will help track and analyse critical nutrition and performance indicators, including weight and height of children.

The programme has also been given substantial funding and importance, and has managed to create harmony, ensure better monitoring and issue alerts for timely action. It is expected to help the government map the nutrition and growth levels of beneficiaries with great accuracy.

Poshan Abhiyaan has enhanced the efficacy of ICDS in addressing malnutrition-related issues from the prenatal stage to six years. However, considering that adequate nutrition is necessary for children aged seven and above also, efforts should be made to ensure that the benefits of this initiative reach children above six years of age. That would be possible with the convergence of the Mid Day Meal (MDM) scheme with Poshan Abhiyaan. The MDM scheme provides freshly cooked nutritious meals to children in the age group of 7-14 years as an incentive to enrol and attend school.

While schools collect data pertaining to height and weight of children, it is not collated or analysed by any central agency -- data on malnutrition in the age group of 7-14 years is not readily available. The introduction of CAS for MDM will help school authorities collect real-time data on their smartphones and send it to nodal agencies, facilitating better implementation and monitoring of the school lunch programme. This real-time data will help formulate new strategies, fine-tune existing ones and even devise local strategies to make the most of available resources. Significant reduction in malnutrition can be achieved with clear policies and targets in place. This would require scaling up of funding across all related sectors and real-time monitoring and analysis of data -- the inclusion of MDM in Poshan Abhiyaan will help in both the aspects. If done effectively, this will benefit over 94 million children. In the long run, it will help coordinate the functioning of both the nutrition welfare programmes to achieve common goals, thus making Poshan Abhiyaan a well-rounded programme.

The Supreme Court today slapped Rs 50,000 each as costs on Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu and Uttrakhand for their failure to create a online link with a chart meant for monitoring the implementation and hygiene of mid-day meal schemes in government-run schools.

A bench of justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta expressed displeasure that these three ""defaulting states"" have not yet complied with the directions of the apex court in this regard.

""In view of the default of these three states, costs of 50,000 are imposed upon these states. The amount be deposited within four weeks from today with the Supreme Court Legal Services Authority for utilisation of juvenile justice issues,"" the bench said.

Swati Narayan, a research scholar and an activist with the Right To Food campaign, recently mapped the inclusion of eggs in mid-day meals in schools and anganwadis across India using government data and media reports. The map, which looks at possible links between political ideology and the provision of eggs in these meals, was released on July 8, 2018.

Building upon Narayan's research, IndiaSpend analysed government nutrition data, spoke to several experts and government officials, and found that:

In India, 7.5 per cent children under five years of age are severely wasted-a rise of 1.1 percentage points from 6.4 per cent in 2005-06, according to National Family Health Survey 2015-16 data. All the experts IndiaSpend interviewed were of the view that eggs included in the mid-day meals of children could be a critical factor in combating malnutrition.

""Eggs will be helpful in addressing malnutrition among kids because scientific research shows that animal-based protein is better than plant-based protein,"" said Mansi Patil, a public health nutritionist and metabolism clinical dietician at AshaKiran Hospital, Pune.

Though some states in India had introduced mid-day meals earlier, this was universalised only in 2001. Eggs were first served in mid-day meals in Tamil Nadu in 1989, when the state was governed by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). The initiative started with one egg every two weeks and then was stepped up to one every week.

So why are administrations in BJP governed states-some of which, like Gujarat (39.3 per cent) and Madhya Pradesh (42.8 per cent), report a significant percentage of underweight children-not serving eggs in mid-day meals?

Officials in BJP governed states interviewed by IndiaSpend said they were concerned about offending the sentiments of vegetarians. ""In Gujarat, most of the population is vegetarian,"" said RG Trivedi, commissioner (mid-day meal scheme) in Gujarat. ""Additionally, we provide pulses daily in mid-day meals as protein-rich food, hence we don't serve eggs.""

Trivedi is correct-61 per cent of Gujarat's population is vegetarian, according to the latest available census data on food habits. This, however, is not true of the average Indian-70 per cent of Indians eat non-vegetarian food.

""You can compare protein content of vegetarian and non-vegetarian foods, but the quality of protein in eggs is higher than others according to the protein digestibility corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS),"" said Purnima Menon, Senior Research Fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), Delhi. PDCAAS is a tool to evaluate a particular protein's quality based on human requirements and how they digest it.

In Himachal Pradesh too, officials spoke of the concerns of vegetarian parents. ""We do not give eggs because of religious and cultural issues,"" said Naresh Sharma, nodal officer (mid-day meal scheme) for Himachal Pradesh. ""People in Himachal Pradesh consider eggs non-vegetarian and there are children whose parents would have problems if we served them. To avoid controversy, we don't."" The census doesn't provide data on vegetarianism in Himachal Pradesh.

Non-BJP states avoid eggs too, but BJP states most resistant

IndiaSpend investigations found that non-BJP states that do not offer eggs in mid-day meals were more constrained by the lack of resources than religious or cultural sentiments.

""Non-BJP states such as Punjab, Delhi and Mizoram also do not provide eggs.

And Jharkhand, a BJP majority state, does,"" said Sinha. ""But, in states like Gujarat and Rajasthan, you cannot even talk (about providing eggs) for the fear of hurting upper-caste Hindu sentiments. Over the years, activists have been demanding eggs, but there is more resistance in BJP states due to cultural issues.""

On April 22, 2018, the ministry of health and family welfare set off a controversy when it tweeted a stock photograph that seemed to indicate that a vegetarian diet is the only way to stay healthy. The tweet was later deleted, as Scroll.in reported on April 23, 2018.

Manisha Chachra, a research scholar in political studies at the Jawaharlal Nehru University who has studied the Hindu right-wing, explained the importance of sattvik food in its ideology. ""The BJP is an affiliate of the Sangh Parivar, which ideologically follows certain upper-caste Hindu beliefs as characteristics of Hindutva,"" she said. ""One of this is the sattvik diet, which excludes non-vegetarian food, onion, and garlic. There is a bigger dietary politics to this kind of exclusion (of eggs).""

In Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government has not been able to fulfill its promise of boiled eggs as part of the mid-day meal scheme for school, according to this April 9, 2018, report by India Today.

Sinha's argument about the need for more resources to provide eggs can be corroborated by Arunachal Pradesh's 2018-19 mid-day meal policy. ""Green leafy vegetables and fruits are available in rural areas with minimum prices and these are important items included in the menu, but eggs are not available and unaffordable,"" it said.

The north-east has a particular problem. Eggs are largely unaffordable here because there are free poultry industries, and this pushes up the price of procurement, said Narayan. ""If the central government wanted, it could have provided funds to all states for providing eggs, but it did not,"" she added.

Former union health secretary K Sujatha Rao told IndiaSpend that costs are a major concern in the inclusion of eggs in mid-day meals. ""It would be ideal to have village communities encouraged to develop hatcheries under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act scheme and have eggs provided to schools and anganwadis,"" she said. ""These interventions should be decentralised and communities should be more involved rather than only the government.""

The other view: Introduce eggs with caution

Some dieticians advocate caution in the push for eggs to be included in mid-day meals. ""We should 'introduce' eggs rather than include them,"" said Mansi Patil. ""If children are malnourished and we suddenly introduce eggs (into their diet), it may have a negative impact on their bodies. So let's say we should start with 2-3 eggs a week and then slowly increase (the numbers). We need to realise that a body needs fats and carbohydrates too. There needs to be the right mix of nutrients.""

Patil added that the number of eggs that need to be consumed depends on the kind of malnutrition a child suffers from and what kind of metabolism her body has. ""In severe acute malnutrition (SAM), as opposed to moderately acute malnutrition (MAM), we cannot introduce eggs right away. We need to focus on carbohydrates and energy first so that the body slowly shapes us to be able to take protein.""

Dipa Sinha, assistant professor, Ambedkar University, and an activist with Right To Food campaign, however, said that this cannot be a reason to deny eggs to children. ""The overall proportion of SAM kids is low so that cannot be a reason to not provide eggs,"" she said. ""For SAM kids, there is an established protocol, where they need to be taken to the hospital by anganwadi workers and treated accordingly because they are given a proper diet.""

Animal rights activists who advocate vegetarian food in the context of cruelty against poultry birds argue this differently. ""Chickens used for eggs are among the most abused animals on the planet,"" wrote Bhuvaneshwari Gupta, a former campaigner and nutrition adviser with PETA India, in June 2015 for the Huffington Post. ""Most are forced to live their entire lives in an area smaller than the size of an iPad screen. Their beaks are typically cut off with a hot blade to prevent them from pecking each other in frustration, because the industry simply won't give them more space.""

A large number of women mid-day meal workers tried to lay siege to HRD Minister Ganta Srinivasa Rao's house at the M.V.P. Colony here opposing the government's decision to introduce cluster system all over the State and run the mid-day meal scheme through private agencies.

Police did not allow them to enter the street on which the house is located, but the workers stormed through the barricades leading to arrests.

There was pushing and jostling with the protesters trying to reach up to the gate of the Minister's house. Around 3,000 workers from all over the district participated in the protest.

The women workers then came on to the national highway at Isukathota near MVP Double Road and staged a 'rasta roko' there leading to a traffic jam for sometime.

Police took some more protesters into custody there, according to union leaders.

The arrested included Mid-Day Meal Scheme Workers' Union State president and secretary G. Varalakshmi and K. Swarupa Rani respectively, district president K. Prasanna, honorary president S. Aruna and CITU district secretary G. Koteswara Rao.

The union is opposing the cluster system in which nine mandals of the district are proposed to be given to a private agency. The schools within 20 km are part of one cluster.

Workers' contention

The union contended that since the food was prepared early at one place and distributed at noon, it would lack nutritional values. It alleged that the implementation at Mangalagiri, Tulluru, Tadepalli, Gajuwaka and Rajamahendravaram showed lack of quality.

They were demanding, among other things, payment of minimum wages instead of the ₹1000 to each worker, increase in menu charges, basic facilities to prepare food, LPG on subsidy and monthly payment of bills and wages."

(HT File)

With some school headmasters (HMs) dragging their feet over paying penalties for allegedly inflating attendance of students, the Bihar government has finally decided to recover fines by deducting the amount from their salary.

The HMs allegedly spiked attendance of students to claim more funds under the mid-day meal(MDM) programme.

Though the government received reports of irregularities long ago and imposed financial penalty on HMs, the fines could not be fully recovered. Many of the HMs moved court for relief citing their unwanted involvement in non-academic work, while others were just indifferent.

The government has ordered the recovery of a Rs8.68-crore penalty from HMs. Of which, Rs 4.21-crore (48%) has been recovered. More than 1,000 HMs have allegedly fudged the data since 2013, when the idea of penalty was first mooted by the state education department.

RK Mahajan, principal secretary of the department of education, recently directed all district programme officers (DPOs) to deduct the penalty amount from headmasters' salary in five instalments over as many months.

""The DPOs must ensure a monthly deduction from all those who have not deposited the penalty amount within a month of the receipt of the letter, except those who have got stay from the court,"" stated a letter by Mahajan.

""During inspections, the attendance of that particular day in the school and the average of the previous week is matched. If the deviation is within 10%, there is no issue. However, if the deviation is above 10%, a penalty equivalent to the amount given in the last three months is imposed on the headmaster,"" said Vinod Kumar Singh, director of the mid-day meal programme, .

Another official said that in several cases, the accused HMs with the help of their association approached the Patna high court or the Lokayukta, claiming that they were overburdened with non-academic work like management of MDM. The court has also asked the government to find an alternative to free teachers from MDM responsibilities.

Though the Bihar government tried to hand over MDM to NGOs or self-help groups (SHGs) and also ran pilot projects, a viable alternative has not been found because of the scale of the programme. In Bihar, despite a drop in enrolment numbers, 1.20 crore students from Class 1 to Class 8 are estimated to avail MDM daily.

In a Niti Ayog meeting a few months ago, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar advocated the direct benefit transfer for the centre's flagship MDM programme to plug leakages. ""Cooking in schools has a direct bearing on education. Instead of centres of learning, schools are viewed as centres of food. Poor quality and unhygienic conditions often lead to unpleasant incidents,"" he had said.

However, to achieve this, the Centre would have to change the policy at the national level, which seems unlikely. Bihar, on its part, has been seriously mulling the option of handing over MDM to women SHGs, which are 8 lakh in the state, the highest in the country. A pilot project has been launched in one block each of Jehanabad and Muzaffarpur to assess the feasibility."

Akshaya Patra follows religious dietary restrictions which only allow 'sattvic', or balanced food, rejecting 'tamasic' ingredients like onion and garlic which are associated with lethargy, lack of focus and confusion. This dietary system draws from principles enshrined in Ayurveda, Yoga and the Upanishads.

The state government has pulled up the organisation for its dietary system after Karnataka's Food Commission recommended that onion and garlic be included in mid-day meal preparation.

Joint Director of Karnataka's mid-day meal scheme M R Maruti stated that onion and garlic add to nutrition and improves the taste. ""Considering this, we asked the foundation to follow the state menu, but they have not yet replied to our letter,"" he added.

Akshaya Patra has defended its food preparation norms and stated that it is already complying with all the nutritional guidelines issued by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) and the Karnataka Government.

A senior executive of ISKCON Kulashekara Chaitanya Dasa explained that the meals prepared by Akshaya Patra met the nutritional and calorific criteria set by the authorities. Chaitanya argued that onion and garlic were substituted by other vegetables with the same nutritional value. He added that they were willing to rectify if there are any issues in food preparation, but that the government could not specifically tell them what ingredients to use."

Raising concerns over the ""meagre salaries"" paid to cook-cum-helpers working under the centrally sponsored 'Mid Day Meal' scheme, CPI national secretary D Raja called it a matter of national shame and demanded their pay be hiked.

Addressing a rally of Mid Day Meal (MDM) scheme workers organised by eight different trade union bodies at Jantar Mantar here, Raja said there are about 26 lakhs MDM workers at the grass root level and 98 per cent of this work force are women.

The scheme was launched on August 15, 1995, and covered under the National Security Act, 2013.

""It is a matter of national shame that the Mid Day Meal workers are paid only Rs 1,000 per month and that too for only ten months a year,"" Raja said.

The objective of the scheme was to boost universalisation of education by increasing enrolment, retention and attendance and improving the nutrition levels of students. In 2001, the Supreme Court had made it mandatory for the government to provide cooked meal to all children in primary schools.

""Working around six to eight hours a day including in the preparation, actual cooking and distribution of foods, cleaning the vessels and premises etc, they are not even recognised as workers and not paid minimum wages,"" he alleged.

The demands of All India Federation of Mid Day Meal Workers included minimum wages of Rs 18,000 per month, implementation of the recommendation of 45th and 46th Indian Labour Conference, to give them 'worker' status, ensuring social security and recognise the mid day meal workers as the fourth grade employees among others.

On Monday, a six-member delegation led by D Raja, the Rajya Sabha MP, met Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and handed over a memorandum with demands of mid day meal workers to him.

According to the delegation, the Finance minister responded positively and promised them of an increase in monthly wage of the MDM workers at the earliest.

They spend Rs 4.13 per student of Class 1 to 5, and Rs 6.18 per student of Class 5 to 8, with the food menu decided based on the required number of calories needed each day.

However, the NGO is willing to spend Rs 8 per student with an assurance of hygienic and healthy meal.

With the contract in place,Akshaya Patra foundation will begin to supply meals in PMC run schools in Hadapsar and neighbouring areas.""The aim is to provide good quality and quantity food to the students, so we add our contribution to the existing amount spent by the government on each child. Also, our menu is planned as per the nutrition requirement along with student and teacher feedback. After Diwali, we plan to sit with the PMC authorities to discuss the details of the contract and the number of schools we will be covering. For now, we are planning to set up a kitchen in Handewadi area. It takes about 6 to 8 months to set up the facility, after which work in full swing,"" saidAmitasana Das, regional president (Maharashtra), Akshaya Patra foundation.

Tithi Bhojan is a concept of providing nutritious food with community participation. It encourages families and religious/charitable institutions to donate food on special occasions like birthdays, anniversaries, festivals and other

important days.

As per orders, the ministry wants local village residents and communities to contribute and organise a feast for kids to celebrate 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi. Following orders from MHRD, the state education department of Punjab too issued orders (dated October 12) to all schools to organise Tithi Bhoj for children on October 31. The school heads have to ensure that children are served some delicacies on October 31, not regular menu which they are served daily.

'Tithi Bhoj ' be organised with the community participation on 31/10/2018 and 2/10/2019,' say the orders.

Former HRD minister Smriti Irani had mooted the proposal to incorporate concept of Tithi Bhoj in mid-day meal in October 2014 and wanted other states to replicate Gujarat model, months after NDA government led by Narendra Modi came to power. Irani wanted all states in India to replicate Tithi Bhoj model of Gujarat where community participation is encouraged to serve food in schools. However, not many states had shown interest and it could not be implemented in all states.

Speaking to The Sunday Express, Prabhcharan Singh, general manager, Mid-Day Meal Society, Department of Education, Punjab, said that concept of Tithi Bhoj was similar to concept of 'langar' in Punjab. ""In both practices, community participation is encouraged. On special occasions, community members can contribute food for children's mid-day meal in local government schools. However, this is the first time that MHRD has issued orders to organise Tithi Bhoj on two particular days as part of Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary celebrations. It will be organised on October 31 this year and then October 2 (Gandhi Jayanti), 2019. We have ordered schools to implement it. They can either seek help of gurdwaras and local families to prepare feast for children or cook some delicacies in schools itself. Earlier too, when proposal was mooted in 2014 by former MHRD minister Smriti Irani, Punjab had no problem with it. In fact, we had even implemented it for few months and collected food materials from those who wanted to donate. But we do not collect any funds. Those who want to contribute can give food items only.""

He added that schools can organise Tithi Bhoj as per arrangements they have and there is no particular menu. ""They can prepare some desserts like kheer, halwa, other sweets or serve chana-poori, halwa-puri or something which is not served as part of regular menu. We have not given specific menu items so that teachers are not troubled but Tithi Bhoj has to be organised on October 31 and children should be served a feast in memory of Mahatma Gandhi,""

said Singh.

Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) Minister Vishwajit Rane said a team of FDA officials was sent to the two schools who inspected the kitchens of the two women self-help group which supply the mid-day meals.

""Mid-day meals at Janata School was supplied by Shri Ram Self Help Group,"" he said, adding that of 438 students who had had the meals, 38 were affected.

During discussion, he urged the teachers and parents to motivate the students to take up their studies seriously.

Highlighting state government's committed efforts for ameliorating academic environment of educational institutions, he informed that initiatives like Gunotsav were taken up as part of this.

Sonowal asked Palashbari MLA Pranab Kalita and Kamrup Deputy Commission Kamal Baishya to take expeditious steps for completion of infrastructure development works of the school.

The Punjab education department has directed all government schools to use powdered milk (dry milk) to prepare kheer, which is served once a week as part of the mid-day meal menu to children. The powdered milk will be supplied to schools by government-run cooperative MILKFED (which runs VERKA milk plants across the state).

As per the notification issued, schools are required to use seven grams of milk powder per child for making kheer. The milk powder will cost Rs 273 per kilogram; this amount will be paid to MILKFED from the ration amount they are granted for mid-day meals. Besides increasing the sale of milk powder, sources said, this step by the government has been taken to ensure children consume kheer prepared from ""quality-tested"" milk as earlier, schools purchased milk from local dairies and other shops which do not undergo a quality check.

Also, with adulterated milk widely being sold across Punjab, one needs to ensure children are not made to consume the same.

The order, however, clarifies that MILKFED will supply 10-kg powder milk cans to schools with 150 children or above. In other words, government schools with less than 150 children (mostly primary and in far-flung villages) will have to arrange the item on their own.

Welcoming the government's decision, Amarjit Singh, a government school teacher from Mansa said, ""Some schools are already using powder milk as it is easier to handle and store. Also, it tastes better and children prefer powdered milk in the food they consume.""

Another teacher from Ludhiana, Dharamjit Singh said, ""There is not going to much of a cost difference as a kilogram of powdered milk can be used by several students when compared to liquid milk. Also, it is easier to store powdered milk.""

Punjab State Education (elementary) Director Inderjit Singh, ""We have taken this decision as MILKFED agreed to supply powdered milk to our schools. The quality of milk had become a cause of worry as adulterated milk is openly sold in the market. The powdered milk by MILKFED passes through several checks.""

Singh added, ""The only concern might be cases of theft. Some people can try and steal to take the milk powder home. We need to look for a solution for this soon.""

Officials in the Union Human Resources Development Ministry told Express that most states, in response to a letter sent last month, had expressed inability to expand the scheme citing fund crunch. ""The states are not against the idea in principal, but are saying that they do not have the resources to provide milk in Mid Day Meal and we, too, are not in a position to help them financially for this,"" a senior official in the school education and literacy department said.

Last December, aiming to double farmers' income by 2022, the Union Agriculture Ministry had asked the states to boost consumption by distributing milk under various schemes like Mid Day Meal.By official estimates, the country has a surplus of 3,00,000 tonnes of milk powder. This has led dairies and other bulk buyers to cut liquid milk purchase, a reason why its price in several parts of Maharashtra fell by '10-15 per litre less than last year, sparking farmers' protests in many parts.

Government figures show that around 70 per cent of the 165 million tonnes of milk produced in India in a year is consumed in liquid form, while the rest is processed into products such as cheese, butter and skimmed milk powder.

Rajasthan, Haryana children get milk

At present only a few states like Rajasthan and Haryana provide milk to children in select districts. The Vasundhara Raje government in Rajasthan had launched Annapurna Doodh Yojana in July this year under which 200 ml milk is provided to every primary and upper primary school student twice a week."

The civic body just can't seem to get its mid-day meals right. It turned out to be a poisonous Thursday at Bhandup's Sahyadri Vidyamandir, after 16 students and a teacher landed in hospital with complaints of stomach ache and vomiting on eating the dal rice served in the school yesterday. While all are stable now, it has once again raised serious concerns over the meal scheme.

The trigger

Though Sumit Dongarkar's mum packs a tiffin for him every day, he looks forward to the brunch served in school, and Thursday was no different, said his mother Sonali, as he loves dal rice.

The 13-year-old and his friends ate the meal with relish during the recess at 9.50 am, but shortly after, trouble started. At first, a Std VII student began vomiting, but soon, more complained of stomach ache and nausea. After other students began throwing up, the school authorities rushed 16 of them, and a teacher, Vidya Lad, who'd tasted the food as per protocol, to Mulund Agarwal Hospital. Sonali Dongarkar said, ""Sumit is doing fine now and is under observation.""

Who's responsible?

School authorities said that for the last one and a half year, around 700 students have been eating the meals prepared by Lingeshwar Mahila Bachat Gat. Parents told mid-day that VII-C is the first to receive the food every day, and while 16 from the class of 40 took ill, others remained unaffected. ""Everybody is stable now. But this has shaken the kids and our trust. Who will take the responsibility for it?"" asked Aruna Poojari, a parent.

Another, Aditi Naik, said, ""My son, Krish, had a nasal tube attached for a while. He is okay now, but I am going to tell him not to have the meal again."" Several parents complained of being kept in the dark about the incident. ""The school finishes at 12.30 am. When I went to receive my daughter, she never came out. Then, a friend of hers told me what had happened. I felt dizzy on finding out, but I rushed to the hospital,"" said Lalita Shinde.

Hospital dean Dr Usha Mohprekar said, ""All are stable now. We have moved them to the general ward for observation. Prima facie, it looks like food poisoning. An inquiry will be conducted.""

Sampling the fare

Principal Narsingh Mane told mid-day, ""The staff were prompt in giving required care to the sick children, all from one division. The food had come from Lingeshwar Mahila Bachat Gat, which has been providing it to us for a while now. So, we are not sure what went wrong. Samples of the food have been submitted to authorities for testing.""

BMC education officer Mahesh Palkar said, ""We have collected raw as well as cooked food samples from the kitchen of the organisation. The kitchen looked neat and tidy; nonetheless, experts will test the samples to end the inquiry conclusively. Until the investigation report is out, we have ordered the organisation to not supply food; its contract with the civic body will be subject to the probe report.

""The organisation provides mid-day meals to 25 other schools in the vicinity. So, while the investigation is on, all these schools will have to make alternative arrangements."""

(Representational)

At least 644 kitchen-cum-stores for mid-day meals are yet to be constructed in Manipur due to the diversion of funds amounting to Rs 14.02 crore under the National Programme of Mid-Day Meal.

According to a report by the auditor general, on March 2011, the Government of India had approved Rs 40.82 crore for the construction of 1,879 units of Kitchen-cum-Store under the scheme. However, the government released only Rs 35.79 crore.

""The Grants-in-aid should be utilised for the construction of Kitchen-cum-Store under the Mid-Day Meals scheme in accordance with the provisions of the rules and diverted for any other purpose,"" the report said.

The report said that as per an examination conducted by the AG on December 2016, the additional director of education schools/valley in 2014 showed that due to amalgamation and abolition of several schools, the requirement of kitchen-cum-stores was reduced to 1,792 units. As a result, the Manipur government refunded Rs 6.52 crore, which it had considered to be an excess amount, leaving a balance of Rs 29.27 crore.

Subsequently, the state education department deposited an amount of Rs 1.64 crore as value added tax (VAT) and the balance of Rs 27.63 crore was transferred on December 2015 to the accounts of the Nodal Officer, Mid-Day Meal.

Out of this amount, a sum of Rs 14.02 crore was diverted between February and July in 2016 for payment of cooking cost and cooking honorarium in three instalments. As per the report, the first diversion of Rs 4.05 crore took place on February 2, followed by Rs 3.08 crore on April 24 and another Rs 6.89 crore on July 2.

The total amount was used on the condition that the same would be reimbursed on the release of subsequent funds from the Centre.

The report said the diversion of Rs 14.02 crore and its subsequent non-recoupment have stalled the construction of at least 644 kitchen-cum-stores across the state.

However, the department said that the Centre had released Rs 30.97 crore to the state as the recurring component for cooking cost till the end of 2016-17 and that the diverted amount of Rs 14.02 crore will be reimbursed as and when the fund is released by the state government.

As India witnessed an all-time high production of pulses over the last two years, the Union Cabinet has decided to dispense it to states for distribution at a cheaper price through the Public Distribution System and mid-day meal, for which Rs 5,237 crore will be spent.

Under the approved scheme, state governments can pick up 34.88 lakh million ton of Tur, Chana, Masoor, Moong and Urad at a discount of Rs 15 per kg over the wholesale market price, and distribute through mid-day meal, PDS, Integrated Child Development Programmes (ICDP) etc.

""Government will spend Rs. 5,237 crore for implementation of this Scheme,"" Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs said in a statement, adding that it will be a one-time dispensation covering 12 months of demand, or complete dispensation of 34.88 lakh million ton stock, ""whichever is earlier"".

The government is also expecting good production this Kharif season as well. The decision will also help clear-up warehouses for the upcoming Kharif season commodities procured under Price Support Scheme (PSS). The government made record procurement of 45.43 lakh million ton pulses in Kharif 2017 and Rabi 2018 seasons under the PSS.

The government procured pulses from key growing states Telangana, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Maharastra, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh among others. After two great years, pulses sowing this year has fallen in comparison. However, with adequate rains in coming months, sowing activities are expected to pick-up.

Under the PSS system, the government procures oil seeds, pulses and cotton at a minimum support price (MSP) and provides remunerative prices to the farmers/growers. It is implemented in consultation with state governments, which also exempts these commodities from several levies such as mandi tax. The central nodal agencies then make logistical arrangements for the procured commodity from its storage to the creation of funds for the PSS operations."

Midday meals for 45.7 million children for a year. One day's wages for 200 million workers under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS). About 6 million new latrines. And at least 10 more Mars missions.

These were some of the things that could have been financed with the money that the current National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government spent on publicity in the four years it has governed India.

The Bharatiya Janata Party-led government spent $753.99 million on advertising its flagship schemes in the 52 months between April 2014 and July 2018, according to the information made available to the Rajya Sabha (Parliament's upper house) by Rajyavardhan Rathore, minister of state (Independent Charge) for information and broadcasting.

This amount is double the sum spent by the government's predecessor in 37 months: The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government spent $377.32 million between March 2011 and March 2014, according to this 2014 response to a Right To Information (RTI) query filed by activist Anil Galgali.

Of the Rs 48.8 billion the NDA spent on publicity, Rs 2.92 billion (7.81%) went to advertising four public schemes in three years-Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (Prime Minister's Crop Insurance Scheme) for crop insurance, Swachh Bharat Mission (Clean India Mission) for a nationwide cleanliness campaign, Smart City Mission and Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (Ideal Village Scheme for Members of Parliament) for urban and rural development.

When these figures came to light in July 2018, the government was criticised for not investing the money in public utilities.

5K Crores spent by Modi govt on advertising! Most of the advertisements are just of Modi's face. Apart from a colossal waste of public money which could have been used to build schools & hospitals etc, it gives a huge unfair advantage to party in power https://t.co/RWnxoEJxg8

-- Prashant Bhushan (pbhushan1) August 1, 2018

IndiaSpend calculations showed that the money spent by the NDA on publicity could have been used in critical government projects ranging from child nutrition to public health and sanitation.

There's been a 34 per cent rise in govt ad spend in four years

Government expenditure on advertisements rose 34 per cent from Rs 9.8 billion in 2014-15 to Rs 13.14 billion ($203.89 million) in 2017-18.

In 2016-17, the government cut down on print advertisements and channeled money into audio-visual publicity instead. But in 2017-18, it did the reverse-it spent more on print ads than audio-visual campaigns.

The 2017-18 trend seemed to have continued into this financial year too. The government's bookings in the four months to July 2018 show that it has spent double the money on print advertising over audio-visual publicity."

The State government has decided to introduce the mid-day meal scheme not just in Intermediate colleges, but in all government-run degree colleges, and polytechnic ones as well as those offering vocational courses.

The government aims to supply nutritious food to students in these colleges spread across 31 districts in the State through Akshaya Patra Foundation and the Foundation has accordingly been asked to put in place the amenities and infrastructure required for handling the task.

The Cabinet Committee headed by Deputy Chief Minister Kadiyam Srihari held discussions with the representatives of the Foundation in this regard on Friday.

In addition to Mr. Srihari, Ministers Eatala Rajender, T. Harish Rao, A. Indrakaran Reddy and Jogu Ramanna accompanied by senior officials tasted the food being supplied by the Foundation. The Foundation representatives informed the Cabinet panel that Akshaya Patra was implementing Annapurna scheme since the past four years without giving scope for any complaints. The Foundation has dedicated kitchens at Kandi, Narsingi, Kothagudem, Warangal and Mahabubnagar and it is in the process of setting up six more kitchens in different parts of the State.

Mr. Srihari wanted the Foundation to prepare a detailed report on the food items that would be provided to students as well as the estimated cost that would be incurred in the process by April 6. The report would be forwarded to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, who would take a final decision on the issue. The Foundation should also conduct a trial run of the scheme in selected institutions before the full-fledged implementation of the scheme.

The Foundation representatives told the Ministers that they would follow the suggestions and ensure that a report was submitted on the requirements and cost within four days.

Today's children are the future of tomorrow, and so it's important they have access to nutritious food right from birth through adolescence. However, India ranks 10th in terms of prevalence of underweight children in the world and 17th in terms of prevalence of stunting, according to UNICEF. To ensure that malnutrition doesn't affect children's cognitive development or physical growth, the ministry of women & child development (MWCD) approved the Poshan Abhiyaan (National Nutrition Mission) last year.

The initiative seeks to reduce the level of stunting, undernutrition and low birth weight by 2% each, and anaemia by 3%. It aims to reduce stunting from 38.4% (NFHS-4) to 25% by 2022. Its goal is to achieve improvement in nutritional status of children aged 0-6 years, adolescent girls, pregnant women and lactating mothers in a time-bound manner, over three years. Poshan Abhiyaan, as a policy strengthening the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), is a boon towards addressing child and maternal malnutrition.

A key idea of the initiative is to incentivise Anganwadi Workers (AWs) for using ICT-based tools, making it easier to implement and monitor the programme.

Earlier, AWs would keep beneficiary records and indicators related to the provision of services in registers, which have now been replaced by the Common Application Software (CAS) designed especially for the programme. The data is collected using smartphones provided to AWs. This data can then be accessed and analysed by supervisors using tablets, and the block, district, state and national level ICDS officers using the reporting dashboards, provided to them. It also seeks to provide performance-based incentives to AWs to encourage them to adopt and efficiently use the technology.

The rationale is that if this data is made available to the MWCD in real time, it will help track and analyse critical nutrition and performance indicators, including weight and height of children.

The programme has also been given substantial funding and importance, and has managed to create harmony, ensure better monitoring and issue alerts for timely action. It is expected to help the government map the nutrition and growth levels of beneficiaries with great accuracy.

Poshan Abhiyaan has enhanced the efficacy of ICDS in addressing malnutrition-related issues from the prenatal stage to six years. However, considering that adequate nutrition is necessary for children aged seven and above also, efforts should be made to ensure that the benefits of this initiative reach children above six years of age. That would be possible with the convergence of the Mid Day Meal (MDM) scheme with Poshan Abhiyaan. The MDM scheme provides freshly cooked nutritious meals to children in the age group of 7-14 years as an incentive to enrol and attend school.

While schools collect data pertaining to height and weight of children, it is not collated or analysed by any central agency -- data on malnutrition in the age group of 7-14 years is not readily available. The introduction of CAS for MDM will help school authorities collect real-time data on their smartphones and send it to nodal agencies, facilitating better implementation and monitoring of the school lunch programme. This real-time data will help formulate new strategies, fine-tune existing ones and even devise local strategies to make the most of available resources. Significant reduction in malnutrition can be achieved with clear policies and targets in place. This would require scaling up of funding across all related sectors and real-time monitoring and analysis of data -- the inclusion of MDM in Poshan Abhiyaan will help in both the aspects. If done effectively, this will benefit over 94 million children. In the long run, it will help coordinate the functioning of both the nutrition welfare programmes to achieve common goals, thus making Poshan Abhiyaan a well-rounded programme.

""The annual expenditure on the project has been estimated to be ₹55.53 crore. The government has sanctioned ₹23 crore in the first phase,"" he pointed out.

Education hub

Mr. Srinivasa Rao further said that though the State had inherited a deficit budget of ₹16,000 crore in the aftermath of bifurcation, the government was committed to promoting Andhra Pradesh as an education hub at an investment of ₹25,000 crore. ""The government colleges will be provided with infrastructure and other facilities on par with the corporate colleges. Digital and virtual classrooms are being set up at all government schools with the assistance of NRIs,"" he said.

State Commissioner of Higher Education B. Udayalakshmi said that the mid-day meal scheme, being implemented in government schools, has helped reducing the dropout rate. Visakhapatnam South MLA Vasupalli Ganesh Kumar said that the measures being taken by the government had revived the demand for admission in government schools and colleges.

The Minister, MLA and the Commissioner had lunch with the students after the programme was launched.

District Vocational Education Officer MVN Patrudu, DEO Lingeswara Reddy, Executive Director of BC Welfare Nageswara Rao and Visakha Women's College Principal T. Radha were among those who attended the progrrame."

The Supreme Court today slapped Rs 50,000 each as costs on Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu and Uttrakhand for their failure to create a online link with a chart meant for monitoring the implementation and hygiene of mid-day meal schemes in government-run schools.

A bench of justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta expressed displeasure that these three ""defaulting states"" have not yet complied with the directions of the apex court in this regard.

""In view of the default of these three states, costs of 50,000 are imposed upon these states. The amount be deposited within four weeks from today with the Supreme Court Legal Services Authority for utilisation of juvenile justice issues,"" the bench said.

The counsel appearing for the petitioner told the bench that some of the states and Union Territories (UTs) have not yet created a separate link on website as required in terms of the court's direction and no chart has been filled up by them.

""The other defaulting states/UTs are Arunachal Pradesh, Dadar and Nagar Haveli and Puducherry. For the time being, we are not imposing any costs on these states. We expect these states will comply with the directions passed by this court from time to time,"" the bench said and posted the matter for further hearing on September 20.

The apex court had earlier noted that two committees at the national and state level were suggested to be set up to monitor various aspects like maintaining hygiene in the mid-day meal schemes in schools.

The court was hearing a plea filed by NGO 'Antarrashtriya Manav Adhikaar Nigraani Parishad' in 2013 on the issue of mid-day meals.

The top court had on March 23 last year asked state governments and UTs to upload information including the total number of students getting benefit of the mid-day meal scheme within three months on their websites.

The PIL has claimed that in over 12 lakh government-run and aided schools across the country, children receive free, cooked lunch every day but ""they are constantly exposed to the risk of food poisoning and related health hazards due to a lack of mid-day meal infrastructure and proper monitoring of the scheme""."

Swati Narayan, a research scholar and an activist with the Right To Food campaign, recently mapped the inclusion of eggs in mid-day meals in schools and anganwadis across India using government data and media reports. The map, which looks at possible links between political ideology and the provision of eggs in these meals, was released on July 8, 2018.

Building upon Narayan's research, IndiaSpend analysed government nutrition data, spoke to several experts and government officials, and found that:

In India, 7.5 per cent children under five years of age are severely wasted-a rise of 1.1 percentage points from 6.4 per cent in 2005-06, according to National Family Health Survey 2015-16 data. All the experts IndiaSpend interviewed were of the view that eggs included in the mid-day meals of children could be a critical factor in combating malnutrition.

""Eggs will be helpful in addressing malnutrition among kids because scientific research shows that animal-based protein is better than plant-based protein,"" said Mansi Patil, a public health nutritionist and metabolism clinical dietician at AshaKiran Hospital, Pune.

Though some states in India had introduced mid-day meals earlier, this was universalised only in 2001. Eggs were first served in mid-day meals in Tamil Nadu in 1989, when the state was governed by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). The initiative started with one egg every two weeks and then was stepped up to one every week.

So why are administrations in BJP governed states-some of which, like Gujarat (39.3 per cent) and Madhya Pradesh (42.8 per cent), report a significant percentage of underweight children-not serving eggs in mid-day meals?

Officials in BJP governed states interviewed by IndiaSpend said they were concerned about offending the sentiments of vegetarians. ""In Gujarat, most of the population is vegetarian,"" said RG Trivedi, commissioner (mid-day meal scheme) in Gujarat. ""Additionally, we provide pulses daily in mid-day meals as protein-rich food, hence we don't serve eggs.""

Trivedi is correct-61 per cent of Gujarat's population is vegetarian, according to the latest available census data on food habits. This, however, is not true of the average Indian-70 per cent of Indians eat non-vegetarian food.

""You can compare protein content of vegetarian and non-vegetarian foods, but the quality of protein in eggs is higher than others according to the protein digestibility corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS),"" said Purnima Menon, Senior Research Fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), Delhi. PDCAAS is a tool to evaluate a particular protein's quality based on human requirements and how they digest it.

In Himachal Pradesh too, officials spoke of the concerns of vegetarian parents. ""We do not give eggs because of religious and cultural issues,"" said Naresh Sharma, nodal officer (mid-day meal scheme) for Himachal Pradesh. ""People in Himachal Pradesh consider eggs non-vegetarian and there are children whose parents would have problems if we served them. To avoid controversy, we don't."" The census doesn't provide data on vegetarianism in Himachal Pradesh.

Non-BJP states avoid eggs too, but BJP states most resistant

IndiaSpend investigations found that non-BJP states that do not offer eggs in mid-day meals were more constrained by the lack of resources than religious or cultural sentiments.

""Non-BJP states such as Punjab, Delhi and Mizoram also do not provide eggs.

And Jharkhand, a BJP majority state, does,"" said Sinha. ""But, in states like Gujarat and Rajasthan, you cannot even talk (about providing eggs) for the fear of hurting upper-caste Hindu sentiments. Over the years, activists have been demanding eggs, but there is more resistance in BJP states due to cultural issues.""

On April 22, 2018, the ministry of health and family welfare set off a controversy when it tweeted a stock photograph that seemed to indicate that a vegetarian diet is the only way to stay healthy. The tweet was later deleted, as Scroll.in reported on April 23, 2018.

Manisha Chachra, a research scholar in political studies at the Jawaharlal Nehru University who has studied the Hindu right-wing, explained the importance of sattvik food in its ideology. ""The BJP is an affiliate of the Sangh Parivar, which ideologically follows certain upper-caste Hindu beliefs as characteristics of Hindutva,"" she said. ""One of this is the sattvik diet, which excludes non-vegetarian food, onion, and garlic. There is a bigger dietary politics to this kind of exclusion (of eggs).""

In Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government has not been able to fulfill its promise of boiled eggs as part of the mid-day meal scheme for school, according to this April 9, 2018, report by India Today.

Sinha's argument about the need for more resources to provide eggs can be corroborated by Arunachal Pradesh's 2018-19 mid-day meal policy. ""Green leafy vegetables and fruits are available in rural areas with minimum prices and these are important items included in the menu, but eggs are not available and unaffordable,"" it said.

The north-east has a particular problem. Eggs are largely unaffordable here because there are free poultry industries, and this pushes up the price of procurement, said Narayan. ""If the central government wanted, it could have provided funds to all states for providing eggs, but it did not,"" she added.

Former union health secretary K Sujatha Rao told IndiaSpend that costs are a major concern in the inclusion of eggs in mid-day meals. ""It would be ideal to have village communities encouraged to develop hatcheries under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act scheme and have eggs provided to schools and anganwadis,"" she said. ""These interventions should be decentralised and communities should be more involved rather than only the government.""

The other view: Introduce eggs with caution

Some dieticians advocate caution in the push for eggs to be included in mid-day meals. ""We should 'introduce' eggs rather than include them,"" said Mansi Patil. ""If children are malnourished and we suddenly introduce eggs (into their diet), it may have a negative impact on their bodies. So let's say we should start with 2-3 eggs a week and then slowly increase (the numbers). We need to realise that a body needs fats and carbohydrates too. There needs to be the right mix of nutrients.""

Patil added that the number of eggs that need to be consumed depends on the kind of malnutrition a child suffers from and what kind of metabolism her body has. ""In severe acute malnutrition (SAM), as opposed to moderately acute malnutrition (MAM), we cannot introduce eggs right away. We need to focus on carbohydrates and energy first so that the body slowly shapes us to be able to take protein.""

Dipa Sinha, assistant professor, Ambedkar University, and an activist with Right To Food campaign, however, said that this cannot be a reason to deny eggs to children. ""The overall proportion of SAM kids is low so that cannot be a reason to not provide eggs,"" she said. ""For SAM kids, there is an established protocol, where they need to be taken to the hospital by anganwadi workers and treated accordingly because they are given a proper diet.""

Animal rights activists who advocate vegetarian food in the context of cruelty against poultry birds argue this differently. ""Chickens used for eggs are among the most abused animals on the planet,"" wrote Bhuvaneshwari Gupta, a former campaigner and nutrition adviser with PETA India, in June 2015 for the Huffington Post. ""Most are forced to live their entire lives in an area smaller than the size of an iPad screen. Their beaks are typically cut off with a hot blade to prevent them from pecking each other in frustration, because the industry simply won't give them more space.""

Narayan agreed that the poultry industry needed better standards of hygiene and should be more aware of animal rights. ""However, that cannot be a reason to deny eggs to children,"" she said."

A large number of women mid-day meal workers tried to lay siege to HRD Minister Ganta Srinivasa Rao's house at the M.V.P. Colony here opposing the government's decision to introduce cluster system all over the State and run the mid-day meal scheme through private agencies.

Police did not allow them to enter the street on which the house is located, but the workers stormed through the barricades leading to arrests.

There was pushing and jostling with the protesters trying to reach up to the gate of the Minister's house. Around 3,000 workers from all over the district participated in the protest.

The women workers then came on to the national highway at Isukathota near MVP Double Road and staged a 'rasta roko' there leading to a traffic jam for sometime.

Police took some more protesters into custody there, according to union leaders.

The arrested included Mid-Day Meal Scheme Workers' Union State president and secretary G. Varalakshmi and K. Swarupa Rani respectively, district president K. Prasanna, honorary president S. Aruna and CITU district secretary G. Koteswara Rao.

The union is opposing the cluster system in which nine mandals of the district are proposed to be given to a private agency. The schools within 20 km are part of one cluster.

Workers' contention

The union contended that since the food was prepared early at one place and distributed at noon, it would lack nutritional values. It alleged that the implementation at Mangalagiri, Tulluru, Tadepalli, Gajuwaka and Rajamahendravaram showed lack of quality.

They were demanding, among other things, payment of minimum wages instead of the ₹1000 to each worker, increase in menu charges, basic facilities to prepare food, LPG on subsidy and monthly payment of bills and wages."

(HT File)

With some school headmasters (HMs) dragging their feet over paying penalties for allegedly inflating attendance of students, the Bihar government has finally decided to recover fines by deducting the amount from their salary.

The HMs allegedly spiked attendance of students to claim more funds under the mid-day meal(MDM) programme.

Though the government received reports of irregularities long ago and imposed financial penalty on HMs, the fines could not be fully recovered. Many of the HMs moved court for relief citing their unwanted involvement in non-academic work, while others were just indifferent.

The government has ordered the recovery of a Rs8.68-crore penalty from HMs. Of which, Rs 4.21-crore (48%) has been recovered. More than 1,000 HMs have allegedly fudged the data since 2013, when the idea of penalty was first mooted by the state education department.

RK Mahajan, principal secretary of the department of education, recently directed all district programme officers (DPOs) to deduct the penalty amount from headmasters' salary in five instalments over as many months.

""The DPOs must ensure a monthly deduction from all those who have not deposited the penalty amount within a month of the receipt of the letter, except those who have got stay from the court,"" stated a letter by Mahajan.

""During inspections, the attendance of that particular day in the school and the average of the previous week is matched. If the deviation is within 10%, there is no issue. However, if the deviation is above 10%, a penalty equivalent to the amount given in the last three months is imposed on the headmaster,"" said Vinod Kumar Singh, director of the mid-day meal programme, .

Another official said that in several cases, the accused HMs with the help of their association approached the Patna high court or the Lokayukta, claiming that they were overburdened with non-academic work like management of MDM. The court has also asked the government to find an alternative to free teachers from MDM responsibilities.

Though the Bihar government tried to hand over MDM to NGOs or self-help groups (SHGs) and also ran pilot projects, a viable alternative has not been found because of the scale of the programme. In Bihar, despite a drop in enrolment numbers, 1.20 crore students from Class 1 to Class 8 are estimated to avail MDM daily.

In a Niti Ayog meeting a few months ago, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar advocated the direct benefit transfer for the centre's flagship MDM programme to plug leakages. ""Cooking in schools has a direct bearing on education. Instead of centres of learning, schools are viewed as centres of food. Poor quality and unhygienic conditions often lead to unpleasant incidents,"" he had said.

However, to achieve this, the Centre would have to change the policy at the national level, which seems unlikely. Bihar, on its part, has been seriously mulling the option of handing over MDM to women SHGs, which are 8 lakh in the state, the highest in the country. A pilot project has been launched in one block each of Jehanabad and Muzaffarpur to assess the feasibility."

Raising concerns over the ""meagre salaries"" paid to cook-cum-helpers working under the centrally sponsored 'Mid Day Meal' scheme, CPI national secretary D Raja called it a matter of national shame and demanded their pay be hiked.

Addressing a rally of Mid Day Meal (MDM) scheme workers organised by eight different trade union bodies at Jantar Mantar here, Raja said there are about 26 lakhs MDM workers at the grass root level and 98 per cent of this work force are women.

The scheme was launched on August 15, 1995, and covered under the National Security Act, 2013.

""It is a matter of national shame that the Mid Day Meal workers are paid only Rs 1,000 per month and that too for only ten months a year,"" Raja said.

The objective of the scheme was to boost universalisation of education by increasing enrolment, retention and attendance and improving the nutrition levels of students. In 2001, the Supreme Court had made it mandatory for the government to provide cooked meal to all children in primary schools.

""Working around six to eight hours a day including in the preparation, actual cooking and distribution of foods, cleaning the vessels and premises etc, they are not even recognised as workers and not paid minimum wages,"" he alleged.

The demands of All India Federation of Mid Day Meal Workers included minimum wages of Rs 18,000 per month, implementation of the recommendation of 45th and 46th Indian Labour Conference, to give them 'worker' status, ensuring social security and recognise the mid day meal workers as the fourth grade employees among others.

On Monday, a six-member delegation led by D Raja, the Rajya Sabha MP, met Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and handed over a memorandum with demands of mid day meal workers to him.

According to the delegation, the Finance minister responded positively and promised them of an increase in monthly wage of the MDM workers at the earliest.

According to officials, the said move was made after civic body began receiving complaints from school heads and teachers about the low-quality food served by the PMC affiliatedself-help groups (SHGs).

""The issue came up after we began receiving complaints against the quality and quantity of the meals.

Tithi Bhojan is a concept of providing nutritious food with community participation. It encourages families and religious/charitable institutions to donate food on special occasions like birthdays, anniversaries, festivals and other

important days.

As per orders, the ministry wants local village residents and communities to contribute and organise a feast for kids to celebrate 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi. Following orders from MHRD, the state education department of Punjab too issued orders (dated October 12) to all schools to organise Tithi Bhoj for children on October 31. The school heads have to ensure that children are served some delicacies on October 31, not regular menu which they are served daily.

'Tithi Bhoj ' be organised with the community participation on 31/10/2018 and 2/10/2019,' say the orders.

Former HRD minister Smriti Irani had mooted the proposal to incorporate concept of Tithi Bhoj in mid-day meal in October 2014 and wanted other states to replicate Gujarat model, months after NDA government led by Narendra Modi came to power. Irani wanted all states in India to replicate Tithi Bhoj model of Gujarat where community participation is encouraged to serve food in schools. However, not many states had shown interest and it could not be implemented in all states.

Speaking to The Sunday Express, Prabhcharan Singh, general manager, Mid-Day Meal Society, Department of Education, Punjab, said that concept of Tithi Bhoj was similar to concept of 'langar' in Punjab. ""In both practices, community participation is encouraged. On special occasions, community members can contribute food for children's mid-day meal in local government schools. However, this is the first time that MHRD has issued orders to organise Tithi Bhoj on two particular days as part of Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary celebrations. It will be organised on October 31 this year and then October 2 (Gandhi Jayanti), 2019. We have ordered schools to implement it. They can either seek help of gurdwaras and local families to prepare feast for children or cook some delicacies in schools itself. Earlier too, when proposal was mooted in 2014 by former MHRD minister Smriti Irani, Punjab had no problem with it. In fact, we had even implemented it for few months and collected food materials from those who wanted to donate. But we do not collect any funds. Those who want to contribute can give food items only.""

He added that schools can organise Tithi Bhoj as per arrangements they have and there is no particular menu. ""They can prepare some desserts like kheer, halwa, other sweets or serve chana-poori, halwa-puri or something which is not served as part of regular menu. We have not given specific menu items so that teachers are not troubled but Tithi Bhoj has to be organised on October 31 and children should be served a feast in memory of Mahatma Gandhi,""

said Singh.

The Punjab education department has directed all government schools to use powdered milk (dry milk) to prepare kheer, which is served once a week as part of the mid-day meal menu to children. The powdered milk will be supplied to schools by government-run cooperative MILKFED (which runs VERKA milk plants across the state).

As per the notification issued, schools are required to use seven grams of milk powder per child for making kheer. The milk powder will cost Rs 273 per kilogram; this amount will be paid to MILKFED from the ration amount they are granted for mid-day meals. Besides increasing the sale of milk powder, sources said, this step by the government has been taken to ensure children consume kheer prepared from ""quality-tested"" milk as earlier, schools purchased milk from local dairies and other shops which do not undergo a quality check.

Also, with adulterated milk widely being sold across Punjab, one needs to ensure children are not made to consume the same.

The order, however, clarifies that MILKFED will supply 10-kg powder milk cans to schools with 150 children or above. In other words, government schools with less than 150 children (mostly primary and in far-flung villages) will have to arrange the item on their own.

Welcoming the government's decision, Amarjit Singh, a government school teacher from Mansa said, ""Some schools are already using powder milk as it is easier to handle and store. Also, it tastes better and children prefer powdered milk in the food they consume.""

Another teacher from Ludhiana, Dharamjit Singh said, ""There is not going to much of a cost difference as a kilogram of powdered milk can be used by several students when compared to liquid milk. Also, it is easier to store powdered milk.""

Punjab State Education (elementary) Director Inderjit Singh, ""We have taken this decision as MILKFED agreed to supply powdered milk to our schools. The quality of milk had become a cause of worry as adulterated milk is openly sold in the market. The powdered milk by MILKFED passes through several checks.""

Singh added, ""The only concern might be cases of theft. Some people can try and steal to take the milk powder home. We need to look for a solution for this soon.""

The timing of this act of empowering Panchayats carries lot of weightiness as the decision to this effect has been taken when nine phase Panchayat elections are scheduled to be held between November 17 to December 11. Secondly, it conveys the determination and the writ of the Government to those elements including the two main Regional Political Parties of the state who explicitly and implicitly decided to boycott these elections and thus helping those forces that want to undermine democratic political process in the state to attenuate separatist and secessionist tendencies which over years, otherwise have gained marginal ascendancy.

It is worth noting that a feeble attempt by means of an administrative order was made in the past by the National Conference - Congress Coalition Government headed by Omar Abdullah by assigning some role to control some Departments to Panchayats but that ""experiment"" did not succeed . Keeping in view the past experience, Governor Satya Pal Malik using the legislative powers vested with him under Governor's rule and the Assembly being under suspended animation, approved requisite amendments in the Panchayat Raj Act to give cover of legislation to powers extended to the Panchayats.

It is , however, a bold and innovative attempt , the first one of this nature taken by the State Government and should herald a new era of total involvement of elected representatives of the people in rural areas when even conducting concurrent audits , quarterly social audit of works going on in respective areas including ensuring of socio economic and human development too will be their responsibility. This will surely give boost to these institutions where real powers to look after almost every aspect of development activities will find their full involvement. Transparency and accountability in the concerned Departments at grass root levels shall result in direct accountability to the elected representatives of the people at grass root levels.

As regards devolution of financial powers at Halqa and Block levels, It is decided to increase as many as 10 times from Rs.10000 to Rs.100000 for Panchayats and from Rs.25000 to Rs.2.50 lac for Block Councils. Every Panchayat will get Rs.50 to Rs. 80 lacs per year for implementation of key national schemes. It is without any doubt that while most of Panchayats in the country were already enjoying these powers under 73rd amendment of the Constitution of India , Jammu and Kashmir State had been ""deprived"" of these powers at Panchayat levels.

While it is hoped that more and more contestants would join the process of Panchayat elections in the state as a result of massive empowerment by means of cover of a legislation, it has got to be ensured that these ""powers"" did not cross the expected limit of the line of supervision , monitoring and control so that the Departments under their expected control did not encounter functional hindrances due to misusing of the ""powers"". To pre-empt those chances, it is suggested that some measure of tutelage and grooming exercise of the elected representatives would be imperative to make the empowerment meaningful and workable in the real sense."

A much of a hue and cry was made about linking Aadhaar data with school children for even mid-day meal with the argument that this will help negating corruption in the scheme.

The court has clearly ruled in its majority 3:2 verdict that Aadhaar must not be made compulsory for school admission and the school administration cannot make it mandatory.

""We get paid just Rs 1,000 a month -- far less than colleagues in other states -- after putting in six hours of work a day. We are even made to clean toilets and children when they soil themselves... We are not paid for two months a year -- July, during summer vacations, and December, even though schools are closed for just half the month. Maybe we will never get Rs 18,000 but we are pushing for as much as possible,"" she said. Renu Devi, a widow from Bihar, claimed 200 mid-day meal workers from her district get paid Rs 1,250 per month and had come to the rally.

Each demand was similar yet different from the others. Manju Begum (35), who accompanied Kanaklata Das's delegation, is an anganwadi worker from Rampur, Assam. ""The Rs 3,000 a month I get is low anyway, but we are also made to do additional government work like paperwork for the NRC process...,"" she said.

Roshni Kamble (32), an Asha worker from Nagpur, contended that their working conditions are worse than that of anganwadi workers. ""We are on duty 24/7 as a child delivery can happen anytime. We regularly deal with tuberculosis patients. But we make Rs 500-1,000 a month,"" she said.

Many at the rally were unemployed and demanded generation of work opportunities. Among them was Gopal K (62), a mason from Kozhikode in Kerala, who said: ""I want to be given work up till my death. I used to work on a daily wage basis for Rs 500 and haven't got work for a very long time.""

Shoulder to shoulder with those seeking employment were government employees hoping to get issues with their pension scheme addressed, and those with grouses against private employers.

Ram Singh, a migrant labourer from Muzaffarpur doing tailoring work in a private firm in Noida, said 150 of his co-workers were present as their employer had cheated them by giving them fake papers for provident funds.

Cops arrested five persons near Limbda Chowk in Rajkot and seized 2,000kg rice and 600kg wheat from them.

In Rajkot city, food is supplied under the mid-day meal programme to about 15,000 children from the 334 government primary schools and anganwadis everyday. Those arrested were identified as Rahul Dholakia, Nizamuddin Ali Hussain, Lala Khan Rahmatulla Khan, Kanavibha Bharvad and Arjun Singh Sikh. Two Delhi-based traders Ankur Jain and Niranjan Jain of Sree Shakti Traders were also booked along with the five accused for criminal breach of trust, cheating and criminal conspiracy.

Investigating officer sub-inspector P B Kavana of Pradhuman Nagar police station said that the accused used to divert about 25% of the foodgrains supplied by the central government for the mid-day meal programme into the open market every month. He added that the arrested accused Arjun Singh acted as a coordinator on behalf of Sree Shakti Traders while siphoning off foodgrains to local traders like Dholakia. Sree Shakti Traders were given contract to supply foodgrains to schools and anganwadis.

Late night on Sunday, a police team intercepted a truck and a tempo filled with foodgrains near Suchak School, where the central kitchen has been set up for supply of cooked food to children across the city.

Police said that Dholakia and Bharvad were driving the two vehicles, while Hussain and Rahmatulla Khan were labourers seated in them. When they could not produce documents for the foodgrains, they were taken into custody and questioned. Dholakia told police that he had bought the foodgrains meant for mid-say meal from Arjun Singh and late night on Sunday, he was arrested from his house in the city.

Kavana told TOI, ""The accused have been operating this racket since long. The Sree Shakti Traders was blacklisted last month by the Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) for supplying substandard foodgrains. However, they were allowed to continue the supply till another agency was given the contract."""

Parents alleged that students in the school at Nawadih village in Koderma were served rotten and worm-laced gram with potato in the mid-day meal on Tuesday causing food poisoning.

Koderma administration has ordered a probe into the matter.

""A probe team under sub-divisional magistrate has been set up in this regard,"" Koderma deputy commissioner (DC), Bhuvnesh Pratap Singh said on Thursday, adding, except two, the other students have been discharged from the hospital.

The deceased was identified as Manish Kumar, 12. His father Manoj Yadav lodged a complaint with the Domchanch police station alleging carelessness on the part of the school management committee, said Vinod Kumar, police station in-charge.

""""Around 4pm, we found Manish was vomiting and by the night he was shivering with fever.

Ten students fainted during the morning prayer in school on Wednesday morning. By evening, they were admitted to hospital and one died on way to Ranchi.""

She alleged the teachers have fled after closing the school on Thursday. ""No official from the education department has yet visited the school,"" she said.

Koderma civil surgeon Dr Yogendra Mahto said over 60 students were brought to Sadar hospital on Wednesday evening with symptoms of food poisoning.

""They were given treatment and most of them were released on Thursday afternoon,"" he said.

However, Shiv Mehta, a para teacher in the school, denied the charges of students' falling ill due to mid-day meal.

""The students had been served gram with potato and rice in the lunch on Tuesday and no problem occurred that day. They came to school as usual on Wednesday and had the meal as usual. If there was something in the mid-day meal, students would have fallen ill by Tuesday evening or Wednesday morning,"" he said.

The mid-day meal scheme in Jharkhand had come under the scanner earlier as well after instances of children falling ill due to poor hygiene conditions came to light. Besides, activists allege that the meal served doesn't meet the nutritional standards set by the Right to Education Act, 2009.

Pics/Rajesh Gupta

The civic body just can't seem to get its mid-day meals right. It turned out to be a poisonous Thursday at Bhandup's Sahyadri Vidyamandir, after 16 students and a teacher landed in hospital with complaints of stomach ache and vomiting on eating the dal rice served in the school yesterday. While all are stable now, it has once again raised serious concerns over the meal scheme.

The trigger

Though Sumit Dongarkar's mum packs a tiffin for him every day, he looks forward to the brunch served in school, and Thursday was no different, said his mother Sonali, as he loves dal rice.

The 13-year-old and his friends ate the meal with relish during the recess at 9.50 am, but shortly after, trouble started. At first, a Std VII student began vomiting, but soon, more complained of stomach ache and nausea. After other students began throwing up, the school authorities rushed 16 of them, and a teacher, Vidya Lad, who'd tasted the food as per protocol, to Mulund Agarwal Hospital. Sonali Dongarkar said, ""Sumit is doing fine now and is under observation.""

Who's responsible?

School authorities said that for the last one and a half year, around 700 students have been eating the meals prepared by Lingeshwar Mahila Bachat Gat. Parents told mid-day that VII-C is the first to receive the food every day, and while 16 from the class of 40 took ill, others remained unaffected. ""Everybody is stable now. But this has shaken the kids and our trust. Who will take the responsibility for it?"" asked Aruna Poojari, a parent.

Another, Aditi Naik, said, ""My son, Krish, had a nasal tube attached for a while. He is okay now, but I am going to tell him not to have the meal again."" Several parents complained of being kept in the dark about the incident. ""The school finishes at 12.30 am. When I went to receive my daughter, she never came out. Then, a friend of hers told me what had happened. I felt dizzy on finding out, but I rushed to the hospital,"" said Lalita Shinde.

Hospital dean Dr Usha Mohprekar said, ""All are stable now. We have moved them to the general ward for observation. Prima facie, it looks like food poisoning. An inquiry will be conducted.""

Sampling the fare

Principal Narsingh Mane told mid-day, ""The staff were prompt in giving required care to the sick children, all from one division. The food had come from Lingeshwar Mahila Bachat Gat, which has been providing it to us for a while now. So, we are not sure what went wrong. Samples of the food have been submitted to authorities for testing.""

BMC education officer Mahesh Palkar said, ""We have collected raw as well as cooked food samples from the kitchen of the organisation. The kitchen looked neat and tidy; nonetheless, experts will test the samples to end the inquiry conclusively. Until the investigation report is out, we have ordered the organisation to not supply food; its contract with the civic body will be subject to the probe report.

""The organisation provides mid-day meals to 25 other schools in the vicinity. So, while the investigation is on, all these schools will have to make alternative arrangements."""

(Representational)

At least 644 kitchen-cum-stores for mid-day meals are yet to be constructed in Manipur due to the diversion of funds amounting to Rs 14.02 crore under the National Programme of Mid-Day Meal.

According to a report by the auditor general, on March 2011, the Government of India had approved Rs 40.82 crore for the construction of 1,879 units of Kitchen-cum-Store under the scheme. However, the government released only Rs 35.79 crore.

""The Grants-in-aid should be utilised for the construction of Kitchen-cum-Store under the Mid-Day Meals scheme in accordance with the provisions of the rules and diverted for any other purpose,"" the report said.

The report said that as per an examination conducted by the AG on December 2016, the additional director of education schools/valley in 2014 showed that due to amalgamation and abolition of several schools, the requirement of kitchen-cum-stores was reduced to 1,792 units. As a result, the Manipur government refunded Rs 6.52 crore, which it had considered to be an excess amount, leaving a balance of Rs 29.27 crore.

Subsequently, the state education department deposited an amount of Rs 1.64 crore as value added tax (VAT) and the balance of Rs 27.63 crore was transferred on December 2015 to the accounts of the Nodal Officer, Mid-Day Meal.

Out of this amount, a sum of Rs 14.02 crore was diverted between February and July in 2016 for payment of cooking cost and cooking honorarium in three instalments. As per the report, the first diversion of Rs 4.05 crore took place on February 2, followed by Rs 3.08 crore on April 24 and another Rs 6.89 crore on July 2.

The total amount was used on the condition that the same would be reimbursed on the release of subsequent funds from the Centre.

The report said the diversion of Rs 14.02 crore and its subsequent non-recoupment have stalled the construction of at least 644 kitchen-cum-stores across the state.

However, the department said that the Centre had released Rs 30.97 crore to the state as the recurring component for cooking cost till the end of 2016-17 and that the diverted amount of Rs 14.02 crore will be reimbursed as and when the fund is released by the state government.

As India witnessed an all-time high production of pulses over the last two years, the Union Cabinet has decided to dispense it to states for distribution at a cheaper price through the Public Distribution System and mid-day meal, for which Rs 5,237 crore will be spent.

Under the approved scheme, state governments can pick up 34.88 lakh million ton of Tur, Chana, Masoor, Moong and Urad at a discount of Rs 15 per kg over the wholesale market price, and distribute through mid-day meal, PDS, Integrated Child Development Programmes (ICDP) etc.

""Government will spend Rs. 5,237 crore for implementation of this Scheme,"" Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs said in a statement, adding that it will be a one-time dispensation covering 12 months of demand, or complete dispensation of 34.88 lakh million ton stock, ""whichever is earlier"".

The government is also expecting good production this Kharif season as well. The decision will also help clear-up warehouses for the upcoming Kharif season commodities procured under Price Support Scheme (PSS). The government made record procurement of 45.43 lakh million ton pulses in Kharif 2017 and Rabi 2018 seasons under the PSS.

The government procured pulses from key growing states Telangana, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Maharastra, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh among others. After two great years, pulses sowing this year has fallen in comparison. However, with adequate rains in coming months, sowing activities are expected to pick-up.

Under the PSS system, the government procures oil seeds, pulses and cotton at a minimum support price (MSP) and provides remunerative prices to the farmers/growers. It is implemented in consultation with state governments, which also exempts these commodities from several levies such as mandi tax. The central nodal agencies then make logistical arrangements for the procured commodity from its storage to the creation of funds for the PSS operations."

Midday meals for 45.7 million children for a year. One day's wages for 200 million workers under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS). About 6 million new latrines. And at least 10 more Mars missions.

These were some of the things that could have been financed with the money that the current National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government spent on publicity in the four years it has governed India.

The Bharatiya Janata Party-led government spent $753.99 million on advertising its flagship schemes in the 52 months between April 2014 and July 2018, according to the information made available to the Rajya Sabha (Parliament's upper house) by Rajyavardhan Rathore, minister of state (Independent Charge) for information and broadcasting.

This amount is double the sum spent by the government's predecessor in 37 months: The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government spent $377.32 million between March 2011 and March 2014, according to this 2014 response to a Right To Information (RTI) query filed by activist Anil Galgali.

Of the Rs 48.8 billion the NDA spent on publicity, Rs 2.92 billion (7.81%) went to advertising four public schemes in three years-Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (Prime Minister's Crop Insurance Scheme) for crop insurance, Swachh Bharat Mission (Clean India Mission) for a nationwide cleanliness campaign, Smart City Mission and Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (Ideal Village Scheme for Members of Parliament) for urban and rural development.

When these figures came to light in July 2018, the government was criticised for not investing the money in public utilities.

5K Crores spent by Modi govt on advertising! Most of the advertisements are just of Modi's face. Apart from a colossal waste of public money which could have been used to build schools & hospitals etc, it gives a huge unfair advantage to party in power https://t.co/RWnxoEJxg8

-- Prashant Bhushan (pbhushan1) August 1, 2018

IndiaSpend calculations showed that the money spent by the NDA on publicity could have been used in critical government projects ranging from child nutrition to public health and sanitation.

There's been a 34 per cent rise in govt ad spend in four years

Government expenditure on advertisements rose 34 per cent from Rs 9.8 billion in 2014-15 to Rs 13.14 billion ($203.89 million) in 2017-18.

In 2016-17, the government cut down on print advertisements and channeled money into audio-visual publicity instead. But in 2017-18, it did the reverse-it spent more on print ads than audio-visual campaigns.

The 2017-18 trend seemed to have continued into this financial year too. The government's bookings in the four months to July 2018 show that it has spent double the money on print advertising over audio-visual publicity."

The State government has decided to introduce the mid-day meal scheme not just in Intermediate colleges, but in all government-run degree colleges, and polytechnic ones as well as those offering vocational courses.

The government aims to supply nutritious food to students in these colleges spread across 31 districts in the State through Akshaya Patra Foundation and the Foundation has accordingly been asked to put in place the amenities and infrastructure required for handling the task.

The Cabinet Committee headed by Deputy Chief Minister Kadiyam Srihari held discussions with the representatives of the Foundation in this regard on Friday.

In addition to Mr. Srihari, Ministers Eatala Rajender, T. Harish Rao, A. Indrakaran Reddy and Jogu Ramanna accompanied by senior officials tasted the food being supplied by the Foundation. The Foundation representatives informed the Cabinet panel that Akshaya Patra was implementing Annapurna scheme since the past four years without giving scope for any complaints. The Foundation has dedicated kitchens at Kandi, Narsingi, Kothagudem, Warangal and Mahabubnagar and it is in the process of setting up six more kitchens in different parts of the State.

Mr. Srihari wanted the Foundation to prepare a detailed report on the food items that would be provided to students as well as the estimated cost that would be incurred in the process by April 6. The report would be forwarded to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, who would take a final decision on the issue. The Foundation should also conduct a trial run of the scheme in selected institutions before the full-fledged implementation of the scheme.

The Foundation representatives told the Ministers that they would follow the suggestions and ensure that a report was submitted on the requirements and cost within four days.

Today's children are the future of tomorrow, and so it's important they have access to nutritious food right from birth through adolescence. However, India ranks 10th in terms of prevalence of underweight children in the world and 17th in terms of prevalence of stunting, according to UNICEF. To ensure that malnutrition doesn't affect children's cognitive development or physical growth, the ministry of women & child development (MWCD) approved the Poshan Abhiyaan (National Nutrition Mission) last year.

The initiative seeks to reduce the level of stunting, undernutrition and low birth weight by 2% each, and anaemia by 3%. It aims to reduce stunting from 38.4% (NFHS-4) to 25% by 2022. Its goal is to achieve improvement in nutritional status of children aged 0-6 years, adolescent girls, pregnant women and lactating mothers in a time-bound manner, over three years. Poshan Abhiyaan, as a policy strengthening the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), is a boon towards addressing child and maternal malnutrition.

A key idea of the initiative is to incentivise Anganwadi Workers (AWs) for using ICT-based tools, making it easier to implement and monitor the programme.

Earlier, AWs would keep beneficiary records and indicators related to the provision of services in registers, which have now been replaced by the Common Application Software (CAS) designed especially for the programme. The data is collected using smartphones provided to AWs. This data can then be accessed and analysed by supervisors using tablets, and the block, district, state and national level ICDS officers using the reporting dashboards, provided to them. It also seeks to provide performance-based incentives to AWs to encourage them to adopt and efficiently use the technology.

The rationale is that if this data is made available to the MWCD in real time, it will help track and analyse critical nutrition and performance indicators, including weight and height of children.

The programme has also been given substantial funding and importance, and has managed to create harmony, ensure better monitoring and issue alerts for timely action. It is expected to help the government map the nutrition and growth levels of beneficiaries with great accuracy.

Poshan Abhiyaan has enhanced the efficacy of ICDS in addressing malnutrition-related issues from the prenatal stage to six years. However, considering that adequate nutrition is necessary for children aged seven and above also, efforts should be made to ensure that the benefits of this initiative reach children above six years of age. That would be possible with the convergence of the Mid Day Meal (MDM) scheme with Poshan Abhiyaan. The MDM scheme provides freshly cooked nutritious meals to children in the age group of 7-14 years as an incentive to enrol and attend school.

While schools collect data pertaining to height and weight of children, it is not collated or analysed by any central agency -- data on malnutrition in the age group of 7-14 years is not readily available. The introduction of CAS for MDM will help school authorities collect real-time data on their smartphones and send it to nodal agencies, facilitating better implementation and monitoring of the school lunch programme. This real-time data will help formulate new strategies, fine-tune existing ones and even devise local strategies to make the most of available resources. Significant reduction in malnutrition can be achieved with clear policies and targets in place. This would require scaling up of funding across all related sectors and real-time monitoring and analysis of data -- the inclusion of MDM in Poshan Abhiyaan will help in both the aspects. If done effectively, this will benefit over 94 million children. In the long run, it will help coordinate the functioning of both the nutrition welfare programmes to achieve common goals, thus making Poshan Abhiyaan a well-rounded programme.

The Supreme Court today slapped Rs 50,000 each as costs on Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu and Uttrakhand for their failure to create a online link with a chart meant for monitoring the implementation and hygiene of mid-day meal schemes in government-run schools.

A bench of justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta expressed displeasure that these three ""defaulting states"" have not yet complied with the directions of the apex court in this regard.

""In view of the default of these three states, costs of 50,000 are imposed upon these states. The amount be deposited within four weeks from today with the Supreme Court Legal Services Authority for utilisation of juvenile justice issues,"" the bench said.

The counsel appearing for the petitioner told the bench that some of the states and Union Territories (UTs) have not yet created a separate link on website as required in terms of the court's direction and no chart has been filled up by them.

""The other defaulting states/UTs are Arunachal Pradesh, Dadar and Nagar Haveli and Puducherry. For the time being, we are not imposing any costs on these states.

Swati Narayan, a research scholar and an activist with the Right To Food campaign, recently mapped the inclusion of eggs in mid-day meals in schools and anganwadis across India using government data and media reports. The map, which looks at possible links between political ideology and the provision of eggs in these meals, was released on July 8, 2018.

Building upon Narayan's research, IndiaSpend analysed government nutrition data, spoke to several experts and government officials, and found that:

In India, 7.5 per cent children under five years of age are severely wasted-a rise of 1.1 percentage points from 6.4 per cent in 2005-06, according to National Family Health Survey 2015-16 data. All the experts IndiaSpend interviewed were of the view that eggs included in the mid-day meals of children could be a critical factor in combating malnutrition.

""Eggs will be helpful in addressing malnutrition among kids because scientific research shows that animal-based protein is better than plant-based protein,"" said Mansi Patil, a public health nutritionist and metabolism clinical dietician at AshaKiran Hospital, Pune.

Though some states in India had introduced mid-day meals earlier, this was universalised only in 2001. Eggs were first served in mid-day meals in Tamil Nadu in 1989, when the state was governed by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). The initiative started with one egg every two weeks and then was stepped up to one every week.

So why are administrations in BJP governed states-some of which, like Gujarat (39.3 per cent) and Madhya Pradesh (42.8 per cent), report a significant percentage of underweight children-not serving eggs in mid-day meals?

Officials in BJP governed states interviewed by IndiaSpend said they were concerned about offending the sentiments of vegetarians. ""In Gujarat, most of the population is vegetarian,"" said RG Trivedi, commissioner (mid-day meal scheme) in Gujarat. ""Additionally, we provide pulses daily in mid-day meals as protein-rich food, hence we don't serve eggs.""

Trivedi is correct-61 per cent of Gujarat's population is vegetarian, according to the latest available census data on food habits. This, however, is not true of the average Indian-70 per cent of Indians eat non-vegetarian food.

""You can compare protein content of vegetarian and non-vegetarian foods, but the quality of protein in eggs is higher than others according to the protein digestibility corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS),"" said Purnima Menon, Senior Research Fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), Delhi. PDCAAS is a tool to evaluate a particular protein's quality based on human requirements and how they digest it.

In Himachal Pradesh too, officials spoke of the concerns of vegetarian parents. ""We do not give eggs because of religious and cultural issues,"" said Naresh Sharma, nodal officer (mid-day meal scheme) for Himachal Pradesh. ""People in Himachal Pradesh consider eggs non-vegetarian and there are children whose parents would have problems if we served them. To avoid controversy, we don't."" The census doesn't provide data on vegetarianism in Himachal Pradesh.

Non-BJP states avoid eggs too, but BJP states most resistant

IndiaSpend investigations found that non-BJP states that do not offer eggs in mid-day meals were more constrained by the lack of resources than religious or cultural sentiments.

""Non-BJP states such as Punjab, Delhi and Mizoram also do not provide eggs.

And Jharkhand, a BJP majority state, does,"" said Sinha. ""But, in states like Gujarat and Rajasthan, you cannot even talk (about providing eggs) for the fear of hurting upper-caste Hindu sentiments. Over the years, activists have been demanding eggs, but there is more resistance in BJP states due to cultural issues.""

On April 22, 2018, the ministry of health and family welfare set off a controversy when it tweeted a stock photograph that seemed to indicate that a vegetarian diet is the only way to stay healthy. The tweet was later deleted, as Scroll.in reported on April 23, 2018.

Manisha Chachra, a research scholar in political studies at the Jawaharlal Nehru University who has studied the Hindu right-wing, explained the importance of sattvik food in its ideology. ""The BJP is an affiliate of the Sangh Parivar, which ideologically follows certain upper-caste Hindu beliefs as characteristics of Hindutva,"" she said. ""One of this is the sattvik diet, which excludes non-vegetarian food, onion, and garlic. There is a bigger dietary politics to this kind of exclusion (of eggs).""

In Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government has not been able to fulfill its promise of boiled eggs as part of the mid-day meal scheme for school, according to this April 9, 2018, report by India Today.

Sinha's argument about the need for more resources to provide eggs can be corroborated by Arunachal Pradesh's 2018-19 mid-day meal policy. ""Green leafy vegetables and fruits are available in rural areas with minimum prices and these are important items included in the menu, but eggs are not available and unaffordable,"" it said.

The north-east has a particular problem. Eggs are largely unaffordable here because there are free poultry industries, and this pushes up the price of procurement, said Narayan. ""If the central government wanted, it could have provided funds to all states for providing eggs, but it did not,"" she added.

Former union health secretary K Sujatha Rao told IndiaSpend that costs are a major concern in the inclusion of eggs in mid-day meals. ""It would be ideal to have village communities encouraged to develop hatcheries under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act scheme and have eggs provided to schools and anganwadis,"" she said. ""These interventions should be decentralised and communities should be more involved rather than only the government.""

The other view: Introduce eggs with caution

Some dieticians advocate caution in the push for eggs to be included in mid-day meals. ""We should 'introduce' eggs rather than include them,"" said Mansi Patil. ""If children are malnourished and we suddenly introduce eggs (into their diet), it may have a negative impact on their bodies. So let's say we should start with 2-3 eggs a week and then slowly increase (the numbers). We need to realise that a body needs fats and carbohydrates too. There needs to be the right mix of nutrients.""

Patil added that the number of eggs that need to be consumed depends on the kind of malnutrition a child suffers from and what kind of metabolism her body has. ""In severe acute malnutrition (SAM), as opposed to moderately acute malnutrition (MAM), we cannot introduce eggs right away. We need to focus on carbohydrates and energy first so that the body slowly shapes us to be able to take protein.""

Dipa Sinha, assistant professor, Ambedkar University, and an activist with Right To Food campaign, however, said that this cannot be a reason to deny eggs to children. ""The overall proportion of SAM kids is low so that cannot be a reason to not provide eggs,"" she said. ""For SAM kids, there is an established protocol, where they need to be taken to the hospital by anganwadi workers and treated accordingly because they are given a proper diet.""

Animal rights activists who advocate vegetarian food in the context of cruelty against poultry birds argue this differently. ""Chickens used for eggs are among the most abused animals on the planet,"" wrote Bhuvaneshwari Gupta, a former campaigner and nutrition adviser with PETA India, in June 2015 for the Huffington Post. ""Most are forced to live their entire lives in an area smaller than the size of an iPad screen. Their beaks are typically cut off with a hot blade to prevent them from pecking each other in frustration, because the industry simply won't give them more space.""

Narayan agreed that the poultry industry needed better standards of hygiene and should be more aware of animal rights. ""However, that cannot be a reason to deny eggs to children,"" she said."

As per the official data, milk production is estimated to have increased by 6.6 per cent to 176.35 million tonnes during the last financial year. The government expects milk production to touch 254.5 million tonnes by 2021-22."
