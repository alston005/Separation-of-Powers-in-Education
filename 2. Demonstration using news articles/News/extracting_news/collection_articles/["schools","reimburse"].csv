States in turn are to reimburse a certain amount of money for every RTE admission.

However, it turns out that the Maharashtra government is looking around for ways to not pay these schools the money it owes them.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Maharashtra, led by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, can claim credit for many successes, especially with the irrigation project Jalyukt Shivar and an impressive infrastructure upgrade topping the list. However, its record on one front has been abysmal, i.e., in fulfilling its responsibility under the Right to Education (RTE) Act.

According to Section 12 of the RTE, non-minority unaided private schools are required to reserve 25 per cent of the seats in entry-level classes (either primary level or Class 1) for students belonging to disadvantaged groups (DGs) [Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), etc] and economically weaker sections (EWS) [income less than a certain amount]. The state in return is supposed to pay these schools, for every RTE admission, an amount fixed by the government or the tuition fee of a school, whichever is less. Maharashtra has fixed an amount of Rs 17,000 a year for RTE students.

But it goes to great lengths to avoid reimbursing this amount to schools. Though the schools have been reserving seats under RTE since 2012, the government tried to get out of its commitment by simply agreeing to pay dues for only one academic year. Then, there was disagreement over the actual amount due and how it should be calculated. The government said it owed Rs 300 crore while the schools said the amount was more than 1,000 crore.

This mismatch in estimates came about because the government wanted to pay only for fresh RTE admissions while the schools were asking to be compensated for all RTE admissions (new and repeat/old students - explained in detail here).

Even to date, the dues of past academic years have not been fully released to all the private schools. Now, the Maharashtra government has come up with a new plan to avoid paying the money it owes to these institutions. In a government resolution released recently, it has modified the norms for RTE reimbursement stating that ""if a private school is using any government land and benefiting from the same then the school would not receive reimbursement for students who have been admitted in 25 per cent RTE quota,"" Mumbai Mirror reported.

Through this order, the government has effectively imposed a retrospective binding of sorts in an agreement that is in force for years and it has done so in a one-sided manner. This is a textbook definition of ""breach of contract"". When the government leased out land, it didn't impose a condition that schools will have to reserve 25 per cent seats for EWS/DG category students. Nor does the RTE Act mandate that those schools that have received land from the government at concessional rates will not be compensated for fulfilling the RTE quota. Hence, both from the RTE Act and the leasing agreement, the government's action is prima facie illegal. Less said about the ethical aspect of its action, the better.

Independent English Schools Association (IESA) secretary Rajendra Singh told Swarajya that ""the government's action is not just illogical but outright illegal. The RTE and land leasing are two separate contracts. In any case, under the RTE Act, the government gives reimbursement for only tuition fees and not for infrastructure costs the school has to bear. Land comes under the latter category. How can the two be clubbed? If the government was paying per student reimbursement for infrastructure costs also, then they had a case. In such a scenario, they could have deducted this from total reimbursement, but how can they not reimburse the tuition fees?""

Singh further explained that the government simply ""doesn't have the data to ascertain how many schools have the land leasing agreement with the government. Nor it has the manpower to determine this number. It will take anywhere between one to two years to collect the data. This is nothing but their latest attempt to delay payments to private schools."""

Irregular expenditures have been incurred while setting up and running new Kendriya Vidyalayas on the request of government-run institutions, and Rs 59.67 crore is still to be received for the schools being started.

A report tabled in Parliament Tuesday pointed out that as on March 31, 2016 an amount of Rs 59.67 crore was due for 81 such schools. Of these, 34 schools have been already been shut due to various reasons, making the possibility of recovery as remote, said a PTI report.

Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan sets up schools on request from PSUs and institutes like IIMs and IITs on their campus for children of employees working there. As per norms, the Public Sector Undertakings or the institutes are supposed to reimburse the cost of setting up and running the schools.

""The committee notes that KVS, an autonomous body under the HRD Ministry, establishes and manages KV and the scheme of KV has been extended to children of the employees of PSUs and government-owned Institutes of Higher Learning (IHL) on the condition that all recurring and non recurring expenditure on running these schools would be provided by the sponsoring agencies.

""The sponsoring authorities of some existing or functioning and closed project Vidyalayas defaulted in payment of dues resulting in recoverable amount of Rs 24.57 crore in the year 2003,"" the panel report said.

The committee said that along with the key concern of recovery of dues which have been long pending, the matter needs to be looked at in the larger perspective of the importance of Kendriya Vidyalayas in providing education.

The Parliamentary panel has recommended that after asking the sponsoring authority to transfer the infrastructural assets to KVs, the state governments and corporate entities in the area may be requested to contribute towards running of such schools under their corporate social responsibility initiatives."
