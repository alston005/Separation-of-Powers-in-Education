According to the new rules, 80% attendance is compulsory for students of class X and XII during the academic year from June 15 to February 15. The new rules have raised eyebrows among students.

According to the old rules, if students did not fulfil the attendance criteria, they could take the board exams as private students. However, the new rules mandate that students must have at least 65% attendance to take the board exams as private students.

In a small relief measure for students, the GSHSEB chairman has been empowered to relax the attendance requirement by 15% for students in individual cases under circumstances such as prolonged illness, the death of a parent or participation in NCC/NSS camps. Apart from these, if a student needs leeway on the attendance front, the parents make a representation to the school principal who will in turn forward it to GSHSEB officials.

According to data from the state education board, about 1 lakh students take the class X and XII board exams as private students every year.

The board's decision to make 80% attendance mandatory is its second major decision this academic year. In June, the board notified major changes to the rules for promoting students to higher classes."
