Conceived in 2013-14 by Shyamkant Anwane, the professor has trained 150 students in the last five years. As many as 140 have joined the one-year programme this time.

The professor believes the tutorials will help students in scientific fields, competitive exams and make the routine BSc course meaningful and technically sound. Explaining about the 'flipped classroom', he said he borrowed the idea from IIT-Bombay which has been providing lectures before holding class. ""When students come to class after hearing lectures, it triggers the process of thinking on the subject,"" he said.

According to the professor, flipped classroom allows them to do away with monotonous theoretical part while students explore their creativity in the 'Maple' lab during their free time in college. During the certificate/diploma course, students are taught the mathematical software named 'Maple' which is used in computing complicated equations, data analysis and plotting 2D or 3D graphical functions.

""Understanding of the subject becomes clear and students start ideating. Generally, students need to take up additional course after or during their degree programmes to learn the software. The syllabus is approved by the Nagpur University. However, students are encouraged to be innovative by applying ideas coming in their minds,"" Anwane said.

He added that the initiatives by college's department of Physics is limited to its students but from next year, the doors would be opened for outsiders as well.

""Learning physics along with Maple is certainly mould young minds to be innovators. We have been encouraging students to execute new ideas and never hesitate to open up for discussions,"" he said.

""In the academic session 2018-19, we plan to reach to maximum students through this CoC in the form of flipped e-classroom. We have uploaded six video lectures on Maple on YouTube which the students should listen to before reporting to the Maple Laboratory for hands-on experience. Some PDF worksheets on Maple are also made available on Google Drive.

Talking about teaching method, Anwane said students need to register online and subscribe the YouTube channel. Those not having access to smartphones or Internet are given hard copies.

""Whenever students have free slots or off lectures, they hear the lectures. So, there is no need to follow a timetable. We are maintaining the attendance in the lab along with their YouTube activity to ensure they go through the study material,"" he said.

How the course is run

In flipped classroom, online lectures are provided before the actual class is held. Students can go through them as many times as they need unlike a traditional classroom where the teacher delivers one lecture on a topic. Pre-hand involvement of students ensures meaningful interaction with the teacher later. Discussion on various points as well as problem solving is done. This opens scope of bringing out students' innovation and creativity.

On Tuesday however, Punjab state commission for the protection of child rights summoned both teachers and DEO in the office on January 18.

The commissioner has asked DEO, elementary Jaspreet Kaur to submit a detailed report with the commissioner on that day. She has also been asked to ensure the presence of both teachers who allowed the students to go out with heavy garbage bins during school time.

Head teacher Charanjit Kaur was suspended and class teacher Savita was transferred on Friday. But teachers' associations, residents and even parents were upset at what they perceived as a hasty decision. A total of 50 parents and residents reached the school and submitted in writing that they don't want action against the teachers.

On Sunday, a number of teachers and teachers' associations across the state wrote to the secretary, education, saying schools would boycott the cleaning process. They also slammed the government for not providing safai karamcharis in government primary schools and pointed out that under the Swachh Bharat Mission, students are involved in cleaning the school and surrounding areas.

Later facing criticism district education officer (elementary) Jaspreet Kaur had revoked the decision.

DEO (elementary) Jaspreet Kaur said, ""The teachers were at fault for sending students out of the campus alone. Though I understand it was not intentional, it was a highly negligent act. They were suspended as the video had gone viral and if the department had not taken stern action, it would have given a wrong message to all. I feel in these two days the teachers have realised their mistake and now many parents, teachers and residents have come up in their support. With examinations coming up, shifting the teachers could affect studies. Considering all factors, they have been reinstated,"" she said.

Commission chairman Sukesh Kalia said, ""The teacher and DEO have been summoned. The DEO has been asked to submit a detailed report on the issue. Besides the matter of the viral video, a genuine matter of the need of safai karamcharis in schools has been raised by teachers' unions. If needed, the commission will take up the issue with the government."""
