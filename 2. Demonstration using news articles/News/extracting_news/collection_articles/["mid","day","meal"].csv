The New Year is set to bring smiles on the faces of dairy farmers, thanks to firm prices of the skimmed milk powder (SMP) following export incentives by the government.

Most co-operative dairies and private players were able to get rid of their excess SMP stock, which led to firming up of prices by at least ₹20 a kg in the past fortnight.

A section of consuming industry, however, has claimed shortage of SMP as a reason behind sudden spurt in prices. They claimed that the dairies had reduced processing due to heavy losses in SMP last year and farmers stayed away from investing in additional cattle in the flush season causing supply shortage in certain areas. SMP prices increased from ₹195 to ₹220 a kg in recent trades.

However, industry leaders rejected the claims stating that price rise is a fall-out of exports and increased consumption and will ultimately benefit dairies and farmers.

""Last 2-3 years, SMP prices had declined significantly from ₹290 a kg to ₹130-140 per kg. This resulted in losses for farmers. So, they reduced buying or investing in new cattle. But with lower prices, consumption went up and now that the exports are happening with government incentives, we see prices improve. There is no shortage,"" said RS Sodhi, Managing Director, Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd (GCMMF) -- the marketer of Amul.

GCMMF has so far exported about 30,000 tonnes of SMP under the incentive scheme in past 2-3 months.

Notably, SMP prices had touched a peak of ₹290 a kg in 2014 but fell to as low as ₹130-140 a kg. On the advice of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), several States had also initiated the use of SMP for mid-day meal (MDM) scheme thereby increasing the consumption.

In June 2018, the Gujarat government had decided to provide ₹50/kg financial assistance for all SMP exports to be done by Amul for the next six months beginning from July 1. The ceiling for assistance was set at ₹300 crore. The government export data, however, compiled up to October 2018, doesn't show any significant rise in the exports.

Meanwhile, the glut situation appears to be over with stock position at about 80,000 tonnes in the country.

Even in Europe, SMP stock -- which was about 3 lakh tonnes earlier -- has come down to about 70,000 tonnes. The international SMP prices have shown a firm trend at $2,042 a tonne at Global Dairy Trade (GDT) auctions for December 18 -- closer to the 12-month peak levels of $2,051.

At a higher domestic prices of ₹200-225 a kg, the dairy co-operatives are still unable to profit, as the cost of SMP production is ₹230 a kg.

Private sector dairy veteran RG Chandramogan, Chairman and Managing Director of Hatsun Agro, stated that with reduced exports over the past three years, India faced a glut situation in SMP followed by a crash in prices."

Following complaints that some transport agents engaged for delivery of rice under the scheme in Bhadrak and Keonjhar districts are diverting the food grain for purposes other than providing supplementary nutrition to school children, the State Food Commission had sought immediate intervention of the Government.

Since corrective measures were not taken promptly, as normally expected, the Food Commission moved the Finance department with a request to conduct a special audit into the allegations on a priority basis.

The special audit suggested recovery of '1,888.72 lakh from officials concerned as bulk of the amount relates to short delivery of MDM rice by two transport agents. ""The audit report clearly brings out the gross misconduct and indifference of the District Education Officer (DEO), Keonjhar and other Government employees,"" said a letter of State Food Commission Chairperson Ranglal Jamuda to School and Mass Education department.

The audit found excess consumption of MDM rice by one Manna Trust over and above the requirement. The cost of the excess rice used was estimated at '6.53 lakh.

Bhayander assistant superintendent of police Atul Kulkarni, along with his team, raided the godown and seized 12,035 gunny bags containing the foodgrain. Each 50 kg bag had the stamp of the Food Corporation of India (FCI), Punjab. The crop year mentioned was 2017-18.

Investigations revealed the rice was allotted under the MDM scheme. Instead of transporting it to the beneficiary schools, it had been offloaded at the mill. Around 10 trucks loaded with foodgrain, parked outside the mill, were also seized.

The owners claimed the rice had arrived at the mill for cleaning and polishing and would then be transported to the schools. The owners, however, were not able to give details of the schools where the rice had to be delivered. Police seized two machines used for cleaning and sorting the rice. Police said the mill did not have licence to store foodgrains procured from the FCI.

Sensing the growing homophobia in schools, former student Kabir Karamchandani formed a support group titled Garv in February to address the issue. While the 20-year-old may be miles away, pursuing his higher education in Oberlin, Ohio, his legacy is being carried forward by a dedicated team of 'woke' boys and girls. Interestingly, the Garv initiative might be included as a case study in a large scale survey conducted by Humsafar Trust on bullying in schools.

In October, the Diss track trend hit India when Mumbai underground rapper Emiway took on popular singer Raftaar. When rapper Raftaar said in an interview that there was no money to be made in underground rapping and named Emiway, the 22-year-old Mumbai rapper released a diss track called Samajh Mein Aaya Kya trying to address the issue. Then Raftaar released a song, then Emiway released another... well, you get the drift. What makes it good for you is that you can follow them and enjoy some quality music.

What is it about Ludo King that has made it beat Temple Run, Candy Crush and Pokemon Go, to become the No. 1 free game on both Google Play Store and App Store? We dug deep to find out how this trend has seamlessly penetrated the lower rungs of the socio-economic segment, galvanising a strata that hadn't warmed up to digital games. Raamesh Gowri Raghavan, an ancient Indian games researcher and professor of archaeology at Mumbai University, believes the game has an innately competitive element which makes it addictive.

Makarand Deshpande, the maverick playwright, finished his 50th original script, Epic Gadbad, marking a milestone in a glorious journey onstage. A farce, it is a conclusion to his previous play, Shakespearecha Mhatara, which was a hilarious take on King Lear. While it was first staged at Prithvi Theatre in July 2018, the playwright has plans to bring it back to the city in 2019 as well.

In 2018, the iconic theatre group Awishkar Theatre brought Aranya Kiran directed by Ajit Bhagat. The play, staged 10 years after the death of its late director-playwright Chetan Datar, is set in the Mahabharata. It revolves around a self-questioning Lord Krishna (played by Sushil Inamdar) in Dwarka. The string of monologues with various lead characters -- wife Rukmini, brother Balaram, foster parents Nand and Yashoda and lastly, mother-like Gandhari -- interrogate Krishna's trickery, political moves and worldview. The play is still being staged and the next show is in January itself.

When Aneesh Bhasin, co-founder at Svami, told us his tonic water has 50 per cent fewer calories than Schweppes, its main competitor, we knew the way we had our gin and tonic was going to change forever. Made from quinine sourced from Congo, cucumber and lime from India, and grapefruit from the US, Bhasin has increased the carbonation over the months because ""Indians like their fizz"". Svami is getting ready to launch more flavours, and a ginger ale by February.

The backstory behind booze

What and Where: White Lady cocktail at The Bombay Canteen; Chanel No. 6 at House of Nomads; Sherlock In A Pickle at London Taxi; and Red Monsoon at Hakkasan

This year, Yash Bhanage, co-owner at The Bombay Canteen, and his research team soaked themselves in the history of single screen theatres as inspiration for cocktails. Not just them, several other bartenders tried to create a story out of their cocktails. For instance, Jiaan Kris J Lam, House of Nomads, created Chanel No. 6 (in pic) as an ode to the fashion house, and Ami Shroff at London Taxi, whipped up a Sherlock-inspired drink which stood out for its prominent notes of gherkin, tea and rose. Order a glass.

At, Harajuku, on Chapel Road, co-owner Saleha Bawazir wanted to bring the street food of Harajuku to Mumbai. So, the restaurant offers a wide range of sweet and savoury crepes; Dorayakis, palm-sized treats comprising a sweet filling sandwiched between two round cakes, among other things. Vikram Khatri, executive chef at Hello Guppy, also overhauled the menu to introduce a range of new items including caramelised popcorn with crispy bacon, beetroot rice cracker and tuna nachos pizza. ""Everybody knows about sushi and ramen. It was time to educate people that there's a lot more that comes from Japan,"" he says.

Inspired by the legendary wrestler, Mini Punjab introduced The Dara Singh thali on its menu this year. Not for the weak-hearted, it packs in the best of unlimited eating. It features 33 items, and includes aloo paratha, chur chur de naan, makki di roti, murg mussalam rice, lamb yoghurt curry, chicken Amritsari and more. If you're in for a man-versus-food contest, here's your best bet.

Development consultant Ragini Kashyap, who started Third Culture Cooks -- a multinational supper club -- likes to tell a story with a bite. Her venture, Bordered dinner, explores border conflict by pairing food with peoples' stories and history. We sampled the Tamil-Sinhala conflict in Sri Lanka, and returned knowing a lot more about our neighbour's culinary diversity.

If you are severely intolerant to gluten, there is a chance you have stayed away from vodka, which is made from wheat, barley, or rye. Well, Tito's Handmade Vodka that is produced in Austin at Texas's oldest legal distillery is now available in Mumbai. The drink is made using corn. Tito Beveridge, who came up with the recipe, distilled the corn mash six times, because it was believed that corn retains some of its smoothness even after distillation. The process of making the corn-based vodka is similar to that of the making of single malts and high-end French cognacs.

It's not every day that you come across pepper in your pannacota, which is why pastry chef Husna Jumani's timut-infused creamy Italian dessert is noteworthy. It's the pronounced flavour of the Nepalese pepper -- spicy with hints of grapefruit -- that propelled her to pick this as the hero ingredient. However, it is an acquired taste, she warns.

The ingredients of Du Rhone might be a well-kept secret, but not its stellar reputation. So when the 140-year-old gourmet chocolate brand opened their first store in May this year, we were the first to rush for a blind tasting evening. Our favourite was the Coline which is a dark ganache with 70 per cent cocoa beans from Brazil and Papua New Guinea.

The last one year saw a rise in the number of gourmet delivery joints in the city. The menu at these kitchens range from Bento Buddha bowls to coconut-panko crusted shrimps with orange and ginger dips. The food, then, is the biggest selling point. We'd recommend the Mis Malaysian Seafood Bisque from Hello Green.

The wandering Maharaj is invited for weddings and funerals, casual get-togethers and Diwali dos, any affair in which the party size is too significant for a regular cook, and when guests need to be impressed. Om Maharaj specialises in sweets, such as rasgulla and ghevar; and Lallan Maharaj, who has also trained in restaurants and five-stars for 13 years, can be trusted to pull off Italian and Chinese dishes convincingly. Lallan says, ""In this line of work, the person who knows his job, doesn't need the title. I have not kept my name maharaj. It's all of you who call me maharajji. So, now, it has become a surname.""

From kombucha to vegetable broth, mixologists discuss what you can replace your calorie-laden mixer with. The almond milk soda cocktail at Colaba's Bombay Vintage has an interesting backstory. Here, Sean Pereira, bar operations manager, uses doodh soda consumed by farmers in Peshawar to keep themselves hydrated.

A food service in Bandra has been made special by autistic students, who have donned chefs' hats to make the lunch break worthwhile. The students belong to the Support for Autistic Individuals (SAI), a charitable trust set up by Kamini Lakhani and her husband, Anil. The young autistic cooks need a fair amount of support. ""It will take them anywhere between one and eight months for them to understand all the steps,"" says Lakhani.

What can you expect when the power couple behind The Table teams up with the boys behind The Woodside Inn? Miss T, a gastro Asian cocktail bar and restaurant. Every cocktail we sampled was characterised by an adventurous, refreshing and comforting tag. The Quixotic (R850) came with peanut butter-infused Jim Beam bourbon, hints of saffron and orange bitters. In the food menu, we liked the chicken and tender coconut curry (R900) that came with pandan rice. The curry was light without lacking depth. We liked the food for its simple execution of flavours and lack of pretentiousness, which is just what an Asian meal should be.

One of Goa's most loved restaurants, House of Lloyd, made its Mumbai debut this year. We met the chef for a taste of the Goa-inspired menu. He has selected the choicest of dishes including rassa omelette, pork chops and clams masala. Now you know where to head for a susegad experience.

Chef Scott Linquist (who runs the Miami favourite Coyo Taco) and Jason Hudanish introduced chapulines or grasshoppers as an off-the-menu dish at Mexican restaurant Xico. The grasshoppers don't have a distinct taste and the texture is close to crunchy prawns. A rich source of protein, you can either eat the dried grasshoppers directly, or on tortilla.

Shunned by society, trans-women have found jobs sans judgment at Third Eye Café. We visited the restaurant to find a place that serves decent food, and the opportunity to the third gender to lead a respectable life. Spread over eleven pages, the menu offers Italian, Oriental and Indian cuisine.

A hoppumm is a marriage between Sri Lanka's hoppers, a type of fermented pancakes, and South Indian appams, and three school friends from Bombay Scottish brought it to Bandra this year. Hoppumm is a 15-seater restaurant, exuding architectural influences from Sri Lanka. The highlight is the bowl-shaped Sri Lankan pancakes filled with a range of fragrant curries. To make it flexible, they offer combinations where you can pair a base staple -- hopper, string hopper (idiyappam), neer dosa, paratha or kothu roti -- with a flavourful filling.

Mastani is a milkshake that comes topped with a dollop of hand-churned ice cream. Some people also add fresh cut fruits, dry fruits and whipped cream. It is believed that when guests tried it for the first time, they would exclaim 'masta'. It has become a part of Pune's food heritage, and you can now try it at a tiny dessert parlour in Vile Parle called Karandikar Mastani House. A simple store with a couple of chairs, this Mastani house offers eight flavours starting from mango to the interesting Irish pudding Mastani.

Chembur, the eastern suburb which last made headlines for a culinary reason in November 2016 when Matunga's iconic eatery Mani's Lunch Home moved here, is now in the midst of a hospitality boom. Want to spend a day indulging your cravings? Do it with as few steps as possible as you start off with Pot Pourri, Theobroma, then 99 Pancakes, Keventers, London Bubble Co, The Koffee Works, Wok Hei and then China Villa.

Did you know that the hair dryer, apart from blowing hair, can be used to relight charcoals on the grill, soften chocolate and frost cake? Chefs across Mumbai are putting non-kitchen items to good use. The stand out was Empresa Hotel chef Ajay Chopra's ingenious hack of using a coal iron to press a quesadilla.

Karan Johar recently appeared on best friend, Neha Dhupia's podcast, No Filter Neha, Season 3. He gave some interesting tidbits about the new star kids' brigade to watch out for in 2019. Once again, at the closing episode of the show, the flamboyant filmmaker made some unknown revelations, and also spoke about the constant pressure to look fashionable.

Karan Johar is going through Fashion Terrorism, read more to know why!

You know Neha, a lot of thought, energy, money goes into strategizing for what you are going to wear and even if you are 46, and you are going through mid-life crisis, this is what makes you happy. I'm going through mid-life crisis and it's fine and in fact, I'm going through mid-life ISIS. It's like fashion terrorism.

Karan's clarification to his iconic ""10 suitcases airport image""

So I've to tell you the schedule was such that I was going to London for 3 days which was like oscillating between pre-fall. So, I was confused between winter wear and the end of summer wear. So, it was a bit of trauma. Then I was going to this engagement for Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal and it was again going to get hotter and warmer in Lake Como, which was warmer than London. So, then there were was, of course, black tie looks etc. and there were shoes which are always heavy and there are jacket options. You must have 3 options for every look because you never know what's going to like work at that particular moment. Then I was going to Paris for Fashion Week, so I was going to Gucci show at Paris Fashion Week and then there were looks designed for that, so you must understand that it's very easy for you guys to just blame me for those 10 suitcases...

And apart from that, there are casual day-to-day wear, there are undergarments, I can carry a lot of underwear. Because I don't have time to send them always to the laundry, so I just wear fresh. And I like to change 3 underwears a day because the problem is that I don't like to be in one underwear all the time because it just makes me feel like my inners are suffering and I need to like always reinvent my inners. So there are a lot of underwears, there a lot of socks, a lot of shoes. And that's why there was so much required and that's why those 10 suitcases. So please don't make any kind of judgment on them, because you must understand and its better than emotional baggage, you actually carry baggage.

Karan Johar's Bharatnatyam-lunges in the gym

It's when I do these lunges, so I do a psyche of ballerina kind of a pose like my hand goes out, so I do Bharatnatyam/ballerina pose between each lunge, its part of the exercise routine. I just do it to make myself look graceful while doing the lunge because you know how crazy you can look while doing lunges. When I do it, I look like a mess, to give some grace I mix it with classical dance. It's like a class-lunge, like a classical lunge.

Karan Johar hates the gym

I hate the gym. It's just torture, first, you have to go there and then he (trainer) makes you do 5 mins of walking, then he starts killing you in between, then there is something called as functional training, then intermediate fasting then keto dieting. And I'm like so done, at this age why do I've to do this? Why can't I just eat meetha (sweets) and be happy? Why can't I just eat, but then I look at those clothes and I be like I'll never wear you if I don't wear out in the gym.

KJo's 7 lakhs indulgence on wine and salad in London

I've gone and given my card in the restaurant and the friend of Arvind's who was with us, who I don't know at all. He ordered some wine and we ordered another bottle, and I just had one glass, that's it. I hardly ate also because I had eaten and come and suddenly the bill came to me because I ate and suddenly they were like why did you do this. And I was like I really wanted to take you guys out, I had given the card in advance and it's all done and it's all good. And I opened the bill and I read 4500. And I was like 'No, they must have added an extra 0 by mistake.' I called the Maitri d'hotel and I said is this our bill right? He said yes and smiled, I said oh and I signed and gave him. And I think Arvind caught my expression and because of course I went little pale because imagine you are paying like a 10,000 dollar bill where you are expecting it to be 500 dollars, because we ate nothing, it was 2 salads, one dish and this wine, so the major cost was for the wine. And Arvind saw the bill, he froke out and he called Kajal as in Putlu who we know, he said Karan has paid 4500 dollars and I'm like it's okay its done, its fine it's over and one. It was absolutely fine, but it was historical that my face became (white) I was like this red wine has made me white. So I've paid at that time if you are saying by today's conversion its 10,000, I paid 7 lakhs for one salad and one glass of wine.

Like mere mortals, when KJo didn't have money to pay the restaurant bill!

We had all seen Lust Stories and we came back and again I didn't have my card and I was looking all over my bag, because I had forgotten my card, everyone was like what are you looking for, I said I was looking for my house keys, actually I was looking for my card, because I had no money. And then I walked thinking Taj is our house, our property. I went to the guy who is clearly new and looked at me like Who are you? And I said listen I don't have my card but just I'll clear it tomorrow morning, he said no sir that won't be possible. And I was like hain? And then I was like oh god I've no money, I'm very embarrassed and I don't know what to do. And I was like very embarrassed and I told you I have this thing in my head that my father has taught me, then I told Shashank, chalo Shashank toh apne ghar ka hain, Dharma Productions ka hain, toh I said tu pay karle toh at least it looks like hamare taraf se aaya hain, his card didn't work and then Angad your very gracious husband has decided to take the tab. But it was very torturous for me, those 20 mins were torture for me because I don't know what it feels like to not have money in my bag and not pay for a meal or just able to offer at least and I had nothing but my house keys and 2 bitter chocolates.

If Karan Johar is throwing a MET Gala, guess what he wants the theme to be and 3 fashionistas he will definitely inviting!

If I have the MET Gala in India, I would go completely Indian with it. The idea is to platform out beautiful garments, our culture, and our beautiful embroidery and our beautiful fabric. I will go Royal Indian that would be my theme, The Royal rich Indian. Fashionistas that I would have - Amitabh Bachchan to start with I think predominantly the face of fearless and fabulous fashion I think he is amazing, he can pull off any garments with panache with style with absolutely and amazing grace. Then definitely you cannot have a fashion segment without involving Sonam Kapoor because she pretty much started the entire ball rolling and I would have her and she would look beautiful in this Indian look, royal wear and of course I would finish off my trilogy of fashionistas with Ranveer Singh, who is out there, who is completely fashion-forward, fashion progressive, who walks the fine line between androgynous and hyper-masculine and I think he can do both with equal ease and equal panache. So I think these would be my 3 must haves on the Red Carpet for my MET Ball.

Guess which Indian, Karan Johar think is going to win an Oscar?

Nawazuddin Siddique

Did you know, Karan Johar cried after watching some glimpses of Alia Bhatt's performance in Kalank?I saw something that Alia had done in Kalank and I was just so moved by the work she had done. She has worked very hard towards it. When you see Alia I get the feeling like I'm seeing my daughter perform and because I have that emotion for her, I started crying in the end for some weird reason. I'm going through something internally, which I'm not aware of and I just got very teary-eyed. And I rang her up and said her I got very emotional, well done!"

But to recognise how well a wine pairs with the food or go down with your guests, you don't need a sommelier's powers to discern a Sauvignon blanc from a Chardonnay. Or know Syrah and Shiraz are the same wine, but the same-sounding petite Sirah is not. Or even pronounce those French names right - Merlots, Cabernet sauvignons, Pinot noirs and, in a rare encounter, Gewurztraminers. And, according to Simon Tam, Head of Wine at Christie's Hong Kong, also not so much about perfecting the 5 S' of wine tasting - see, swirl, sniff, sip and savour. Just the finish at the end of 'savour'.

""The only quality all winemakers judge and strive to produce is the length of the flavour - that lovely lingering flavour (aftertaste), also known as 'finish'. Its length is not measured in inches or centimeters, but in time.... Gentlemen,"" winks Tam, during the mini wine tasting session he held in mid-November in Mumbai's Christie's auction House at the viewing of paintings by the usual suspects of Indian Modernism - SH Raza, MF Husain, FN Souza, Ram Kumar.

Tam, at 50, has a 30-year career in wine business. Before taking up his current role in 2011, he owned a vineyard in Australia, nurtured the Chinese wine market as an educator and consultant, created an iPhone/iPad app, Flavour Colours to pair Chinese food with wine. He's now working on a book about the shape of flavours.

Dressed head-to-toe in shades of purple (read suit, tie, and phone cover), Tam largely dispelled the myth that choosing wine is subjective to individual tastes. He insists that you can pre-decide what wine to serve your guests. ""Choosing wine objectively can put a sense of place, price, and occasion to wine. What you drink after a tennis match when dehydrated will differ from a romantic setting when you're looking into your wife's eyes.""

Exactly why Tam feels a wine with a long finish is your safest bet when catering to a large audience or an eclectic meal. To prove this, at the Christie's Mumbai tasting session, he conducted a small experiment. It involved timing the finish of a white wine followed by red using the stop watch on your phone.

When we gulped the red, Tam starts the stop watch and a monologue, ""Run your tongue inside your cheeks (your own preferably). Silky? Taste the saliva under your tongue. Can you taste the fruit? Soft, fruity, jam-like, and now it starts to fade a little... Now you're left with? Just dryness... The fruit has dropped away and you're left with the tannins. Stop the clock...34.99 seconds.""

And the white wine, a Sauvigon Blanc from Somerset, France, that we'd gulped before the red, ""tasted like a cold green apple on a hot summer's day"" and left a 42.8-second aftertaste.

For Tam, 42.8-second and 34.99 second finishes are long enough to be considered a good wine. ""When you run a marathon, you train yourself properly. With wine tasting, you have to train your mouth properly.""

Before we tried red, Tam asked to rinse our mouths with red wine itself for a fresh palate. Not water. ""Your mouth has a PH level of 7, which is neither alkaline nor acidic. Wine has a PH level of 3.1-3.2. After your palate gets used to this acidity, and you drink water, the wine you have after, especially if it's a red for its tannins, will feel extremely sour, harsh, even bitter and quite unattractive.""

But Tam's most quirky take on wine are his definitions on the types of textures, which he puts in four categories. ""Europeans talk about light-bodied and full-bodied, which, to me, feels like chicken soup and milkshake. You can look up the names, vintages, pricing, auction results, but it's all about whether you like milkshake with the fruits and flavour or without?"" So, his own interpretation reads as light-bodied - thin chicken soup); medium-bodied - thick chicken soup; and full-bodied - milkshakes.

Tam thinks, medium flavour red wines to full bodied cabernets and malbecs wines work in India. Given the food pairing, wines too light will get missed out here. Also, what Asia on a whole lacks, is proper storage facilities, that is dust-and-vibration-free, as this changes the wine's composition, feels Tam, who even finishes a glass of 'bad' wine, ""so I remember why I didn't like it.""

Champagne is consumed the most world over because it's incredibly delicious and you can't go wrong with it. I have 3,000 bottles of champagne in my own collection.

A wine doesn't need to be expensive to taste good. Recognise that each price point delivers its own level of quality and you'll find a better value.

Serve/drink the older wine before the younger wine, a joy to experience an old vintage on a clean palate.

Break rules. In Burgundy region of eastern France, red wine is had before white. Pair an extremely spicy dish with dessert wine. Red wine with red food and white wine with white food doesn't always work. Chicken is prepared in so many variations that colour of the wine alone can't be the decision maker.

Preferably, buy wine directly from a château or domain, because quality gets compromised when it exchanges third, fourth, fifth hands while it travels.

Keep all the receipts and paperwork if you've purchased wine off an auction. Fastidious the collector, higher the return."

In the whole process two BJP ministers, Ch Lal Singh and Chander Prakash Ganga, lost their ministry, BAR Association Jammu jumped into the controversy but was ultimately made to retract as Supreme Court intervened and transferred trial of the case to Pathankot for trial on day to day basis. For the first time in history of Jammu and Kashmir NC MLA, Mohammad Akbar Lone shouted pro Pakistan slogans inside the Assembly and Assembly also witnessed breach of protocol controversy between Speaker and Deputy CM. Governor N.N. Vohra got replaced with SP Malik, ending his long tenure in Jammu and Kashmir. To strengthen the administration, CS and one advisor from outside state were appointed.

On terrorism front, continuing from where they had left, terrorists struck on the first day of the new year in South Kashmir at CRPF camp and the encounters continued throughout the year in the valley as terrorists even attacked Military Station Sunjwan at Jammu, again

struck at Jahajjar Kotli Jammu and assassinated BJP leader Anil Parihar and his brother at Kishtwar. Kidnappings / killings of belt men and their relatives were a common phenomenon throughout the year, be it the occasion of Diwali or Ramzan. On one hand school bus got stone pelted while on other hand a young Chennai tourist lost his life in an unfortunate stone pelting incident. FIRs were also registered against army men despite AFSPA. Jammu bore the brunt of across the border shelling as the entire IB and LOC was active throughout the year with Indian army / BSF giving Pakistan a befitting reply from time to time. With missing bunkers, crumbled health services, thousands migrated from borders in peak summer.

Another area of tragedy was repeated major accidents on Ramban, Doda, Kishtwar, Bhaderwah highway along with Poonch - Rajouri highway. Among the dead were pilgrims of Amarnath and Chandi Mata. Eight local tourists also lost their life as huge boulder fell on them at Siar Baba water fall. All the accidents once again exposed the state of trauma centres along with district hospitals though work on five new medical colleges was taken up a step forward with appointment of principals. J and K also witnessed Basant mania for a brief period with IGP Traffic becoming hero for some while villain for others and finally got transferred.

Power segment remained affected throughout the year as Jammu division suffered in summer and Kashmir in winter with no serious efforts by the authorities to upgrade the infrastructure despite repeated reminders/ reprimands from Central PMDP team. On the development front historic Raghunath Mandir and Mubarak Mandi projects proved hype only along with Smart City projects as no substantial progress could be noticed this year. Baramullah to Kupwara railway line got approved and the first phase of the survey for the Bilaspur-Manali-Leh railway line project also got completed as initial estimates put the cost of the 465 km line at ?83,360 crore and even Jammu-Rajouri-Poonch railway line got approved .

Karan Singh retired from Rajya Sabha and Gulam Nabi Azad was declared best parliamentarian for the year 2015. Mehul Chowksi defrauded J and K Bank of 152 crores. Both JU and KU got their new VCs but simultaneously SKUAST(J) rating nosedived from 15 to 24.Aircel and Reliance Communications shut down their operations leaving lakhs of subscribers high and dry. This year, FM Drabu's statement on Kashmir situation cost him his ministry. BJP blocked revised militant rehabilitation policy though it diluted its stand on Article 370 and 35 A. J and K's KAS exams adopted UPSC pattern and 23 ETT colleges were sealed in the this year.

Daughter of soil, Professor Neelu Rohmetra, Director IIM Sirmaur, HP received the 'First Ladies Award' for being the first woman to head an IIM.

This year also NIA kept its pressure on hawala operators and even raided central jail Srinagar from where number of mobiles, SD cards and other material got recovered. For a change 150 bungalows by politicians also got vacated this year. Print media also suffered this year as Shujat Bukhari, Editor in Chief of Rising Kashmir, was shot dead by terrorists. Chief Secretary BB Vyaas got the extension but later on under Governor's Rule was appointed as an Advisor to Governor, later on as member UPSC. DGP SP Vaid was replaced by Dilbagh Singh under Governor's Rule. Border residents got major relief as reservation was extended to residents of IB on the pattern of LOC residents.

In last six months with new Governor came the fresh breeze, things started rolling as long delayed projects like AIIMS, Jammu-Akhnoor road widening got much needed flip, corruption was taken seriously by new Governor with the cancellation of state employees insurance with Reliance as well as talks with AFCONS for two 10 kms tunnels for 1000 MW Pakal Dul hydro-electric project were shelved. Panchayat and Municipal elections were successfully conducted despite boycott by both NC and PDP and power equations took interesting turn with NC rebel spokesperson Junaid Azim Mattu got elected as Srinagar Mayor with BJP support. Final tally of both Jammu and Kashmir were very interesting , out of total 1144 seats BJP got 312 (Jammu 212, Kashmir-100), INC 267 (Jammu-110, Kashmir -157) and independents whopping 363 ( Jammu-185, Kashmir-178). Three candidates got elected with lottery system and Soura in Srinagar had a distinction of not casting a single vote though 11,265 voters were there with three candidates in fray. On the similar pattern Panchayat polls were also successfully conducted leaving a big question mark on boycott call of NC and PDP. Under the Governor SAC took some long awaited decisions like increase of honorarium of thirty thousand SPOs, setting up Anti Corruption Bureau, damage to horticulture sector due to untimely snowfall causing hundreds of crore loss as such was declared natural calamity, reservation for disabled, scholarship for specially able students to name a few. Major inter-state agreement of Shahpur - Kandi was signed this year. Ujh multi-purpose project also got cleared. Valley saw its first ever mass wedding as 105 tied knot at one place.

Kashmir got new IGP in SP Pani and many prominent terrorists were eliminated including Naved Jat , killer of Shujat Bukhari but the most disturbing news was arrest of engineering students with arms and ammunition from Punjab colleges, PhD scholars joining militancy under the influence of radicalization. CEC LAHDC, Dr Sonam Dawa Lonpo , passed away and Ladakh MP, Thupstan Chhewang resigned from Parliament as well as BJP on account of alleged neglect by BJP on issue of UT status. Initiative of 23 GW ultra mega solar power project got a flip as under phase one of the project, 2,500 MW Solar PV Capacity for Kargil region and 5,000 MW for Leh district got sanctioned.

Ladakh got its first University after 71 years and J and K got Special Industrial Package. HC directs removal of encroachments and illegal constructions in and around Tawi river from Nagrota to Mandal Phallian.

With President's rule now prevalent in State, administration is in full throttle, daily reformative progressive decisions taken, one can feel the much needed flip of development which people of Jammu and Kashmir hope will continue in the ensuing year and on this positive note we wish all our readers 'A Happy New Year'."

Releasing a white paper on human resources and social development at the Grievance Hall in Undavalli on Friday, he said overall budget allocated to the Education Department was increased from Rs 15,681 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 24,961 crore in 2018-19.

He said after bifurcation, the State government gave top priority to the education sector. A knowledge mission was set up to benefit youth. Many steps have been taken to reduce dropout rate and improving infrastructure in educational institutions. The government spent Rs 100 crore for buying furniture and building toilets in schools.

The Chief Minister said 1,217 virtual classrooms and 3,640 digital classrooms were developed in government schools. Wifi facility was provided in all junior and degree colleges and 11 private universities were set up.

The Chief Minister said 10 universities got NAAC accreditation and six universities are in top 100 in National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) of the Union HRD department. He said priority has been given for skill development and Jnanabheri programme is being organised to bring awareness among students.

(HT File)

With some school headmasters (HMs) dragging their feet over paying penalties for allegedly inflating attendance of students, the Bihar government has finally decided to recover fines by deducting the amount from their salary.

The HMs allegedly spiked attendance of students to claim more funds under the mid-day meal(MDM) programme.

Though the government received reports of irregularities long ago and imposed financial penalty on HMs, the fines could not be fully recovered. Many of the HMs moved court for relief citing their unwanted involvement in non-academic work, while others were just indifferent.

The government has ordered the recovery of a Rs8.68-crore penalty from HMs. Of which, Rs 4.21-crore (48%) has been recovered. More than 1,000 HMs have allegedly fudged the data since 2013, when the idea of penalty was first mooted by the state education department.

RK Mahajan, principal secretary of the department of education, recently directed all district programme officers (DPOs) to deduct the penalty amount from headmasters' salary in five instalments over as many months.

""The DPOs must ensure a monthly deduction from all those who have not deposited the penalty amount within a month of the receipt of the letter, except those who have got stay from the court,"" stated a letter by Mahajan.

""During inspections, the attendance of that particular day in the school and the average of the previous week is matched. If the deviation is within 10%, there is no issue. However, if the deviation is above 10%, a penalty equivalent to the amount given in the last three months is imposed on the headmaster,"" said Vinod Kumar Singh, director of the mid-day meal programme, .

Another official said that in several cases, the accused HMs with the help of their association approached the Patna high court or the Lokayukta, claiming that they were overburdened with non-academic work like management of MDM. The court has also asked the government to find an alternative to free teachers from MDM responsibilities.

Though the Bihar government tried to hand over MDM to NGOs or self-help groups (SHGs) and also ran pilot projects, a viable alternative has not been found because of the scale of the programme. In Bihar, despite a drop in enrolment numbers, 1.20 crore students from Class 1 to Class 8 are estimated to avail MDM daily.

In a Niti Ayog meeting a few months ago, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar advocated the direct benefit transfer for the centre's flagship MDM programme to plug leakages. ""Cooking in schools has a direct bearing on education. Instead of centres of learning, schools are viewed as centres of food. Poor quality and unhygienic conditions often lead to unpleasant incidents,"" he had said.

However, to achieve this, the Centre would have to change the policy at the national level, which seems unlikely. Bihar, on its part, has been seriously mulling the option of handing over MDM to women SHGs, which are 8 lakh in the state, the highest in the country. A pilot project has been launched in one block each of Jehanabad and Muzaffarpur to assess the feasibility."

Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu on Friday sought votes for the welfare schemes implemented and development achieved during the last four-and-a half years against odds, and for continuing the work to reach the objectives.

During his interaction with beneficiaries who received assets for self-employment and later in his speech at the Adarana III Mega Grounding Mela here, he said each family was given five to ten benefits with implementation of housing schemes, Adarana, Chandranna Bima, Pellikanuka, welfare pensions, Anna canteens, unemployment allowance, public distribution system, gift hampers for festivals, maternity and child health schemes, mid-day meal and roads, office buildings and toilets in villages, among others things.

The third phase of Adarana covered two lakh persons with an outlay of ₹1,000 crore

All those who got benefit should co-operate in the elections to get more benefits, he said repeatedly seeking the support of people in the 2019 election.

Recalling that in spite of knowing the difficulty involved, he had gone in for farm loan waiver of ₹24,000 crore though banks and the RBI opposed.

The Narendra Modi Government created hurdles by not covering it in the revenue deficit due to the State. However, they were indulging in some talk of it (loan waiver) now, he said.

He would not rest till the goal of ₹10,000 monthly family income to the poor, housing for all by 2022 and MSME parks in each of the Assembly constituencies and tapped water to all the houses in two years were achieved, he said.

Isolated reports had also appeared that the Centre was considering a national debt waiver package for farmers. But there's a bright new idea in town and it has come from Telangana and it may even decide the future of our agricultural policies.

Telangana's Rythu Bandhu scheme offering a crop neutral investment support Rs.4,000 per acre to farmers with land titles has been recognized for over a year as the brightest idea for quite some time in agricultural policy. Strangely no state gravitated to it until the TRS's landslide victory in the recent assembly polls. One of its manifesto promises was to double the amount and make it available to tenant farmers too. The party's sweep of rural Telangana at a time when ruling parties everywhere faced the heat of farmers distress indicated that here was one party that seemed to get it right.

No sooner than BJP-ruled Jharkhand announced its willingness to implement the Rythu Bandhu scheme, the Central government is also toying with a Rs.1.3 crore direct benefit transfer scheme with states also sharing a small part of the fiscal burden. While it is unclear how long the project will take to roll out given the poor condition of land records (Telangana first went for digitization), this is a positive direction and there will be no return from this path once taken.

It can also be expected that true to the Modi government's track record it will aim to roll out the project without all the nuts and bolts in place and hope to fix the problems as and when they emerge. Given the impending elections and the need to assuage farmer anger, one cannot blame the central government for the haste. It is also certain that Congress will head into the Lok Sabha elections promising instant farm loan waiver.

This clash of ideas is good for the 2019 polls. NDA carried forward UPAs ploy of promising higher MSPs and greater procurement but reports indicate that neither of these promises could be met because of the crash of commodity prices. The blame must also be taken by the promises of MSP and procurement which incentivised too many farmers to target these crops with the result that only the well-connected farmers and middlemen cornered the benefits of MSP.

Hopefully, with Rythu Bandhu the government will distance itself from MSPs, procurements, and farm loan waivers and allow the market dynamics to take precedence. Concurrently, improvements in storage and cold chain networks will help. K Chandrashekhar Rao may just have offered Prime Minister Narendra Modi his much-needed reform package to reboot agriculture. The Rythu Bandhu scheme continues the glorious tradition of schemes rolled out by states becoming the model for national programmes.

K Kamaraj's idea of the mid-day meal scheme is the forerunner to today's ICDS. Likewise, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan passed Right to Information Act much before (1997 and 2000 respectively) the UPA government's RTI Act of 2005. Maharashtra had a rural employment guarantee scheme from 1972 itself. All this raises the question: wouldn't a coalition of national parties with regional outfits bode better for India than a single national party like BJP and Congress lording over the country?"

Whether you are an amateur runner, professional marathoner, young or old runner, proper training is indispensable for successful completion of a marathon.

Having said that it is equally important to enjoy the race and the spirit of the marathon than solely focusing on finishing it.

Savio D'souza, a former marathon champion shares a few tips that will help you prepare for a marathon.

Training

The primary thing to make sure is that you simply work with a coach or prepared runners who can prompt you around prepare you well with the necessary requirements for the run.

Practicing depends on how long the runners are training themselves. The runners should train themselves keeping in mind the distance they will be running.

A person training for a 10 km marathon should not run a 21 km marathon at the last minute as it might lead to injuries.

Also, the runners need to check with their physician before beginning any extensive exercise program like training for a marathon.

Make a reasonable weekly workout schedule and stick to it. Elderly runners should do medical checkups and look after their health to avoid injuries on the race day.

Be proactive in your approach to injuries and don't ignore the warning signs of an injury.

Runners should train smart, not hard. While the runners are training themselves, a well-devised training plan gradually increases the mileage.

Sports gear

Along with proper nutrition and exercises, the sports gear is one of the essentials for a marathon.

Starting from choosing the comfortable apparel to the right pair of shoes, tested running gear is considered as the preferred wear for the marathon.

The wrong pair of shoes increases the chances of a knee injury.

For the first-timers, the ideal time for buying a sports gear is at least two months prior to the marathon as one needs to be comfortable in the running attire.

It is recommended to opt for the fabric that best suits your body.

Fuelling

It is ideal to have energy-rich foods like oats and tea and also ensure that the body is well-hydrated.

Do not change the routine.

If you consume tea or coffee daily, do not skip it on the race day.

Energy is most vital for running marathons.

With less than a month to go for the race, it is important to ensure that your body is trained the right way. Eat meals that give you proper nutrients and avoid oily foods.

Do not run the race empty stomach, as it will lead to acidity or weakness.

On the day of the race, drink 1-2 glasses of water as you wake up in the morning; followed by a healthy breakfast that includes healthy fruits, dry fruits, or oats to keep your stomach full enough so as to sustain through the race.

The most important thing is to have a watch on your post-run meal.

Many runners neglect this. It is important to have light meals and not include junk food in the diet.

Hydrate well

In order to strengthen your muscles and enhance the comprehensive performance, proper hydration is of utmost importance.

Water not only helps in staying calm but also relieves pressure which in turn boosts your performance.

On the day of the race, runners should consume enough amount of water to avoid the risk of overheating the body and lack of glycogen.

Race Day tips

It is recommended to carry a banana or dry fruits. Consuming a banana about half hour before the run will help the runners survive the race.

Be mentally prepared for the race and also visualise the route.

Make mental notes with regard to the water stops and also, have a defined plan on how much mid-race hydration and nutrition you will need and at the various points in the race.

On the race day, breakfast is a must.

A light, ideal and energy packed one.

Hydrate your body well for several days leading up to your marathon.

Drink a big glass of water before you go to bed the night before race day; drink another one first thing in the morning.

Carry energy drinks, electral water or chew bars that are easy to digest as well as easy to carry, to keep the body charged.

A few small things to keep in mind

Make sure that the laces are tied; the clothes are comfortable to the body and ensure neat and well-tied hair so as to keep you from disturbance during the run. Runners should do light stretching and light exercise before the marathon. Do not hesitate in taking help from the pacers. Also, for all sort of runners, a marathon isn't for competition. Run for your delight and enjoy yourself.

6. Post-marathon

Keeping the body well maintained and healthy even after the marathon is a must.

After completing the run, runners should keep practicing and exercising. Your body will need recovery and thus, you might crave for foods and liquids.

Make sure your body gets healthy calories and enough hydration to help recover it.

A diet that includes light and nourishing food is easy to digest. For instance, vegetables and fruits are some of the food items that help your body nourish, speed up and recover after the race.

Punjab's potato growers have been facing another bad year. The Indian Express explains why the problem is recurrent and what can be done.

What is the current price of potato in wholesale and retail markets?

Punjab farmers have begun harvesting this year's potato crop. The season will continue until March 2019. With cold stores still stocked with 25 per cent of last year's harvest, the wholesale rate of the crop is Rs 2.50 to Rs 3.50 per kg, almost the same as in 2016 and 2017. Consumers on the other hand are paying retail prices of Rs 15 to 20 per kg. Farmers say they are being cheated by the middlemen.

What is per kg production cost of potato?

Punjab is major grower of seed potato. Out of its total 2.3 MT production, 65 per cent comprises seed potatoes produced in 98,000-odd hectares across the four Doaba region districts of Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Hoshiarpur and Nawanshahr.

Production cost of seed potato is Rs 9 per kg, much higher than the table variety. It includes Rs 3 for harvesting, packing and keeping in cold stores or transportation to mandies. Seed potato is harvested in February-March and then kept in cold stores to supply to other states during the year.

Punjab grows around 35 per cent table potato, the harvesting of which starts in December. The cost of production is Rs 5.5 to Rs 6 per kg. Farmers get around 80-100 quintal potato from one acre of seed potato and 120 to 140 qunital per acre table potatoes. Growers say their operations are not viable if the rate goes below Rs 1,000 per quintal potato, or Rs 10 per kg.

Why the glut like situation every alternate year or sometimes 2-3 years continuously?

Punjab is a major supplier of seed potato to farmers in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and other producing states. Seed potato rate cost ranges from Rs 2500-3000 for branded and Rs 1800-2000 for unbranded varieties. As seed purchasers of other states cannot afford to plant new seed every year, they use seed from their own potato crop for the second year. This is what leads to the glut every alternate year.

Potato growers in Punjab then face double loss -- keeping potatoes in cold stores (rental cost of Rs 22-23 per quintal per month) for months; and, disposing their costly seed potato as table potato in the market, as the stores need to make space for the new crop. Since 2007 there have been only three excellent years, three average and four including current year bad years for potato growers.

What is the way out?

According to farmers and experts, if government streamlines the wholesale and retail prices by keeping a control on middlemen or traders, they would be able to recover the cost if not the profits. They said government's intervention is required to include Punjab in TOP (Tomato-Onion-Potato) Scheme so that government can purchase potato at fair price. Like Kinnow crop, the government should help potato growers through e-markets and facilitate export to Middle East countries and to Russia.

Has the state government done anything to help?

Not this year yet, but last year on the direction of the Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, Markfed, a government-owned unit, had purchased around 450 tonnes (4500 quintals) of the potatoes for supplying to schools under mid-day meal scheme, but it was too little. Secretary, Agriculture and Managing Director, Punjab Agro, Sibin C said that they held a meeting in which the matter of potato export to Middle East countries was discussed."

As many as 13 schools have recorded zero enrolment, while another 171 schools have fewer than 20 students. A total of 1,140 schools have fewer than 40 students.

These were the details furnished by the state in 2017-18 to the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), a database about schools in India, developed at the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA). According to officials, the reason for the low enrolment is parents' preference to private schools due to lack of infrastructure, teacher absenteeism, and poor quality education in government schools, among others.

This is in addition to 1,773 schools without buildings, which the government plans to merge with nearby schools with infrastructure. The merger plan comes after the state failed to land for the 1,773 schools. Most of these schools have been merged. Of them, 190 schools in Patna district alone.

The enrolment in government schools dropped to 1.8 crore in 2017-18 from 1.99 crore in 2016-17. The number is expected to drop further when fresh data is examined, diluting the government claim of more than 99% enrolment.

The most alarming trend reflected through U-DISE is that the dropout rate from Class 9 to Class 10- almost 25% of the total enrollment in 2014-15, which jumped to 39.73% in 2016-17, the period when there was unprecedented increase in the number of students failing in Bihar class 10 and 12 board exams.

One of the reasons for the drop, authorities admitted, is parents' preference for private schools for better education and infrastructure.

""If the incentives (such as scholarships, bicycles) attached with government schools are removed, the number will drop further. Many students get admitted to government schools to avail incentives but study in private schools. In 2011, when reports on inflated enrolments surfaced, it created a flutter,"" an education department official added.

Three years ago, the then principal secretary, department of education, Amarjeet Sinha, had said the duplication of enrolment in government schools could be up to 20%.

Bihar Education Project Council (BSEPC) director Sanjay Singh, however, said that the drop in students' number was due to government's drive to do away with duplication in enrolment. ""The number children availing mid-day meal has come down to 1.20 crore compare to previous years,"" he added.

Singh said that the sanctity of data was being maintained. ""Earlier, there was no data on private schools. Now, that is also being prepared. Around 12 lakh more students have joined private schools, not necessarily because they have suddenly opened, but because they are being documented,"" he added.

Singh said under the Right to Education Act, there should be a school within a kilometre for Class 1-5 students provided there are a minimum of 40 students. ""If that is not the case, teachers can be used elsewhere more effectively. Having 3-4 teachers for fewer than 40 children is not relevant,"" he said, adding he would do another appraisal in January after studying the reasons and reports of physical verification."

There is a predictable knee-jerk reflex of conventional economic pundits, on mentioning freebies such as free or concessional supply of electricity for agriculture, farm loan waiver, distribution of free laptops, television sets, grinders, bicycles, shoes and the like to students and others belonging to low-income groups and generally any food and agricultural subsidy and concession to the poor and needy:

It is to condemn it as squandering away tax-payers's money by ruling dispensations to pander to vote banks and as a subterfuge to come to, and remain in, power.

It is interesting to recall that when K Kamaraj as chief minister of (the then) Madras state introduced the mid-day meal scheme in schools, the same outcry ensued, but Kamaraj braved it and went ahead.

By now, it has earned high tribute from exalted international agencies like the World Bank for its contribution to improvement of vital parameters such as health and nutrition and reduction in child and maternal mortality, besides, of course, helping the spread of education among the poor by better attendance in schools.

Currently, the waiving of farm loans by the three newly elected governments of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, and Congress President Rahul Gandhi's insistent call to the National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre to adopt a similar course are agitating the voluble commentariat.

Many articles have appeared pontificating on the grievous damage such a nation-wide waiver would inflict on the economy.

R Jagannathan, for instance, who has a fan club of his own investing him with the authority and credentials to take the cudgels on such topics, in his mouthpiece, Swarajya , bluntly calls the pressure mounted by Rahul Gandhi 'an economic sabotage of growth' and Rahul himself 'an economic saboteur'.

Critics and sceptics of his ilk miss the fine print that appears year after year in the country's Budgets under the title 'Revenue foregone'.

As per information furnished to Parliament in reply to a question on December 20, 2018, a total of Rs 17,15,461 crore revenue has been foregone by the government due to tax incentives (direct and indirect taxes) in the last three financial years.

That amount represents the revenue readily given up by governments in favour of business and industry in the form of a variety of tax incentives and concessions, quite apart from non-performing assets (Rs 4 lakh crore) of banks (of which between 2012 and 2015, Rs 1.14 lakh crore has been written off) and what the business and industry tycoons default in the form of loans.

As against this, a cumulative farm loan waiver encompassing all the states comes to Rs 3.1 lakh crore.

But Jagannathan makes out a case against farm loan waivers by giving his version of the difference between corporate loans and revenue foregone on the one hand and farm loans on the other, to rub in the distinction between corporate and farm loans, and argue for a hard stand in regard to the latter.

Says Jagannathan: '...corporate bad loans are not written off across the board; only loans involving specific defaulters get written off when a business fails.'

'Farm waivers, on the other hand, are nearly universal.'

'Secondly, after the legislation of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, when bankers take haircuts, the businessperson who defaults loses his entire business assets. When farm loans are written off, no farmer loses his asset.'

In saying so, he seems to take no account of the realties on the ground of rural agricultural India and the daily struggle farmers have to wage to make both ends meet because of the rising burden of fixed and variable costs and the palpable erosion in agricultural income.

There are also extensive studies carried out by dispassionate academic scholars on how electricity, seed, irrigation and fertilizer subsidies have actually boosted agricultural production and income.

One such study Electricity Subsidy in Punjab Agriculture: Extent and Impact by Dr Karam Singh, published in the October-December 2012 issue of the Indian Journal of Agricultural Economics, typically has this to say:

'The decline in the gross margin (profit over operational costs), without electricity subsidy, from rice, would have been about 20 per cent to the all Punjab farmers and 25 per cent to the tubewell farmers in 2010-11. The decline in the profitability of wheat would be much lower at about 5 to 6 per cent.'

'In other words, the electricity subsidy increases the profitability of rice by as much as 25 per cent, because of its significantly larger requirement for irrigation than for wheat (and/or other crops).'

'It is also...... important that any containment of the electricity subsidy to the farm sector should accompany the matching visible improvements in the infrastructures and institutions that would cut down the farmers' fixed costs, reduce the market risks and improve the relative guarantee of profitability of their production efforts and alternatives, and thereby strengthen the base of growth of the farmers' incomes.'

The urban-cum-corporate biased analysts must remember that there is plenty to be gained by farm loan waivers in terms of food, nutrition and livelihood security and rural prosperity, considering the fact that as of 2014, the share of agriculture to GDP was 17.9 per cent, and India is the world's second largest producer of agricultural products.

India's rank is 12th in industry and 11th in services, their respective contribution to India's GDP is 24.2 per cent and 57.9 per cent.

Thus, in my view, farm loan waivers should not be regarded as expenditure but as incentive and investment.

Finally, a word generally about freebies:

I have personally witnessed during my visits to various places how TV sets have been great help in broadening the mental horizons of the poor people and in a sense, have served as agents of political awareness and social change on a conspicuous scale with low investment.

Similar are the benefits derived from laptops.

Well-to-do urban dwellers with most comforts found for them cannot imagine the self-esteem generated in people at or below the poverty line by ownership of such simple things as grinders and bicycles.

In such matters, our politicians, with their ears to the ground, have much greater empathy, sensitivity and imagination than the elitist, English-educated, Western-oriented intellectuals (so-called).

This Bengaluru based NGO has come out to help India achieve its aim by 2020 by feeding at least 50 lakh children across the country every day.

Only such giant leaps can make a difference, feels the management of The Akshay Patra Foundation which runs what it claims is the world's largest school lunch programme to end child hunger and to support education.

For this foundation, feeding 50 lakh school students is not a distant pipe-dream but an attainable challenge as it already feeds 19 lakh (1.9 million) students every school day.

In its over 40 kitchens across 12 states in India -- with most centralised kitchens having the capacity to cook up to 100,000 meals -- around 7,000 people from different castes and creed work together to serve hot cooked meals to students, says Ratnagada Govind Das, President of the Rajasthan unit of The Akshaya Patra Foundation.

Home to over 46 million malnourished children as per the Global Nutrition Report 2018, India ranks 103 among 119 countries in the Global Hunger Index.

The Global Hunger Index 2018 report says that at least one in five Indian children under the age of five is wasted (having extremely low weight for their height), reflecting acute under-nutrition. The only country with a higher prevalence of child wasting is the war-torn nation of South Sudan.

Das says the foundation hires people from all castes and religions to work under one roof with a single aim so as to ensure that no child in India is deprived of education because of hunger.

Mukesh Mali, who has been working in one of the Akshay Patra kitchens in Rajasthan for the last five years, says, ""We ensure that cleanliness and hygiene standards are followed in our kitchen. I and my other co-workers love cooking as it brings in a sense of satisfaction that we satiate the hunger of so many kids. The food from this Jaipur kitchen goes to distant places.""

Just as hunger doesn't discriminate, one can also find true diversity not only in The Akshaya Patra Foundation's (TAPF) kitchens where people from different castes and religions cook prasadam (a devotional food offering made to a god that is later shared among devotees) together, but also in students who come from different castes and religions and receive that prasadam in the form of mid-day meals.

Sharing the reason why this food is called prasadam, Das says that after being cooked, it is first served to the Lord and then it reaches schools.

B.D. Kumawat, administration head in Ajmera's Tikamchand School where students' mid-day meal comes from TAPF, says most students in the school come from the Katchhi Basti (an underprivileged neighbourhood) nearby.

""They come from poor backgrounds and hence this food being served here is like a blessing to them. The quality and the taste is good. Hence they love coming to schools. In fact, the school attendance has gone up after the distribution of this meal,"" he says.

Started in the year 2000 in Bengaluru, TAPF's mid-day meal scheme is the largest programme to serve meals in schools in India. In Rajasthan alone, it feeds over two lakh children from its 11 kitchens.

""The organisation is looking forward to the goal of feeding 50 lakh children each day by 2020,"" Das says.

He adds that the biggest challenge in cooking for millions is maintaining the quality and delivering the food without it going bad.

If any lapse is detected, it becomes a big challenge to immediately stop the same lot of food from getting distributed and evaluating the reason for the problem and making sure it doesn't happen again.

Das says the parents of the beneficiary students are also very happy with the programme.

""As we are mainly working on feeding underprivileged kids, their parents feel relieved that at least this one nutritious meal is being served to their children for which they don't have to worry,"" he says.

Divya Jain, regional quality head at Akshay Patra, says the foundation ensures that the food suffices the dietary requirements of the students.

""We follow the ISO 22000 standard that is the highest standard in food safety and hygiene. The food we cook here is precisely made and the menu is well-designed too. It is least hand-handled and comes with nice nutritional value. Kids love this meal as the taste is good,"" he says.

""We serve a three-course menu, including chapati, pulses, vegetables, rice and soups,"" he adds.

Das says it also makes parents push their children to attend school regularly and to study. ""As per a survey, it has been seen that the attendance in these government schools where they get mid-day meals has increased tremendously,"" Das adds.

""Hunger, malnutrition, ill-health and gender inequality are constraints to attaining an education. Through this mid-day meal programme, we have tried to tackle these problems. Further, these meals provide a sociable environment where children from different backgrounds interact and break barriers of the caste system,"" he says."

A glut in the market for pulses is a classic case of central planning gone wrong. The goal of achieving higher production by raising the Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for pulses did increase production and brought consumer prices down. But conversely, a predictable glut followed, farm income fell and fuelled rural distress.

In 2015, the Narendra Modi government responded to high consumer price inflation to the order of nearly 30 to 40 per cent in urad, arhar and moong by announcing a number of measures. These included checking hoarding, importing pulses and increasing the MSP.

When the government increased the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of pulses in 2015 and in 2016 with a big bonus of Rs 425, it was focused on encouraging higher domestic production. Production did go up in response to the higher MSP, but mandi prices crashed.

To ensure higher prices for farmers, government started procuring pulses. In earlier years, the focus of food procurement was only on wheat and rice to ensure self-sufficiency, a policy relic from the 1960s. Now, the focus has been on pulses to ensure higher farm incomes.

Record amounts of pulses were purchased by the central government last year. This year too, the government has already spent Rs 15,000 crore on procurement. Procurement by government resulted in large stocks of pulses. Government then tried selling off these pulses to the paramilitary forces, the Army and the open market.

Unable to dispose of the large stocks, the government is now trying to give discounts to states to deal with the situation. Each kilogram of pulses can be obtained by the states at a discounted rate for schemes such as the mid-day meal or to sell to retail consumers. It is important to get rid of these stocks to clear warehouse space for the upcoming rabi crop.

MSP as an instrument began to be used in the 1960s. The Agricultural Prices Commission was set up in 1965. In order to protect farmer incomes, it recommended that the government announce Minimum Support Prices. These prices protect the farmer's income in case of a glut. If the government procures at the MSP, either private traders buy at a price above this price or farmers can sell to the government at this minimum price.

A higher Minimum Support Price encourages the farmer to produce a particular crop as opposed to another whose price is not supported. A stable income, even if lower, is usually preferred. The problem arises if too many farmers get encouraged by the MSP and start producing a particular crop. There may be a glut and if the government does not have the organisation and the storage capacity to buy the additional crop, then prices could start falling. Schemes such as the Bhavantar Bhugtan allow the government to pay the farmer the difference in case private traders buy at a lower price.

The MSP has to be constantly revised because MSP depends on the cost of production and that regularly changes. But all Minimum Support Prices do not increase by the same magnitude. One difficulty in setting the MSP is that the government can only guess how much additional crop would be produced when it raises the price. It doesn't always get it right. In fact, it usually gets it wrong.

In USSR and Eastern Europe, central planners had believed that all you had to do was to get the price signal right, and you could emulate the market. Their economies collapsed because they were producing things people did not want, and not producing those that they did want. The role of prices is to signal demand and supply, and without the prices that reflect demand producers were not able to get the right signals.

Household consumption baskets change in response to changing incomes. For example, when people get richer, they buy less of wheat and rice and more of food items that make their meals tastier and more nutritious. In India, the demand for vegetables, meat, milk, fish and fruit has been rising with the rise in household incomes. In recent years, household consumption data shows that Indian households now consume higher protein products and fresh vegetables and fruit - although it is still among the lowest in the world.

When the government tries to set the price for a number of goods, it is setting all these relative prices in the process. It needs to know the exact mix of dal and rice that households would like to buy. And this is not a one-time exercise. As a household's income increases, it may prefer to eat more dal with the same amount of rice. And when it increases even further, it may move to eating less dal by eating vegetables or fish or poultry. Trying to get prices right at every point of time to match demand and supply is a nearly impossible task.

As a consequence, while addressing the issue of farmer income, we could end up giving wrong price signals. A market economy, with millions of producers, may do better with the individual hand that equates demand with supply than a government that sets targets. Income support to farmers is another way to prevent market distortions while supporting farmer incomes. The Rythu Bandhu in Telangana gives Rs 4,000 per acre to farmers for investment. Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik has just announced a new scheme 'Kalia' that gives financial assistance for five cropping seasons from 2018-19 to 2020-21 to small farmers and Rs 12,500 for goat rearing, mushroom cultivation or bee-keeping to one million landless agriculture households. It is time to explore alternatives to setting MSPs.

""The mid-day meal should be substituted with the wholesome meal, which the children would consume with happiness and would help them in the good health, which is the main object under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS),"" HC has held.

The authorities have been asked to pass appropriate instructions in this regard and informed the court by January 31, 2019.

Justice Ritu Bahri of the HC has passed these orders while hearing a case after court was informed that the mid-day meal provided under mid-day meal is not good.

""The states of Punjab, Haryana and UT Chandigarh will apply their mind to set up institutes, where they can examine manufacturing of food by using government funds and funds under the CSR/donations as per guidelines given by some good dietitians for good health of the children/mothers. The children and lactating mothers can be given meal, bread, butter, jam, eggs daily as wholesome meal,"" Justice Bahri has observed in her recently released orders.

The judge has passed these order after senior advocate Reeta Kohli who is assisting the HC as Amicus Curiae on the issue, informed the court that the Mid-day Meal, which is presently given, is not appreciated by the children. Kohli had given this information after visiting to villages Seonk in Mohali and Bharaili in Panchkula district of Haryana.

Senior advocate Kohli also placed on record an affidavit giving details of various notifications issued by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) on July 10, 2017 whereby consistent guidelines have been issued to give fortified nutritious diet to children under the public funded programmes---Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), Mid-Day Meal Scheme (MDM) and Public Distribution System (PDS) in order to fulfill the object of National Food Security Act 2013.

On the other hand, Anil Kumble's and Javagal Srinath's 199 Tests have yielded 855 wickets.

The contribution of this 90s Class is unparalleled. While they created magic on the field during their playing days, they touched hearts as they relived memories during the Bengaluru launch of VVS Laxman's autobiography '281 And Beyond' co-authored by R Kaushik.

It was a typical Bengaluru December evening, the air was chilly, but the mood was warm. Laxman along with Kumble, Srinath and Dravid showcased rare spirit and camaraderie, rekindling an old fire. Teammates reunited.

Excerpts:

When the boys from South first met..

VVS Laxman: I remember Rahul (Dravid) it was a U-19 match between Hyderabad and Karnataka in Bengaluru. Rahul was wearing a shirt while batting. Later, I came to know it was gifted by Roger Binny, and had the BCCI logo. As usual, Rahul scored a hundred. I cannot forget the body language he showed - the concentration, focus, ability to play long innings. That never changed till the last day he played the game.

Rahul Dravid: I remember that shirt Laxman is talking of, Roger had given it to me. It was a shirt they got when they were touring England. It was really thick, meant for the winter in England. But because it was given to me by Roger Binny, I would still wear that shirt to bat in 30 degrees centigrade. And Laxman is just being kind to say I got a lot of runs against them. The amount of fielding I've done when Laxman has batted! I mean I got a hundred, but he made triple-hundreds against us, and double-hundreds against us.

Laxman's meeting with Srinath

VVS: Before I made my debut in Ahmedabad, as was the norm, they asked me to give a speech. I was very emotional, and when I started talking I was courteous, thanking each one, saying it was an honour and privilege to be playing with some of the role models I've grown up being inspired by. There was Tendulkar, Azharuddin, Anil, Srinath.. suddenly one voice in the room calls out: 'Don't you respect the seniors? I want you to stand on the chair and give your speech. Show some respect man.' And that was from Javagal Srinath. He will deny having said that. Even till date, he continues to rag me! I'm still being ragged by my seniors.

Javagal Srinath: I don't know.. My first interaction with Laxman was in 1996 on the tour of England. Laxman has a story to tell, which is not true. If it is in his book I'm going to sue him! He has some grouse against Venky (Venkatesh Prasad) and me for a long time.

VVS: As a youngster who wanted to play for India, I went to meet the touring Indian team while I was playing in the Bradford League. I go to their team hotel in Nottingham and meet Anil, Rahul, Venkatapathy Raju... then I wanted to meet Venkatesh Prasad and Javagal Srinath. Both fast bowlers, must have been exhausted after a tiring day. I knocked on the room and there was no answer.

Srinath: We were not in the room..

VVS: That's what they say but I'm not convinced.

Anil Kumble as batting partner on debut

VVS: That was the first and not to be the last time I played with him. The only thing he would say is, 'Tu khel na mama, main hoon tere saath' (You bat, I'm there with you). That's the confidence Anil had in himself and the confidence he used to give to any player he came across. We had an important partnership and gave the bowlers something to defend.

Anil Kumble: What he doesn't say is that whenever I batted with him, I was the dominant partner, although he was the senior batsman. I had to tell him how to bat. I remember in South Africa in 1996, we were playing Orange Free State in a side game, and I was the captain. It was the last ten mandatory overs and we had lost six wickets when I went in to bat. Laxman was in the 40s, and the first message I gave him was, 'We can't lose this game. We are India. And if you get out trying to score a fifty, you've had it.' And he took it so seriously that a couple of full tosses by Nicky Boje, he just tapped it straight back at him. He was not out on 47 or 48, and I remember him walking into the dressing room and one of the senior players made a comment, 'Arre, fifty to karna tha' (You should have made a fifty at least). I screamed at the top of my voice, 'It was my decision that he cannot get his fifty, and he has to stay there and we can't lose another wicket' That's how dominant I was, the big brother for Laxman.

Fielding for Kumble...

VVS: While fielding in close-in area for Anil, we always said anything that comes your way, please take it. Otherwise, you would get hell from Anil. It was like he had a split personality.

Kumble: Split or sweet Personality?

VVS: tujhe jo bolna hai tu bole. Off the field, Anil was a totally different person. So gentle and nice. I still remember my third Test match, which was my first one overseas. Rahul was at short-leg and me at silly point with Anil bowling. Gary Kirsten and Andrew Hudson were at the crease and we needed a wicket.

Kirsten was beaten and our wicketkeeper Nayan Mongia passed the ball to me and I threw it back to Anil and it went over his head. His response: 'kahan kaha se lekar aati hai yaar! Ball phekna bhi nahi aata aur international khel raha hai.'(Where do you get these people from. Doesn't know to throw the ball and he's playing international cricket).

Srinath: I know it is Laxman's book but we need to speak about Anil. When Anil is bowling (according to him) every ball is catchable or stoppable. I was fortunate because I was too good to be standing at forward short leg or slip. I was usually at either mid-on or mid-off. Rahul would be positioned at first slip. I remember an incident from South Africa. Rahul was at first slip. It is a right-hand left-hand combination. the right-hand batsman has taken a single and the striker has changed. Rahul is in his own world and still standing in the leg slip.

Anil goes back to his mark and see Rahul and says, 'Jam! Ellaiah iddiya ninu baraiah e kade' (where are you standing Jam, come this side).

This was a good opportunity for Venky and me to have a go at Rahul. At the end of the over we would go and say baisko??a, baisko??a, baisko??a, (he has got yelled at) and rub it in. If I misfielded something, more than Anil shouting at us, I would dread Venky or Rahul coming up to me and saying Baiskondiya Baisko...Baisko. (you deserve the scolding)

VVS: When Sri misfielded off Anil, he wouldn't look at Anil. He would look at the crowd instead.

Srinath: But I think, in my era there were a few catches dropped. People do drop catches. I had tremendous confidence in Laxman and Rahul. He was exemplary. Even if he dropped catches, I never said a word to him. Rahul, was the best forward short-leg fielder. he didn't like it. He thought he was senior, but he was junior to me for a long time and I always wanted him at forward short-leg when I was bowling.

Laxman sharing the room with Kumble during the perfect 10

Srinath: That room must've have been silent. There probably was only a 1 MB worth of data spoken each day.

VVS: Anil was a fantastic roomie. I don't know about you (Srinath), but he was normal with me.

Kumble: Can anybody be allowed to speak when Sri is around? No chance.

Being a part of the perfect 10

VVS: It was the fourth day and at lunch we were a little concerned because we had lost a Test and it was important to break that partnership. Like everyone knows, Anil created history after lunch. Rahul was a senior by then, so was at slips and I was at forward short-leg. Nine wickets down, Wasim Akram batting and Anil Kumble batting. I told myself, 'Laxman you can't afford to drop that catch.' I'm disappointed no one talks about how good or sharp that catch was.

Anil: I keep talking about it Laxman.

VVS: There was something funny that happened before the perfect 10. Sadagoppan Ramesh too knew he had to go and take the catch because it was off Anil's bowling. Just that, he forgot it wasn't Anil but Sri bowling. Srinath was shouting don't catch, don't catch!

On catching vegetarian 'fans' abroad

Kumble: West Indies would be a challenge. Two bowlers would be on the boundary, one would be Srinath. He would have figured out where we are going for dinner that day, to someone's house. He would speak to one of the Indian friends who were sitting near the boundary line, and make sure we were their guests - uninvited. That was the only option.

Generally, when you invite the Indian team over for any meal, there is reluctance. It's very difficult to get the team as a whole, coming to anyone's house. But in the West Indies, two minibuses would be parked outsise the team hotel. Without invitation, both buses were filled up by 7 o'clock. And there were clear instructions given to the host: 'You can't talk to the cricketers, you can't disturb them.' So we would go there, and after we had eaten, there would be some two minutes the hosts could have a conversation and then we would leave. It used to be a sort of potluck, with a lot of Indian families bringing one dish to the host's place. The best food was in the homes of Indian families.""

Srinath: We have shamelessly invited ourselves into so many people's houses. And now when I go back to West Indies as match referee, there are times when people walk up to me and say, 'You came to our house thrice'. But we are thankful to our expatriates for their love of the game. At any stage, we didn't feel short of food. In fact, I think we over-ate and added weight.

On Laxman's routines

Dravid: The thing with Laxman was he had so many routines. Tap the gloves, then he'll go to his crease and mark seven times on one side, six times on the other. Then he'll come and stand. He was in such a rush to get back to do all his lines, that there was no time to have a conversation! I'm waiting there to talk to Laxman and he's busy marking lines. He'd tap the glove exactly in one fashion and just to pull his leg, I would sometimes walk away and he'd be, 'Come here'. Then he'd tap.

On the 281 at the Eden Gardens in 2001

Dravid: You know I sometimes tell people, and I really mean this: I really had the best seat in the house for the greatest Indian innings ever played... it was phenomenal to watch. Some of the shots he played were incredible. You can almost still visualise him stepping outside the leg stump and hitting [Shane] Warne through the covers, for a ball that's pitched yards outside leg stump. Or being able to flick a ball on middle and off on a turning track to a great bowler (Warne), and hitting him through square leg. Or driving Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie. It was an incredible experience watching him bat. By the time I went to bat, he was already 90-odd, and I think we ran a single to short fine leg and he got a hundred. I wasn't playing particularly well in that series to start off with, but just watching him play gave me a lot of confidence. It was a magical day.

Laxman: We didn't have too much conversation in between. All we did was punch gloves and say, 'One more over'. We broke it down into small goals. But not once did we feel complacent. I got my hundred, then he got his hundred, he got his 150, I got my double-hundred - but not once were we content that 'Yes, we have achieved a personal aspiration'. I remember just before the Kolkata Test, both of us had a partnership against West Zone in Surat. Again I got a double-hundred, Rahul got a hundred and we had a big partnership. (While) batting with Rahul the talk was always minimal, but there was some kind of serenity around whenever you were batting with Rahul.""

Kumble: I did not participate in that series because I had a shoulder surgery. I was in South Africa for my rehab, and I was watching the game while I was at my physiotherapist's. Evan Speechly, who became the Indian physio and is now the RCB physio, was there. We had just got all out and Laxman had come out to bat again, this time at No. 3. And I was leaving for India that night, and Evan said, 'Hey, what's happening, how can India lose to Australia?' So I said, 'No, no, we are winning this Test match' and I walked out. I sat on the flight when Rahul and Laxman were on the crease, and when I landed in Mumbai at 2 or 3 am, the whole day's play had gone. The first thing I asked at immigration was, 'What's the score?' They said, '500-plus for 4'. So I didn't get the opportunity to watch them live at all, and I was hoping it would happen again. And it happened very quickly, in Adelaide (in 2003). The one thing that kept coming back to my mind was, 'I hope this is a partnership like Kolkata because I want to watch this', and they put on 300-plus again."

Or me. Most urbanites (I grew up in Bengaluru) have had some experience of Bharat-the other 69 per cent of Indians who live in the hinterland. I have vivid memories of visiting my maternal grandfather in Bhagamandala, in the foothills of Talacauvery in Kodagu where the mighty Cauvery bubbles forth as a tiny spring.

From 1965 onwards, I regularly went to Cherangala, his village, to stay with him while he was alive and to pay res­pects at his grave after he died. We had to go by foot to his house from the bus stop in Bhagamandala. It was a five kilometre walk through lush paddy fields bisected by the gurgling Cauvery, which was more of a stream than a river. The house did not have electricity and we lit kerosene lamps at night. Food was cooked using firewood-the akki (rice) rotis baked on them were delicious. We plucked cashew fruit from the garden, roasted the seeds on burning wood and ate the kernel piping hot. We bathed in a pond surrounded by a thatched enclosure. There were no toilets, we took refuge in the nearby bushes, always watching our backs for snakes and other wildlife. It was only in the early 2000s that change became visible in the village. We did not have to walk to the house any more, we could use the motorable road that passed right by it. Electricity poles had come up and, when the lights failed, the hum of gensets echoed across the hills. Houses with thatched roofs were replaced by ones using cement, concrete and tiles. When I last visited two years back, my relatives cooked food using LPG cylinders. The houses had attached toilets and bathrooms with water coming from the taps. Everyone had smartphones and stayed in touch on WhatsApp. They kept abreast of cashew, coffee and cardamom prices in India and the world on the internet. The issues they faced, though, were no different from what my grandfather complained about when he was alive. The price at which they sold the surplus paddy they grew remains unremunerative. Rates for coffee, the main plantation crop, continue to fluctuate widely even as finding labour to tend the plants has got costlier. Loss of tree cover and climate change are making agriculture a risky venture, forcing some members of the family to find work in town and supplement the family income.

TRADITION VERSUS MODERNITY: A farmer couple cultivates land near Udaipur in Rajasthan. (Photographs by Purushottam Diwakar)

Welcome to the New Bharat which, like Kodagu, has experienced transformational change along with extreme contradictions since india today magazine came into existence 43 years ago. Even as it prospered, the countryside experienced equal distress, particularly on the farm front. The paradoxes are evident. In these four decades, the Central and state governments have combined their resources to build a record 30 lakh kilometres of black top roads that now connect the 640,867 villages to the nearest town. By last year, virtually 100 per cent of India's villages had been electrified, and almost 83 per cent of rural households now have electric bulbs lighting up their nights. Under a scheme to provide housing for the needy in villages, 1 crore houses have been built in the past four years, a six-fold annual increase from before. The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has seen over 9 crore toilets being built since 2014 and 5.3 lakh villages have been declared open defecation free. With 5.8 crore new LPG connections given since 2016, cooking gas is fast replacing kerosene stoves and coal- or wood-fired chulhas in kitchens, covering almost 50 per cent of rural households. Mobile phone coverage and usage have reached the poorest of the poor. Joining the white revolution that saw India become the world's largest producer of milk are the silver (poultry) and blue (fisheries) revolutions. And the number of those living below the poverty line (BPL) in rural India has dropped dramatically, from 50 per cent in 1993-94 to 25.7 per cent today.

TRADITION VERSUS MODERNITY: Farmers in Rajawas village in Jaipur district. (Photographs by Purushottam Diwakar)

Yet, even if the transformation has been nothing short of revolutionary in many areas, on key welfare indicators such as health and education and on the economic front, the situation remains grim. While infant mortality levels have dropped significantly since Independence, they are still at a higher level than in neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh. Almost 35 per cent, or one out of three, children in villages still suffer from malnutrition. In education, while enrolment in primary and secondary levels is near universal, dropout rates for high school are extremely high and only 11.6 per cent pursue an undergraduate course. Even for those enrolled in schools, several studies have exposed how poor the standards of learning are. In agriculture, production levels have reached record levels in foodgrains and pulses, making India self-sufficient in food. But this has triggered a problem of plenty that has seen farmers across the country rise up in strong protest against the low returns. Farmer distress is compounded by the huge slowdown in manufacturing and industry in the country. That has resulted in not enough jobs being generated to absorb the underemployed from agriculture. Agricultural workers now constitute 54 per cent of India's total work force, but their productivity is only half that of their urban counterparts.

So, to paraphrase Charles Dickens, it is the best of times for village India and also the worst of times. Why do we still call it Naya Bharat when much of it could still be described as the old India with all its familiar woes? The big difference is that no more are those living in village India willing to resign themselves to their fate. Or depend on doles from the government to lift them out of the abyss. That change is visible, particularly among rural women, who are looking to go beyond being homemakers or work as subsistence farm labourers. In what is possibly the world's largest self-employed movement, over 10 crore women have formed 717,689 self-help groups (SHGs) and now collectively engage in a wide spectrum of economic activity that gives them income and, more importantly, an identity of their own. They organise themselves in clusters to leverage small loans from banks to fund the jobs they are engaged in, whether in livestock management or in tailoring. They have a strong record of repaying loans. And they are bringing about a silent but profound revolution.

All across the country, as India Today correspondents found, there are inspiring examples of how villagers have worked against debilitating odds to bring about change, not only in their lives but for others as well. Ruma Devi, who features on our front cover, got married at the age of 17 with few skills other than stitching and embroidery. To supplement her income, she formed a self-help group to make handicrafts. When its members found that rather than rely on middlemen, they could directly buy their raw material and sell their finished products, they took a bank loan and expanded their business. Ruma Devi then joined an NGO called Gramin Vikas Evam Chetna Sansthan that trained artisans and rose to become its president. It now operates in 75 villages and has trained over 11,000 artisans. Ruma Devi inspired her team members to diversify into making tops, skirts, dupattas and salwar suits using traditional motifs. Their work caught the attention of top designers who have started purchasing the clothes they make. At 30 years of age, Ruma Devi is an outstanding example of the success of empowered women. In the following pages, we feature many more such heart-warming stories.

The recent rising tide of farmers' protests is also an expression of rural self-assertion and awareness. Farmers are now demanding more than band-aid solutions like loan waivers that make them look like villains and benefit only those who can game the system. Their demand is for an INCOME REVOLUTION, not a green, blue or white one. They are not taken in by the promises from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to double farm incomes. They insist on speedy delivery and fundamental reform. They also want ""ease of doing agriculture"" rather than just seeing all the government's concessions go to industry. This tragedy could have been averted if agricultural practices had also seen a paradigm shift with the economic reform process that began in 1991. It didn't happen. Policy-makers continued with the single-minded focus on production and self-sufficiency. They were averse to taking major risks for fear of offending India's largest vote bank. In contrast, China ushered in major reform so that only 18 per cent of its population now is dependent on agriculture as compared to India's 43 per cent.

Among India's follies was the failure to amend the various land acts. As a result, the fragmentation of land holdings has reached critical levels, with a majority of farmers working less than one hectare of land. With no enabling legislation being passed towards easing the land crisis, contract farming, innovative technologies and economies of scale have not taken hold. What was also neglected was agricultural logistics, post-production processing and marketing of products. For instance, the shortfall in cold-chain infrastructure for storage and transport of high-value crops such as fruits and vegetables is anything between 85 and 95 per cent. There were other mistakes. There is a clear need to link agriculture to domestic and industrial consumption and diversify crops based on need. But the mindless focus on foodgrains saw close to 50 million tonnes being stored under the Public Distribution System-more than twice the ann­ual food entitlement of all the BPL families in the country. To cite another example, we need only 25 million tonnes of sugarcane for domestic consumption, but we produce 30-36 million tonnes. Yet, till July this year, government policy restricted its diversion to non-food uses like ethanol production. No matter which party comes to power in 2019, one must hope its manifesto will include undertaking major agrarian reforms to end the farmers' agony.

In the other key areas impacting rural progress, both the Central and state governments have thankfully learnt from past errors. Providing rural housing for the needy is one such. Housing programmes have been around since 1985, but their implementation has been tardy, and corruption rampant. When the NDA government under Narendra Modi came to power, it rev­am­ped the programme and ren­amed it the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana. The size of the houses to be built was increased from 20 square metres to 25 square metres and the grant increased from Rs 70,000 to Rs 1.2 lakh. But what was critical was how corruption was curbed using digital and communications technology. At the time of the payment of the first instalment, the recipient has to upload his photograph along with pictures of the plot of land his house is to come up on. Then, the person has to send photographs of each major stage of construction stipulated to get the next instalment. The subsidy money is transferred directly to the recipient's bank account, ensuring it is not diverted. This has cut down corruption by local officials from 50 per cent to around 12 per cent. It has also seen a record number of houses being built in the past four years. One fallout: with no slush money coming to them, many of the panchayat-level officials are not pushing the programme too enthusiastically.

A DIFFERENT TREATMENT: Patients crowd a makeshift clinic in Patna in Bihar. (Photo: Purushottam Diwakar)

Another welcome development has been the move to integrate the various services under diff­erent schemes. So, under the housing scheme, a person can also avail of the subsidy for toilets under Swachh Bharat, get a cooking gas connection under the PM Ujjwala Yojana and an electricity connection under the rural electrification programme. With all money transfers going to bank accounts, the opportunities for corrupt officials to withhold or divert payments has been dramatically reduced. It remains critical to ensure that, having provided these amenities, the quality of service is not compromised. It is not enough to bring electricity poles to a village, there must also be quality supply of power. In subsidised LPG, cooking refills have to be made easily available and not given as a premium.

In the PM Gram Sadak Yojana, an important innovation is that, apart from building the roads, there is a built-in five-year maintenance contract the constructor has to abide by. He has no choice then but to ensure that good quality material is used for making the road. Some of the other government schemes have provided amazing results in the past too. When M.G. Ramachandran was chief minister of Tamil Nadu in 1982, he introduced the mid-day meal scheme. I had written an article about it for the magazine at the time, dismissing it as a populist scheme. But its impact turned out to be revolutionary. Infant mortality rates in the state began to drop significantly a few years after the scheme was introduced. Then the government cleverly extended it to pregnant mothers who came to drop their children to school. They were not only given a meal package but also medicines to ensure a safe pregnancy. It was followed up with post-natal care and benefits. That saw maternal mortality rates drop perceptibly in the state. And to the astonishment of social planners, Tamil Nadu's total fertility rates began to fall significantly within a decade, reaching levels only achieved by Kerala.

Maternal care has been another success story. When I visited Rajasthan in the 1980s for a health story, only two out of 10 babies born were institutional deliveries. The other eight were delivered at home with the help of the rudimentary equipment used by traditional midwives or dais. Today, eight out of 10 babies in Rajasthan are born under institutional care.

Yet, while these are laudable success stories, it is not enough for governments to be content with providing the basics alone. In the mid-1980s, the then prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi, launched the rural water mission. The government improved the quality of the hand-pumps being installed and had them mass produced. It then made provisions for speedy boring of wells and installation of pumps. There were still issues as to how many wells had to be sunk in each village, including separate ones for Dalits and Muslims. But it transformed water availability in rural areas where women had to walk long distances to fetch water. I travelled across several states during the great drought of 1987 and found that the hand pumps provided major relief and enabled the Rajiv government to successfully tackle the crisis. While villagers then were willing to gather around hand-pumps to collect water, now they are all clamouring for piped water supply to their homes, having seen their urban counterparts enjoy such facilities. Yet, this is not going to be easy to deliver both in terms of costs and availability. The situation calls for innovative solutions and people's involvement and cooperation to accept and implement them.

There were good reasons why my parents left their respective villages in Kodagu to work for a living in professions other than agriculture. Reasons that continue to send droves of migrants from villages in search of jobs to urban India. For the new Bharat to prosper, there will have to be major reforms in every aspect of the lives of the 83.3 crore who live in it. That remains India's biggest challenge."

Earlier on Wednesday, the state food commission had met with representatives of Akshaya Patra in Bengaluru. Krishnamurthy, the Chairman of the Food Commission said ""Akshaya Patra representatives said that they would find nutritional replacements for onion and garlic.

It was in 2010 that Delhi's Shri Ram School Maths and Computer Science teacher Sujata Sahu first went on a trip to Ladakh. It was a solo trek, and on the third day, she began to face extreme difficulty breathing and walking. The low oxygen in the altitudes as high as 16,100 feet had given her Pulmonary Edema.

She needed to rest, and with the help of two passing trekkers, she decided to spend the night at a remote village --

""A village which has no road access, is reachable only after a day's walk, and one which boasted of just one home with three occupants. I had neither medicines, nor the ability to call my family, nor access to medical care,"" says 50-year-old Sahu, a resident of Gurugram.

In was in these conditions that she saw two tiny schools which totally changed her life.

The first primary school -- Sku-Kaya -- had five students and two teachers. It had two rooms which were being rebuilt. While one teacher had stayed in the village, the other had gone to Leh to get uniforms and mid-day meal supplies for the school.

The second school had eight children and three teachers. It was two of them who had stopped to help Sahu when she was feeling sick. They had been walking back to Leh for textbooks and uniforms

The children were being taught from English books, which was very alien to them as they had no electricity or TV or telephone connectivity and thus, had no idea what the outside world was like. Having never set foot out of their villages, the exposure level of these children was very low.

.In Ladakh, even the summer months were bitingly cold but that didn't stop the kids from coming to school to learn. ""One of the children even brought his little brother along, who was barely two years old and the love and care with which all the children and the teacher took care of the child was a lesson for me,"" says Sahu.

What really hit her on that fateful Ladakh trip was the sheer drive of the Ladakhi people there to keep growing and improving their circumstances.

""Their determination to come to school and learn, the eagerness of the teacher to learn something new to teach his students, and the aspiration of the parents to educate their children was my inspiration to drop everything and help these amazing people,"" says Sahu.

From a regular school teacher to Ladakh's 'Iron Lady'

""My experience with the schools in Ladakh gave me a path to follow, one that I knew I could contribute to,"" says Sujata Sahu, who had spent 12 years in the corporate world before starting to work with children.

But she had been working at the Shri Ram School for just two years at the time, and leaving this job was the hardest decision she had to make in her life.

""I was planning to take on a seemingly herculean task, in possibly one of the toughest terrains of the world. I had no idea about where I would get the funds from and was also not very clear on how much of an impact I alone could make,"" she says.

Moreover, no one had done something like this before her in Ladakh. But thankfully, she found with herself two strong founding partners -- her husband, Sandeep Sahu, who had been trekking in the region for almost 35 years, and Dawa Jora, a Ladakhi businessman, all of whom had the strong conviction that something like this was really needed for the region.

In 2011, unable to find other NGOs to partner with, the three founders went on a three-day trek to one of the most isolated villages in Lingshed (in Ladakh), carrying 1500 kg of education material on 25 horses, and crossing three mountains at extreme temperatures as low as minus 15 degrees.

The treacherous and steep pass they crossed at an altitude of almost 17000 ft inspired the name of the '17000 ft foundation'.

As she started off on her mission to provide Ladakh schools with the right resources to further the education of their students, she realised this wouldn't be very easy.

""One of our biggest challenges was convincing corporates that even remote areas with extremely scattered and small populations needed support,"" says Sahu.

For the first two years, the foundation worked only with the founders' own funds and kind contributions of friends and family members.

""Though no non-profit organisations were willing to take on Ladakh as a region, we were given support in the form of knowledge, pedagogy and even a large donation of books for our first 100 libraries,"" she says.

Sujata Sahu's undying passion to help the people of Ladakh earned her the nickname of the 'Iron Lady'.

How Ladakh poses a unique set of education problems

India is a geographical anomaly as it has every type of topographical setup, each of which comes with its own challenges. This makes it extremely difficult for the government to cater to every type of problem that can arise in this vast country owing to accessibility issues, extreme weather conditions etc.

Ladakh has almost a 1000 schools across Leh and Kargil, spread across 60,000 sq km of harsh mountains. Catering to a school going population of under 40,000 children, the average school strength of these schools is barely 25 students across the two districts, explains Sahu.

Teachers themselves come from remote villages and have to travel long distances for training, school supplies and even basic administrative functions, leading to long absences and shortage of staff, she adds.

Also, ""While teachers are given basic residential training during winters as well as in-service training, most of the trainings are not contextualized for the uniqueness of the Ladakhi education system,"" she says.

The extreme weather also adds to the problems with schools being shut for severe winters for three months in a year when the roads become inaccessible due to thick snow and temperatures as low as minus 35-40 degrees.

""Incredibly, despite the remoteness of the region, every little hamlet which has even 10 school going children has a tiny government school with teachers in attendance, thanks to the local administration. A little wonder then, that 89% of the schools in Ladakh are govt schools with the private schools present in just a handful of the larger villages,"" she says.

""What is commendable is that all these 900 plus schools are functional and have qualified teachers in attendance. What is even more remarkable is that every child in every village goes to school, managing to at least complete middle school,"" Sahu adds

However, it is only the larger villages which have middle schools and after passing class 5, children have to walk around two hours to get to school to continue their education. Public transport isn't available in such terrain and the army provides army vans for commuting.

.Despite the presence of these govt schools, the community here wants a better life and quality education for their children so they can get better jobs. This aspiration makes them send their very young children, often as young as three years old, to be enrolled in private schools, often extremely far away from their homes.

""Cut off from their villages and parents for months in a year, these children grow up in dormitories, hostels or with other families. Lacking the care and guidance they need in their growing up years, this leads to large-scale dropouts and a population of youth who are unable to go back to their villages,"" Sahu explains.

17000 ft works in these remote villages by improving existing govt schools so that parents would have faith in them and stop sending their children away so far that it disconnects them from their roots.

How voluntourism is helping 17000 ft foundation grow

Sujata Sahu started her non-profit organisation with just the founders and a few volunteers who were given the task to survey the entire length and breadth of Ladakh.

The team mapped around 600 schools after a seven-month-long study. Some of these schools had been bomb shelters during the Kargil war and the buildings had to be shifted multiple times.

The success of the volunteer programmes helped the foundation grow and each of these schools has been geo-mapped for travellers to find.

""We, very early on, piloted our volunteering programmes to involve outsiders in the work of our organization and to also understand if people could be encouraged to donate to such a cause. The enthusiasm and support shown by complete strangers told us that we were on the right track,"" says Sahu.

""Our volunteers, who are our brand ambassadors, then carried the story of our work into their workplaces and CSR then became our main source of funding. Voluntourism, as it is called today, still forms a good 25% of our annual budget and helps us maintain our backend costs,"" she adds.

Why playgrounds are so important in Ladakh schools

Though the govt schools all over Ladakh have proper buildings, they lack the proper facilities that make a school a happy, joyous and welcoming place for children. And in a remote location with rugged ground, a playground comes as a blessing.

""In these remote villages, where nothing is available, there are absolutely no options for children to play with. Though these schools have well-qualified teachers and very low pupil-teacher-ratio, parents often judge the performance of a school based just on the facilities they provide,"" says Sahu.

Thus, parents see the existence of a playground in govt schools as a very good incentive to not send away their kids to far-off private schools.

""Today, 17000 ft foundation has setup playgrounds in 140 schools with colourful swings, slides, see saws etc. many of which the team had to carry over horseback for days to reach our remotest schools,"" she says.

Solving the problem of no native language storybooks in Ladakh

A big aspect of Ladakh education that surprised Sujata Sahu was how the kids learned in English medium schools even though they have no exposure to the foreign language. Their native language was Bhoti.

""To add to this burden, children also have to study their local language as well an additional Hindi/Urdu from grade 1,"" says Sahu.

To enable the children to read better and get comfortable with the number of languages they have to deal with, 17000 ft set up libraries in 230 schools with simple and easy to read story books in English, Hindi and Urdu.

""However, sadly, there are absolutely no story books in Bhoti for children to read. Sensing this gap, we undertook a mission to translate storybooks from English to Bhoti.""

""In 2015, we launched our first phase where we translated 21 titles and published 21,000 storybooks for distribution into 300 schools,"" says Sahu.

This year again, the organisation not only translated another 20 titles, but also added illustrations and changed narratives to make them more relatable to the children of Ladakh.

What has 17000 ft foundation achieved so far?

In the span of just six years, Sujata Sahu's organisation has accomplished much.

""Today, 17000 ft works with 250 govt schools across Leh and Kargil and we are already seeing a reverse trend of children coming back from private schools back to the govt schools in their villages,"" says Sahu.

The organisation has set up libraries in 230 schools, playgrounds in 140 schools, and trained over 1500 teachers in various methodologies with a team which is in Ladakh every winter for training teachers.

17000 ft foundation has conducted multiple community workshops in 125 villages with over 10,000 villagers contributing to our workshops and programmes in the schools.

Recently, the organisation electrified and digitized 120 schools in Leh and Kargil, providing solar electricity and tablets with customized digital learning content, a TV, and a server to provide offline data syncing.

The DigiLab project is the non-profit's most ambitious programme bringing offline hybrid digital learning solutions to the remote villages.

The well-furnished digital labs supported by workshops from the team throughout the year can help the students learn independently with guidance from their teachers.

How crowfunding is helping 17000 ft foundation

Crowdfunding is increasingly coming up as a very important resource collection measure.

""17000 ft has been involved with ImpactGuru.com in multiple projects, the latest being the funding of a Playground for a very remote school in Kargil. We had also fundraised for our Bhoti Book Translation project through ImpactGuru.com and managed to raise more than we needed,"" says Sahu.

Fundraising platforms are great for helping nonprofits fund small projects that have tangible goals and timelines. It is an excellent way to help get the word out to potential supporters and garner more support for the non-profit, says the Iron Lady of Ladakh.

Future of 17000 ft foundation

Before 17000 ft was established, there was little or no attention on the remote schools of Ladakh, and today with all our work and efforts and the participation of the local communities, govt schools are looking and performing better and we are seeing a reverse trend of children coming back to their villages and govt schools.

""When we started, one of our biggest challenges was encouraging donors, volunteers, foundations and even corporates to focus on remote regions of Ladakh. Today, however, we are confident that our model is working and we can get the support we need,"" beams Sahu.

Sujata Sahu now wants to take this model to other remote and mountainous regions, like Arunachal Pradesh, or the remote areas of Himachal.

""We feel that we are closer now to our vision of a better life and education for all children, regardless of geography or terrain,"" she says.

Yes, ""Monday Night Football"" changed the face of television. Yes, it can still dominate the sports conversation when it has great games like Rams vs. Chiefs. But ""Monday Night Football"" is far from what it used to be, and it's time to face some hard truths about the most iconic show in sports TV history.

To be blunt, ""Monday Night Football"" is bad. Too often, the game matchups are not marquee. The football is not as exciting. The new announce team -- featuring three Monday night rookies in Jason Witten, Joe Tessitore and Booger McFarland -- is a work in progress at best, a train wreck at worst.

The most famous broadcast booth in sports no longer boasts legendary announcers like Howard Cosell, Dandy Don Meredith, Frank Gifford, John Madden or Al Michaels. Instead, this season's crew of Witten, Tessitore, McFarland and Lisa Salters has been roasted by fans and critics.

STEELE: The glory days of Cosell, Meredith and Gifford

Witten doesn't have the quarterback charisma of CBS' Tony Romo, the fearlessness of NBC's Cris Collinsworth, the Super Bowl gravitas of Fox's Troy Aikman. He's improving as he learns on the job. Unfortunately, the former Cowboys tight end keeps fumbling on the air.

During the Saints' 12-9 win over the Panthers in Week 15, Witten noted one of the best things about QB Cam Newton is his ability to ""run after catch"" before he corrected himself later in the broadcast. The ""Booger Mobile,"" a movable contraption carrying McFarland around stadiums, was supposed to reestablish the series' reputation for jazzy, technical innovation. Instead, it's been panned, with critics saying ESPN is trying to reinvent the wheel.

Let's be clear: ""Monday Night Football"" is one of the most successful and influential franchises in TV history. The show has even made somewhat of a comeback this season, with average viewership rising 10 percent season-to-date through Week 15.

But the world changes. The Oscars are no longer must-see TV. Famous brands like Sears, Blockbuster Video and Toys ""R"" Us are either going or gone. So is ""Monday Night Football's"" long run as the NFL's flagship telecast.

Like code blue in the emergency room, the warning signs have been flashing for years over the proud-but-aging Monday night franchise. Below are six symptoms of ""Monday Night Football's"" mid-life crisis as it wraps up its 49th season.

From monopoly to monotony

When ABC Sports producer Roone Arledge launched the original on Sept. 21, 1970, it stood alone as the NFL's only nationally televised prime-time game. Arledge and director Chet Forte created the original three-man booth of Cosell, Meredith and future ""Mr. College Football"" Keith Jackson (Gifford succeeded Jackson in 1971). They doubled the number of cameras, jacked up highlights, replays and graphics, and added memorable theme music.

Now, ""Monday Night Football"" is just one of three weekly prime-time NFL games, along with ""Sunday Night Football"" and ""Thursday Night Football."" (Not to mention the league's own NFL Network offering four exclusive Saturday night game telecasts this month).

All these games are produced like mini-Super Bowls. NFL game productions now feature anywhere from 12 to 20 cameras, including Skycams, pylon-cams and an ""All-22"" angle that captures every player on the field in a single shot.

""There are some weeks when all four of us, NBC, CBS, Fox and ABC, are doing prime-time college football games. And obviously Sunday night, Monday night and Thursday night in the NFL,"" said Mike Tirico, who served as ESPN's Monday night play-by-play announcer from 2006 to 2015 and now hosts the ""Football Night in America"" pregame show for NBC's Sunday night game. ""So now we have five days a week of football on in primetime. And 'Monday Night Football' is the sole reason for that happening.""

Though the modern NFL broadcast owes a lot to ""Monday Night Football's"" innovation, what was new and cutting edge in 1978 is workaday in 2018, making it much harder for ""Monday Night Football"" -- or any broadcast -- to truly stand apart.

""It never will get back to where it was. When 'Monday Night Football' started there weren't a thousand different options,"" said Joe Theisman, whose career was bookended by ""MNF."" His Super Bowl-winning career ended with a gruesome broken leg on a Monday night game against Lawrence Taylor's Giants in 1985, and he later served as ESPN's first lead analyst with Tirico in 2006, when the cable network took over from ABC.

""It used to be, as a player, that was the marquee night. Because everybody would be watching you,"" Theismann said. ""As a broadcaster, Monday night was the job you wanted -- because it was the only game in town. Today, there's so much football, so many options available, that it will never be what it was.""

Still, don't write ""Monday Night Football"" off. Nobody is comparing Witten, Tessitore and McFarland to Cosell, Gifford and Meredith. Much less Madden and Michaels. But they're improving together as a team.

Unlike Romo, Collinsworth or Aikman, Witten doesn't have the luxury of calling one of the week's best matchups. He gets whatever game the NFL gives ESPN in the preseason, even if it turns out to be two losing teams.

Witten, the 2012 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year winner, has the blessing of Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, the league's most powerful owner. Witten too has the backing of ESPN brass. Lee Fitting, ESPN's vice president of production, told Lindsay Jones of The Athletic that Witten, Tessitore and McFarland will all be back in 2019.

Again, the show is still a venerable Monday night brand. Even if it now draws the smallest average audience of the NFL's five main TV packages, it beat the Emmy Awards in September and will rank No. 1 on cable TV again this season. Along Madison Avenue, the show has powered ESPN to 15 straight Monday night ratings victories, across all networks.

""Monday Night Football's"" season-to-date 10 percent viewership increase is better than the league-wide average of 6 percent. Before ESPN's contract expires in early 2022, look for multiple corporate suitors, including ESPN, to throw billions at the league for the right to show Monday night games.

When asked whether ESPN would negotiate a new rights agreement for ""MNF"" or another NFL package when the current deals expire, ESPN declined to comment.

First to worst

Remember how the classic ""Monday Night Football"" always seemed to get the best game matchups? Who can forget Mike Ditka's undefeated Bears taking on Don Shula's Dolphins on Dec. 2, 1985? That classic game at the Orange Bowl (called by Gifford, Joe Namath and none other than O.J. Simpson) is still the highest-rated in Monday night game history, with a 29.6 rating.

Or Phil Simms' Giants taking on Joe Montana's 49ers on Dec. 3, 1990? That clash of two 10-1 teams featured future Hall of Famers on and off the field, including LT, Jerry Rice, Ronnie Lott, Bill Parcells and Bill Belichick. It's the second highest-rated Monday night game ever, with a 26.9 rating.

Fast-forward nearly 30 years, and it's NBC's ""Sunday Night Football"" and Fox's and CBS' Sunday afternoon packages that land the best games. That's why ""Sunday Night Football"" has reigned as the No. 1 prime-time show a record seven straight years.

""The Sunday Night package is the best package because it has the best games. It's plain and simple,"" Tirico said. ""You see three appearances from the best teams in the league on 'Sunday Night Football.' Sometimes four. You'll only see those teams once on the Monday night package. So there's no doubt the best package is on the 'Sunday Night Football' NBC broadcast. That goes on with everything around it, from the production to the look and all that stuff.""

To add insult to injury, ESPN pays nearly twice as much as other NFL TV partners for the rights to Monday night: $1.9 billion a year. For that, it gets one wild-card playoff telecast and the Pro Bowl. But zero Super Bowls.

Sure, ESPN gets tons of NFL highlights that drive studio programs such as ""NFL Live,"" ""Sunday NFL Countdown"" and ""Monday Night Countdown."" Not to mention ""SportsCenter,"" ""Get Up!"" and other weekday shows. But ESPN would love to land a Super Bowl in the next round of contract talks. Given what they pay, it's long overdue.

There have been whispers for years that the NFL stiff-armed ESPN as pay-back for the network's ferocious reporting on criminal players, concussions and CTE. Maybe. Maybe not. But there's little doubt that years of weak games have taken their toll on the ""Monday Night Football"" brand.

ESPN's Monday night broadcast sank to a record-low audience during the 2017 season, according to SportsBusiness Daily. The series drew the smallest average audience of the league's three prime-time series and ranked dead last among the NFL's five main TV packages, according to SBD (The league's NFL Network offers a smaller package of seven exclusive game telecasts this season).

The good news? Those numbers are relative compared to the rest of TV. In 2017, ""MNF"" still ranked as the No. 1 show on cable TV on Monday, beating scripted powerhouses such as AMC's ""The Walking Dead"" and HBO's ""Game of Thrones.""

ESPN president Jimmy Pitaro and executive vice president of programming Burke Magnus have made improving the network's NFL relationship their first priority. They're working closely with key NFL executives such as Brian Rolapp, the league's chief business and media officer. Their hard work is paying off.

There's no question that ESPN nabbed its strongest Monday night schedule in years this season. There have been thrillers such as the Rams' 54-51 win over the Chiefs and the Chiefs' 27-23 comeback win over the Broncos, plus games featuring national TV draws such as the Cowboys, Packers, Patriots and Steelers.

Despite speculation that ESPN would lose its NFL wild-card game to Fox this postseason, Pitaro and Burke hung on to it. The game will be simulcast on ABC, according to SBD.

No flexibility

The seeds for ""Monday Night Football's"" fall into second-string status were planted in 2006, said Wesley Hyatt, author of ""Kicking off the Week: A History of Monday Night Football on ABC Television, 1970-2005.""

That's when the show moved to ESPN after 35 years at ABC. During that round of negotiations, the NFL anointed NBC's new ""Sunday Night Football"" its No. 1 prime package. To make sure, the league gave NBC the added weapon of so-called ""flexible scheduling.""

During Weeks 5-17, the league can grab more promising games for the Sunday night broadcast. That means if NBC is stuck with a Sunday night matchup of two losing teams, the league has options.

Only Sunday afternoon games are eligible to be flexed into NBC's Sunday night window. If ESPN has a lousy matchup the next night, that's tough luck. Talk about bringing a knife to a gunfight. And a butter knife at that.

Two words ESPN needs to add to its vocabulary (and then to its NFL contract): flexible scheduling. -- MarkMaske (@MarkMaske) November 9, 2015

Compare the networks' respective Week 16 matchups. While NBC's ""Sunday Night Football"" will showcase young superstar Patrick Mahomes of the Chiefs against Super Bowl winner Russell Wilson and the Seahawks, ESPN's ""Monday Night Football"" will be stuck with Jon Gruden's 3-11 Raiders hosting the 6-8 Broncos.

Yeah, it could be the Raiders' final game at the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum. So there's a bit of drama. But ESPN would rather have Mahomes' 45 touchdown passes than the Raiders and Broncos playing out the string.

As Tirico noted: ""We will flex three or four better games this year -- just because of flex scheduling -- that Monday night can never do. If you're Monday night, and you have the Raiders at the end of the year, you can't do anything about it. If it was a Sunday night game, it would be gone. So right there, you know what the pre-eminent package is.""

One could argue the biggest problems facing ""Monday Night Football"" are not ESPN's doing. Instead, they're structural and contractual, author Hyatt said.

Nostalgia only takes you so far.

""The show has problems defining what it is, and what it wants to be, right now,"" Hyatt said. ""That's been shown over the years by the number of personnel they've had to add, and take away, while it's been on ESPN. They've also lacked any leverage with the NFL to get good quality contests. It seems like they're always the ones coming in last. There's just no excitement for it like the way it was when it was on ABC.""

ESPN's subscriber losses have hurt, too. As recently as 2011, ESPN reached 100 million U.S. homes. Because of cord-cutting and other issues, ESPN's down to about 86 million homes. Meanwhile, broadcast competitors such as NBC still reach roughly 115 million homes.

""The 'Monday Night Football' that we enjoyed back in the 20th century is not going to make it in the 21st century,"" warned Hyatt.

Witten pulls a 'rabbit out of his head'

The illustrious history of ""Monday Night Football's"" broadcast booth may have hit rock bottom this season with Witten in the lead analyst chair.

Say what you will about the color commentators who came and went over the decades, but the show is almost as famous for its announcers as its games. Blame it on the legendary trio from the show's glory days. Their memory tortures every announcing team that's followed, like the Greek furies of myth.

Consider this: A ""TV Guide"" viewer poll in 1978 named Cosell the most loved -- and hated -- analyst at the same time. Try getting that kind of reaction these days to any announcer. Dandy Don could make a blowout fun by singing ""Turn out the Lights, The Party is Over."" Gifford, their straight man, served 27 straight years in the booth from 1971 to 1997.

In contrast, ESPN just shook up its cast for second time in four seasons, with Witten succeeding Gruden, Tessitore replacing Sean McDonough and McFarland coming aboard as ""field analyst."" Salters, the talented sideline reporter who's been part of the crew since 2012, is the only holdover.

By all accounts, the likable Witten is working hard to make the difficult transition to TV. Let's give credit where credit is due. Witten's widely mocked comment that his Cowboys ""won"" the Amari Cooper trade with the Raiders looks pretty prescient now.

But the TV novice keeps tripping over his own tongue. He's become infamous on social media for his Norm Crosby-like malapropisms -- such as stating Aaron Rodgers of the Packers pulled another ""rabbit out of his head.""

Witten compared Giants star Saquon Barkley to ... O.J. Simpson? He thinks the NFL has become too ""left wing"" on safety rules, raising the suspicions of liberal viewers.

Early on, a nervous Witten swallowed the microphone, letting McFarland, Tessitore and Salters fill dead air. Now viewers such as ex-Redskins running back Clinton Portis complain that the ex-Cowboy talks way too much about his time with America's Team -- to the exclusion of the game in front of him.

Viewer frustration boiled over during ESPN's telecast of the defending Super Bowl champion Eagles' 28-13 win over the Redskins on Dec. 3.

""Is this Monday Night Football or ... Jason Witten: A Football Life?"" asked Philadelphia sports radio anchor Marc Farzetta.

Another viewer tweeted: ""Things this commentary team talked about: - Domestic violence - Jason Witten - LA Chargers - The AFC - Saints - Cowboys - Mike McCarthy - The Packers - Redskins QBs. Things this commentary team didn't talk about: - The Eagles - This game.""

Even when Witten has a strong TV moment, it can backfire. As a childhood victim of domestic violence, Witten won praise by calling out the Redskins for signing Reuben Foster, despite a domestic violence arrest.

""I believe the Washington Redskins used horrendous judgment in claiming this guy. And I understand that it's an ongoing investigation. But my family's been affected by domestic violence,"" Witten said. ""I understand the anguish that it causes. And you know, young players just have to understand that there is no tolerance for putting your hands on a woman. Period.""

That's nice, countered critics like Robert Littal of BlackSportsOnline. But why didn't Witten take an equally hard stance when Cowboys owner Jerry Jones signed Greg Hardy back in 2015?

To his credit, Witten tweeted Littal a mea culpa, saying he may have gone overboard with his support of a new teammate.

Thanks for your opinion, Robert. Privately, I let my opinion be known and agreed to disagree. That day after practice I chose not to be divisive. Prob went too far. On Monday with platform and no longer member of a team,I spoke my mind. Would love your support w/SCORE Foundation https://t.co/0ipiGwX1Hi -- Jason Witten (@JasonWitten) December 5, 2018

Jason Whitlock, the ex-ESPN columnist turned co-host of FS1's ""Speak for Yourself, sympathizes with Witten. He blames ESPN producers, not the TV rookie, for the Foster episode.

""ESPN has gotten a lot better, but the network still makes too many decisions based on Twitter,"" Whitlock wrote in an email. ""Asking Jason Witten and Booger McFarland to discuss one of America's most complex problems (domestic violence) during the broadcast of a live NFL game is an example of serving Twitter noise rather than football fans and your partner (the NFL). ...

""The discussion put Witten in a bad spot and surely baffled fans trying to enjoy a football game.""

Even before the Foster brouhaha, the knives were out for Witten among critics and viewers.

An ""Awful Announcing"" reader poll ranked ESPN's Monday night crew dead last among 15 NFL announce teams. ""The new 'Monday Night Football' broadcast booth is a complete disaster, and this isn't some kind of minority opinion,"" wrote AA. (CBS' lead duo of Romo and Jim Nantz were named No. 1 in the poll, which drew over 50,000 votes. NBC's Collinsworth and Michaels finished No. 2).

Tessitore, McFarland and Salters are experienced pros. But Witten's reviews have been brutal compared to those of his pal Romo, who became the toast of sports TV last season. If Witten doesn't make the cut, he'd be ESPN's biggest flop since another ex-Cowboys star: Emmitt Smith.

Without finding another one-of-a-kind talent like Cosell, ESPN needs to form a stable, appealing announce team that will engage viewers, Hyatt said. The author would start by benching Witten.

""They need to shake up what they've got right now. This booth is just nothing to write home about,"" he said. ""I'm not sure when ABC will get coverage rights to the Super Bowl. But I can't imagine they'd be using the same crew they're using now on Monday nights on a Super Bowl.""

With sharks circling his new TV crew, respected ""Monday Night Football"" producer Jay Rothman gave them a strong vote of confidence last month.

""I think it's been really, really seamless and getting better,"" said Rothman on a media call.

In hindsight, ESPN wishes it had put Witten on-air sooner.

""In retrospect, and this is a great lesson to learn when we hire the next new person in any sport, is just put him on TV,"" ESPN executive vice president of production Lee Fitting told The Athletic. ""Let him get comfortable talking to America. Let him get comfortable talking to the camera, and talking to others.

""That's something that I personally whiffed on and hold myself accountable for and wish we did more of that.""

'Monday Night Football' can't hang

Even when it boasts the game of the year, ""Monday Night Football"" can't beat ""Sunday Night Football,"" or even ""Thursday Night Football.""

Consider ESPN's telecast of the Rams' thrilling win over the Chiefs last month. The 54-51 shootout set multiple league records; the teams combined for the third most points in a game (105) in NFL history and a ridiculous 14 touchdowns. It was the first time both teams scored 50-plus points -- and the first time the losing team dropped 50 on its opponent.

The matchup drew the largest viewership for the program in nearly two years. Witten and his new team rose to the occasion. It was great TV. But it still wasn't enough for ""Monday Night Football"" to beat its two prime-time NFL competitors.

The previous evening, NBC's Sunday night telecast of Bears-Vikings drew 19.1 million viewers to Monday night's 16.7 million. Fox's Thursday night telecast of Packers-Seahawks also outdrew Monday night, according to Nielsen, averaging 16.9 million viewers.

Gerry Matalon, the respected former ESPN executive turned founder of Matalon Media, said it's unfair to compare today's Monday night on ESPN to the original on ABC.

""Success should absolutely not be judged by the past,"" Matalon said. ""'Monday Night Football' used to be the only prime time game in the 70's and most of the 80's, so it should not be compared to today's NFL broadcast landscape. With the space now having two more high-quality prime-time productions, ESPN just needs to continue its focus on producing the best broadcast possible and decide what external feedback is valuable and what is simply noise.""

'Booger Mobile' trying too hard?

Then there's the ""Booger Mobile,"" the movable crane that puts McFarland closer to the field where the former Super Bowl-winning defensive tackle can better analyze line play in the trenches.

That's ESPN's goal, anyway. But the jury's out on whether this vantage point has produced scintillating insights that McFarland couldn't spot from the TV booth.

McFarland is smart and quick. Separating him from Witten and Tessitore might not have been the best idea. McFarland could help Witten adjust to TV. Instead, they're separated. At times, it seems like they're rushing to beat each other to the talk button, a la ""Jeopardy."" And when Witten starts talking before he's completed his thoughts, look out.

Meanwhile, ESPN has ticked off stadium spectators whose expensive lower-bowl views are blocked by the contraption. ""Booger! Get out of the freakin' way,"" screamed one ticked off Giants fan on Twitter.

""Quit trying too hard,"" Whitlock said. ""The Booger Mobile is just trying too hard.""

😡😡😡😡😡😡😡 pic.twitter.com/9yFUYmhwYG -- LPG - NYG (@LicensePlateGuy) October 23, 2018

So what can ESPN do?

The easy answer is dump Witten, its new $4 million-per-year man, and hire a new lead analyst. The list of possible replacements is long, starting with McFarland and Louis Riddick inside ESPN, and Peyton Manning, Kurt Warner, Joe Thomas and others outside the network.

One could argue ""MNF"" hasn't had a top-flight TV booth comparable to NBC, Fox and CBS since Tirico jumped to NBC before the 2016 season.

The combination of Gruden and Sean McDonough never meshed. They didn't seem to like each other, much less the violence on the field, the officiating, or the lousy, late-season games they were forced to call. No wonder Gruden left for his $100 million coaching deal with the Raiders while McDonough returned to the familiar confines of college football.

""As much as Witten has struggled, I still think it's better than last year,"" Whitlock said. ""I was so done with Jon Gruden and Sean McDonough and their negativity toward the NFL. ... At least this crew likes football.""

Rather than giving up on Witten, ESPN should move McFarland to the booth and see what develops.

""They just have to have the courage to stay the course and ride it out,"" Whitlock said. ""They've made some positive moves. The NFL is still TV gold.""

Matalon agrees. Despite the Twitter noise, he thinks ESPN should give the group three seasons to develop chemistry.

""Some of the criticism is fair, but most of it is subjective chatter,"" he said. ""Basically, ESPN is making mechanical adjustments on a plane while it's in the air.""

Witten could be self-pitying about his rough critical reviews. Instead, he's been funny and self-deprecating about his struggles. When Sporting News asked about his flubs during a media call, Witten didn't get defensive. Instead, he laughed at himself and vowed to improve. It's the kind of stand-up guy attitude he was famous for with the Cowboys. It should serve him well in his TV career, if it lasts.

""Yeah, there's been some flubs. I mean I made mistakes. You try to own it, you embrace it,"" Witten said. ""Hell, I'm not perfect, I've certainly had my fair share of mistakes on live television and more than anything else you try to embrace it, you laugh at it, you smile at it, I had the remark on Twitter that you don't try to deny it. You know, I got a few texts from my wife and it's good to see her laughing at it when I get home the next day and talking about it. So it's a transition, I try not to take it too serious, I really try to embrace it, and focus on improving.""

IYER: Manning Night Football: How ESPN can bring back its 'MNF' magic

The Week 15 Saints-Panthers game averaged 13 million viewers, up 37 percent from last season's comparable telecast. ESPN's average viewership is up 10 percent to 11.8 million viewers this season. That means roughly 1 million more viewers are watching Monday night telecasts every week. That's sweet music for ESPN vs. 2017, when full season viewership sank 6 percent, according to SBD.

In a telling sign that ESPN is working its way back into the league's good graces, the NFL announced Disney's ABC/ESPN, along with NFL Network, will serve as the exclusive home for live coverage of the 2019 NFL Draft. That means Fox is out of the picture after only a single season of live draft coverage.

While ESPN will continue to offer its traditional draft coverage in Nashville, Tenn., from April 25-27, ABC will highlight the cast of ""College GameDay"" for three straight days.

Call it poetic justice. Remember, it was ESPN that discovered the NFL Draft as a TV property back in 1980, when even PR-savvy NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle didn't see the potential. Now, the draft is a movable feast, moving from city to city, and generating record TV audiences.

""There is no better way to celebrate 40 years of working with the NFL to grow the draft than to bring the considerable assets of The Walt Disney Co. to Nashville,"" Pitaro said in a statement.

As for those who don't like the ""Booger Mobile,"" remember, experimentation has always been part of ""Monday Night Football's"" DNA, Tirico said. This is the same series that put standup comedian Dennis Miller on the air for two seasons, then cast Kornheiser, the snarky ""Pardon the Interruption"" co-host.

""You never know where too much is if you don't try,"" Tirico said. ""I always applaud people who innovate and try something different. It might not work. It might not be for everyone. Time will tell that. But try something in a different way that hasn't been done before. At some point, somebody said let's put a yellow (first down) line down on the field. Guess what? If you saw a broadcast without it, you would go apoplectic now.

MORE: Seven steps to fix ""Monday Night Football""

Few know the ""Monday Night Football"" brand better than Tirico. No matter the announcers, or game matchups, he believes the classic show has one main quality that will help retain its relevance and value in a crowded sports media market.

First, the nationally televised game airs on Monday, when the NFL fraternity has a rare night off. NFL players, coaches and front office personnel may or may not watch ""Sunday Night Football,"" depending on their travel schedules. But everybody still watches on Monday night. To call ""Monday Night Football"" is to enter a ""fishbowl"" existence, Tirico said, where every comment is judged first and foremost by the NFL fraternity.

""I sat in the fishbowl for 10 years. Al Michaels was right: It's just different,"" he said. ""It's the last song on the stage for that week's play. Everyone is watching it. So no matter the rating for the game, you know that that platform remains, and will will remain, important.""

The game's secret weapon has always been its spot on the weekly calendar, Tirico said. Monday is the most depressing day of the week. But for a few hours, fans can enjoy a respite that makes the rest of their work week palatable.

""Mondays suck. Folks are going back to work. It's a terrible day. What you have with 'Monday Night Football' is a little bit of an oasis,"" Tirico said. ""You know that all the football that you enjoyed is gone, now, for three more days. So you just get to enjoy one more game.

""It's almost like that last bite of a good meal.""

As reported by Telangana Today, the department tied up with Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) and Telangana State Technology Services (TSTS) for implementing the Aadhaar biometric attendance. The attendance of teaching and non-teaching staff will be recorded twice a day -- morning and evening -- and for students, before serving the mid-day meal, so that the attendance recorded on the biometric machines could be matched with the bills submitted by school managements to ascertain the number of students consuming the mid-day meal."

Occupations traditionally considered as 'lowly', like sweeping and leather work, continue to be dominated by scheduled castes in general, more so by the specific castes associated with such work. And the jobs at the top are almost entirely in the grip of those who are not from scheduled castes or tribes.

Among coveted jobs at the top, those entirely in the private sector -- corporate managers and business professionals -- have the worst representation of SCs and STs. About 93% of corporate manager jobs are held by non-SC/ST people. In the case of sectors with significant government presence, such as teaching and healthcare, the scenario is much better.

It is difficult to say from the current data set how much this skew in the presence of SCs and STs in many professions is because of class -- as class closely mirrors caste in India -- and how much is due to actual caste discrimination. But what is amply evident is that the link between caste and occupation remains strong. Also, worryingly, the link between occupations traditionally viewed as 'lowly', such as sweepers and leather workers, seems to be as strong in younger age groups as in older ones.

Among the aspirational jobs that TOI looked at in the census data (see graphics), SCs have the highest proportion among teachers and healthcare professionals, 8.9% and 9.3%, respectively, though still well below their proportion of 14% in all non-farm workers. STs have proportional representation in the teaching profession in almost all states.

Another profession with representation of SCs (13.7%) and STs (9.3%) almost in proportion to their population shares is that of policemen, again totally in the government sector. In fact, STs have a representation among police personnel well over their proportion of 4% among all non-farm workers, thanks to many states with significant tribal populations taking them in large numbers into the police force.

Despite several reports of mid-day meal cooks belonging to scheduled castes facing discrimination, intriguingly, there is a fairly high proportion of SCs among cooks in several states, including Punjab (44.3%) and Uttar Pradesh (21.3%), two states generally seen as caste-ridden. Why this is the case is not clear.

Among lower rung professions, those involving hard manual labour again show a pattern of SC and ST representation well above their proportion in the non-farm worker population. In the middling professions, their presence improves considerably compared to the aspirational professions, but remains lower than their share in all non-farm jobs.

There are only two professions, leather work and sweeping, where the scheduled castes are in a majority. For instance, of the 46,000 leather workers in Uttar Pradesh, 41,000 are from castes traditionally associated with leather work -- Chamars, Dhusia, Jatava, etc. Similarly, in Rajasthan, of 76,000 sweepers, almost 52,000 belong to castes such as Bhangi, Mehtar and Chura, associated traditionally with this job.

Though there are signs of SCs breaking into better jobs to some extent, in the case of castes associated with sweeping and leather work, a significant chunk is still stuck in these traditional occupations. For instance, in Uttar Pradesh, of the total number of SC persons in the 35-59 age group working as sweepers, 63.4% are Balmikis. Even in the 15-34 age group, 62% of SC sweepers are Balmikis, showing how little has changed for the new generation. Similarly, of SCs engaged in leather work in the 35-59 age group, Chamars, Dhusias, Jatavas account for 88.2%. In the 15-34 age group, too, that proportion is 88.2%. A similar pattern holds in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan as well.

There is no doubt that the school education sector is beset with huge problems. However, whether the dismal performance is on account of policy gap or there are other factors that are responsible for the current state of affairs is a moot point.

Let us first try to understand what has not happened in the education sector. Why has it not happened? And, how can it happen (whether through policy intervention or otherwise)?

Two things have certainly happened during the current millennium. The infrastructure (school buildings) has shown remarkable improvement though there is still a long way to go. And, thanks to the mid-day-meal, we have managed to get the child to the school.

However, what is appalling is the poor quality of education that is imparted in most of the government schools. This is evidenced by the fact that the learning outcomes have actually come down during the past decade despite enormous amount of investments. The number of teachers has gone up substantially and the average pupil-teacher ratio comes close to the required levels.

However, this does not solve the problem of quality. To begin with, a large number of teachers are not qualified to teach, yet they are teaching. According to a rough estimate, out of eight million teachers around 1.4 million fall in this category. Politics has seeped into this cadre in the most insidious manner resulting in skewed distribution of teachers in most of the States as the tendency is to hang in and around urban areas.

The Right to Education Act did precious little on this front. In fact, the legislation made the task of delivering quality education complex and difficult. The focus of the Act is primarily on 'inputs' (like infrastructure) rather than 'outcomes'. It has created an adversarial role between 'public' and 'private' schools. The Act mandates under Section 12(1)(c) that even private schools ""shall admit in Class I, to the extent of at least 25 per cent of the strength of that class, children belonging to weaker section and disadvantaged group."" The manner in which reimbursement is to be provided has created a number of problems.

The norms and standards prescribed in the schedule for a school are far removed from ground reality. What is perhaps desirable has been made mandatory. This has resulted in a phenomenal increase in the number of teachers. During 2015-16, there were 39,608 government schools that had less than 10 children but each school was mandated to have minimum of two teachers.

The budget private schools, most of whom are doing a great job in imparting education, are under enormous pressure to meet the prescribed standards or face closure. No attempt was made while enacting this legislation to look at the ground reality.

The consequences have been disastrous. On an average, an amount of around ₹10,000 per child gets spent in government schools. The budget schools do it for much less and impart as good, if not better, education. Unfortunately, the focus so far has primarily been on regulation (legislations are perhaps meant for that) and not on development of the private sector. Consequently, even after eight years of enactment, the country is none the better than what it was.

The RTE Act has done more damage to delivery of education. Section 16 of the Act provides that ""No child admitted in a school shall be held back in any class or expelled from school till completion of elementary education.""

The 'expulsion' part can be understood but not holding back a child in a class has meant that a large number of children are getting promoted without acquiring the necessary attributes. The model of 'no detention' was apparently picked up from the West and transplanted in this country without taking into account the objective conditions obtaining here.

Yet again, the consequences have been devastating as there is a huge bottleneck getting created at Class X where the pass percentage has plummeted. The States were not even given freedom to take a call on the issue. The government has subsequently decided to provide an option to the States and the amendment is under consideration of Parliament.

A new Education Policy is round the corner. However, what needs to be understood is whether there is a need for a policy to address the issues that afflict school education. Most of the action relating to education lies in the States. In any case, the country is too diverse to consider a single mandate by way of policy for the entire country. If a teacher does not go to a school in Kerala, he could well be ""lynched"" but in some of the States of northern India, they consider it their right not to go to the school. There are instances of these regular teachers employing a ""substitute"" to represent them and even teach on their behalf.

What is actually required is an action plan clearly outlining: What needs to be done? How it will be done? Who will do it? And, by when it will be done? The roles of respective entities should be clearly defined so that the performance can be assessed. One has often wondered why should only the Centre assess the performance of States? Why can't it be the other way round?

The action plan needs to focus on the teacher who plays a pivotal role in imparting education. The entire value chain needs to be looked at, understood and interventions clearly outlined. Beginning with pre-service training, to selection process, to in-service training, to transfer and posting, to engagement of teachers in non-educational activities, to their promotional avenues and morale will need to be looked at.

An action plan for each State will have to be worked out in detail, clearly outlining the roles of the Centre and the respective State government. Intervention for each State will vary from State to State. Unlike the present dispensation, there will have to be sufficient flexibility in the central schemes to accommodate the differences among States. The whole approach has to be outcome based rather than input based as has been the case so far.

Our country has been obsessed with the western world. We had looked at Finland, England, Scotland, Holland and all the lands of the world but not at motherland. A lot of wonderful work is being done within the country but has so far gone unnoticed. ""Policy"" cannot help in this regard.

What needs to be done is to facilitate identification, understanding and scaling of successful practices. If these home-grown practices have succeeded in the prevalent objective conditions, the chances of their replication and scaling are pretty high as compared to an 'imported' idea or practice.

What is also required is to learn from States, like Rajasthan, that have turned it around through some remarkable State level interventions both administrative and financial.

Policy debates provide food for intellectual stimulation but what matters is what is done on the ground. Hence, the dire need for an action plan."

According to The News Minute (TNM), 15 of them have died. Eighty birds have also died in that area.

Recent reports suggest that the substance the prasadam was contaminated with is an insecticide called Monocrotophos. According to TNM, authorities are probing how the insecticide got into the prasadam.

Monocrotophos has been classified as ""highly hazardous"" by World Health Organization.

Monochrotophos has killed before, even as recently as in 2017, when a large number of farmers died in the cotton belt in Maharashtra, reported The News Minute.

In 2013, the mid-day meal served in a school in Bihar was contaminated with Monocrotophos. Twenty-three schoolchildren - aged between four and twelve years - died.

The Anupam Verma committee was set up by the government in 2015 to review some of the pesticides, including Monocrotophos.

Noting that Monocrotophos was being misused, the committee asked for specific studies on Monocrotophos to be submitted.

""The Certificate of Registration of technical and its formulation deemed to be invalid w.e.f. from 1st January, 2018 if studies as recommended by the Expert Committee is not submitted by December 2017,"" the committee had warned.

However, according to TNM, the Indian industry did not submit the reports that it had been asked to submit.

According to TNM:

""The Indian agro chemical industry is the fourth largest in the world valued at USD 4.1 billion and expected to increase to USD 8.1 billion by 2025, according to the latest FICCI report. But neither has the government accepted international data on the dangers of Monocrotophos, nor are new studies being conducted in India.""

The pesticide industry does not provide accurate data due to the conflict of interest. Researchers and scientists are intimidated and defamation suits slapped against them, says the TNM report.

Licenced in 1972, Monocrotophos is approved to be used only in cotton, paddy, maize, Bengal gram, green gram, pea, red gram, sugarcane, citrus, mango, coconut, coffee and cardamom crops. However, according to TNM, government institutions like Indian Agriculture Research Institute (IARI) un-selectively use it on fruits and vegetables. Studies conducted by IARI itself have found very high residue of Monocrotophos in vegetables.

The WHO, in it's review, pointed out that the argument that there is no alternative to the insecticide is flawed because a number of countries like Australia, China, those in the European Union, Indonesia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, the United States of America and Vietnam have banned its use.

""Leading Asian countries have banned the use of Monocrotophos because of unacceptable health risks, but in India, Monocrotophos continues to be produced, used and exported. The perception that Monocrotophos is cheap and necessary have prevented the product from being taken off the market. Urgent action is thus needed to reduce the availability of and the demand for highly hazardous pesticides, as recommended by WHO and FAO (42).""

One biometric machine was being provided for every 100 students, with managements being directed to record attendance of teaching and non-teaching staff twice a day -- morning and evening -- and for students, before serving the mid-day meal.

""The attendance recorded on the biometric machines will be matched with the bills submitted by school managements to ascertain the number of students consuming the mid-day meal. As it is linked with Aadhaar, the managements cannot duplicate admissions,"" an official said.

The machines and software were designed in such a way that biometric fingerprints captured are immediately verified with the biometric details available with UIDAI using Internet and is reflected in the dashboard of the School Education Department's website. A software was being developed to transmit the captured details offline or when network is available in the schools located in remote areas.

""Most students and teachers in schools where the machines are already in use are giving their attendance on it. The department sent a proposal to the government seeking budget for implementing the system in all schools from the next academic year,"" an official said, adding that there were some network issues in certain schools located in remote areas with these being sorted out."

In both schools, students reported to having seen a lizard in the food they were served. What is strange, however, is that the two incidents were reported from two different districts of the state - Bagalkote and Ballary.

In Chikkamagi government higher primary school in Hunagunda taluk in Bagalkote district, one student spotted a lizard in the food that he was served. A few other students are said to have started eating by the time he had alerted his teachers.

Those students who had already eaten were made to throw up the food immediately. A hundred and five students from the school were then taken to the hospital for observation.

Meitei Hindus of Manipur and others elsewhere in the world observe New Year or Cheiraoba every year sometime in mid April when the Sun enters the house of Aries or Mesha Rashi. This day is also called Mesha Sankranti (transmigration of the Sun into the house of Aries) by the Hindus. Mesha Sankranti is taken as the first day of the solar cycle year that is the solar New Year as per Hindu calendar based on the movement of the Sun. The day usually falls on 13 or 14 of April (sometimes15 April) every year and take it as the first day of the first month of the year in many local and regional calendars of India and South-east Asia, that adopt solar calendar.

The observation of Cheiraoba by Meiteis Hindus in Manipur is (apparently) in no way related with Charak Pujah, a Siva worship ritual of the Bengalis as suggested by some people. The nature of the ritual performed during Charak Pujah and that of Cheiraoba observed by the Meitei Hindus are quite different. During the festival of Charak Pujah, the human Charak is pierced with hooks called borshi on his back and then he is moved around with ropes fixed on a pole. Further, Charak Pujah takes place on the mid night of the last day of the month Chaitra/Choitro. However, preparation of the festival ( Charak Pujah) usually starts before one month of the Chaitra Sankranti that usually falls in the last week of March or first/second week of April. As per Bengali calendar, the month Chaitra/Choitro (March-April) is taken as the last month of the year whereas, the month Baishakh/Boishakh (April-May) is taken as the first month of the year.

The name Sajibu Cheiraoba ( Sajibu New Year) practiced by the Meitei Hindus is adopted from the traditional Meitei word Sajibu (March /April), the first month of the traditional Meitei calendar and Cheiraoba, heralding of the approach of new year by holding a stick. It is also said that the date of observation of Cheiraoba by the Meitei Hindus is copied from the Bangali calendar after adoption of many of the Meiteis into Hinduism in the early part of eighteenth century and introduction of Goura Hinduism in the later period ( subject to further research). In fact, the people of Bengal too, observe New Year as Pohela Boishakh or Poila Baishakh, the first day of the month of Baishakh based on the movement of the Sun in relation with the Zodiac signs. As stated above, Baishakh (April/May) is the first month of a year as per Hindu Bengali calendar that adopts solar chart based on the movement of the Sun. Every year, the first day of Baishakh coincides with 13 or 14 (sometimes 15) in the mid April. As such, the Meitei Hindus of Manipur observe Cheiraoba almost in the manner and style of the traditional Manipuri Meiteis and the date is seemingly adopted from the solar calendar used by the Hindu Bengalis and certainly not from the date of observation of the Charak Pujah .

Besides Meitei Hindus of Manipur, many non-Hindi speaking Indian states like Assam, Bengal, Kerala, Odisha, Tamil Nadu,Tripura, Punjab along with many other South-east Asian countries including Myanmar, Cambodia, Shri Lanka, Thailand, Laos, Bangladesh, some section of people living in Chittagong Hill Tracts and many other communities living in this region also celebrate New Year either on 13 or 14 April ( occasionally 15) every year as per local/regional astrological readings based on solar calendar. At some places the festival is observed for two to five days. In Assam, the occasion is celebrated as Bohag or Rongali Bihu, in Bengal and Bangladesh as Poila Boishakh (Pohela Baishakh), in Tamil Nadu as Puthandu, in Kerala as Vishu, in Odisha as Pana Sankranti, in Tripura as Boisuk, in Punjab as Baishakhi or Baishakh, in Chittagong Hills as Sangrai by Marma people and Biju by Chakma people, in Myanmar as Thingyan, in Cambodia as Chaul Chnam Thmey, in Sri Lanka as Aluth Avurudda, in Thailand as Sonkran, in Laos as Bpee Mai/Sonkran or Songkran and so on.

On the other hand, the month called Chaitra/Choitro (March-April) is taken as the first month of a year and Baishakh (April/May) as second month of the year as per traditional Hindu calendar based on the movement of the Moon. As per the lunar calendar, the first day of the first fortnight of waxing/brightening moon (Shukla Paksha) of the month of Chaitra is taken and observes as New Year. This year (2017) the New Year falls on 29th March whereas it was corresponded with 8th April last year (2016) as per calendars based on the movement of the Moon. As such, the first day of Sajibu which corresponds with the first day of Hindu month of Chaitra is taken as New Year by many communities who follow lunar calendar on the basis of their respective regional/local calculations. Mention may be made of Chaitra Navratris in Himachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Jarkhand, Ugadi in Karnataka, Gudhi Padwa in Maharastra, Goa and Konkan, Sajibu Nongma Panba Cheiraoba in Manipur, Navreh in Kashmir, Thapna in Rajasthan etc.

In many places throughout South-east Asia, the festival is also observed as an occasion for family re-unions, exchange of greetings, annual house cleaning, pouring of water, temple visits etc. Except for the water pouring part, other cultural practices performing in many parts of South-east Asia and that of Meitei Hindus are almost identical. Here it may be pertinent to mention that the Meiteis who practice and uphold the traditional/indigenous Meetei/Meitei religion, celebrate Cheiraoba on the first day of traditional Meitei Calendar Sajibu ( March/April) which generally falls on the last week of March or first/second week of April of the Gregorian Calendar. The traditional Meitei/Meetei Cheiraoba is believed to have been in practice since the time of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba who ruled Manipur in the first century AD. Generally speaking, lunar and lunisolar calendars were common in almost all the ancient countries of the world and still followed by many communities more for socio-cultural purposes.

Lastly, it is a general practice among the Meitei Hindus of Manipur that after cleaning the house, a family meal/feast with variety of items comprising (at least) five or more is prepared with fresh seasonal vegetables and offered it to Yumlai and Lamlai and some people to Hindu Gods and Goddesses they worship at home too, before consuming it by the whole family jointly. After the meals are over, they use to climb a nearby hill considered to be the abode of Gods and Goddesses by the Meiteis. This tradition reminds the people of Manipur that the land (Manipur) comprises of both hills and valleys and our ancestors once lived in the hills, (though there are other explanations too).

Thus, (Sajibu) Cheiraoba is celebrated in mid-April which usually falls on 13 or 14 April (sometimes15) by the Meitei Hindus, mostly in local manner and style of the traditional (Sajibu) Nongma Panba Cheiraoba of the original Meitei/Meetei culture, along with many culturally identical people of South-east Asia, who adopt solar calendar.

As the British gradually took control of India, both military and civilian people came to settle here, and they soon developed a very distinctive Anglo-Indian lifestyle. Much of this centered around food...a lot of it!

Ingredients were cheap and plentiful and servants a dime a dozen, so the average mid-level Britisher serving in India could eat like a king - tables of the Raj became bywords for excess and gluttony!

Here is a description of the bewilderingly large meals eaten by the typical sahib.

Meal #1

Starting early, at 6 am. Chhota Hazri (small breakfast) would be served, with tea and perhaps a piece of fruit.

Meal #2

A few hours later would come the Burra Hazri. This was the enormous breakfast without which no Englishman in Victorian India would even consider starting his day. A selection of ""crumbled chops, brain cutlets, beef rissoles, devilled kidneys, whole spatchcocks, duck stews, Irish stews, mutton hashes, brawns of sheep heads and trotters, not to mention an assortment of Indian dishes such as Jhalfrazie, prawn dopiaza, chicken malai and beef Hussaini.

Added to this were a number of Anglo-Indian concoctions such as kidney toast Madras style, Madras fritters, and leftover meat minced and refried with ginger and chillies. There was also the ultimate Anglo-Indian breakfast dish of kedgeree, a perennial favourite, even though Indians considered it highly inadvisable to eat fish in the high heat of summer.

Meal #3

A light tiffin lunch at 1 pm would include grilled fowl perhaps, modest in comparison to the enormous Anglo-Indian breakfasts and dinners. A typical lunch would be European style soup, roast meat, pie, cheese, dessert and wine.

Meal #4

Dinner was vast: mulligatawny soup, ""an overgrown turkey (the fatter the better)...an enormous ham, at the top of the table an enormous sirloin or round of beef, at the bottom a saddle of mutton, legs of the same, boiled and roasted down the side, together with fowls three in a dish, geese, ducks, tongues, humps, pigeon pies...mutton chops and chicken cutlets, devilled bones and stews and curries of any game the sportsmen amongst them had shot during the day.""

Indians adopted many classic dishes of their British masters into their daily life, though more into breakfast and tea, rather than the main meals of lunch and dinner.

Sixty years on, the British have long gone, but the exclusive private clubs of Delhi remain the flag-bearers of Raj-era cuisine and continue to serve classic fare like omelettes, scrambled eggs, liver and kidney for breakfast, baked beans on toast, cucumber sandwiches, club sandwiches, cheese balls, curry puffs, cutlets and chops, chicken a la Kiev, chicken stroganoff and trifle pudding and caramel custard.

The last thing she wants to do is step into the kitchen to start prepping for dinner. ""I felt guilty about ordering in restaurant food every night,"" says Mangal. Before Mangal hired a cook, she used to order Being Chef's ready-to-eat meals often. A year and a half ago, the founder of Being Chef sent her a DIY meal kit. It comes with pre-portioned ingredients such as spices or herbs, oil, pre-cut vegetables as well as partially cooked sauces or base gravy. ""All one needs to do is follow our eight-step recipe card and the meal should be ready in five minutes,"" says Shubham Maheshwari, founder of Being Chef. Now, Mangal orders the DIY kits (mainly pastas and Indian gravies) on weekends when the family wants a special meal or when the cook doesn't turn up.

Mumbai-based physiotherapist, Darsha Daru, 42, who often orders the ready-to-eat meals as well as DIY meal kits from Burgundy Box, likes the fact that she can control the amount of oil and masala that goes into the food. This wouldn't be possible with restaurant-ordered food. ""I order from them when I have guests over as it looks like I have cooked,"" she says.

While Being Chef offers a range of 17-18 vegetarian meal kits ranging from a couple of pasta and Chinese options to biryani and Indian gravies along with half-cooked parathas and kulchas, most other meal kits across cities such as Bengaluru, Mumbai and Chennai offer more gourmet cuisines along with a few Indian dishes thrown in. For Abha Damani, a Mumbai-based entrepreneur who likes to try out different cuisines from the comfort of her home kitchen, meal kits are a great option. ""Since everything is in measured quantities, there's no wastage and it only takes about 20 minutes to put together a meal,"" says the 40-year-old who orders iChef's DIY meal kits about twice a week. Featuring Thai curry, salads, soups, pasta, risotto and regional Indian food, iChef offers a weekly changing menu of 15-18 dishes that are priced at ₹200 onwards for a meal for two. ""If I had to buy these ingredients separately, it would cost a lot more. Also, one ends up chucking expensive ingredients such as cheese or exotic herbs because you don't know what to do with the rest of it,"" Damani adds. Daru, enjoys the fact that she can enjoy restaurant quality food at home at 30-40% cheaper prices.

Ayushe Guha, 24, a public relations professional from Bengaluru, tried her first meal kit about a year ago from Eten, a meal kit delivery service in December 2017. ""I had several meetings on that particular day and no time to go home and cook. I ordered for a spaghetti aglio e olio meal kit. It was delivered in an hour -- the cheese was grated, garlic finely diced and there were fresh basil leaves. It was a joy to cook,"" she says. Guha, who orders kits from Eten on and off, says that the biggest upside is that she doesn't have to run to multiple grocery shops to source hard-to-find ingredients. ""Plus, sometimes, I even ask Eten to customize the box with additional veggies or condiments which is possible if you order in advance,"" she adds.

Most Indian households like those of Damani, Mangal, Daru and Guha have domestic help in the kitchen to do prep work or cook, yet the people who run the meal kit business say that does not compromise the value they bring to the table. Vishal Shah, CEO of iChef, puts it, ""Majority of house help is not qualified to make the kind of dishes in terms of taste profiles that we as consumers have graduated to due to our increasing exposure to different cuisines. What is helping the rapid adoption of our offering is the behavioural change in the psyche of the Indian customer."" After all, ""You do want a change in taste sometimes from what your cook does weekly, otherwise it gets monotonous,"" says Daru.

For others, customized meal kits that cater to certain dietary requirements are a godsend. Chennai-based food consultant Sajan CK, 48, who has diabetes and is on a low-carb keto diet, first turned to Awesome Chef's Nutribowl when he was looking for help with his diet. Nutribowl, which promotes a low carb, high fat diet (LCHF), offers meal kits curated by its founder Anjali Anand who followed the diet herself for eight months before launching the line in mid-2018. ""At home everyone has rotis and rice but I needed low carb options. That's when I heard about the Nutribowl meal kits and decided to subscribe to their one-week meal kit. I was happy with the variety as I got to have keto-friendly zucchini noodles, Thai curry with cauliflower rice and grilled chicken with vegetables,"" he says.

Niche to necessity

While changing lifestyles and exposure to new cuisines is helping spur the growth of the meal kits category, it's still a niche market in India. For this reason, most of the businesses providing meal kits such as Being Chef, Burgundy Box and Awesome Chef have expanded their portfolio -- either offering meal boxes or health-specific requirements. Even Chef's Basket, perhaps, the only pan-Indian brand to offer meal kits, has changed its product line considerably since it launched in 2013. Nipun Katyal, co-founder of Chef's Basket, says, ""We have two sets of customers -- one is the millennial who orders our kits online because they want to try something different and don't want to go through the hassle of doing too much prep work and the other is homemakers who buy these kits from supermarkets for their children.""

While they sell about one lakh units per month, other businesses refused to divulge their turnover. Maheshwari claims that Being Chef's recipe kit category has seen a 30% growth year on year; while Eten sells between 30-50 boxes per day. Shabnam Mehra, co-founder of Burgundy Box, predicts that meal kits will become a necessity in the next 10 years when ""house help becomes scarce or too expensive and more and more people have lesser time or inclination to cook meals from scratch""."

Now CM Kumaraswamy wants the people to help resolve the matter.

Bengaluru: The Karnataka government has been at loggerheads with NGO Akshaya Patra over the question of serving onion and garlic in mid-day meals, and Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy is now ready to take the vexed issue to the people's court.

Speaking to ThePrint, Kumaraswamy said he was ready to open the issue for public debate, and let the people decide whether or not they want the ISKCON-run NGO's onion-and-garlic-free food served to their children.

The Akshaya Patra Foundation, a non-profit organisation, is a midday meal partner of the Karnataka government in five districts -- Bengaluru, Mysuru, Ballari, Hubli and Mangaluru.

The Karnataka State Food Commission conducted a survey of government schools, and found that onion and garlic were absent from the meals served at schools where Akshaya Patra was the providing agency. The panel urged for them to be included to make meals tastier and more nutritious.

Akshaya Patra refused, owing to its belief in the Ayurvedic principle of providing 'sattvic' food -- cooked with organic, vegetarian ingredients. Onion and garlic are considered 'tamasic', that is, items that can trigger lethargy and negative emotions.

Naveena Neerada Dasa, ISKCON's head of strategic communication and projects, told ThePrint that it is Akshaya Patra's ""endeavour to promote good health and nutrition"", and that it ""will continue to follow the prescribed norms set by both the state and central government"".

The state government, meanwhile, began facing pressure from civil rights organisations like the Delhi-based Jan Swasthya Abhiyan and the Right to Food Campaign to cancel its contract with Akshaya Patra. They insist that Akshaya Patra has no right to decide what food has to be served, and cannot impose ""religious diktats"" on a scheme that embodies one's right to food.

The organisations have also spoken about the question of nutrition, though dieticians say onion and garlic only enhance taste -- their nutritional value can easily be replaced by nuts or fibres of different kinds.

Also read: Karnataka civil society groups want govt to dump ISKCON NGO over onion-garlic row

The Union Ministry of Human Resource Development, which oversees the midday meal scheme, does not specify what items are to be provided to children, be it eggs or onion or garlic.

The ministry's guidelines merely state that a primary school child be served food which has a nutritional value of 450 calories -- 12 grams of protein, 100 grams of food grains, 20 grams of pulses, 50 grams of vegetables, 5 grams of oil and fat, and salt and condiments as per need.

For upper primary schoolchildren, the intake is supposed to be 700 calories -- 20 grams of protein, 150 grams of food grains, 30 grams of pulses, 75 grams of vegetables , 7.5 grams of oil and fat, and salt and condiments as per need.

The Karnataka government has been reluctant to cancel its contract with Akshaya Patra, since the midday meal scheme has helped increase the number of admissions in government schools.

It seems to have decided that the only way this matter can be resolved is if it is opened to public debate, rather than be coerced to take a decision based on the observations of civil rights organisations.

Kumaraswamy has now decided to seek the opinion of various stakeholders, including school teachers, headmasters, food scientists and dieticians, on whether there is an absolute need to add onion and garlic in the food that is being served.

""The question we are raising is whether it would cause any major deficiencies to children if (onion and garlic) are not added to their midday meals. We will be able to take an informed stand only after we receive adequate information on it,"" said Kumaraswamy.

""We will ask food experts, doctors and nutritionists on these aspects, and then take a decision. Let's not rush into any decision.""

While this controversy rages, officials at the Department of Primary and Secondary Education have come up with a new idea to bypass the onion-garlic question and yet enhance children's diet.

Preliminary discussions are on to add fruits to the menu, so that children can have a well-rounded meal.

Sources in the department also said the Mysuru-based Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) has been asked to analyse the nutritional value of onion and garlic, and find if there are alternative fruits or vegetables that can provide the same nutrition."

As per the preliminary discussions going on in the department, seasonal fruits could be served every day or every alternate day to the children. Officials say this idea emerged after questions were raised over the Akshaya Patra Foundation excluding garlic and onion in the food preparations, for which the department issued the non-profit organisation a notice.

The department has now written to the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), seeking information on the nutritional value added by garlic and onion in the meal, and which food, vegetable or fruit can replace that.

""Once we receive the reply, the final decision will be taken about introducing fruit in the menu,"" a senior official said.

Akshaya Patra Foundation is also positive about providing fruit to the students. Naveena Neerada Dasa, head, Strategic Communication and Projects, said, ""In Hyderabad and Telangana, we already follow the practice of giving fruit with the meal.""

NO INSTRUCTIONS on EGGs and FRUITS

The guidelines issued by the Ministry for Human Resource Development on the mid-day meal scheme do not have specific instructions or preference about fruits, egg, onion or garlic. It specifies 50 gm rice per student of a primary school, and 100 gm rice for each high school student, while laying down the need to provide carbohydrate and protein in the meal."

Their show of unity came amid getting together for an anti-BJP front at swearing-in ceremonies of Kamal Nath, Sachin Pilot, Ashok Gehlot and Bhupesh Baghel in MP, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh though both Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav stayed away despite offering unconditional support to Congress in MP and Rajasthan .

The leaders, including two-time Tamkuhi Raj Congress MLA Ajay Kumar Lallu, BSP's Lalji Verma and Mohd Iqbal of Samajwadi Party held their brief meeting over recent farmer suicides in UP as well as killing of a cop and civilian in Bulandshahr following violent outrage by cow activists over cow carcasses on December 3.

The UP Police has been trying to contain damage by arresting more than 17 accused in the violence but three Bajrang Dal leaders, including main accused Yogesh Raj, are still at large.

During their talks with CM Yogi Adityanath and parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Khanna, the three parties repeated their demands to either extend the session to complete the scheduled 90 sittings or allow debate on Rs 31,000 crore pending dues for sugarcane farmers.

Besides, they also raised the issue of 13 farmer who allegedly committed suicide between June and November, including three last week in Bulandshahr. Staring at glut, the potato growers in UP are seeking a MSP regime as they continue to dumping their old produce on the roads in the absence of buyers.

""It's an every day phenomenon. UP government should take up the issue of lifting ban on potato export with the Centre so that they get better remuneration for their produce or introduce a fixed price,"" said Ajay Kumar Lallu

The UP government has been mulling to purchase potato and may direct schools to use more potato in the mid-day meal. The Yogi government is expected to table two amendments in Water and Sewage Act and Good and Services Tax (GST) on the fourth day of the session."
