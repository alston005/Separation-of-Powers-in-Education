The move has drawn flak from opposition parties that said the government should rather work towards improving the ""deteriorating quality of education"".

As per notifications issued on Monday (December 31) by the Directorate of Primary Education and Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB), students of class 1-12 of the government, grant-in-aid and self-financed schools will have to respond to attendance call with 'Jai Hind' or 'Jai Bharat', starting January 1.

The first two weeks of the drive, to begin on January 16, is for students up till the age of 15. According to a Directorate of Education (DoE) circular dated December 19, 2018, since the MR campaign is a central government policy, no consent is required from beneficiaries and their parents. A December 24 circular on the same states: ""For vaccination sessions in educational institutes/schools, teachers and parents will play a key role in ensuring that targeted students are well informed and immunised during the campaign.""

Teachers have been told to be part of the vaccination teams, along with the designated health workers, and to create awareness and sensitisation regarding the vaccine among students and parents in all government, government-aided and unaided recognised schools in Delhi. However, some teachers have expressed their discomfort about being placed at the forefront of the drive. ""I have been asked to tell parents that this vaccine is safe when I myself do not know enough about this. We are trained as teachers, not health functionaries.

Without training and knowledge, how can we tell parents that it is alright?"" said a teacher at a North MCD school. ""There is a certain level of trust that parents have in us, and we are recognisable faces in this exercise. If, by any chance, something happens, they will turn to us. They should use schools and classrooms for administering the campaign, if they must, but not us teachers,"" the teacher added. A teacher at a private school also said she was uncomfortable convincing parents about this.

""I am not convinced that this campaign is essential, and we have read many news reports of children falling ill after receiving the vaccine in Maharashtra and Gujarat.

But many students and parents have also voiced their reluctance and I am expected to placate them without information or conviction,"" she said, adding that teachers in her school had not yet received any kind of orientation about the vaccination.

Director of Education Sanjay Goel said, ""We have not received any complaint or experienced resistance from any school so far. As for orientation, one nodal officer per school -- who might be a part of the teaching or non-teaching staff -- is receiving the same as the vaccine is being administered by a health functionary."""

The corporation plans to carry out a trial for one month before officially hiring these agencies.

The agencies will help resident welfare associations and other bulk generators like hotels, schools and other institutions, devise a mechanism for segregation at source, and composting at the community levels. During the one-month period beginning in January, MCG officials will assess the composting units set up by the agencies.

""We will be assessing the machinery in terms of electricity consumed in proportion to the waste processed and the quality of compost produced, against set standards,"" said an MCG official. Additionally, officials will also monitor calorific value of the output products other than compost, and if they can be sent to the landfill to be used in the waste-to-energy plant.

The one-month project will be carried out in Sector 45, Sector 15 Part 2, community centre and Huda park in Sector 56, and Chakkarpur, Chauma and Nathupur villages. The agencies shortlisted for the project are Smart Enviro Private Limited, Clean India Ventures Private Limited, Waste Management Corporation, SMS Hydrotech, and Excel Industries Limited.

According to MCG officials, around 25 residential societies across the city segregate and compost garbage at the community level. ""If we take into consideration all residential societies in the city, just 25 of them composting waste at the community level is a low number,"" an MCG official said. While residents have shown enthusiasm for community composting, adoption of the practice slowed down after the government appointed Ecogreen Energy Private Limited for solid waste management and withdrew financial support to RWAs for setting up composting units.

In September, the NGT imposed a penalty of Rs 2.5 lakh on Ecogreen for not following its direction and carrying out proper waste segregation and treatment at Bandhwari. Three months later, MCG imposed a penalty of Rs 6.38 crore on the firm for non-performance.

While MCG is still not providing any financial support to societies for setting up community-level composting plants, they have decided to guide bulk garbage generators through these agencies. ""To encourage bulk generators to adopt segregation at source and composting as good practices, the corporation will buy the compost at Rs 5 per kg,"" an official said.

Environmentalists and green activists, who have been pushing for decentralised waste segregation and treatment rather than sending the waste to the Bandhwari waste treatment plant, are expected to welcome the move."

Right-wing nationalist Jair Bolsonaro, who has vowed to crack down on political corruption, violent crime and ignite a moribund economy with deregulation and fiscal discipline, will be sworn in as Brazil's president on January 1.

The former Army captain and seven-term fringe congressman rode a wave of anti-establishment anger to became Brazil's first far-right president since a military dictatorship gave way to civilian rule three decades ago.

Bolsonaro plans to realign Brazil internationally, moving away from developing nation allies and closer to the policies of Western leaders, particularly US President Donald Trump, who sent Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to his inauguration.

As a clear sign of that diplomatic shift, Bolsonaro plans to move the Brazilian embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, breaking with Brazil's traditional support for a two-state solution to the Palestinian issue.

Crowds of supporters, many with the Brazilian flag draped around their shoulders and with faces painted yellow and green, the national colors, gathered before the Planalto palace, where later the presidential sash will be draped on Bolsonaro.

Backed massively by conservative sectors of Brazil, including Christian evangelical churches, Bolsonaro would block moves to legalize abortion beyond even the current limited exceptions and remove sex education from public schools, opposing what he calls ""cultural Marxism"" introduced by recent leftist governments.

One-third of his cabinet are former army officers, mostly fellow cadets at the Black Needles academy, Brazil's West Point, all outspoken backers of the country's 1964-1985 military regime.

Bolsonaro, 63, has faced charges of inciting rape and for hate crimes because of comments about women, gays and racial minorities. Yet his law-and-order rhetoric and plans to ease gun controls have resonated with many voters, especially in Brazil's booming farm country.

In an interview with Record TV on the eve of his inauguration, Bolsonaro lashed out at Brazil's notorious bureaucracy, which makes doing business in the country difficult and expensive. He vowed to strip away the so-called ""Brazil Cost"" that hamstrings private enterprise.

""The government machine is really heavy,"" he said. ""There are hundreds of bureaucratic governing bodies across Brazil, of regulators as well. ... We have to untangle the mess.""

His vow to follow Trump's example and pull Brazil out of the Paris Agreement on climate change has worried environmentalists. So have his plans to build hydroelectric dams in the Amazon and open up to mining the reservations of indigenous peoples who are seen as the last custodians of the world's biggest forest.

Brazilian businesses are eager to see Bolsonaro take office and install a team of orthodox economists led by investment banker Paulo Guedes, who has promised quick action in bringing Brazil's unsustainable budget deficit under control.

Guedes plans to sell as many state companies as possible in a privatization drive that he forecasts could eventually bring in up to 1 trillion reais ($257 billion).

That would help restore order to government finances. The key measure, however, for reducing the deficit and stopping a dangerous rise of Brazil's public debt will be the overhaul of the country's costly social security pension system.

Pension reform will be Bolsonaro's biggest challenge since he has yet to build a base in Congress, where he has eschewed the political horse-trading that has traditionally helped Brazilian presidents govern the nation of nearly 210 million people.

Bolsonaro may find that lax protection of the environment and human rights could have negative economic effects, more so than those faced by other far-right leaders, given the spotlight on Brazil's Amazon jungle as a protection against global warming and because the country has more murders than any other nation.

""I think they will be good on the economy and they will probably be bad for human rights and the environment,"" said Brian Winter, vice president for policy at the Americas Society and Council of the Americas in New York.""The key question is whether those things can be separated. Most of Wall Street says 'Yes.' I have my doubts."""

V Rishi Kumar reports

The year 2019 may prove to be the inflection point for green building movement and energy efficiency that could lead to India being a green champion in the future.

Driving the green dream in a big way is the CII-Indian Green Building Council formed in the IT hub of Hyderabad in 2000-01, with the country's first platinum-rated centre of 20,000 sq ft coming up in 2003-04. By incorporating various standards and codes besides applying best practices, the Council has evolved rating systems for a number of sectors.

During the recent Green Building Congress, the Council introduced new rating systems, including 'net zero energy building rating systems', and for green resorts and green hill habitats. The net zero energy rating assesses buildings that are self-sufficient in energy -- their energy requirement is met through their own generating system, be it solar or wind.

With modern buildings, particularly, needing cooling and heating systems, this rating system is expected to play a big role in addressing greenhouse gas emissions. While green buildings consume 25-30 per cent less energy, this has potential to be further brought down, say experts.

As the Council targets a green building footprint of 10 billion sq ft by the year 2022 when India will be @75 years of Independence, if the current pace of growth is anything to go by, this target may be achieved ahead of schedule.

Says V Suresh, Chairman, Indian Green Building Council (IGBC), ""The green building movement is on an upward spiral. Our rating systems cover buildings of all asset classes, from campuses to smart cities, urban mobility and metros and even green villages. Special thrust is being given towards 'green homes' -- with about 14 lakh homes and green footprint of 1.76 billion sq ft, covering residential units of all income categories, including affordable houses.""

This growth would not have been possible without the involvement of various stakeholders working towards a shared vision.

S Raghupathy, CII Deputy Director General, who has been spearheading the movement ever since the IGBC was created, says, ""Projects from Jammu to Andaman, Surat to Shillong have adopted green ratings. The ratings have touched the lives of people from all sections of society, be it residents of rated green homes, students in green schools, commuters travelling through green metros, railways stations and airports, workers in green offices and factories or the common citizens living in green townships and green cities.""

With 25 ratings launched thus far by the IGBC, covering residential, commercial, industrial, healthcare, railways, campuses, townships and cities, there has also been significant movement in retrofitting and transforming older homes and properties.

Niranjan Hiranandani, President, Naredco, says, ""In the uber-luxury segment of premium residential real estate, home buyers support measures that are less polluting or restrict damage to the environment -- they are okay with the additional spend on a 'green' residential building.""

These buildings not only improve the environment and ecology, but can reduce energy consumption by 20-30 per cent, water usage by 30-50 per cent and significantly reduce waste generation by extensive recycling. With an estimated 5 per cent of Indian construction following the Green Building norms, there is definitely scope for future expansion and growth.

The government has come up with some guidelines that result in savings as regards land revenue, so that is an additional sweetener to prod those planning new projects to opt for a green building.

""The customer profile in residential real estate is changing, where the 'new buyer' segment -- the Millennials -- want homes that include some aspects of 'green buildings.' They ensure that developers focus on eco-friendly buildings,"" Hiranandani says.

It is not just about construction methodology and building material usage but also enhancing the quality of life, for those who opt for such facilities.

C. Sekhar Reddy, former national president of Credai, explains, ""What started with zero has now grown to 25 ratings. The number of accredited professionals has gone up to 3,000 and efforts are on to take this up to 10,000. We have barely touched the tip of the pyramid, now the focus is on expanding and reaching out to the bottom of the pyramid.""

""The foundation has been laid and now the Council has chapters in 22 States. Not only States, a number of cities, including smart cities such as Dolera, and the upcoming greenfield city of Amaravati are keen to develop into green cities,"" says Reddy.

Aiding the green city push is a rapidly growing pool of GreenPro rated products, whose number has swelled to over 500, accounting for about 60 per cent of the cost of construction, excluding land and labour. The target is to take this to 90-100 per cent of the construction cost,"" says Reddy.

The cost differential, which was about 18 per cent in 2003 with payback of 5-8 years, for a green building, has now come down to 1-3 per cent with 2-3 years payback.

While the green building movement is driven by the private sector thus far, in a voluntary mode, there is need for proactive support from the Centre and States to provide further impetus by considering some direct concessions to GreenPro-rated building products.

Secondly, buildings that have already gone green or are in the process may be offered municipal tax concessions so that they get incentivised.

""One of the things that States could do is encourage usage of GreenPro rated products so that they get mainstream faster and people are spurred to use them. Smart Cities will not happen unless they have green buildings,"" Reddy says.

And if States too pitch in with some innovative policy initiatives, the green building movement could be accelerated, he explains.

All in all, the country has been making steady progress towards energy-efficiency in construction.

What started with commercial buildings and factories has gradually gained acceptance in residential projects. It is estimated that a million sq ft of green building could save up to 12,000 tonnes of CO2, save about 15,000 MWh of energy, 45,000 KL of water and help in diverting 450 tonnes of construction waste for land fills.

Not surprisingly, we now have more than 12,50,000 dwelling units, over 250 plus green factories, more than 16,000 green offices, 45-plus green townships, several green villages and green cities.

Facilities of Hindustan Zinc, hospitality projects, ITC Green centre in Gurgaon, Suzlon One Earth in Pune, for instance, have demonstrated how they could bring down energy consumption.

Be it corporates or individuals, going energy-efficient adds to the overall happiness index. Imagine not having to worry about monthly power bills or sudden blackouts, thanks to one's own solar energy/wind systems."

""Half of them were Dalit and Tribal students, and a majority of them were boys. Reportedly, all, except seven, were suicides by hanging, and the bodies were discovered either by classmates or members of the school staff. The JNVs are reported to be the central government's pace-setting residential schools for the talented children from rural India,"" the NHRC said in its release.

The Commission has observed that the contents of the media report, if true, cannot be ignored or overlooked as this reported pattern of suicides by so many students in JNVs might still increase, if not checked in time with appropriate measures.

Expressing serious concern over the report, the commission issued a notice to the Secretary, Union Ministry of Human Resource Development and called for certain information within six weeks.

The commission sought to know whether trained counselors were available in the campus to whom the adolescent students could open up and talk about their feelings.

It also asked if there was a dedicated staff to ensure that the children were not left alone in the rooms.

NHRC also asked whether emergency assistance through telephone counseling and suicide hotline services were available to the students.

The Commission has further observed that the intelligent students with a rural background are entrusted to the care of JNVs. They are the strength and future of this country. The proportion of the suicides of the students from the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities is also a matter of concern for the society.

""Teenagers may often get confused and develop a feeling of being isolated. It is also a matter of fact, that many suicides are committed by the people, who are depressed and are not able to cope up with stress. As per the medical science, the suicidal tendencies don't just appear out of the blue, people usually display a number of warning signs. If trained counselors are available, behavioral changes, suicidal tendencies and depression among the students can be spotted in time and with the guidance and counseling of counselors, suicides can be controlled,"" the NHRC said.

According to the media report, carried on the December 24, 2018, the JNVs, which were started in 1985-86, have become a passport out of poverty for thousands of underprivileged children. Since 2012, these schools have consistently recorded a pass percentage of over 99 per cent in Class 10 and over 95 per cent in Class 12, which is far better than private schools and CBSE's national average.

The news report revealed that according to norms, at least 75 per cent of the seats in these schools are set aside for rural children. Hence, a JNV is never sanctioned for a district with 100 per cent urban population.

A Navodaya Vidyalaya starts from Class 6 and goes up to Class 12. All admissions in Class 6 are done through a merit test. The popularity of JNVs is evident from the fact that less than 3 per cent of the candidates appearing for the entrance test every year make the cut.

The news report also revealed that 41 out of 46 JNVs are facing a serious challenge. The report further revealed that there are 635 JNVs with 2.8 lakh students. A total of 2.53 lakh students in the age group of nine to 19 were enrolled across roughly 600 JNVs for the year 2017. That same year, the number of suicides touched 14. The news report revealed that the suicide rate that is per population of 1,00,000 at JNVs for 2017 works out to 5.5. (ANI)"

The results can decide the future of the AIADMK government, which currently has a slender majority in the House. The long overdue local body polls may also be conducted this year

Water is running out

The State is facing a massive water shortage this year, with a wide deficit in monsoon rainfall in 2018. Experts feel that the impending water crisis this summer will be far more acute than the one felt in 2017. Currently, there's only 20 per cent water in all four reservoirs combined. This is four times less than levels recorded in 2017.

Tamil Nadu sans plastic

After years of lobbying, the State has finally taken a bold decision to ban single-use plastic items such as plastic cups, plates and sheets. Implementation and public participation this year will make or break this eco-friendly measure which could reduce the amount of waste that reaches the landfill. Tamil Nadu, if all goes well, could set a model of sustainable business and living for the rest of India

A home for all?

In a bid to provide 12.94 lakh affordable homes in the State, Tamil Nadu will be unveiling its Urban Housing and Habitat Policy this year. It will be seeking large-scale private sector participation by offering incentives. The policy is being prepared with the help of the German development agency GIZ and Ernst and Young

CZR regulations relaxation

The recent relaxation of Coastal Zone Regulation by the Centre will have a big impact on Tamil Nadu and its coastline. A lot more development activity can be expected on sea-facing properties as the 'No Development Zone' has been reduced from 200metre to the 50-metre distance from the coast. While the tourism sector can expect a boost, concerns of coastal erosion and sea level rise have increased

Sterlite is back

Vedanta's Sterlite Copper unit, which was in the middle of a controversy that led to the death of 13 protestors, is all set to reopen in 2019. The company, which faced massive public backlash for alleged environmental pollution, will be building hospitals, schools and other amenities worth Rs 100 crore in Thoothukudi to make up for violations"

The country did very well in sports. The Indian Cricket team stands on the cusp of winning a series in Australia for the first time in decades. In badminton and boxing, we are clearly making our mark. It was not bad in business although a couple of serious mistakes could have been avoided. The judiciary gave us the odd jolt, but managed to gain balance and poise as the year came to an end. There were truly ugly incidents in which mindless violence was perpetrated by those who claim to protect the cow, calling themselves gorakshaks. Lynching by unruly mobs became the order of the day and killing police officers by pelting stones was carried on with impunity.

Political leaders continued to behave the way they have been doing for some years. They were selfish, narrow minded, communal and anti-people with a sane voice coming across rarely. Nothing to celebrate in education and health from which the governments have been withdrawing, leaving the fate of the poor and underprivileged youngsters in the hands of shabbily run government schools while allowing the private and corporate schools to exploit the middle-class, upper middle-class and the rich. The standards of education in private schools are not being monitored by government officials. There is no mechanism to fix the fees. The same is the case with private hospitals where there is no standard rate card enforced by the governments. Most of the developments in education and health take place without the involvement of the government. It is in the political arena, one saw havoc being played by mischievous, manipulative and selfish politicians. The Constitution is not respected. Even decisions that have to be taken by governments or legislature were left to the courts. The anti-defection law has been flouted at will with no constitutional authority questioning the habitual offenders.

Modi loser, Rahul no gainer

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has lost two allies in Chandrababu Naidu's TDP in AP and Upendra Kushwaha's RLSP in Bihar. The BJP had to concede the Lok Sabha seats it won in 2014 in Bihar to ally with JD(U) to contest in 2019, in order to keep the belligerent Nitish Kumar in the alliance. Ram Vilas Paswan, the cleverest politician in the country, has got six LS seats for contesting in the forthcoming elections and one Rajya Sabha seat in the hard bargain he drove with BJP president Amit Shah. The Modi-Shah duo is struggling to retain its edge in UP and Bihar while regaining the confidence of the people of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh which it lost recently to the Congress. Consolidation of the Hindu vote has always been the trick the BJP depended upon since Advani's Rath-Yatra days.

It is not out of love for Muslim women or respect for their rights that the BJP has been making a lot of noise about passing the Triple Talaq Bill. The argument that this was a ploy to divide the Muslim votes through winning the female voters by championing their cause is unfounded. It is unlikely that Muslim women would defy their men and vote for the saffron party despite the lynching by Gorakshaks and the feeling that minorities are treated as second-rate citizens. The idea is that the Hindu zealots would be happy if the Muslim women are empowered as against men. The Hindus think that only a party like the BJP can deal with the Muslims in a stern manner by bringing about a Bill like this. This notion will help consolidate the Hindu votes.

The BJP leaders are aware that it is not possible to win over the minorities or Dalits at this point in time. The winning mantra would be consolidating the Hindus by impressing them through strong, but sensible policy from the viewpoint of human rights, measures against the Muslim community and revival of the movement to build Ram Mandir at Ayodhya. The Congress party would further get alienated from the Hindu community by stalling the passage of Triple Talaq Bill in Rajya Sabha. The subtle argument put forward by the Congress leaders that it is better to refer to a select committee would not convince the Hindus.

Two Telugu Titans Fight It Out

The Enforcement Directorate informed the highest court in the land that the alleged middleman in VVIP chopper, Augusta Westland, deal, Christian Michel, named Sonia Gandhi and a son of an Italian lady (meaning Rahul) as beneficiaries of the kickbacks. AK Antony, a senior Congress leader known for his integrity and defence minister in 2008, had made it clear that the Gandhis never interfered in the deal while Amit Shah and Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis asked Rahul Gandhi to tender an apology to the nation. Rahul flatly refused and continued to say that Modi has been a chowkidar who indulged in theft (Chowkidar Chor Hai) by putting Rs 30,000 crore in the pocket of Anil Ambani, a known defaulter who never produced anything connected to a fighter aircraft in his life, in the Rafale deal. Augusta and Rafale will surely be the main weapons in the battle of ballot in April-May slug-fest which is hardly four months away. Allegations and counter-allegations have marred the debate in the parliament once again. If political parties don't reconsider their strategies in parliament and make a healthy debate possible, the meaning of parliamentary democracy would be lost. We will be reduced to a system of democracy where only elections matter. One has to spend and win elections and then earn more than what was spent making it a vicious circle. All eyes are on Modi and Shah who are expected to use all tricks in their bag to stall the Congress and retain power for another term. While the popularity graph of Modi is falling steeply, the profile of his rival Rahul Gandhi has not been on the ascendant either.

This state of no-winner and no-loser has been manifest in the results of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. The Congress could not win a simple majority against the BJP which has been in power continuously for fifteen years suggesting that while the BJP is losing, the Congress is not gaining. This paradox has given scope to regional satraps like K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) to fancy a role for themselves in national politics and entertain unlimited dreams of sitting in the loftiest chair by mobilising other non-Congress, non-BJP parties and drawing them into the so-called Federal Front. Chandrababu Naidu, TDP chief and chief minister of AP, is not one to lag behind. He also declared his intentions that he would cobble up a front that includes the Congress party. The two Telugu titans are flexing their muscles to fight it out in Delhi to have a final say in the formation of the national government after the general elections in 2019. Which Telugu leader has the guts and wits to make a mark on the national scene is the question engaging the attention of the nation, not just the two Telugu States. That way, 2019 is the most crucial year for Modi and Rahul with KCR and Chandrababu Naidu playing their own games in the lobbies."

Every year, authorities here announce the closure of schools with the onset of winter in the first week of December.

Closure of schools during winters becomes inevitable here given the very low temperatures and poor infrastructure of our schools which hinders the continuity of academic activities because these institutions San any kind of heating arrangements. Had been our schools equipped with proper heating arrangements, the long winter breaks could have been avoided.

That is not the case here. It will take us hundreds of years to develop our institutions on those lines. If authorities are really sincere enough to elevate our educational standards then such steps and measures should be kept in pipeline for coming future.

Traditionally, Kashmiri parents would arrange tutors for their children to overcome the academic deficit of winters. Some two decades back, winter tuition was preferably carried out in the homes of teachers or qualified unemployed youth. But, now, the concept of private coaching centers has revolutionized the concept of winter tutioning.

This coaching has become a big industry in our valley. I won't talk here about the role and contribution of these coaching centers but I would definitely talk about low access of poor children to these centres. Authorities had probably recognized the fact, and winter tutorials were made operational at selective schools, particularly during the last winter. The move of authorities was hailed by one and all particularly by the parents of the poor children.

Government schoolTeachers were deputed to teach at these centres which had been instrumental in the academic prosperity of the student community. Last year, I was part of such a winter tutorial where many hundred students of our own village and the children of adjacent of villages were taken care off.It had minimized the academic deficit of winters in our schools.

This winter, all the parents and children were waiting for such centres to be made operational. Many parents were in close touch with me for the winter tutioning of their wards. Even I too was anticipating an order in this regard but, alas ! Authorities have either linked the future of our children with unemployment or with the additional remuneration of teachers deputed at these centres. Bizzare and tragic ! The incumbent authorities should have appreciated and acknowledged the teachers deputed at these centres. Remuneration should have been increased.Even Authorities could have made it mandatory for teachers to work in these centres.

No, the case is not so. Teachers have been removed from the assignment. The children of lesser God are waiting for a compassionate direction from authorities but their wish will remain a wish only. Authorities have off late decided to run a few coaching centers in some higher secondary schools but to the utter resentment and surprise of parents, these centres are yet to be made operational. One-third part of the vacations is over. There is no clue of the people who are supposed to teach in these centres. The proposed centre at higher secondary school Naidkhai is just a kilometre away from my residence, and believe me, there is no one to teach the children.Many children from my own neighborhood are repeatedly asking me if the said centre will be made functional or not.

I can't reply them with authority. I wonder if authorities are really sincere enough to elevate our educational standards. I pity the plight of these children who are unconsciously wasting their precious time, playing with glass pebbles or marbles in the streets and alleys of villages.These children are supposed to assume the chairs of teachers, engineers and doctor of our nation. Who is jeopardizing the future of these children and the collective future of our society? Let people open their eyes.

Let people at the helm of affairs revisit their plans and policies. Don't link the education of children with unemployment or money. Let parents know that teachers are hapless to impart the education to their children.

After vacations, the teachers are blamed for all the mess in the department.When children remain out of touch with their books, how can they do well after the reopening of the schools in the March. Children are roaming like sheep and there is no one to take care of them. I don't want monetary benefits for everything. Let authorities force teachers to teach at these centres. I will be the first to volunteer myself for the cause. I hope most of the teachers of our department will turn up as volunteers but at least issue a simple order. Let you bell the cat and I guarantee people that our teachers will not give you any opportunity of complaint. I request parents and the respectable citizens of our society to stop blaming teachers alone. Let people at the helm be made accountable. Intellectuals and respected citizens of our nation must come forward for the rescue of our innocent children. Teachers are ready to face any kind of challenge lest you should test their potential.We are not lazy and shirkers but we lack a proper platform."

""The MSP for the progressive and traditional varieties of sugarcane has been fixed at Rs 327 per quintal and Rs 317 per quintal, respectively,"" Kaushik said.

""The minimum support price fixed for both varieties is Rs 2 higher than what is being paid to sugarcane farmers in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh,"" he said.

The cabinet also gave its nod to the amendment in police rules proposing salary hikes of policemen who were ""directly appointed or promoted"" post 2006.

""These relaxations have been granted following the cabinet nod to a proposal for amendment in housing construction and development by-laws,"" he said, adding all related relaxations would also be applicable to the foothill areas.

""It is a category, which was included following recent amendments introduced in the housing construction and development by-laws,"" he said referring to the foothill areas.

Giving details, he said the relaxations introduced in the amended rules would be applicable for construction of residential group housing, affordable housing, housing for the Economically Weaker Sections, commercial units and single commercial offices. Construction of multiplexes with single screens, malls with multiplexes, service apartments, wedding points, hotels, motels, guest houses run by individuals, hostels and hospitals etc. had also been brought under the purview of the amended rules.

Construction of affordable housing, for instance, Kaushik said would now be permitted in a 2,000 square metre area instead of the earlier provision of 4,000 square metre area.

Similarly, new rules specify that minimum 1,000 square metre area would be needed for granting permission for construction of housing complexes for the EWS category. ""Such projects were hampered owing to the ambiguity in rules relating to the land required for the purpose,"" the minister said."

If trained counsellors are available, behavioural changes, suicidal tendencies and depression among students can be spotted in time, and with guidance and counselling, suicides can be controlled, it observed.

""According to the media report, carried on the December 24, the JNVs, started in 1985-86, have become a passport out of poverty for thousands of underprivileged children. ""Since 2012, these schools have consistently recorded a pass percentage of over 99 per cent in Class 10 and over 95 per cent in Class 12, which is far better than private schools and CBSE's national average,"" the NHRC statement said.

The news report also ""reveals that 41 out of 46 JNVs are facing a serious challenge"" and that there are ""635 JNVs with 2.8 lakh students"".

""A total of 2.53 lakh students in the age group of 9 to 19 were enrolled across roughly 600 JNVs for the year 2017. That same year, the number of suicides touched 14.

For many students, it also led to loss of their precious documents. In this environment of despair, there was a welcome announcement. As a special gesture to students from CBSE affiliated schools, whose board exam academic documents such as marksheets, migration certificates, pass certificates were lost or damaged in the Kerala floods, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) decided to facilitate and provide digital mark sheets, migration certificates and pass certificates, made possible due to the integration with DigiLocker. With over 1,300 schools are affiliated to the CBSE in Kerala, this was a significant step as board exam academic documents are crucial for admission for higher studies and employment. This announcement also showed India the importance of electronic storing and validation of documents.

Targeted at the idea of paperless governance, DigiLocker was created as an electronic platform for issuance and verification of documents and certificates in a digital way, thus eliminating the use of physical documents. Organisations that are registered with Digital Locker can push electronic copies of documents and certificates (e.g. driving license, Voter ID, School certificates) directly into citizens lockers. Citizens can also upload scanned copies of their legacy documents in their accounts. These legacy documents can be electronically signed using the eSign facility.

As part of the Indian Tech Leaders Series, we are honoured to bring you the views of Amit Ranjan, Architect, National DigiLocker Project (National eGov Division, Ministry of IT, GoI) who shares the key aspects that were considered while building DigiLocker, the role of open source, and his future vision for DigiLocker

As the CTO / key architect of DigiLocker, what are some of the key aspects that you have kept in mind while designing the platform for scalability?

DigiLocker is a key Digital India initiative for paperless governance and its goal is to create a nationwide federated document exchange network operating across the public and private space. Accordingly, scalability has been one of the key design principles for the project right from the inception stage. The selection of technology and architecture was made in a way that would allow the platform to scale vertically and horizontally. The platform uses concepts like Open APIs, microservices based architecture, cloud storage, caching etc. to achieve this goal.

The partners which integrate with DigiLocker as ""Issuers"" host their data (or documents) individually on their own servers, without any centralised aggregation, thus reducing the risks that may be associated with a single point of failure.

The project was divided into phases with realistic targets. The phases provided concrete goals in terms of key metrics like anticipated number of users of the platform, file storage parameters, database performance etc. Additionally, the infrastructure is constantly monitored, adjusted and fine-tuned with every major release. Scaling an application isn't a one-time activity, but a dynamic, continuing process that needs constant changes and iterations in architecture and solutions used. The technology and product teams running DigiLocker are in a constantly learning mode to face the unique challenges that come up with every stage of the fast-growing platform's evolution.

How important is open source to the overall development and design of DigiLocker?

DigiLocker runs almost exclusively on open source technologies. This is in line with (MeitY) Ministry of Electronics & IT's policy of encouraging open source with a view to promote reuse, reduce cost, invoke community participation and allow peer review. Open source promotes innovation by giving the freedom to try, test and scale your solution, one step at a time. An additional advantage of using open source over proprietary solutions in a government set-up, is reduced time cycles due to absence of RFPs, tendering etc.

DigiLocker is based on open source programming languages like PHP, Python and Node.js. On the server front, it uses Apache, Nginx, MemCache, databases like MongoDB & MariaDB, file systems like GlusterFS etc. The DigiLocker user application (DigiLocker portal) is based on an open source application called OwnCloud. OwnCloud is a very popular solution globally for building open sourced, cloud based, document management systems. DigiLocker with over 15 million users, is the world's largest OwnCloud installation. The DigiLocker team is in constant touch with OwnCloud's open source developer community for feedback and constant iterative learning.

In your view, what are some of the major areas/functions on which DigiLocker has made a major impact in the country? Can you cite some examples?

DigiLocker's impact can be gauged from the fact that it has digitised 294 crore citizen documents and made it available on a user-friendly cloud application that be accessed across web and mobile devices. 64 issuers comprising government and private organizations have been integrated with DigiLocker; prominent amongst them are UIDAI (for eAadhaar), Ministry of Transport (for digital driving licenses & vehicle registrations), Income Tax Department (for PAN verification records), Ministry of Petroleum (for LPG subscription vouchers), CBSE (for Std X & XII marksheets and certificates), NSDC (for skill certificates), eDistrict applications of 13 state governments, secondary education boards of 12 states (for school marksheets and certificates) etc. Citizens have started using DigiLocker in ways that make their lives simpler and paperless.

Here are some notable examples:

* Thousands of citizens are showing their DigiLocker driving license and registration certificates to traffic policemen everydaywhen stopped on the road

* Railway passengers are showing DigiLocker's digital documents to ticket collectors for identity verification

* CBSE announced Std X & XII board results in May 2018; on that day itself, digital marksheets of students was made available to them in their DigiLocker accounts

* Many Fintech startups into consumer lending have integrated with DigiLocker for digitally verifying loan applicants in a few minutes (versus hours or days earlier)

* After the recent Kerala floods, where over a million state residents have lost their identity documents, the state government is working with DigiLocker for reissuing of digital documents directly into citizens' DigiLocker accounts to safeguard against a natural calamity occurring again. So overall one can say that DigiLocker's usage is growing, though a lot more needs to be done.

Your future vision for DigiLocker

DigiLocker's vision falls under the ambit of the Digital India mission to transform India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy. The goal of the project is to provide to all Indian citizensa digital platform for paperless services, that they can use in their daily lives. In many ways, the project is ""competing with paper"" through the use of innovative technology.

The entire ecosystem of paper - from its creation, to printing, to storing, transferring and verifying it is slow, inconvenient, wasteful, corruption inducing, besides being unfriendly to the environment. We think DigiLocker can be a transformative game-changer here and make the lives of Indian citizens simpler and more convenient than before. It will also lead to reduced bureaucracy, result in massive cost savings and usher in a new era of technology enabled governance.

Class 10 students in Kashmir's Pulwama & Shopian districts excelled with highest pass percentage, even though schools there were closed for more than 100 days.

New Delhi: Community schooling and continuous efforts by the locals is what led to excellent Class 10 results in south Kashmir's Pulwama and Shopian districts, the most disturbed region in the Kashmir Valley last year, say local residents and students.

The Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education (JKBOSE) announced the Class 10 results for Kashmir division on Saturday, and Pulwama and Shopian districts in south Kashmir recorded the highest pass percentage. While Pulwama recorded a pass percentage of 84.5 per cent, the pass percentage in Shopian was 83 per cent. Both these figures are higher than that of Srinagar, which recorded a pass percentage of 81.9 per cent.

The overall pass percentage in Kashmir this year was 75.44, compared to 62.94 last year.

According to the state government data, in 2018, schools in Pulwama district were shut for 170 days and, in Shopian they were closed for 118 days by the administration due to fear of disturbance. This shutdown was apart from the number of regular holidays that the students got.

During the 2016 unrest in Kashmir following the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani, 32 school buildings were burnt and most of them were in south Kashmir. In 2017, the HRD Ministry had devised a roadmap for Kashmir to improve the education scenario in the state. Construction of school buildings was also a part of the ministry's plan. However, no construction has happened so far in Pulwama and Shopian districts.

While the district administration credited the government's efforts for the results, school teachers said it was largely because of the intervention by the local residents.

""Schools were shut down for most part of the academic year and there was no way they could have completed their syllabus. It was largely because the locals ran community schools for students in several parts of the districts, that they were able to study,"" said Masood Taing, a teacher at a government school in Shopian.

Community schools are like coaching classes, where a couple of teachers gather to teach students either at somebody's home or a community centre, depending on availability. There are more community schools in rural Kashmir than in urban areas.

""We used to study at home most of the time because schools were shut. We used to write down all the doubts and clarify them with our teachers when schools reopened. Community schools also shut down during curfew in the town, (but) they were mostly open in villages,"" said Abid Hassan, a student from Pulwama district who scored 88 per cent.

Reham Mir, who scored 90 per cent marks, also said he studied at home and with the help of a community school.

""Schools were closed for more than five months in Pulwama district. How can one expect students to finish their syllabus? Despite all these odds they have managed to study and not just study, get excellent results. All of this is because they are self-motivated and get help from locals who run community schools,"" Mohammad said.

""Students from south Kashmir are traditionally known to be excellent in studies because they know that they will not get support from schools, so they have to be self-dependent,"" he added.

G.N. Itoo, director of school education, gave all the credit to students. ""Despite all the problems students have shown excellent results in Shopian and Pulwama. They are all very hard-working students,"" he said.

But how well do we know about the technologies with which we surround ourselves? Your phone, your child's tab that he/she uses to play games and your virtual Home Assistant?

Lately, these dangers in the online space have transitioned into the real world, and as parents, we need to step in. After all, how would you or the child react to having a random stranger sitting at home all day with you? That's just what we are doing today, in this gadget-crazy world. As a mom to a 5-year-old, I often ask myself how safe my child is in today's cyber-world.

Ever since Facebook rolled out their Messenger Kids, it has been getting a lot of flak from cyber pundits, just like the Snap Map feature that is freaking out parents about their kids' safety. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a tough concept to explain to kids, about how every small physical device can connect to the internet and identify itself to similar devices. How do I do it?

From Amazon's Echo to Google Home, AI-enabled home assistants rule the roost today. Nikita Sharma, a stay-at-home mom of a 2-year-old, states how these devices excite the kids and counts for fun family time, playing games together or listening to popular nursery rhymes.

""If it means less screen-time and interactive learning for my child, I am all for it!""

On one side, you wish this is the assistant you need to make your lives simpler, but ever wondered what threats they pose to your children? Perhaps we should, like Mark Zuckerberg, start taping our laptop and tablet's camera and microphone. An incident in Portland in the USA earlier this year described how Alexa recorded a private conversation of a couple and sent it to a contact in their list without their permission. They were understandably petrified and vowed never to plug in such devices in their home again.

The makers are still clueless about how this happened.

Rajee Deepak, a techie mom of two kids, aged 11 and 9, says she lets them use the smartphone and virtual assistant Bixby, but with restrictions. ""I am okay with them using it for the weather forecast, score or to play songs"". But just like all millennial moms, Rajee is worried if this will make the next-gen kids over-dependent on gadgets and virtual assistants.

Studies such as 'Robovie, you'll have to go into the closet now: Children's social and moral relationships with a humanoid robot' by Shen Solace et al, state how these virtual 'friends' substitute your child's real friends and why that's not good. For those unfamiliar, Robovie developed by Vstone, is an adorable robot which can double as your kid's best friend; crying, laughing and walking, all included. The act of searching for answers and learning in the process is lost when all you have to say is 'Okay Google, tell me the spelling of photosynthesis'. This begs the question of whether or not a child will actually learn something tangible without relying on technology.

Don't get fooled by those privacy settings or the voice-recognition software. In mid-December, Rocco, a talking parrot, ordered itself some delicious snacks for Christmas through Alexa in Oxfordshire, when his owner wasn't around and the Internet is having a hearty laugh! But it's technology that's having the final laugh in this cyber dilemma.

The Drop-In feature in Amazon Echo is eavesdropping in a tech-guise! Agreed, it does help a new parent or when you need to check on the elders in your family, but the privacy risks and the complicated security issues outweigh the benefits it offers, leaving the customer confused.

There's also news of how Alexa has overheard 'Christmas shopping lists' from everyday conversations and purchases are being made directly from the linked bank accounts -- without one even actually placing the order. Isn't that scary? Soon would a LEGO purchase worth ₹30,000 be delivered to my doorstep just because I had a conversation with my child about it?

Be it the smartphone, iPad or even the home assistants, take a minute (or maybe more) to go through the privacy settings and enable the parental controls and safe search options. Don't ignore this step and click 'I agree' blindly. Act smart. Switch off the voice-purchasing option or at least set a PIN to make it secure. The safer route would be to disable microphones and video camera options in your child's devices.

If you buy any of these virtual home assistants, go through their manuals and read about them thoroughly. Find out what are the 'wake words' for each device and ensure your conversations don't include a lot of them, that can activate the device!"

""Our students were on a par with their private school counterparts, who have access to good science labs,"" said Umme Salma, science teacher at the government school.

The school has had a science lab for long but it was not used due to shortage of time and logistics.

The enhanced quality of education reflected in the numbers -- admissions went up from 425 in 2017 to 535 in 2018.

""When we started mobile science labs for students in government schools, the excitement to learn was palpable. Some of the kids are quick learners. That's what made us set up this centre. Students from 10 nearby government schools can visit the centre, innovate and experiment,"" said Dilip Gowda, head of the science centre set up in the school by Agastya International Foundation.

He was accompanied by his schoolmates Aravind Reddy, Ramakrishna and Lawrence Aga, who have a similar background like his. ""It was a dream come true. It was our teacher's motivation which took us to these places,"" said Ramesh.

The quartet was from Seva Bharath Trust Government Telugu Higher Primary School, Viveknagar, and was drawn to robotics during their STEM education classes.

Sridhar P, an IISc graduate, who left his cushy job to train government school students in robotics, has taken students from six government institutions to international competitions. ""STEM labs help in students' overall development, instilling qualities like peer learning, leadership and creativity in them. They give students the confidence that they can make something work. They also connect science and maths to real-world problems. Unconsciously, the students become computer literate too,"" said Sridhar.

""Thanks to the robotics project we started on a pilot basis in Seva Bharath Trust Government Telugu Higher Primary School, students wanted to spend more time in class. They created LEGO robots, a humanoid and what not. Students are bright enough to grasp concepts; it's all about giving them access,"" said Sushmita Ananth from Akshara Foundation.

Vandana P, a teacher from RT Nagar Government School, said that lack of access to labs and rote learning of science with focus on theory make students fear the subject.

All of this is because they are self-motivated and get help from locals who run community schools,"" Mohammad said.

""Students from south Kashmir are traditionally known to be excellent in studies because they know that they will not get support from schools, so they have to be self-dependent,"" he added.

G.N. Itoo, director of school education, gave all the credit to students. ""Despite all the problems students have shown excellent results in Shopian and Pulwama. They are all very hard-working students,"" he said.

During the 2016 unrest in Kashmir following the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani, 32 school buildings were burnt and most of them were in south Kashmir. In 2017, the ministry of human resource development had devised a roadmap for Kashmir to improve the education scenario in the state. Construction of school buildings was also a part of the ministry's plan. However, no construction has happened so far in Pulwama and Shopian districts.

2. Bhima Koregaon: Before Memorial Day, Fear Under Security Blanket

Many who will welcome the new year under flimsy pandals around the Bhima Koregaon war memorial have spent every December 31 here, swatting mosquitoes and singing Ambedkarite songs to distract from the cold. But January 1, 2019, is different. It marks a year of deepening faultlines at the site of the 1818 war that saw a Colonial army, helped by a Mahar regiment, defeat the Peshwas. This new year, the day that marks the overthrow of upper-caste rule is time to mull over what remains a divided society.

""It's going to be peaceful tomorrow,"" says Santosh Davne, 35, from Nanded. A vendor of trinkets featuring Dr B R Ambedkar and the Buddha, the disabled Davne has been visiting the Jaystambh, the obelisk to honour soldiers who died on January 1, 1818, on the banks of the Bhima, for 12 years. ""I set up a stall every year, but I have never seen such police presence or such quiet fear among people,"" he says.

7. 30 Lakh Reapply for Inclusion in Assam NRC

About 30 lakh of the 40.07 lakh people left out of the final draft of the updated National Register of Citizens (NRC) published five months ago have applied again for inclusion during the claims and objections round that ended on Monday.

During the phase, 600 objections also came in from those who doubted the citizenship of others included in the draft.

The window for 40.07 lakh of the 3.29 crore applicants excluded from the complete draft was opened on 25 September. It was to have closed on 15 December, but the Supreme Court, which is monitoring the exercise, extended the last day to 31 December after the Assam government said the panchayat election, held on 5 and 9 December, had robbed the people and officials of precious time.

8. Pumps to Remove Water from Meghalaya Mine on Tuesday

Personnel of multiple agencies engaged in the search and rescue operation for at least 13 miners trapped in a coal mine at Ksan in Meghalaya's East Jaintia Hills, found a wooden structure, coal and mud near the bottom of the pit on Monday.

Six divers of the Indian Navy and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) had on Sunday detected a few rat-holes - narrow tunnels where miners have to crawl into to extract coal.

R. Susngi, spokesperson for the district administration, said the site had been cleared for the Odisha Fire Service to start pumping out water from the main shaft measuring about 150 sq ft in area and about 350 ft deep. Other shafts were being prepared to keep at least three of the 10 high-power pumps brought from Odisha operating for longer durations, he said.

9. Pujara and Kohli Difference Between Two Sides, Says Australia Coach Langer

Australian coach Justin Langer has lamented a lack of world-class batsmen in his side's line-up and pointed out that Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara have been the difference for the visitors in the on-going four-match Test series.

India won the third Test at the MCG by 137 runs to take an unassailable 2-1 lead in the series. The fourth Test begins in Sydney on Thursday, 3 January.

""At this stage, the difference in the series is Pujara and Kohli, if we're frank. Pujara averages 53 and Kohli has averaged 46 and got a duck in the second innings. The lesson we learn from that is he just absorbed all our pressure,"" Langer said on Monday.

The Ashok Gehlot government is about to make superficial changes to usher in visibly and academically different schooling for lakhs of students enrolled in public schools, which will have financial implications for both the state treasury and parents of students.

One of the proposals put up before the government is to change the uniforms of the students in government schools. School education minister Govind Singh Dotasra reviewed the department's works on Monday and said, ""The BJP government has changed the school syllabus to impose ideology of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).We will review the school uniforms of students.""

Other things under scanner are transfer of teachers effected by the Vasundhara Raje government, colour of the bicycles that were painted saffron and given away to meritorious students and the syllabus, he added.

Congress leaders, said sources, pointed out that the existing school dress is identical to khaki colour worn by the members of right-wing outfit. This was brought to the notice of the state education department and has been placed under review. If a change in uniform is ordered, it will impact students in 69,000 government schools across state.

A change in the uniform will lead to financial burden on the parents. The uniform of students was changed only last year. More than 84 lakh students are studying in government schools across the state. On an average, a set of uniform costs Rs 500. In such a situation, there will be an additional financial burden of Rs 420 crore on parents of 84 lakh students, in case they choose to purchase one set of uniform.

Over the last twenty years, the uniforms were changed twice in the state government schools. The BJP government changed the uniform both the time. ""We changed the school uniform after twenty years. This uniform colour is also in practice in several private schools of the country and in state. Changing the uniform after a year is wrong,"" former education minister Vasudev Devnani told DNA.

The Raje government had introduced the new uniform in government schools in the academic session 2017-18. After two decades, the uniform of students enrolled in government schools was changed. In the year 1997, the then BJP government's education minister Gulab Chand Kataria had ordered a change in the uniform of government schools.

The BJP government introduced shirts of light brown colour and khaki pants for boys. For the girls, light brown kurti and salwar and khaki-coloured dupatta was finalised. The uniforms of RSS members include khaki pants.

Congress has earlier accused the BJP government of attempting to impose RSS ideology on students by effecting a change in uniforms. In spite of opposition from the Congress, the BJP government went ahead and implemented the new dress.

Before 1997, the colour of school uniforms was khaki and white. Gulab Chand Kataria who was the education minister then replaced sky blue tops in place of white. In 2017, the uniform in light brown and khaki colour was introduced replacing the sky blue colour."

The Delhi High Court has directed police to expeditiously probe the death of a 12-year-old girl, who committed suicide after allegedly being rebuked and humiliated by her teacher.

The girl was found hanging in the bedroom she shared with her lawyer-mother in a locality in southwest Delhi on December 1.

Naming the school, principal, class teacher and another teacher as party to the petition, the mother approached the court seeking a CBI enquiry into the child's death, alleging that police was not probing the case properly.

Justice Najmi Waziri, before whom the plea came up for hearing, asked the area's Joint Commissioner to personally look into the matter and take legal action against the culprits within 48 hours. The judge also directed police to lodge an FIR into the incident and file a status report before January 10, the next date of hearing.

Advocate R D Rana, appearing for the mother, alleged the girl had told her friends she would commit suicide and not meet them again. The counsel sought protection for the students, studying at a private school, so they could depose without fear.

He further submitted the Class VII student wrote the teacher's name on her palms and hands and the reason for her extreme step. The ""suicide note"" had said: ""meri suicide ki khabar school tak zarur pahuchana."" She had also written: ""Bye world,"" and ""Jai Shri Krishna I am coming"".

The counsel for Delhi Police told the court, ""We are waiting for the autopsy report and are recording statements of victim's classmates.""

The woman, a single mother, said in her petition that her daughter had complained of relentless humiliation at her teacher's hands. She further alleged her daughter had been insisting on changing schools. ""I (mother) had not realised how extreme it has been and that she would commit suicide,"" the plea said, adding ""her teacher used to rebuke her for trivial issues"".

Besides a CBI enquiry, the plea also called for a probe by an independent agency as the school management was ""trying to cover up the case"".

Soon after the incident, the school in a statement had said, ""... Police are presently conducting an enquiry into the case. We, as a responsible institution, are fully co-operating with the investigating authority and are also conducting an enquiry internally... We stand in solidarity with the family of the student in this difficult time, and assure them our full support in the proper and fair investigation of the case."""

The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) will launch an online portal next month to facilitate stakeholders of a land pooling policy, officials said Monday.

The land pooling policy, notified by the DDA in September this year, is aimed at allowing the city to get 17 lakh housing units capable of accommodating 76 lakh people.

It covers urbanizable areas of urban extensions at 95 villages in the national capital.

DDA vice-chairman Tarun Kapoor said, ""We have already notified land-pooling policy. We will launch an online portal by the end of January. Interested parties can put their applications on this portal.""

He said the authority will organise nukkad nataks (street plays) to aware farmers about the policy.

The Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry is planning to introduce urban land title Act to prevent land fraud.

Under the land pooling policy, agencies will develop infrastructure like roads, schools, hospitals, community centres and stadia on the pooled land and return a portion of the plot to farmers who can later execute housing projects with the help of private builders.

Formulated with an aim to provide affordable housing in Delhi, the policy is also expected to trigger huge economic, social and civic development in the city. It is likely to ""benefit lakhs of farmers"" while generating immense investment opportunities, the DDA had said in September.

(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). With effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions.

The Samagra Shiksha scheme focuses on improvement of quality of education by providing support for different interventions like; in-service training of teachers and schools heads, conduct of achievement surveys at National and State level, provision of textbooks as per Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, ICT and digital initiatives, vocational education, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment has been increased and from this year provisions for library grants and grants for sports and physical education have also been introduced.

The Government has also launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities.

e PATHSHALA: a single point repository of e ­resources containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-­print materials.

The Central Government, supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme namely 'Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat' (PBBB) in foundational years of schooling.

(iii) MHRD, has launched a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform popularly known as SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) on 9 July, 2017. The portal is offering various online courses for school education and higher education. NCERT has been developing course modules for Massive Open and Online Course (MOOCs) for school education system in 12 subject areas (Accountancy, business studies, biology, chemistry, economic, history, geography, mathematics, physics, political science, psychology and sociology) for classes IX-XII.

The horror of NEET continues

National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) has continued to haunt medical aspirants of Tamil Nadu, particularly those from government schools. Only eight government school students managed to secure a medial seat after clearing NEET this year, according to official data. Despite setting up 412 special training centres, ineffective operation have let down the students. KA Sengotttaiyan, state school education minister, admitted that Rs 20 crore amount sanctioned remained unused and promised better performance in the coming years.

Also, many students were given centres in other states like Rajasthan since there were not enough centres set up here. Strict checking which also led to stripping in few cases took toll on mental health of few examinees. Of the 1.2 lakh candidates, around 60 per cent were unable to clear the entrance, according to official data. However, around 1,300 government school students who cleared the test were unable to obtain the necessary cutoff. With government showing no intent in clearing the bill which seeks a permanent exemption of NEET, private coaching centres have started to mushroom, collecting fees Rs 20,000-Rs 2,00,000 for a year. Some are also travelling to other states for coaching.

Revised syllabus cheers up students

After a gap of nearly 12 years, Tamil Nadu government revised school curriculum. The new textbooks, written based on the revised syllabus for state board students, have received a positive response from almost all the stakeholders. Besides enriching the content, value additions like Quick Response (QR) codes for reading reference materials, Information & Communication Technology (ICT) corners and career guidance sections have made the new textbooks better than the National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT), said an official from the school education department.

""The book is filled with worked-out examples, colourful illustrations and quick pointers which will help the students understand the concepts better and perform well in not only board exams but also competitive exams like NEET and IIT-JEE,"" he said.

Only one bus for Chennaiites

Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswamy launched a total of 986 government buses this year -- 515 in July and 471 in October. However, despite the Corporation's proposal to replace 245 buses on an urgent basis, the city got just one new bus. According to official records, nearly 250 old MTC buses were declared unfit for operation. Also, more than 70 per cent of the 3,300 buses are being operated beyond the permissible six lakh kilometres.

M Chandran, vice president, Centre of Indian Trade Union (CITU) said a bus must ideally run for seven years. But, MTC buses have been running for more than 15 years. While the year started with the government announcing a steep hike in government and private bus fares ranging from 20 per cent to 55 per cent in January, the failure to replace rickety buses has proved in further losses to MTC, with a major chunk of commuters shifting to suburban trains for travel. When contacted, an official from MTC said that at least 50 new buses will be allocated to Chennai next year.

Now, pay your fine online

In a bid to eliminate cash transaction and ensure transparency, the city police in May this year launched a cashless fine payment system for traffic violators. Police reviewed that it is a major hit. ""From May 10 to December 27, a total of 13,92,442 cases have been registered and fine worth Rs15,44,69,930 has been collected,"" said a senior official from the traffic department. As per the new system, besides swiping cards at point of sale machines already available with traffic police, those served with e-challans can make payments online.

The fine can also be paid through Paytm using QR Code. The fine can also be paid in cash at post offices, relevant courts and state-run e-sewa centres The official further added that when offenders pay digitally, they get an acknowledgement text from the city police. ""Also, from next month, we will announce an updated portal after tying up with the National Informatics Centre (NIC). This will help us know their previous details and nab repeated offenders,"" he said.

Metro yet to become the first choice

Two underground metro rail stretches, Nehru Park to Central and Saidapet to AGDMS were inaugurated after nearly six years of construction in May, this year. The ridership of Chennai Metro currently stands close to 60,000 against the estimated five lakh. Though the inauguration of the two stretches increased the patronage from 30,000 to 60,000, it still has to go a long way. It may be noted that in December last year, Chennai Metro came under fire from the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs for several discrepancies in the Detailed Project Report (DPR), it prepared for the phase- II project. Even this year, Union Urban Development Ministry had reasons to doubt the feasibility of the 107 km second phase for which the agency had sent a detailed report to avail funds. An official of CMRL said the ridership will increase once Metro is connected from AG-DMS to Washermanpet via Central.

Chennai is becoming smart

While the Smart City project implemented by the Greater Chennai Corporation made little headway in 2017, an official said as many as seven projects were completed this year and several others have begun. ""The completed projects include exclusive bicycle lane, installation of storm water drains in T Nagar, development of Namma Chennai app for GCC, establishment of 28 smart classrooms in corporation schools, park renovation, establishment of sensory park and conversion of sodium lamps into LED lamps in almost all the areas,"" said an official. While projects worth Rs 26 crore are being implemented on the ground, projects worth Rs 336 crore are in various stages of implementation. Also, work to augment the water supply to city residents and increase the volume of supply, as part of the Smart City Mission, would be underway by March next year."

Over the course of 10 months, IGR has highlighted successful initiatives on issues including health, gender parity, climate change, education, and Kerala's post-flood rehabilitation. Here is a selection of five stories, each covering one of our focus areas, that made an impact in 2018 and hold out hope for India's future.

As the country braces for the 2019 general elections, the impact of good governance, or the lack of it, will be under the spotlight. We aim to increase our coverage of governance issues, and welcome your suggestions and feedback.

Climate Change

Challenge: Climate change can lower the standard of living of nearly half of India's population by 2050, the World Bank warned in a June 2018 study. Particularly vulnerable are farmers who are dependent on rainfall for a good harvest, especially in regions such as Karnataka that are prone to drought. In the 15 years to 2015, only three years -- 2005, 2007 and 2010 -- witnessed no drought, as per a 2017 assessment report by the Karnataka State Disaster Management Monitoring Centre. In 2018, 77 percent of the 30 districts were declared drought-hit, The Times of India reported on 14 September, 2018.

Action: A farmer couple, Shyamrao and Laximibai Patil, in water-scarce Kalaburagi in north Karnataka, have shown that a combination of state and NGO support, supported by grassroots innovation, can help farmers combat the effects of climate change.

The Patils practice organic farming, run a dairy and poultry farm, and are helping their fellow farmers experiment with new methods.

The couple have set up their own self-help group to sell produce such as pulses. From their mixed-crop farming and livestock produce, they make an annual income of Rs 5 lakh and a profit of around Rs 2.5 lakh, at a time when 70% of the country's agricultural households spend more than they earn on average every month.

Gender Parity

Challenge: In 2017, nearly 50,000 women died at the hands of intimate partners or family members, making ""home, the most dangerous place for women"", according to a November 2018 study by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.

India is perceived as having the worst record on sexual violence, harassment from cultural and traditional practices and human trafficking, and is considered the least safe country in the world for women, according to a Thomson Reuters Foundation poll, as IndiaSpend reported on 26 June 2018. Only 14 percent of Indian women who have experienced physical or sexual violence have sought help to stop the violence while 77 percent have neither sought help nor told anyone about the violence they experienced, according to the National Family Health Survey (2015-16).

Action: In Mumbai, health advocacy Centre for Enquiry into Health and Allied Themes has since 2001 been running support centres called Dilaasa, which are funded by the National Health Mission, to identify victims of domestic and sexual violence.

Using a model of care that can be replicated across government health centres nationwide, Dilaasa centres have provided help to more than 8,000 women.

Over the two years to 2018, Mumbai's 11 centres identified 5,647 women as potential victims of domestic violence. They got 2,554 cases registered for domestic violence and 809 cases for sexual violence, according to municipal records. Sikkim, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Assam and Uttar Pradesh are replicating and activating this model.

Health

Challenge: India has 46.6 million stunted children and is home to 31% of all stunted children under five--the highest in the world--according to the 2018 Global Nutrition Report, IndiaSpendreported on December 10, 2018.

Nearly 20% of Indian children under five are wasted (have low weight for their height) and 7% severely wasted, according to data from the National Family Health Survey of 2015-16.

The Society for Nutrition, Education and Health Action (SNEHA), an NGO in Mumbai's Dharavi, the third largest slum in Asia by population, is helping reduce the prevalence of child malnutrition by plugging nutrition awareness gaps and supporting local health workers.

Action: SNEHA's efforts have reduced wasting among children aged up to three by 23% and produced a 109% increase in the services received by children through the Integrated Child Development Services Scheme, a government programme covering health, food and primary education. It plugs gaps in nutrition-related knowledge in the community by training community volunteers, who spread awareness and inform anganwadi (daycare) workers about the status of pregnant women and families who are finding it difficult to feed a newborn.

Education

Challenge: India has been successful in increasing primary school enrolment to the extent that more than 83% of primary school-age children were enrolled in 2016-17, according to data from the District Information System for Education (DISE). But fewer than half (47.8%) of grade V rural students could read at least a grade II text in 2016, the Annual Survey of Education Report 2016 found.

Action: World Vision, a non-profit, runs a remedial education programme, Aparajitha, for 4,300 students in government schools in 130 villages in Lalitpur district in Uttar Pradesh. From a zero baseline, within a year 1.55% of enrolled students could read local content (such as newspapers) and understand it; 6.2% (up from 1.8%) could read a story and comprehend it; and 10.4% could read a story (up from 5.1%). World Vision expects to complete the project by 2020 and empower the community to take over.

Disaster Relief and Rehabilitation

Challenge: In the two decades to 2017, India suffered a $79.5 billion loss, ranking among the top five countries in the world to be affected by climate-related disasters, The Wire reported on October 11, 2018. India is taking baby steps towards disaster preparedness, the lack of which is becoming obvious in the wake of climate change-related extreme weather events. Only 7% of the 4,862 dams in the country have emergency action plans, a 2017 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India said, the Hindustan Times reported on September 3, 2018. Often, the armed forces are summoned to undertake rescue operations, such as during the recent Kerala floods in August 2018, despite the constitution of the National Disaster Response Force in 2006.

The Kerala floods affected an estimated 5 million people's lives and damaged infrastructure to the extent that the state needs nearly Rs 30,000 crore to rebuild.

Action: The Kerala state electricity board's quick response under Mission Reconnect restored electricity to nearly 2.5 million homes in less than two weeks. Kerala is one of the 15 states in India that have 100% household electrification, the Hindustan Times reported on November 28, 2018. It managed the task by improving coordination through a state-level task force and an army of volunteers comprising retired staff, students and private electricity personnel.

Though 2018, young with expectations and hope for development, began on a slow and steady note with projects like the Kochi Water metro and Smart City receiving a boost, tragedy struck by the middle of the year, after a school van carrying pre-school children of a playschool fell into a temple pond at Ayani in Maradu.

This was to be the first among the many disasters Ernakulam would witness in the coming months.

Hardly a month later, Kerala woke up to another rude shock, the death of SFI member and Maharaja's College student Abhimanyu, which sparked state-wide protest and unravelled a story of political vendetta.

Migrant labourers were brought under the scanner after 22-year-old Nimisha, a native of Malayidamthuruthu, was hacked to death in Perumbavoor.

And even as Kochi prayed for brighter days, bad times came visiting again after Independence Day, when heavy rains led to flooding, rendering many homeless and looking for shelter in relief camps. Homes in Aluva, Paravoor, Varapuzha went underwater spiralling peoples lives out of control.

If that was not enough, the factional feud began rearing its ugly head in municipalities in and around Ernakulam. The nuns' protest demanding the arrest of Jalandhar Bishop Franco Mulakkal gained prominence at Vanchi Square in High Court.

Another nail in the coffin was the death of Ebin Paul an IT professional, a native of Kochi in October, who was killed in a road accident along the pot-hole ridden Kakkanad-Palarivattom route. Yet, despite the tragedies, Kochi did have its share of positive moments.

The Cochin International Terminal attained the one crore passenger benchmark this year while authorities also opened its renovated domestic terminal on a budget of Rs 240 crore. The water metro received a boost while eight small bridges connecting tiny islands under the Goshree Islands Development Authority (GIDA) at an estimated cost of Rs 38.40 crore were thrown open to the public.

The much-anticipated City Gas Pipeline project gathered steam. Adding to Kochi's bag of happiness was the 'conditional permission' granted by the city council to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL) for digging up roads to laying optical fibre cable(OFC) and drawing overhead lines for their ambitious project.

The Kochi Muziris Biennale also took off on December 12.

Student politics play spoil sport

The murder of 20-year-old Abhimanyu, a BSc Chemistry student of Maharaja's College, cast a pall of gloom on nearly all college campuses It brought to light the intrusion of fanatics into educational institutions. Debates raged over the validity of campus politics. This was also the year which saw two women vice chancellors stepping down from their offices after a successful and fruitful stint. J Letha of Cusat and Rose Varghese of NUALS, proved to tough nuts when it came to making their institutions premier ones.

The rains, bandhs and hartals wreaked havoc on the academic calendar in 2018. The playschool van accident at Maradu led to the death of three including two children. Guidelines to be followed by the schools with regard to school buses and vans were drawn. However, it was not all that bad for the education sector. The year saw a spike in the number of admissions in government schools. Around 1.85 lakh students had sought admissions in government schools all over the state and the numbers were significant enough in the district too.

Kochi metro gets a push

The Kochi Metro, which is now an integral part of City's transport sector, focused on brand building activities mainly in 2018 along with launching some key steps in connection with Water Metro, the formation of Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (UMTA) and second phase expansion of the Metro to Kakkanad. It also actively associated the flood relief activities. The KMRL conducted free services thereby helping the rescue workers to reach Aluva and supply relief materials. The agency also The reconstruction of Champakkara bridge was also launched along with the preparatory work at Petta- SN Jn stretch

Sorrow of motorists

City roads turned death traps this year. Ebin Paul's death along the pot-hole ridden Palarivattom-Kakkanad route shocked the collective conscience of the city. Officials, who were till then in a state of apathy, woke up from their slumber. The inaction of the authorities catapulted protests. It was the private bus owners, backed by organisations like the Kerala Private Bus Operators Association, who first threatened to suspend services in the route.

Fall of the football hype

A host of events kept Kochi busy in the year that passed by even though Kerala Blasters, the city's most high-profile team, endured a torrid time. Blasters suffered their worst run in ISL history, with popular coach David James facing the axe last week. It followed the fans' boycott of the last three matches. But the football fans were treated to some quality action earlier in the year when Spanish premier league club Girona and Australian Melbourne City played friendlies with Kerala Blasters.

Year of factional feuds

The Congress party has become synonymous with factional feuds. Local bodies such as Thrikkakara, Kochi Corporation, Kalamassery Municipality and Maradu Municipality witnessed a year of ugly politics too. In Kalamassery municipality, Jessy Peter had to step down after KPCC helped the Congress I faction oust her from the post and appoint Rukiya Jamal, wife of former chairperson Jamal Manakadan, as the new chair. At Thrikkakara municipality, the LDF once again came to the front with the Congress rebel Sheela Charu shifting to the LDF and becoming elected as chairperson. However, the factional feud in the Congress party at Corporation reached nowhere, though a section of Congress workers pushed for Shiny Mathew as the Mayor candidate.

Floods

Aluva, Kalamassery, Paravoor, Angamaly were the constituencies which bore the major brunt of the floods in Ernakulam. Lakhs of people were shifted to relief camps. The Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL) at Nedumbassery, was shut down due to flooding for several days. Approximately 2 lakh people were displaced in Paravoor alone, as 60,000 homes were inundated in the aftermath of the floods, said Paravoor MLA V D Satheeshan. The livelihood of agricultural and dairy farmers weavers, fishermen went for a toss. The Chekutty doll from Chendamangalam rose as the symbol of resilience.

Upbeat health sector

At least 300 cases of leptospirosis resulting in two deaths broke out in the district post-floods. H1N1 cases also reared its ugly head. The silver lining, however, was the introduction of the Ernakulam District Comprehensive Cancer Control Programme aimed at the early detection of cancer. On the infrastructure front, new blocks are under construction at the General Hospital, Ernakulam Medical College and Cochin Cancer Research Centre. The year also marked the fifth anniversary of the government takeover of Ernakulam Medical College. ""Despite the floods, the quality and availability of health care remained stable. This year, we also received a major boost in the implementation of Ardram project,"" said Dr N K Kuttappan, DMO, Ernakulam."

States in turn are to reimburse a certain amount of money for every RTE admission.

However, it turns out that the Maharashtra government is looking around for ways to not pay these schools the money it owes them.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Maharashtra, led by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, can claim credit for many successes, especially with the irrigation project Jalyukt Shivar and an impressive infrastructure upgrade topping the list. However, its record on one front has been abysmal, i.e., in fulfilling its responsibility under the Right to Education (RTE) Act.

According to Section 12 of the RTE, non-minority unaided private schools are required to reserve 25 per cent of the seats in entry-level classes (either primary level or Class 1) for students belonging to disadvantaged groups (DGs) [Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), etc] and economically weaker sections (EWS) [income less than a certain amount]. The state in return is supposed to pay these schools, for every RTE admission, an amount fixed by the government or the tuition fee of a school, whichever is less. Maharashtra has fixed an amount of Rs 17,000 a year for RTE students.

But it goes to great lengths to avoid reimbursing this amount to schools. Though the schools have been reserving seats under RTE since 2012, the government tried to get out of its commitment by simply agreeing to pay dues for only one academic year. Then, there was disagreement over the actual amount due and how it should be calculated. The government said it owed Rs 300 crore while the schools said the amount was more than 1,000 crore.

This mismatch in estimates came about because the government wanted to pay only for fresh RTE admissions while the schools were asking to be compensated for all RTE admissions (new and repeat/old students - explained in detail here).

Even to date, the dues of past academic years have not been fully released to all the private schools. Now, the Maharashtra government has come up with a new plan to avoid paying the money it owes to these institutions. In a government resolution released recently, it has modified the norms for RTE reimbursement stating that ""if a private school is using any government land and benefiting from the same then the school would not receive reimbursement for students who have been admitted in 25 per cent RTE quota,"" Mumbai Mirror reported.

Through this order, the government has effectively imposed a retrospective binding of sorts in an agreement that is in force for years and it has done so in a one-sided manner. This is a textbook definition of ""breach of contract"". When the government leased out land, it didn't impose a condition that schools will have to reserve 25 per cent seats for EWS/DG category students. Nor does the RTE Act mandate that those schools that have received land from the government at concessional rates will not be compensated for fulfilling the RTE quota. Hence, both from the RTE Act and the leasing agreement, the government's action is prima facie illegal. Less said about the ethical aspect of its action, the better.

Independent English Schools Association (IESA) secretary Rajendra Singh told Swarajya that ""the government's action is not just illogical but outright illegal. The RTE and land leasing are two separate contracts. In any case, under the RTE Act, the government gives reimbursement for only tuition fees and not for infrastructure costs the school has to bear. Land comes under the latter category. How can the two be clubbed? If the government was paying per student reimbursement for infrastructure costs also, then they had a case. In such a scenario, they could have deducted this from total reimbursement, but how can they not reimburse the tuition fees?""

Singh further explained that the government simply ""doesn't have the data to ascertain how many schools have the land leasing agreement with the government. Nor it has the manpower to determine this number. It will take anywhere between one to two years to collect the data. This is nothing but their latest attempt to delay payments to private schools."""

***

It is not disputed that security of the country is of prime concern. But the government's new order does not lay down the conditions under which such surveillance of private information can be accessed and safeguards to avoid the order's misuse. Though the old order was introduced in 2009, the feeling of being threatened did not exist. As a parallel example, when Aadhaar was introduced, it had a narrower scope. But this government extended it to so many services that that the Supreme Court had to take up the matter and guarantee fundamental rights under the Constitution. - SN Iyer

Naseeruddin Shah's comment over growing intolerance is genuine (""The Daily Fix: The vicious reaction to Naseeruddin Shah underscores shrinking space for minorities""). There's consensus among the well-wishers of this country that this growing intolerance will harm national integrity and trust in the rule of law in this great nation. However the treatment Shah has received from the ruling BJP suggests that the party and its affiliates are only interested in the electoral politics and not in the diversity and integrity of the nation. - Rehan Ansar

There is no mention of the Ayyappa Jyothi Event that is being planned by those who oppose the Women's Wall Movement.

They have all put under a blanket label of ""mob"".

While this article raises some valid points, there is one aspect that it totally ignores - the near-complete absence of Muslim faculty members at the IIMs (""IIMs have used autonomy for self-aggrandisement, says professor pushing for faculty diversity""). After reading this article, I went through the listed faculty directories of all IIMs (except Rohtak and Hamirpur, as the websites weren't working) and saw that only five core faculty memebers were Muslim. This dearth of Muslims can also be seen even the visiting faculty and teachers for elective courses are offered by the institutes. If we are talking about diversity, then why is there no discussion on religion? - Ahmed Ashhar

***

The interview with the IIM Bangalore professor is an eye opener. His views on being responsible corporate citizens are much needed. We do not want to go the American way, where chasing money at any cost, even family, is legitimate.

The IIMs look at themselves as the Indian equivalent of Western business schools. The difference, not acknowledged by them, is that the Indian taxpayer funds the IIMs. Hence, IIMs have a holistic responsibility towards Indian citizens and not just to enriching themselves.

Indian citizens, therefore, have concerns that need to be addressed within the business models taught at IIMs.

His concern about environmental pollution and social diversity are a reality of the Indian citizens and should be adopted wholeheartedly with a responsibility. This, along with other concerns, like environmental destruction due to industrial activity and others, will make Indian IIMs global leaders in progressive and responsible business models. By not addressing these realities, IIMs are wasting an opportunity to lead the world in a new kind of business model. - Rajratna Jadhav

I could not agree more with Deepak Malghan. The IIMs have failed the nation by deliberately trying to create islands of engineer-dominated institutions without making any contribution to faculty development in small private institutions or state universities. There are consulting assignments because company boards want brand name credibility to endorse decisions. - Sudhakar GP

I read Nayanjot Lahiri's article with a lot of interest for two reasons (""The forgotten story of how Chipko Andolan pioneer Chandi Prasad Bhatt saved Badrinath temple"").

I am glad for such articles which ensure that his efforts are not credited to others. - R Saha

I am worried by news of India's $1.4 billion aid package for the Maldives (""India declares $1.4 billion aid to Maldives""). I cannot understand the rationale behind giving so much money to another nation when our own country is struggling with financial insecurity.

When so many vital things are pending in our country for want of funds, how can people at the helm of governance act like this, that too to a country that has acted in a bitter way towards our nation, by sending back Indian workers and refusing to issue visas to them?

Who is accountable for this act of giving away such a huge sum when farmers are dying of indebtedness and victims of natural calamities are only given peanuts? - R Kanagasabai"

Every few years, fresh data from the National Family Health Surveys reveals its slow progress in these areas.

However, despite voluminous evidence showing the effectiveness of daycare facilities in improving the health of children and women, the recent government-proposed Labour and Social Security Codes barely feature childcare or maternity benefits for informal workers. Their inclusion had just not occurred to our policymakers, most of whom are men. It was up to some of us, mostly women working with informal workers, to bring these to the attention of the Ministry of Labour, during consultations held this year to discuss the codes, which could be tabled in Parliament in the ongoing Winter Session.

In recent years, SEWA along with 300 other organisations, working with the families of the working poor, have come together in a national campaign to ask for quality childcare as a right. This will mean mandatory adequate government investment in full-day, free, quality, holistic and integrated early childhood care; workers at the centres receiving appropriate training, minimum wages, and basic benefits; and maternity entitlements for women. The organisations are part of FORCES, a coalition working for child rights and childcare formed after the landmark Shramshakti report on informal women workers in 1988.

SEWA's experiences in providing childcare for the young children of informal workers dates to the early1970s. We have seen that full-day childcare with proper healthcare, nutritious meals, age-appropriate education and recreational activities results in the holistic growth and development of children. All the children in our centres go to school and almost all finish high school. With SEWA's support, several have enrolled in private schools under the Right To Education provisions, and many have gone on to college and have jobs in sectors like Information Technology, hospitality, healthcare and more.

Our micro-level studies have shown other significant impacts: women with access to daycare earned at least 50% more, and 70% of older children started going to school for the first time as they did not have to care for their younger siblings. Other studies have also pointed to dramatic impacts on women's work and income. With women's workforce participation falling in India, this may well be one significant way to reverse the trend.

There are other advantages of full-day childcare centres. With a physical presence in the communities where workers live and work, it is easier for municipal health workers and ANMs (auxiliary nurse midwife, a village-level female health worker) to provide health services such as immunisation, health check-ups and wellness days. They also become hubs for organising workers and knitting communities together. During disasters - both natural and human - we have witnessed how childcare centres became the focal point of rebuilding and rehabilitation.

In India, the investment in our children is woefully inadequate: an additional investment of 1% of the gross domestic product on full-day childcare, perhaps starting with the poorest or ""aspirational"" districts selected by the Niti Ayog, could result in better care of our young, support to women's work and possibly enhanced incomes and work participation. It would also increase school attendance by girls and knit communities for collective action towards their well-being.

Yet investment by all governments - past and present - is not encouraging. Somehow, investing in childcare is not seen as worthwhile. Interestingly, parents, employers and even local people are ready to contribute towards childcare. About 20% of the costs of running SEWA's crèches come from voluntary community contributions.

India already has several examples of local collectives working closely with women workers to deliver quality childcare. In fact, rolling out one-size-fits-all childcare programmes is unlikely to result in good last-mile delivery. Taking care of our children is best done by local people, including panchayats and other local bodies.

India has advocated for the rights of home-based workers and domestic workers and for a social protection floor at the International Labour Organisation. It has begun to provide pensions and insurance and proposes financial protection during sickness through Ayushman Bharat, a national health protection scheme for poor and vulnerable families. But childcare still remains out of the ambit of its social protection initiatives. Three decades of providing childcare at the doorsteps of women workers has shown us at SEWA that childcare gives children a good start in their lives, is a huge support to women's work and provides decent work to local women - a ""triple dividend"". How much more will it take to convince our policymakers that investment in childcare, and its immediate provision at the local level, will be a win-win for all?"

The attrition was attributed to the tightening of security at exam centres and new protocols introduced by the Adityanath government. To find out more, I travelled to Allahabad where the Uttar Pradesh Madhyamik Shiksha Parishad has its headquarters.

Apart from an atrophied secondary school system, I was startled by the deep distrust and prejudice with which perfectly ordinary citizens view members of other castes and communities and the candour with which they express their beliefs.

In the car, on one of my several trips to Naini, an industrial township across the Yamuna river from Allahabad, I wondered aloud what the story of these students who had dropped out was. Were there more boys than girls? Did they hold down jobs as they studied? What role did poverty play in this mess of an examination system? The school board had not released any data on the students. Without it, it was impossible to tell.

But not for Meera (name changed), an employee of a private coaching service who was accompanying me to Naini to introduce me to private school owners. ""Most of them will be Muslims,"" she said, with an air of certainty. I was mortified. The driver of the car I had hired was Muslim. I braced for what she would say next. She proceeded to elaborate upon this hunch which, in her mind, had now gained all the weight and solidity of a fact. ""You see, their parents have no control over their children, they do not care,"" she reasoned. ""Unlike our kids who study, their children don't.""

I struggled to remind myself that she was a good person, as generous and hospitable a soul as I was likely to find anywhere. She had given up her work day, abandoned her lunch box at her office, and unhesitatingly accompanied me to sundry corners of Naini and smoothed my way into notoriously suspicious private schools.

But casual bigotry would become a familiar feature I encountered on that trip.

Another friendly and equally helpful Allahabadi claimed the fortunes of different communities in the state changed with the political parties in power. ""Pehle Dalit aur Muslim malai khaate the, ab Brahmins kha rahe hai,"" he said. It meant earlier only Dalits and Muslims ate cream - a metaphor for prosperity - and now Brahmins can eat cream too. There is an abiding belief among those I met from his community - he is Brahmin - that under the rule of Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party, Uttar Pradesh's Dalits and Muslims enjoyed extraordinary power and oppressed upper-caste Hindus and that the present BJP government is now only balancing things out.

Each group seemed willing to believe the absolute worst of the others. Every act and incident was first examined through the lens of caste and religion - in both public and private life.

A young man who drove me on my last trip to Naini was supposed to pick me up on the first day but had not turned up at all. He felt he owed me an explanation. He had married just a few months ago, his wife was Muslim like himself, but the relationship had already soured. On the day he failed to pick me up, he was caught up in ""work"" related to his divorce. ""She fights with everyone,"" he said gloomily.

He informed me that his family had been against the match because she was a ""low-caste Muslim"" and that he was beginning to see their point. ""You do know there are different castes among Muslims too, right?"" he asked, throwing a quick glance at the rear-view mirror to check if I already knew or needed schooling. He explained how his wife's background was different from his own, how she was unable to adjust in his family who, he said, did everything they could to make her feel welcome. All his marital problems were chalked up to his wife's caste identity. ""I did not believe in caste earlier but now I do,"" he said. ""There is certainly something there.""

Months after the trip, a young man from Lucknow, who belonged to a community counted among the Other Backward Classes, came to Delhi for work. With the same sort of confidence and candour Meera displayed, he informed me that the surprise checks during the crackdown on cheating specifically targeted private schools owned and run by the Other Backward Classes. I had not seen much evidence of this but he was sure - his relatives ran schools and they planned to settle scores later."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is chairing a meeting in Parliament, ahead of the introduction of the triple talaq bill in the Rajya Sabha.

Opposition leaders have signed a motion for reference resolution, seeking to have the triple talaq bill passed in the Lok Sabha sent to a Select Committee of the Rajya Sabha before being taken up for discussion in the Upper House.

The bill seeks to criminalise the practice of triple talaq, or instant divorce, in the Muslim community. It includes a jail term of three years for the husband pronouncing triple talaq and also makes the practice a a non-bailable offence.

Among other bills on the Rajya Sabha's agenda are the Allied and Healthcare Professions Bill, 2018, to be introduced by Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda, the National Council for Teacher Education (Amendment) Bill, 2018, the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (Amendment) Bill, 2018, and the Representation of the People (Amendment) Bill, 2018.

In the Lok Sabha, the government has listed five bills for discussion and voting, including the introduction of a Appropriation Bill, 2018. The others are the Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Bill, 2018, the National Medical Commission Bill, 2017, the Companies Amendment Bill, 2018, the New Delhi International Arbitration Centre Bill, 2018. The Centre is likely to face resistance against two of them as Opposition members have moved statutory resolutions against the Indian Medical Council Amendment Bill and the Companies Amendment Bill.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will move the second batch of supplementary demands for grants for the financial year 2018-19. If these are approved after being put to vote, he will introduce the Appropriation Bill (Bill no. 6 of 2018), which seeks authorisation to withdraw some extra funds from the consolidated fund of India for the financial year 2018-19.

Over the course of 10 months, IGR has highlighted successful initiatives on issues including health, gender parity, climate change, education, and Kerala's post-flood rehabilitation. Here is a selection of five stories, each covering one of our focus areas, that made an impact in 2018 and hold out hope for India's future.

As the country braces for the 2019 general elections, the impact of good governance, or the lack of it, will be under the spotlight. We aim to increase our coverage of governance issues, and welcome your suggestions and feedback.

Climate Change

Challenge: Climate change can lower the standard of living of nearly half of India's population by 2050, the World Bank warned in a June 2018 study. Particularly vulnerable are farmers who are dependent on rainfall for a good harvest, especially in regions such as Karnataka that are prone to drought. In the 15 years to 2015, only three years--2005, 2007 and 2010--witnessed no drought, as per a 2017 assessment report by the Karnataka State Disaster Management Monitoring Centre. In 2018, 77% of the 30 districts were declared drought-hit, The Times of India reported on September 14, 2018.

Action: A farmer couple, Shyamrao and Laximibai Patil, in water-scarce Kalaburagi in north Karnataka, have shown that a combination of state and NGO support, supported by grassroots innovation, can help farmers combat the effects of climate change. The Patils practice organic farming, run a dairy and poultry farm, and are helping their fellow farmers experiment with new methods.

The couple have set up their own self-help group to sell produce such as pulses. From their mixed-crop farming and livestock produce, they make an annual income of Rs 5 lakh and a profit of around Rs 2.5 lakh, at a time when 70% of the country's agricultural households

spend more than they earn on average every month.

Gender parity

Challenge: In 2017, nearly 50,000 women died at the hands of intimate partners or family members, making ""home, the most dangerous place for women"", according to a November 2018 study by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.

India is perceived as having the worst record on sexual violence, harassment from cultural and traditional practices and human trafficking, and is considered the least safe country in the world for women, according to a Thomson Reuters Foundation poll, as

IndiaSpend reported on June 26, 2018. Only 14% of Indian women who have experienced physical or sexual violence have sought help to stop the violence while 77% have neither sought help nor told anyone about the violence they experienced, according to the National Family Health Survey (2015-16).

Action: In Mumbai, health advocacy Centre for Enquiry into Health and Allied Themes has since 2001 been running support centres called Dilaasa, which are funded by the National Health Mission, to identify victims of domestic and sexual violence. Using a model of care that can be replicated across government health centres nationwide, Dilaasa centres have provided help to more than 8,000 women.

Over the two years to 2018, Mumbai's 11 centres identified 5,647 women as potential victims of domestic violence. They got 2,554 cases registered for domestic violence and 809 cases for sexual violence, according to municipal records. Sikkim, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Assam and Uttar Pradesh are replicating and activating this model.

Health

Challenge: India has 46.6 million stunted children and is home to 31% of all stunted children under five--the highest in the world--according to the 2018 Global Nutrition Report, IndiaSpend reported on December 10, 2018.

Nearly 20% of Indian children under five are wasted (have low weight for their height) and 7% severely wasted, according to

data from the National Family Health Survey of 2015-16.

The Society for Nutrition, Education and Health Action (SNEHA), an NGO in Mumbai's Dharavi, the third largest slum in Asia by population, is helping reduce the prevalence of child malnutrition by plugging nutrition awareness gaps and supporting local health workers.

Action: SNEHA's efforts have reduced wasting among children aged up to three by 23% and produced a 109% increase in the services received by children through the Integrated Child Development Services Scheme, a government programme covering health, food and primary education. It plugs gaps in nutrition-related knowledge in the community by training community volunteers, who spread awareness and inform anganwadi (daycare) workers about the status of pregnant women and families who are finding it difficult to feed a newborn.

Education

Challenge: India has been successful in increasing primary school enrolment to the extent that more than 83% of primary school-age children were enrolled in 2016-17, according to data from the District Information System for Education (DISE). But fewer than half (47.8%) of grade V rural students could read at least a grade II text in 2016, the Annual Survey of Education Report 2016 found.

Action: World Vision, a non-profit, runs a remedial education programme, Aparajitha, for 4,300 students in government schools in 130 villages in Lalitpur district in Uttar Pradesh. From a zero baseline, within a year 1.55% of enrolled students could read local content (such as newspapers) and understand it; 6.2% (up from 1.8%) could read a story and comprehend it; and 10.4% could read a story (up from 5.1%). World Vision expects to complete the project by 2020 and empower the community to take over.

Disaster relief and rehabilitation

Challenge: In the two decades to 2017, India suffered a $79.5 billion loss, ranking among the top five countries in the world to be affected by climate-related disasters, The Wire reported on October 11, 2018. India is taking baby steps towards disaster preparedness, the lack of which is becoming obvious in the wake of climate change-related extreme weather events. Only 7% of the 4,862 dams in the country have emergency action plans, a 2017 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India said, the Hindustan Times reported on September 3, 2018. Often, the armed forces are summoned to undertake rescue operations, such as during the recent Kerala floods in August 2018, despite the constitution of the National Disaster Response Force in 2006.

The Kerala floods affected an

estimated 5 million people's lives and damaged infrastructure to the extent that the state needs nearly Rs 30,000 crore to rebuild.

Action: The Kerala state electricity board's quick response under Mission Reconnect restored electricity to nearly 2.5 million homes in less than two weeks. Kerala is one of the 15 states in India that have 100% household electrification, the Hindustan Times reported on November 28, 2018. It managed the task by improving coordination through a state-level task force and an army of volunteers comprising retired staff, students and private electricity personnel.

An integrated security solution reduces cost and provides a return on investment eliminating costly manual processes. Adopting an integrated security system bring upon many advantages in both commercial and security aspect of designing an integrated system. The major benefit is improved security whether the companies are in private or public sector. An integrated system includes the ability to view alarms from all systems and the ability to link intrusion events or access to video recordings.

Other advantages that can be considered when combining separate systems to an integrated solution are access control, time & attendance monitoring, visitor management systems (VMS), lift control, CCTV Systems, intruder alarm systems, fire systems, building management system (BMS), car park management, external perimeter detection and logical security among others. Access control systems are typically identified to provide protection to both employees and property. Building management systems are responsible for controlling and monitoring the environment of a building. Major security types in cybersecurity include endpoint security, data security, network security, application security, risk & compliance management and disaster recovery.

It is important to consider the depth of integration while considering security trails on the integrated system. A completely integrated systems allows operator security checks to be created from one centralized point. Open integrated systems depend upon open system architecture to complete integration.

Important factors driving the growth of security system integration market are the increased network complexities, owing to third party application deployment, growing security needs for Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), Internet of Things trends. The major factor restraining the growth of security system integration is difficulty in expanding their businesses at a global scale. The businesses are restricted to the geographical presence only. On the other hand, Internet of Things (IoT) and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) are creating new opportunities for the growth of security system integration market.

The global security system integration market is segmented on the basis of technology, end-user and region. In terms of technology, the market can be segmented into video surveillance, intrusion detection, access control, fire and life safety, network infrastructure, data communications, home automation, IP solutions and sound & mass notification. The security system integration market in terms of end-user is classified into power utilities, sports & entertainment, ports, manufacturing, residential, transportation, retail, commercial buildings and healthcare.

The market segments in terms of geographical regions are North America, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East &Africa (MEA) and South America. North America is expected to dominate the security system integration market owing to high focus on innovation in the region owing to growing investment in research and development.

Taking forward the Modi government's 'Make In India' initiative, Railways inducted semi-high speed Train-sets of European standard as Integral Coach Factory took up manufacturing of Semi High Speed (160 Kmph) Self-Propelled Train-set with indigenous efforts, termed Train-18, with contemporary features as per global standards.

The first trainset has been rolled out by ICF in October 2018 and will shortly be ready for service after testing & trials.ICF shall be making at least two more such rakes this year. Depending on feedback, requirements target for induction in 2019-20 shall be communicated in due course.

Bogibeel bridge: Commissioning of Bogibeel Bridge, is among the mega projects completed by Railways this year.It is longest Rail-cum-Road Bridge of India (4.94 Km long Bridge) across Brahmaputra river near Dibrugarh in Assam, dedicated to the nation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 25.

Double line track with three-lane road and 74 km of total railway track, this Project was sanctioned in 1997-98 at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore and the work was commenced in April, 2002 by Bharat Ratna late Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the then Prime Minister. The completion cost of the project is Rs 5,820 crore (approx).

Safety first: Safety continues to be the foremost priority of Railways and is accorded the greatest consideration. During the current year, Ministry of Railways launched following four safety drives on all Zonal Railways with a view to preventing accidents and strengthening safety in trains.

As a result of relentless efforts put in by Railways, consequential train accidents decreased from 104 to 73 during 2017-18 in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous year. In the year 2018-19 (from April 1 to November 30) consequential train accidents decreased further from 51 to 44 in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous year.

On April 13 all zonal railways were advised to launch a one month safety drive particularly focusing on strict observance of shunting practices with compliance of rules/instructions contained in G&SR. On October 16, zonal Railways were advised to launch a special safety drive for a period of fifteen days with special emphasis on safety of work sites, stacking and handling of railway material near track and maintenance of points & crossings.

Smart coach with diagnostic system monitor bearing vibrations provides advance information on health of bearing wheel & track. In addition, coach has been provided with wheel slip protection monitoring.

Further improvements are being brought about to provide fire safety through fire and smoke detection unit integrated with passenger announcement and information system for emergency evacuation and video analytics with phased detection and unusual occurrence features to further enhance safety and security.

Railways did a great work by eliminating of level crossings as 3,478 unmanned LC gates have been eliminated during the current year so far. In effect, all unmanned level crossings on broad gauge over Indian Railway have been eliminated except one. This will also be eliminated in the current financial year.

Out of 16, total 15 Zonal Railways are now unmanned level crossing free on broad gauge, accidents on unmanned level crossings have reduced from 20 in 2017-18 to 3 in the current year up to December 2018.

Act East: DEMU services were introduced in Tinsukia Division of NF Railway in 2016-17. New coaching depots have become functional at Silchar in Barak valley region of Assam and at Agartala in Tripura. These measures have provided better connectivity to the isolated region of North East. The following projects have also been sanctioned for the North East region.

Railways saw a vast level of development in North East Region like 970 km Gauge Conversion completed in NE region in last four years. Thus, all MG sections converted to BG and there is no MG operation in entire North East Region. 353.15 km of New Line/Gauge Conversion/Doubling commissioned per year during the period 2014-15 to 2017-18 as against on average of 110 km commissioning per year in NE Region in period from 2009 to 2014.

Fifteen new lines projects of 1,397 km length having a total cost of Rs 47,695 crore are in different stages of planning, sanction, execution which fall partly or fully in the NE states. Six doubling projects of 482 km length having a total cost of Rs 9,305 crore are in different stages of Planning/Sanction/Execution which fall partly orfully in the states of NE region.

Railways has also enhanced the connectivity to North Eastern states. The Seven Sister States of North Eastern India (Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Tripura, Mizoram, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh) have been connected by Rail network. Meghalaya came on the rail map with the flagging off the first ever train from Guwahati to Mendipathar in Meghalaya on November 29, 2014 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Tripura has been put on broad gauge railway map. On July 31, 2016, the then Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu flagged off the Agartala-New Delhi 'Tripura Sundari Express'. The Agartala-New Delhi Rajdhani Express was launched on October 28, 2017. It trudges the longest route (2,422 km) for any Rajdhani Express in service.

Jiribam, the first railway station in Manipur was connected by broad gauge line. The Prime Minister flagged off the first passenger train service to Jiribam on May 27, 2016. The passenger train service to Bhairabi in Mizoram was also flagged off by him.

Modernisation: This year saw improved sleepers and fittings. In order to strengthen track structure, a wider and heavier sleeper has been developed in 2014 which is fit for 25 t axle load at 100 kmph. After successful field trial over five Zonal Railways wider and heavier sleeper has been adopted and approved for full use from FY 2019-20. This is done in a record time of 3 years from drawing board to insertion in field for trial against normal period of 8-10 years.

A web based system for granting permission of track crossing related to various public utilities like water, sewerage, gas pipeline, OFC cable has been developed and made operational on Indian Railways since April 1, 2015.

This system provides submission of online application and knowing status of the same till permission is granted. This avoids the frequent visits of the user to the Railway Offices for knowing the status of application.

To expedite clearance of track crossing cases, power to accord sanction is delegated to DRM for all the cases.A web based application called Land Management Module integrated with Track Management System (TMS) of Indian Railways has been developed, for maintaining centralized land data that is details of acquisition/area/usages and land plans of Land Bank of Indian Railways in digitized form.

Indian Railways has already completed most of the work related to digitization of land record.Station beautification became an important constituent of development this year as Railways launched an innovative initiative for the station beautification with wall art of paints and graffiti or local arts with participation of local artists, private groups and volunteers. At least 65 stations across Zonal railways have been beautified under this initiative by utilising skills of local artists, mostly using local art form, painting style, local themes or contemporary arts.

The Centre is likely to face resistance against two of them as Opposition members have moved statutory resolutions against the Indian Medical Council Amendment Bill and the Companies Amendment Bill.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will move the second batch of supplementary demands for grants for the financial year 2018-19.

Private equity fund Cerestra Advisors has acquired a K12 school in Pune as a part of their plan to build a portfolio of schools in the country and float an educational Invit (infrastructure investment trust).

Cerestra bought Billabong High International School in Hadapsar area of Pune for Rs 600 million through its Cerestra Edu Infra Fund, which presently owns a total of eight K12 schools valued at over Rs 4.5 billion.

The said school is spread across 2.25 acres of land and has a built-up area of 135,000 square feet with a capacity of 2500 students. The school is leased to the operator for a period of 30 years.

Cerestra has a total of eight such schools, which were bought and leased back to leading Indian chains including Jain Group of Institutions (JGI) in Bengaluru, Sancta Maria in Hyderabad and Witty International in Mumbai, among others.

""Cerestra had launched its first Education Infrastructure Fund in 2016 with the objective of creating a first of it's kind Education Invit. The plan is to have a relationship with eight to ten leading school operators across India and have a portfolio of $70-100 million worth of assets with each of them,"" said Chhabra.

""We focus on the assets which have a long-term rental yield potential. This model also helps the school operators to monetize their assets to raise funds. In this structure, the operating business unlocks significant capital for expansion without needing to resort to debt. Staying asset light also results in a superior return on equity for the operators this creating a win win partnership,"" he said.

Chhabra said they were closing their second education fund of $300 million which will start investing from the first quarter of next year.

Cerestra was started by Chhabra as part of Religare' global asset management business. The Capital Partnership, a global multi-family office with over $7 billion under management, partnered with the management team to buyout Religare from the venture as of last year."

Rural Development Ministry data shows access to highest level of school education remains a concern, only 6.57 per cent villages have up to senior secondary schools.

New Delhi: Over 14 per cent of villages in India don't have schools, while as many as 10 states in the country have over 15 per cent such villages, shows the latest data available with the Rural Development Ministry.

Collected under Mission Antyodaya, the data also shows that around 47 per cent villages have schools only up to the primary level.

The comprehensive data, an assessment of village-level infrastructure facilities and amenities across states and Union Territories, is currently available for 5,27,507 villages and 2.3 lakh gram panchayats.

Apart from the 75,613 (14.33 per cent) villages that don't have schools, data shows 21 per cent villages have up to middle level schools (Classes 6 to 8), around 11 per cent have up to high schools (Classes 9 and 10) and only 6.57 per cent have up to senior secondary schools (Classes 11 and 12).

The ministry's aim behind collecting village-wise data is to identify gaps in villages based on the set parameters to ensure targeted development and execution of schemes.

Ten states -- Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Manipur, Goa, Odisha, Uttarakhand, Arunachal Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh -- are worse off than the national average, with over 15 per cent villages reporting no school at all.

Mizoram, Kerala and Gujarat, meanwhile, have less than 2 per cent villages with no schools.

Kerala also does exceedingly well with respect to higher education, with senior secondary schools available in as many as 80 per cent villages, and 11 per cent villages reporting at least up to high school level. This implies that the state has less than 10 per cent villages which have schools only up to middle or primary level.

The poorest performers at senior secondary level school education are Odisha, Nagaland and Jharkhand, with only 1.7 per cent, 1.8 per cent and 2.1 per cent villages, respectively, with such schools.

Ministry officials explain that the data is only for villages and not at the Gram Panchayat level -- which usually has a cluster of villages under it. The ministry hasn't yet collected Gram Panchayat-level data.

Effectively, this means that the 14 per cent villages that don't have schools might have one in a neighbouring village. This also implies that access to school education may not be as difficult.

The National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)'s 2014 data said 94 per cent households in rural areas reported availability of primary school within 1 km from the house.

The NSSO data said it was the availability of higher levels of school that remained low in rural areas, a fact further corroborated by the current Rural Development Ministry data.

The government of India's flagship Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan aims at the universalisation of elementary education ""in a time bound manner"", as mandated by the Indian Constitution that calls for free and compulsory education to children in the 6-14 year age bracket.

However, little did he realise that his action will backfire spectacularly as he began to face journalists' ire for confirming the opposition charge on the controversial Rafale deal.

Piyush Goyal had posted a video, seemingly recorded to boost the image of Modi's image as a true patriot in the election year. While posting the video, Goyal wrote, ""Identify those who point fingers at the country's prime minister in the garb of democracy.""

In the video, tweeted by Goyal, Srivastava is seen criticising Modi's detractors and making fun of those, who abuse the prime minister by taking advantage of their 'freedom of expression.' The once popular stand-up comedian also takes a veiled dig at Congress President Rahul Gandhi for calling the prime minister a thief. He then goes on to say, ""Friends, a prime minister's post has its own respect. A prime minister does not belong to one party....We are fortunate that Narendra Modi ji was born in India.""

This line is followed by a huge round of applause, clearly suggesting that the video has been recorded at the behest of the BJP to boost Modi's image, which has taken a serious beating following his inability to prevent his party's defeat in three states that went to polls recently.

Srivastava continues, repeating Modi's famous line that he was a humble man, a faqueer (beggar). He says, ""He's a beggar-like man. In reality, Modi is a God-send person.""

Srivastava then adds that Modi signed the controversial Rafale deal to help Anil Ambani. He says, ""Modi ji knew exactly what the Indian armed forces needed. This resulted in the signing of the Rafale deal so that the Air Force could be strengthened."" Srivastava continues with his inimitable style while mimicking Modi and adds, ""Modi ji then told HAL that 'you finish the work that you've already been given. I will give the Rafale deal to a private company. This is also a truth. Are you happy with all government organisations?""

To justify his claims, Srivastava mentions the public broadcaster, highlighting just how pathetic it was and Indians were forced to watch Doordarshan only because they did not have better alternatives. ""Do you travel in government buses? Only when you are compelled to do so. Who wants to go to a government hospital? Do you want to send your kids to government schools?""

The last night line of Srivastava's promotional video says it all as he signs off, ""Statutory warning, people from Bangladesh and Pakistan living in India illegally can abuse me after watching this video, thank you.""

Journalists were left aghast at the intellect of Piyush Goyal for not detecting that despite some creditworthy statements, passed off as comedy, the supposed comedy video of Srivastava is essentially a source of huge embarrassment for Modi. By promoting his video, not only has Goyal confirmed that Modi had personally favoured Anil Ambani in securing the Rafale deal, but he has also conceded that government institution under Modi were symbol of poor governance.

Journalist Rohini Singh tweeted, ""Wow. So @PiyushGoyal endorses opposition claim that Rafale deal was given to Reliance ADAG because of @narendramodi?"" Journalist Abhisar Sharma wrote sarcastically, ""As @SrBachchan said in Amar Akbar Anthony..."" iska to bad luck kee kharab hai "" . @PiyushGoyal?"" Journalist Poonam Pandey tweeted, ""This (giving contract to Anil Ambani) must be true if the cabinet minister is tweeting this video.""

Columnist Meghnad tweeted, ""It's hard to imagine all the electoral bond money being spent to produce cringe-worthy crap like this. And yet, seems like that is exactly what is happening."" Pawan Khera of the Congress wrote, ""This minister (Goyal) has honestly told everyone what the former French President had told us but the prime minister did not tell the Supreme Court that Modi was responsible for giving the Rafale deal to Anil Ambani.""

The Supreme Court had refused to order a probe in to the Rafale deal earlier this year. However, the top court's judgement had come under sharp scrutiny after it emerged that it was based on false affidavit by the Modi government."

As the country braces for the 2019 general elections, the impact of good governance, or the lack of it, will be under the spotlight. We aim to increase our coverage of governance issues, and welcome your suggestions and feedback.

Challenge: Climate change can lower the standard of living of nearly half of India's population by 2050, the World Bank warned in a June 2018 study. Particularly vulnerable are farmers who are dependent on rainfall for a good harvest, especially in regions such as Karnataka that are prone to drought. In the 15 years to 2015, only three years--2005, 2007 and 2010--witnessed no drought, as per a 2017 assessment report by the Karnataka State Disaster Management Monitoring Centre. In 2018, 77% of the 30 districts were declared drought-hit, The Times of India reported on September 14, 2018.

Action: A farmer couple, Shyamrao and Laximibai Patil, in water-scarce Kalaburagi in north Karnataka, have shown that a combination of state and NGO support, supported by grassroots innovation, can help farmers combat the effects of climate change. The Patils practice organic farming, run a dairy and poultry farm, and are helping their fellow farmers experiment with new methods.

The couple have set up their own self-help group to sell produce such as pulses. From their mixed-crop farming and livestock produce, they make an annual income of Rs 5 lakh and a profit of around Rs 2.5 lakh, at a time when 70% of the country's agricultural households spend more than they earn on average every month.

Challenge: In 2017, nearly 50,000 women died at the hands of intimate partners or family members, making ""home, the most dangerous place for women"", according to a November 2018 study by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.

India is perceived as having the worst record on sexual violence, harassment from cultural and traditional practices and human trafficking, and is considered the least safe country in the world for women, according to a Thomson Reuters Foundation poll, as IndiaSpend reported on June 26, 2018. Only 14% of Indian women who have experienced physical or sexual violence have sought help to stop the violence while 77% have neither sought help nor told anyone about the violence they experienced, according to the National Family Health Survey (2015-16).

Action: In Mumbai, health advocacy Centre for Enquiry into Health and Allied Themes has since 2001 been running support centres called Dilaasa, which are funded by the National Health Mission, to identify victims of domestic and sexual violence. Using a model of care that can be replicated across government health centres nationwide, Dilaasa centres have provided help to more than 8,000 women.

Over the two years to 2018, Mumbai's 11 centres identified 5,647 women as potential victims of domestic violence. They got 2,554 cases registered for domestic violence and 809 cases for sexual violence, according to municipal records.

Sikkim, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Assam and Uttar Pradesh are replicating and activating this model.

The Society for Nutrition, Education and Health Action (SNEHA), an NGO in Mumbai's Dharavi, the third largest slum in Asia by population, is helping reduce the prevalence of child malnutrition by plugging nutrition awareness gaps and supporting local health workers.

Action: SNEHA's efforts have reduced wasting among children aged up to three by 23% and produced a 109% increase in the services received by children through the Integrated Child Development Services Scheme, a government programme covering health, food and primary education. It plugs gaps in nutrition-related knowledge in the community by training community volunteers, who spread awareness and inform anganwadi (daycare) workers about the status of pregnant women and families who are finding it difficult to feed a newborn.

Challenge: India has been successful in increasing primary school enrolment to the extent that more than 83% of primary school-age children were enrolled in 2016-17, according to data from the District Information System for Education (DISE). But fewer than half (47.8%) of grade V rural students could read at least a grade II text in 2016, the Annual Survey of Education Report 2016 found.

Action: World Vision, a non-profit, runs a remedial education programme, Aparajitha, for 4,300 students in government schools in 130 villages in Lalitpur district in Uttar Pradesh. From a zero baseline, within a year 1.55% of enrolled students could read local content (such as newspapers) and understand it; 6.2% (up from 1.8%) could read a story and comprehend it; and 10.4% could read a story (up from 5.1%). World Vision expects to complete the project by 2020 and empower the community to take over.

Challenge: In the two decades to 2017, India suffered a $79.5 billion loss, ranking among the top five countries in the world to be affected by climate-related disasters, The Wire reported on October 11, 2018. India is taking baby steps towards disaster preparedness, the lack of which is becoming obvious in the wake of climate change-related extreme weather events. Only 7% of the 4,862 dams in the country have emergency action plans, a 2017 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India said, the Hindustan Times reported on September 3, 2018. Often, the armed forces are summoned to undertake rescue operations, such as during the recent Kerala floods in August 2018, despite the constitution of the National Disaster Response Force in 2006.

The Kerala floods affected an estimated 5 million people's lives and damaged infrastructure to the extent that the state needs nearly Rs 30,000 crore to rebuild.

Action: The Kerala state electricity board's quick response under Mission Reconnect restored electricity to nearly 2.5 million homes in less than two weeks. Kerala is one of the 15 states in India that have 100% household electrification, the Hindustan Times reported on November 28, 2018. It managed the task by improving coordination through a state-level task force and an army of volunteers comprising retired staff, students and private electricity personnel."

Agra: Farmers in rural hinterland of Uttar Pradesh's Agra district have locked up herds of stray cattle, especially cows, in schools and other government buildings alleging that the bovines are destroying their crops, amid a spate of such incidents in the state.The development comes close on the heels of another such incident in Aligarh where farmers in the district herded stray cows inside government buildings to prevent crop damage. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath recently directed the officials concerned to make immediate arrangements for proper care of stray cows.

A day earlier, cattle were locked up inside a primary school at Arela village in Etmadpur tehsil. Officials of the Basic Education department had to intervene to get the premises vacated for children who had been forced to stay away from classes.

Stalker dies after private parts chopped off in Maharashtra

Thane: A 27-year-old man from Maharashtra's Thane district whose private parts were allegedly chopped off by three persons, including a woman he was reportedly stalking, has died in a Mumbai hospital, police said Sunday. An official said that Tushar Pujare, a home loan adviser, was allegedly stalking a 42-year-old woman in the district's Manpada area and had also visited her home and told her husband about his infatuation. Pujare's brother, in his complaint to the police, said 15 days prior to the incident, the woman had warned Pujare of dire consequences if he did not stop his advances. On December 25, Pujare was called to Nandivli area of Dombivali by the accused on the pretext of arranging a home loan, the official said. ""Pujare was assaulted there and the woman chopped off his private parts with a knife. The woman rushed Pujare to a nearby hospital and then left from there,"" the official said. ""On Friday, at around 11pm, Pujare succumbed to his injuries in JJ Hospital in Byculla in Mumbai. We have added the charge of murder against the three accused,"" a police official said Sunday.

Girl thrashed, disrobed, made to run naked by eve-teasers

Bhadohi: A woman was beaten up, disrobed and made to run naked in her village in Gopiganj area of the district for resisting eve-teasers, police said Sunday. Police have registered a case against the four miscreants involved in the incident and have arrested one of them, said Circle officer Yadavendra Yadav Sunday, adding they are trying to apprehend others. ""The incident took place in a village in Gopiganj area of the district on Saturday, when a woman from the weavers' community objected to being teased by one Lal Chandra Yadav. Later, in the evening, Yadav along with his three accomplices forcibly entered her house and badly beat her up."" ""They stripped off her clothes and made to run in the village. Some villagers shot the incident and its video subsequently went viral,"" he added Circle Officer Yadav said the woman is undergoing treatment at a hospital and a case has been registered against all four involved in beating and disrobing her. ""One accused has been arrested, while efforts are on to nab the rest of the culprits,"" he said. Meanwhile, Inspector Anil Yadav of Gopiganj police station has been sent to the police lines. (PTI)"

To maintain uniformity in admissions under the Economically Weaker Section (EWS)/ Disadvantaged Group (DG) category for entry-level classes in all private unaided recognised schools of Delhi except minority schools, the Directorate of Education will conduct the process online from the 2019-20 session onwards.

A circular released by the DoE has asked all district-level officers to verify and update the list of all private unaided schools in Delhi along with their GPS coordinates. Schools have been given time till Thursday to check EWS/DG vacancies and update the information in case of any discrepancy from the records available with the DoE.

""If no representation is received from the school concerned, then it will be presumed that the data available with the DoE is correct and students will be allotted accordingly through computerised draw of lots. Thereafter, school shall not deny admission, "" added the DoE circular.

It added in case admission is denied once it has been allotted by draw of lots, necessary action will be taken against the school.

According to the RTE Act 2009, all private unaided recognised schools are under obligation to admit in entry-level classes at least 25% of the class strength children belonging to weaker sections and disadvantage group from the neighbourhood, and provide free and compulsory elementary education till its completion"

Here's what to expect in key areas that touch your life. Learning beyond the four walls

Out of class learning is expected to be a key part of the Delhi government's education push in the coming year.

In Delhi government schools, which largely cater to children from economically disadvantaged families, ensuring attendance and establishing a classroom connect with students has been a struggle.

The coming year will see the flagship 'Happiness Curriculum' project completing one year, and implementation of the new 'Entrepreneurship Curriculum' for students in classes IX to XII.

Through storytelling, 'mindfulness' classes and interactive activities, 'happiness classes' for students of nursery to Class VIII have tried to help students ""get in touch with their emotions"". The objective of the 'entrepreneurship classes', an official said, will be to develop an ""entrepreneurial mindset"" in older children to help them re-orient their goals -- from simply seeking jobs towards innovation.

Advertising

Shailendra Sharma, principal advisor to the Delhi government, said these curricular interventions are laying the ground for changing the education discourse in classrooms. ""The whole point of happiness classes is to reorient relationships between teachers, students and parents. Students are getting the opportunity to reflect on their thoughts and express themselves without fear of judgement, while teachers can experience their relationship with students beyond just teaching. This is setting the ground for the larger goal of education beyond knowledge transmission.""

On the 'entrepreneurship curriculum', he said, ""Hopefully, this will also help take the discourse to the next level, in terms of what students feel like they're ready for after stepping out of school and what roles they see for themselves in the public arena.""

Education, many believe, is also tied closely to AAP's political fortunes. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has often spoken about education reforms in Delhi during his rallies outside the state; AAP leader Atishi, best known for her work in the field of education, has been made a Lok Sabha candidate; and AAP has frequently harnessed the 'happiness curriculum' for international recognition -- most recently during an education conference in Austria in December.

Even though heads of schools have given positive feedback on happiness classes in review meetings -- such as a greater sense of belonging and an increase in attendance -- some have expressed concern that the flurry of new interventions take away time, effort and focus from the core need to deliver examination results.

This year, several schools delivered zero pass percentages in the internal examinations. The ability to match these interventions with results will be tested in 2019, particularly with children in board examination classes being brought under their ambit.

Move to check overpricing by hospitals

The Delhi government is set to roll out guidelines to regulate private hospitals and nursing homes. Once implemented, the policy is expected to be a landmark decision for Delhi residents who have often complained of overpricing by various private hospitals.

Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain told The Indian Express that the government will implement the guidelines by early 2019. The advisory was framed after the AAP government formed a nine-member committee, headed by the then Director-General of Health Services Kirti Bhushan, to monitor functioning of private hospitals.

The aim is to ensure rates of surgery packages are ""transparent, without hidden charges"", and hospitals disclose whether they cover any complications during the procedure.

The draft advisory states that private hospitals can charge patients for medicines at the MRP mentioned in the National List of Essential Medicines, 2015, as their prices have already been capped. The policy also prohibits private hospitals and nursing homes from refusing to hand over bodies over pending bills.

""The department is finalising work on the committee report and will release it soon. The guidelines will change the entire scenario of the medical profession,"" said a senior health department official.

In 2019, Delhi will also witness implementation of the Centre's ambitious Ayushman Bharat scheme, which has run into some turbulence in the capital over the name of the scheme. At the moment, both sides are in a deadlock.

It has so far been implemented in four government hospitals -- All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ram Manohar Lohia, Safdarjung Hospital and Lady Hardinge Medical College -- as well as a few private hospitals. The National Health Agency has asked private hospitals in the capital to join the insurance scheme, and 2019 will tell how many follow through.

AAP and Cong: Will they, won't they?

Wild swings in vote shares of the three big political players, AAP, BJP and Congress, which have come to characterise the city's politics since 2014, will largely determine the churning that lies ahead.

For the ruling AAP, doing well in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls is imperative for its ambition to go national. It has received jolts in the recent past owing to successive drubbings in state assembly polls, as seen recently in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.

The AAP's political fortunes appear to be tied closely with that of the Congress, with the two parties competing for acceptance among the same sections -- from residents of unauthorised colonies to Purvanchalis -- while the BJP continues to draw support from traders and the upper-middle class.

This is where coalition talks come in: Despite their apparent mutual dislike, there has been no outright rejection from the AAP and the Congress that they are in talks to arrive at an ""understanding"" so that the BJP does not romp home once again by taking advantage of the possible vote cutting.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has so far shied away from giving a straight answer -- whenever asked by reporters, he has maintained: ""We will let you know."" He also insists that the AAP will do ""all that is necessary"" to keep the BJP out of power.

Behind the ambiguous statements are hard facts: In 2015, the AAP won with a 54.3% vote share due to the massive dip in the Congress's vote share, which was down to 9.8%. However, in last year's municipal polls, Congress showed signs of revival as it increased its share to 21.09%, while AAP's came down to 26.23%.

On the other hand, the BJP's vote share has remained more or less constant -- 33.07% in the 2015 Assembly polls and 36.23% in the 2017 MCD polls. Only in 2014 had the BJP notched up an impressive share of 44.81%, on the back of a country-wide Modi wave that swept the party to power.

While back-channel talks may or may not yield results, the AAP has been critical of the Congress in public. At rally after rally, Kejriwal tried to drive home the point that voting for the Congress will end up strengthening the BJP. Addressing one such rally in August, he had said that the Delhi Congress has been reduced to a ""vote cutter for the AAP"".

Leaders in the AAP also point to the fact that Delhi will go to Assembly polls in less than a year after the Lok Sabha elections, and any coalition with the Congress in 2019 may end up harming AAP's prospects in 2020.

""What happens in the Lok Sabha elections will also have a bearing on the Assembly polls. Some leaders in AAP are looking at an alliance because arithmetic says both parties together will be able to keep the BJP out of power. But the implications have to be seen in context of the Assembly polls. Will AAP want to align with the very party whose vote bank shifted to it en masse in 2015?"" said a former party leader.

The Delhi Congress, still smarting from the 2015 drubbing, currently under the leadership of Ajay Maken, disapproves of all coalition talks. It has maintained that the AAP is a ""B-team"" of the BJP and that the Kejriwal-led party is ""desperate to stitch an alliance for its own survival"".

Eight years on, 1,500 buses may roll out

For a city that has been waiting for new buses to join its fleet since 2011, the coming year is going to be a crucial one. At least 500 standard-floor buses, with hydraulic lifts to make them accessible to the differently abled, have already got a go-ahead from courts.

Delhi Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot said 1,000 electric buses will also join the close to 6,000 buses on Delhi roads by June. ""The Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System is preparing a feasibility report, after which tenders will be floated,"" he said.

If all goes according to plan, Delhi will become the first Indian city to have such a large electric bus fleet. This will also be key to Delhi's fight against pollution -- according to recent studies by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and TERI, vehicular pollution contributes to over 35% of particulate matter in the city.

With construction of Metro Phase IV getting the green signal, the other gap that remains is providing last-mile connectivity.

Recently, the Delhi Metro tied up with private app-based cab aggregators to fill this gap. However, in an ever-expanding city, buses and a regulated e-rickshaw service are being seen as the only way to make sure people are incentivised to leave their personal vehicles at home and switch to greener modes of travel.

1.4 lakh cameras on streets, 1 lakh in schools

Education and health will be the focus of the Public Works Department (PWD) in 2019. According to a senior PWD official, ""by the end of 2019, the aim is to construct 12,000 additional classrooms in Delhi government schools"".

The department will also begin work on the hotly debated plan to install CCTV cameras inside schools. ""Over 1 lakh cameras will be put inside 726 schools. The project cost has been estimated at Rs 600 crore so far,"" said Sanjeev Rastogi, PWD PRO.

Cameras are also supposed to be installed in public places, such as markets, across the capital. ""The plan is to install 1.4 lakh cameras across the city; the allocated budget is Rs 350 crore,"" Rastogi said.

Also on the agenda is remodelling seven of the 17 government hospitals, and converting 94 dispensaries into polyclinics.

On the traffic front, PWD aims to clear congestion at Shastri Park and Seelampur by building a flyover. ""It's a two-year project to help manage traffic from Shahdara to Kashmere Gate,"" said Rastogi.

Staring at a financial crisis of Rs 3,000 crore, the North and East civic bodies have not undertaken any big projects for 2019, and will instead focus on completing pending projects.

The North Corporation wants to finish multi-level parking projects at Rani Bagh, Shiva Market, Shastri Park, Idgah and Gandhi Maidan to create parking space for 5,000 vehicles.

The East MCD is focusing on Krishna Nagar, Preet Vihar, Geeta Colony, Babarpur and Anand Nagri; and the South MCD on New Friends Colony, Rajouri Garden, Defence Colony and Hauz Khas.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is cruising towards a landslide victory in Bangladesh's general election on Sunday with her Awami League all set to cross the 'magic number' of 151 in the 300-member House, following a tense vote that saw at least 17 people killed in poll-related violence and demands of a fresh vote by the Opposition, alleging rigged voting.

The Election Commission has so far confirmed the complete result of only one constituency in southwestern Gopalganj from where Hasina won bagging 229,539 votes, while her BNP opponent got only 123 votes.

Facing imminent defeat, Bangladesh's opposition NUF alliance, with BNP as its key partner, rejected the outcome of the general election and demanded fresh polls under a neutral caretaker government.

The National Unity Front (NUF) is a coalition of parties, including BNP, Gono Forum, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal-JSD, Nagorik Oikya and Krishak Sramik Janata League.

""We reject the results and demand a new election under a neutral government,"" NUF convenor and veteran lawyer Kamal Hossain, who heads the Gono Forum party, told reporters after early results suggested a win for AL-led Grand Alliance.

""We ask that you cancel this election right away,"" Hossain urged the Election Commission, claiming, ""we have reports that fraudulence took place in almost all centres"".

BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, who steered the party in Zia's absence and won from his northeastern constituency, described the polls as a ""cruel farce"".

A total of 47 opposition candidates boycotted the polls as voting was underway.

BNP's ally Jamaat-e-Islami, which is not a registered political party anymore, announced its boycott alleging massive vote rigging.

Jamaat Secretary General Dr Shafiqur Rahman said 22 of its candidates contesting under the sheaf of paddy symbol and four others contesting independently have boycotted the polls.

""People's lives are in jeopardy as the government continues to attack voters and the general public on election day...Such a lopsided election cannot be accepted under any circumstance, and that is why our candidates...have rejected and boycotted the polls,"" he said in a press statement.

While Hasina is seeking re-election for a fourth term as the prime minister, her chief rival Zia, who is reportedly partially paralysed, faces an uncertain future in a Dhaka jail.

The voting started at 8 AM and ended at 4 PM. The results are expected by Monday morning which would be announced by the commission headquarters in the capital, the EC said.

EC officials said they have received over a hundred complaints from candidates throughout the country amid reports of violence.

At least 17 people, including a member of a security agency, have been killed in eight districts, and several others were injured in poll-related violence, the Daily Star newspaper reported. The build-up to the election has already been marred by violence.

Reports said most of the dead were ruling party activists, while others were workers of opposition BNP or its allies.

Hasina appeared as the first voter in Dhaka centre from where her nephew and party candidate Fazle Nur Taposh was a contender.

""I'm always confident about our victory in the elections... I trust my people and I know that they will choose us so that they can get a better life in future,"" she said after casting her vote.

Schools and colleges across Bangladesh were turned into makeshift polling centres for the day while people had begun to line up to cast their vote even before the election opened.

At least 10 candidates - mostly BNP nominees - announced to stay off the polls alleging that their agents were ousted from polling centres by the ruling party workers.

BNP's Ruhul Kabir Rizvi alleged that polling centres are being occupied across the country, the party's agents are being driven out and that its supporters and activists are facing violence.

Over 600,000 security personnel including several thousand soldiers and paramilitary border guards were deployed across the nation for the election in which 10.41 crore people were eligible to vote.

""Barring some unwanted incidents, the polling so far was smooth and peaceful,"" Chief Election Commissioner Nurul Huda said.

Meanwhile, Bangladesh's private Jamuna TV has been taken off the air. Channel's chief news editor Fahim Ahmed said private cable operators stopped broadcasting their transmission without giving any reason.

An online newspaper quoting cable operators, however, reported that they stopped Jamuna's broadcast due to technical glitches. The channel is owned by an independent candidate in the polls with an influential businessman from the ruling party being her rival.

According to the latest results, the ruling Awami League won 135 seats, followed by its key ally the Jatiya Party at 18, the bdnews.24 reported.

Main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of jailed ex-premier Khaleda Zia has suffered a massive rout with just four seats, it said.

The Election Commission has so far confirmed the complete result of only one constituency in southwestern Gopalganj from where Hasina won bagging 229,539 votes, while her BNP opponent got only 123 votes.

Facing imminent defeat, Bangladesh's opposition NUF alliance, with BNP as its key partner, rejected the outcome of the general election and demanded fresh polls under a neutral caretaker government.

The National Unity Front (NUF) is a coalition of parties, including BNP, Gono Forum, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal-JSD, Nagorik Oikya and Krishak Sramik Janata League.

""We reject the results and demand a new election under a neutral government,"" NUF convenor and veteran lawyer Kamal Hossain, who heads the Gono Forum party, told reporters after early results suggested a win for AL-led Grand Alliance.

""We ask that you cancel this election right away,"" Hossain urged the Election Commission, claiming, ""we have reports that fraudulence took place in almost all centres"".

BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, who steered the party in Zia's absence and won from his northeastern constituency, described the polls as a ""cruel farce"".

A total of 47 opposition candidates boycotted the polls as voting was underway.

BNP's ally Jamaat-e-Islami, which is not a registered political party anymore, announced its boycott alleging massive vote rigging.

Jamaat Secretary General Dr Shafiqur Rahman said 22 of its candidates contesting under the ""sheaf of paddy"" symbol and four others contesting independently have boycotted the polls.

""People's lives are in jeopardy as the government continues to attack voters and the general public on election day...Such a lopsided election cannot be accepted under any circumstance, and that is why our candidates...have rejected and boycotted the polls,"" he said in a press statement.

While Hasina is seeking re-election for a fourth term as the prime minister, her chief rival Zia, who is reportedly partially paralysed, faces an uncertain future in a Dhaka jail.

The voting started at 8 AM and ended at 4 PM. The results are expected by Monday morning which would be announced by the commission headquarters in the capital, the EC said.

EC officials said they have received over a hundred complaints from candidates throughout the country amid reports of violence.

At least 17 people, including a member of a security agency, have been killed in eight districts, and several others were injured in poll-related violence, the Daily Star newspaper reported. The build-up to the election has already been marred by violence.

Reports said most of the dead were ruling party activists, while others were workers of opposition BNP or its allies.

Hasina appeared as the first voter in Dhaka centre from where her nephew and party candidate Fazle Nur Taposh was a contender.

""I'm always confident about our victory in the elections... I trust my people and I know that they will choose us so that they can get a better life in future,"" she said after casting her vote.

Schools and colleges across Bangladesh were turned into makeshift polling centres for the day while people had begun to line up to cast their vote even before the election opened.

At least 10 candidates - mostly BNP nominees - announced to stay off the polls alleging that their agents were ousted from polling centres by the ruling party workers.

BNP's Ruhul Kabir Rizvi alleged that polling centres are being occupied across the country, the party's agents are being driven out and that its supporters and activists are facing violence.

Over 600,000 security personnel including several thousand soldiers and paramilitary border guards were deployed across the nation for the election in which 10.41 crore people were eligible to vote.

""Barring some unwanted incidents, the polling so far was smooth and peaceful,"" Chief Election Commissioner Nurul Huda said.

Citing security reasons, authorities temporarily blocked mobile data services and slowed down the internet.

Meanwhile, Bangladesh's private Jamuna TV has been taken off the air. Channel's chief news editor Fahim Ahmed said private cable operators stopped broadcasting their transmission without giving any reason.

An online newspaper quoting cable operators, however, reported that they stopped Jamuna's broadcast due to technical glitches. The channel is owned by an independent candidate in the polls with an influential businessman from the ruling party being her rival.

The 11th parliamentary poll is the first fully competitive general election in a decade since 2008, while it is widely expected to be won by the AL of Hasina, who is likely to be the country's first premier for a fourth term.

Zia, serving a 10-year prison term on graft charges, has been barred from contesting the polls, while her son Tarique Rahman is living in London in self exile."

However, Department of Schools Education, Kashmir (DSEK) has given allowance to some private schools for only remedial classes that even on terms and conditions.

A number of parents said that there are several private schools that are giving winter tutorials to the students in the early morning.

Parents while questioning the government order regarding the winter vacations said, ""If the Directorate of School Education Kashmir (DSEK) has announced the winter vacation in all schools so that the students will evade the biting cold and when it is not being implemented on ground level then what is the fun of announcing such vacations.""

One of the parents wishing anonymity said that there are some private schools that function for winter schooling, where classes start from 10 Am upto 2 PM.

He said, ""This freezing winter has returned after many years and the students are being compelled to attend the winter schooling starting from 10 Am.""

He said that this seems to be a punishment to the students and nobody from the education department is showing any concern to overcome the issue.

Another parent while lamenting on the issue said that her ward felt ill twice due the cold and he is not able to go for winter schooling in the misty morning.

Director Education, Kashmir, Ghulam Nabi Itoo, said that the department had already issued the circular regarding the functioning of the winter schooling in the valley.

He said, ""We have only allowed private schools for only remedial classes and we have asked the concerned authorities to make proper arrangements of heating and seating available."" ""The scheduled timing for the approved private schools and the coaching centres is from 11 AM to 3 PM,"" he said."

While the appropriateness of four sitting judges of the Supreme Court holding a press conference is still being debated, it has brought in greater transparency in the functioning of the top court.

Decisions of the Supreme Court Collegium, a system in which judges appoint judges, are now uploaded on the official website more promptly. Earlier, the public had no excess to it. It also decided to broadcast live-streaming of certain Supreme Court proceedings in the larger public interest.

1. BEING GAY NOT A CRIME

The year also saw the Supreme Court ruling that homosexuality was not a crime, a progressive decision which brought tears of joy to lakhs of individual who had till then lived in fear of persecution. A Constitution bench of the Supreme Court unanimously decriminalised part of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code which criminalised consensual unnatural sex. The top court was of the view that any discrimination on the basis of sexuality amounts to the violation of fundamental rights.

""Consensual carnal intercourse among adults be it homosexual or heterosexual, in private space, does not in any way harm the public decency or morality,"" the apex court said.

2. AADHAAR VALID BUT NOT FOR EVERYTHING

Another Constitutional bench of the Supreme Court upheld the validity of the Aadhaar scheme but pointed out a host of services for which linking of Aadhaar was not mandatory. While Aadhaar was made necessary for PAN card, income tax returns and for availing welfare schemes and subsidies given by the government, the public were spared of the trouble of requiring it for opening a bank account, getting a new SIM card or admission in schools and to appear in CBSE, UGC and NEET examinations.

3. SABARIMALA TEMPLE FOR ALL

The top court allowed women's entry in Sabarimala temple, a break from age-old practice. The apex court held that ""devotion cannot be subjected to gender discrimination.""

4. ADULTERY NOT A CRIME

The Supreme Court also struck down a 158-year-old law under Section 497 of IPC which criminalised adultery. The provision punished a married man for the offence of adultery if he had sexual relations with a married woman ""without the consent or connivance of her husband.""

Striking down the colonial-era law, the top court said, ""Making adultery a crime is retrograde and would mean punishing unhappy people."" ""Adultery cannot and should not be a crime,"" the top court said but clarified that adultery could continue to be a ground for divorce.

5. NO LAND FOR VIGILANTISM

During the course of the year, the Supreme Court issued a slew of guidelines to deal with mob violence and cow vigilantism. It directed the Centre and the states to start fast-tracked trials in such cases, victim compensation, deterrent punishment and disciplinary action against lax law-enforcing officials. ""The horrendous acts of mobocracy cannot be permitted to inundate the law of the land,"" the top court observed.

6. LAWMAKERS CAN PRACTISE LAW

The Supreme Court dismissed a plea seeking to ban lawmakers from practicing as advocates. The top court ruled that there was no bar on a Member of Parliament, State Assembly or Legislative Council, from practicing as an advocate. The decision cleared the path for several eminent lawyers elected to Parliament and Assemblies to continue in the legal profession.

7. ALLOWED PASSIVE EUTHANASIA AND LIVING WILL

In yet another landmark judgment, the Supreme Court made passive euthanasia and a ""living will"" legally valid. The top court permitted ""living will"" by patients on withdrawing medical support if they slip into an irreversible coma. It was of the view that right to die with dignity is a fundamental right. It laid down some guidelines to be followed in such cases and said its directive shall remain in force till legislation is brought on the issue.

8. TWO-HOUR WINDOW TO BURST CRACKERS DURING FESTIVALS

Concerned over the rising pollution, the Supreme Court brought in a law giving a two-hour window to burst firecrackers on festive days while refusing to impose a complete ban on the sale of firecrackers. The top court conditionally allowed the sale of fireworks that met the standards of low emission and decibel. It allowed the sale of environment-friendly or green crackers only through licensed traders. E-commerce websites were banned from carrying out firecrackers' sale.

9. NO MISUSE OF SC/ST ACT

The Supreme Court removed a provision for automatic arrests and registration of cases for alleged harassment of SCs and STs under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The top court made it mandatory for the police to conduct preliminary inquiries within seven days of a complaint before filing an FIR and said the public servants can be arrested under this law only with the written permission of their public authority.

The Jatiya Oikya Front or NUF is a coalition of four parties - Gono Forum, BNP, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal-JSD, Nagorik Oikya and Krishak Sramik Janata League.

Over 600,000 security personnel including several thousand soldiers and paramilitary border guards were deployed across the nation for the election in which 10.41 crore people were eligible to vote.

According to eyewitnesses, posters bearing the ruling party's ""boat"" symbol outnumbered those of the main opposition's ""sheaf of paddy"". BNP earlier said intimidation and police harassment kept their activists away from the campaign and polling process.

""Barring some unwanted incidents, the polling so far was smooth and peaceful...We could tell you at the end of the day if the election was participatory,"" Chief Election Commissioner Nurul Huda said.

Citing security reasons, authorities temporarily blocked mobile data services and slowed down the internet.

Meanwhile, Bangladesh's private Jamuna TV has been taken off the air. Channel's chief news editor Fahim Ahmed said private cable operators stopped broadcasting their transmission without giving any reason and ""so no one in Bangladesh now can see our channel due to the blackout.""

An online newspaper quoting cable operators, however, reported that they stopped Jamuna's broadcast due to technical glitches. The channel is owned by an independent candidate in the polls with an influential businessman from the ruling party being her rival.

The 11th parliamentary poll is the first fully competitive general election in a decade since 2008, while it is widely expected to be won by the Awami League of Hasina, who is likely to be the country's first premier for a fourth term.

Zia, serving a 10-year prison term on graft charges, has been barred from contesting the polls while her son Tarique Rahman is living in London in self exile."
"93","1029516051","2018-12-30","http://www.easternmirrornagaland.com/where-does-nagaland-stand-after-55-years-of-statehood/","Where does Nagaland stand after 55 years of statehood?","easternmirrornagaland.com",FALSE,"Dimapur, Dec. 30 (EMN): Nagaland celebrated its 55 Statehood Day this month. The state has come a long way during the last five decades but it still has a longer way to go before catching up with most of the Indian states on many aspects. The fact that not a single viable mechanism has been formulated to generate employment opportunities for the state's educated youth all these years provides a stark reminder of the actual position the state is in.

It was on Dec. 1, 1963, that Nagaland was declared the 16 state of the Indian Union, more than three years after the 16-point agreement was signed between the government of India and the Naga People's Convention (NPC). Besides making it a full-fledged state, the agreement also has provisions like helping the state out of the consolidated fund and grant-in-aid to meet the cost of administration.

But where does Nagaland stand today? Here is a glimpse:

Literacy

According to 2011 census, Nagaland has a population of 19,78,502 and a literacy rate of 79.55% (82.75% male, 76.11% female). The state has witnessed tremendous improvement in terms of literacy as only 10.52% was literate in 1951.

As per the Economic Survey 2016-17 conducted by the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Kohima, the state has 2,070 government schools and 729 private schools. But there are only three technical educational institutes that offer diploma in technical course, and only one central university (Nagaland University), one state university (Global Open University), one private university and one National Institute of Technology (NIT). There are 15 government colleges and 48 private colleges in the state, taking the total to 63.

Economy

The Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) 2016-17 at current price is INR 21,119 cr. (9.91% growth) with agriculture and allied activities contributing 29%, according to the Economic Survey 2016-17. At current prices, the per capital income in the state is estimated at INR 1,00,613 during 2016-17 as against INR 92,507 in 2015-16.

However, with a narrow tax base (direct and indirect taxes), the state has been relying on Central fund determined by the Finance Commission since statehood. The grant-in-aid from Central government during 2011-12 was INR 4,246.35 cr., which was increased to INR 6,775.69 cr. during 2016-17. The state's total liability is estimated to remain at 43.77 per cent of GSDP as against the Medium Term Fiscal Policy Statement target of 32.15% in 2016-17, according to the Economic Survey.

Transport and communication

The state has a total road length of 12079.8 km (excluding National Highways) during 2016-17, according to Economic Survey 2016-17. However, the roads are reported to be in deplorable conditions due to negligence by the state government, and natural calamities. The four-lane road project between Kohima and Dimapur has picked up pace of late but it may take some years to complete.

The state has a railway connection till Dimapur but it is yet to reach the capital city. In terms of air connectivity, Nagaland has a lone airport at its commercial hub Dimapur.

Industry

The state government has been trying to promote handloom and handicraft over the years and it has shown positive outcome. However, no big industry has been set up in the state that can boost its economy.

Tourism

Nagaland has turned into one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country over the years. Its rich historical and cultural heritage and beautiful landscape have received traction. The state's annual 10-day Hornbill Festival organised in Dec. has boosted tourism, attracting 2,51,701 visitors (2,702 foreigners, 37,397 domestic, 2,11,602 local) this year. According to the Economic Survey 2016-17, the inflow of tourist to the state in 2010 was 22,499 (21,004 domestic, 1,495 foreigners) but it increased to 61,438 (58,178 domestic, 3,260 foreigners) in 2016.

Tourism in the state is still at its nascent stage but there is potential to become a tourist hub if infrastructure like road is improved and aggregate firms offer viable travel packages.

Naga political issue

Insurgency is akin to the state. The Naga National Council (NNC) started Nagas' independence movement from India under the leadership of Angami Zapu Phizo in 1946 but after the group signed the infamous Shillong Accord 1975 with the government of India, a new faction called the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) was floated in 1980 by Isak Chishi Swu, Thuingaleng Muivah and SS Khaplang. The NSCN fell apart in 1988 -- one led by Swu and Muivah (NSCN-IM), and the other by Khaplang (NSCN-K), which fragmented even further three years after abrogating the ceasefire with the government of India in 2015.

The NSCN-IM has been spearheading peace talks with the government of India for several years now in an attempt to solve the long-pending Nagas' struggle for self-determination. Subsequently, the historic peace accord, a framework agreement for Naga peace, was signed between the NSCN-IM and Indian government on Aug. 3, 2015. It spurred hope that the much-delayed political issue would be solved and the Nagas in Nagaland, Myanmar, Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh would be finally placed under one administrative umbrella but that has not happened even more than three years after the signing of the much-hyped framework agreement.

The Nagaland state assembly has passed resolution on Naga integration for the sixth time, stating that it as a legitimate right of the Nagas despite stiff opposition from its neighbouring states. The hope for a respectable solution to Naga political issue remains to be an illusion.

Worrying factor

The government of India has been pumping funds into the state since it attained statehood but has failed to eradicate poverty with the rich becoming richer and the poor getting poorer. Instead of making the state self-reliant by setting up industries, especially those that will generate employment and use natural resources available in the region, the central government has been providing temporary relief all these years. The Tuli Paper Mill (Nagaland Pulp & Paper Mill) and Sugar Mill are defunct today, leaving the state with no heavy industries. With job opportunities in the public sector having reached a level of saturation and the government of India not showing an interest to set up big factories in the state, the future of the educated youths and the state is doomed.

Nagaland needs a long-term solution that will help fight poverty and facilitate development, and not short-term help that will make it more dependent on the central government. Besides industries, the state needs more educational institutions to offer professional courses. The fact that the state still does not have a medical college (Nagaland Medical College at Phriebagei in Kohima, expected to be functional by 2020) speaks volumes."

On January 12, four senior-most judges of the Supreme Court, including the current Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, called media persons at their official residence for an unprecedented press conference.

The four judges including-Justice Madan B Lokur, Justice Kurian Joseph and Justice J Chelameswar, all three retired since now-mounted a virtual revolt against then Chief Justice Dipak Misra over the way certain cases were assigned in the Apex Court.

While the appropriateness of four sitting judges of the Supreme Court holding a press conference is still being debated, it has brought in greater transparency in the functioning of the top court.

Decisions of the Supreme Court Collegium, a system in which judges appoint judges, are now uploaded on the official website more promptly. Earlier, the public had no excess to it. It also decided to broadcast live-streaming of certain Supreme Court proceedings in the larger public interest.

1. BEING GAY NOT A CRIME

The year also saw the Supreme Court ruling that homosexuality was not a crime, a progressive decision which brought tears of joy to lakhs of individual who had till then lived in fear of persecution. A Constitution bench of the Supreme Court unanimously decriminalised part of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code which criminalised consensual unnatural sex. The top court was of the view that any discrimination on the basis of sexuality amounts to the violation of fundamental rights.

""Consensual carnal intercourse among adults be it homosexual or heterosexual, in private space, does not in any way harm the public decency or morality,"" the apex court said.

2. AADHAAR VALID BUT NOT FOR EVERYTHING

Another Constitutional bench of the Supreme Court upheld the validity of the Aadhaar scheme but pointed out a host of services for which linking of Aadhaar was not mandatory. While Aadhaar was made necessary for PAN card, income tax returns and for availing welfare schemes and subsidies given by the government, the public were spared of the trouble of requiring it for opening a bank account, getting a new SIM card or admission in schools and to appear in CBSE, UGC and NEET examinations.

3. SABARIMALA TEMPLE FOR ALL

The top court allowed women's entry in Sabarimala temple, a break from age-old practice. The apex court held that ""devotion cannot be subjected to gender discrimination.""

4. ADULTERY NOT A CRIME

The Supreme Court also struck down a 158-year-old law under Section 497 of IPC which criminalised adultery. The provision punished a married man for the offence of adultery if he had sexual relations with a married woman ""without the consent or connivance of her husband.""

Striking down the colonial-era law, the top court said, ""Making adultery a crime is retrograde and would mean punishing unhappy people."" ""Adultery cannot and should not be a crime,"" the top court said but clarified that adultery could continue to be a ground for divorce.

5. NO LAND FOR VIGILANTISM

During the course of the year, the Supreme Court issued a slew of guidelines to deal with mob violence and cow vigilantism. It directed the Centre and the states to start fast-tracked trials in such cases, victim compensation, deterrent punishment and disciplinary action against lax law-enforcing officials. ""The horrendous acts of mobocracy cannot be permitted to inundate the law of the land,"" the top court observed.

6. LAWMAKERS CAN PRACTISE LAW

The Supreme Court dismissed a plea seeking to ban lawmakers from practicing as advocates. The top court ruled that there was no bar on a Member of Parliament, State Assembly or Legislative Council, from practicing as an advocate. The decision cleared the path for several eminent lawyers elected to Parliament and Assemblies to continue in the legal profession.

7. ALLOWED PASSIVE EUTHANASIA AND LIVING WILL

In yet another landmark judgment, the Supreme Court made passive euthanasia and a ""living will"" legally valid. The top court permitted ""living will"" by patients on withdrawing medical support if they slip into an irreversible coma. It was of the view that right to die with dignity is a fundamental right. It laid down some guidelines to be followed in such cases and said its directive shall remain in force till legislation is brought on the issue.

8. TWO-HOUR WINDOW TO BURST CRACKERS DURING FESTIVALS

Concerned over the rising pollution, the Supreme Court brought in a law giving a two-hour window to burst firecrackers on festive days while refusing to impose a complete ban on the sale of firecrackers. The top court conditionally allowed the sale of fireworks that met the standards of low emission and decibel. It allowed the sale of environment-friendly or green crackers only through licensed traders. E-commerce websites were banned from carrying out firecrackers' sale.

9. NO MISUSE OF SC/ST ACT

The Supreme Court removed a provision for automatic arrests and registration of cases for alleged harassment of SCs and STs under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The top court made it mandatory for the police to conduct preliminary inquiries within seven days of a complaint before filing an FIR and said the public servants can be arrested under this law only with the written permission of their public authority.

Reports said most of the dead were ruling party activists while others were workers of opposition BNP or its allies.

Hasina appeared as the first voter in Dhaka centre from where her nephew and party candidate Fazle Nur Taposh was a contender.

Schools and colleges across Bangladesh were turned into makeshift polling centres for the day while people had begun to line up to cast their vote even before the election opened.

At least 10 candidates - mostly BNP nominees - announced to stay off the polls alleging that their agents were ousted from polling centres by the ruling party workers.

BNP's Ruhul Kabir Rizvi alleged that polling centres are being occupied across the country, the party's agents are being driven out and that its supporters and activists are facing violence.

Child-friendly and safe infrastructure, trained teachers and tech-savvy classrooms are some of the criteria the state education department is looking at to include a school under the newly-formed Maharashtra International Education Board (MIEB).

On December 25, Maharashtra's education department formally launched the MIEB to bring international quality education in state schools. It was also announced that government schools that will be a part of the programme would be named 'Bharatratna Atal Bihari International School.'

The education department has received applications from 455 schools to be a part of the first batch of 100 schools that would have the MIEB curriculum in Marathi and has now started scanning the applications. Francis Joseph, head of MIEB's development and strategy, said that school teachers who are well trained and ready for upgrading their skills would have higher chances of getting selected.

""We are not looking merely at the school infrastructure or the facilities provided in schools. Schools that have a dynamic leadership and teaching staff who are ready to learn something new will be preferred. They should also have the safety of students as their main priority,"" he added.

Schools that have applied for the board's affiliation had to go through a rigorous application process. ""They had to mention all details -- including no-objection certificates from their respective managements, school heads and information about their teachers and infrastructure,"" Joseph said. ""We want all schools to have a wifi connection and to have a safe and child-friendly infrastructure as it is the need of the hour.""

While the department had earlier decided to allow only government schools to be a part of the drive, state education minister Vinod Tawde recently announced that 25 private schools, 25 aided schools and 50 government schools would be a part of the programme.

Members MIEB's governing board said private schools would be scrutinised further because they need to have the right infrastructure in place. So far, around 45 private schools have shown interest in becoming part of MIEB. ""Even after granting affiliation, routine audits would be conducted in schools to ensure that they are following all the guidelines laid down by the board,"" added an official from the state education department."

Deeply disturbed by the condition of a private shelter home in New Delhi's Dwarka region, the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) prompted Delhi Police to register an FIR against the abusive staff.

An expert committee of the DCW on Thursday (December 27) found that girls living in the shelter home were being abused and tortured by the domestic staff. The committee included Promila Gupta, Firdaus Khan, Vandana Singh and external member Ritu Mehra.

The girls, aged between 6-15 years, informed members of the expert committee that the elderly lot (13-15 years) were forced to do household chores in the shelter home apart from taking care of the younger girls.

From washing utensils to cleaning toilets, the teenagers were forced to do all the daily chores. Food offered to these children were also not of proper quality.

Horrific punishments

The expert committee was left shocked after learning about the punishments meted out to young children and teenage girls in the home.

Teenagers complained that any sort of defiant behaviour from young children would be met with serious and grave punishment. They claimed that the home staff forced them to eat chilli powder in order to discipline them.

Some of the girls also testified that chilli powder was shoved publicly in their vagina and butts by female shelter home staff members as a form of punishments.

The girls were also beaten with rulers for not keeping rooms clean and ignoring staff members. They were not even permitted to go home during summer and winter vacations.

FIR registered

After receiving testimonies from the girls, the expert committee shared details of the case with DCW Chief Swati Maliwal, who immediately reached the shelter home shortly.

She immediately called the Deputy Commissioner for Police, Dwarka who sent a team of senior officers to the shelter home and recorded statements of the children.

An FIR has been registered by Delhi Police against the staff of the Home.

Maliwal has also appraised the Women and Child Development (WCD) ministry about the activities at the private-run shelter home.

Livid at the conditions in the shelter home, WCD minister Maneka Gandhi immediately instructed Chairperson of Child Welfare Committee (CWC) and senior officers of WCD to reach the shelter home.

However, the children appealed to the Commission to not relocate them from the home as they go to schools nearby.

Therefore, DCW has appealed to the CWC to not relocate the children to another home but immediately ensure complete overhauling and removal of the staff of the home. The Government is planning to set up an inquiry in the matter.

The DCW chief along with members of the expert committee stayed in the shelter home till early morning.

A team of DCW counsellors as well as police (in plain clothes) have been deputed in the home to ensure the safety of children. The DCW shall continue to monitor the condition of the shelter home in future.

More than 500 educators from all over the country joined the meet with the agenda of building 'Happy and Safe Schools'. In his address, Balasubramanian gave an example of a cobbler explaining that anyone can be an educator. ""We have limited the idea of an educator to a strict instructor. People give examples of Finland for education, but their education policy leads to happiness because it works on it as its prime vision and mission,"" he remarked.

Balasubramanian said happiness element cannot be built in class ninth, it must start from nursery. ""We work on curriculum, which is like a horse race, which refers to doing better than one is capable of,"" he said and added that such a system promotes jealousy and competition, which is against the idea of happy schools. ""A good school is where children laugh. But today teachers are busy yelling, making children unhappy because they are unhappy,"" he said.

Balasubramanian laid stress on yoga, appreciation for goodness, being truthful and giving unconditional love for becoming happy humans and better teachers. Educationist Anuradha Sinha talked about importance of following passion. ""If we study something that does not excite us then it is bound to become tiresome,"" she said.

The idea is [to have] a director's interpretation or his approach to the classics.""

Still/Life at JNAF presents the Dutch obsession with the humble, the boring, the drab. Sixteen photographers are represented in the show, with 48 photographs and five videos, with a thread of irony binding them all. Marcel Feil, curator of the show, says about the Bouquet series (pictured above), which is a shot of cutouts of flowers and fruits, ""For most people, these are visually related to the Dutch painterly tradition of still-life painting in the 17th century, with flowers and fruits. But, it's not what you think it is. The original paintings are appreciated because of their naturalistic qualities. In the 17th century, when an artist decided to paint fruit, it was quite exceptional, because fruit in itself is not so special.""

Auckland-based textile artist Areez Katki's debut solo exhibition was inspired by the fabrics he found in his Parsi nani's house in Tardeo. ""I'm here on an artist's residency, to finish my first body of work,"" he says. To open on February 2, 2019, at Malcolm Smith Gallery, in Auckland, it will carry Mumbai in its threads, as Katki carries his heritage in his heart. ""I have attached this great romance to this house and this colony and this community."" His designs will appear on rags, towels, doilies and tablecloths.

Book lovers have clearly surprised the publishing world with their insurmountable appetite for South Indian literature.

Co-founded by five music lovers, Hamsadhwani is a series of baithaks held in a Borivli home. For instance, their inaugural baithak in August 2017 was led by Aditya Khandwe, shishya of Padma Shri recipient Ulhas Kashalkar. Khandwe says, ""In an auditorium, the music may not reach every person, but in chamber music, if it's set up as intimately as Hamsadhwani is, then the game changes because the music reaches every individual."" To ensure that, Amritha and Raghuram have converted a 3BHK house into a music venue.

The antique stores of Mumbai -- Moorthy's in Tardeo, Phillips Antiques in Colaba, Camelot in Kemps Corner -- specialise in restoration and resale. But, what they have started paying particular attention to, because the Indian buyer has furniture from the Art Deco and mid-century period, antiques as young as 100 years old. In 2018, Moorthy's launched Pooranawalla, a dedicated space that will only sell Art Deco and mid-century furniture. As RK Moorthy, owner of Moorthy's, says, ""Mid-century furniture is commanding absolutely fantastic value in some of the auction houses.""

One of India's greatest abstractionists, who passed away in 2018, Mehlli Gobhai's canvasses showed little but spoke a lot. Shireen Gandhy's Gallery Chemould will be presenting a retrospective of his works in March 2019, along with curators Nancy Adajania and Ranjit Hoskote at the NGMA.

They are artistes who are all about the littlest of details. Their palm-sized collectibles are not only cute, but explore new materials and the need to innovate. In 2018, internationally, and in India, works by miniature artistes -- everything from food to TV show memorabilia -- became the new hip collectibles to go online shopping for. In a time and society, where extra large is the order of the day, and miniature art is a refreshing genre, 2019 promises to see more of it.

The aim of The Hope Circuit is to ""give corporate bands the limelight they deserve,"" says musician Howard Pereira, the man behind the initiative, where a corporate band opens for a well-established band at Hard Rock Cafe every month. The bands that play are from all corporate sectors, banking being the most popular one. Most have learnt music growing up and gave it up for many reasons, monetary being the primary.

For the last few years, 30-year-old Vashi resident Arvin David, who runs the music company Connect, has been introducing students with hearing loss to the beats of the djembe -- a rope-tuned goblet drum with origins in West Africa. To accomplish this, he invented the ""vibration box"" -- a two-seater box, made with wood of a particular thickness and width, inside which speakers are placed. David's djembe is connected to the speakers via a wireless microphone. He is not alone. Breach Candy resident Nicole Fernandes recently started an electronic keyboard tutorial on YouTube, Music For The Deaf.

Kirsten Varela has turned his backyard into a no-frills calisthenics park and christened it Elysium, a place of perfect happiness. ""The best part about calisthenics is that it's mainly 90 per cent upper body,"" he says. ""Calisthenics is mixing your body with movements like mobility, stability and just trying to create a beautiful movement.""

This year saw the launch of apps like Delta, which are LGBTQ friendly, and Tinder also opened up its platform to be more inclusive.

India's young Instagrammers, themselves vocal about their problems, make themselves relatable to their followers. They address the fans' issues through their posts, live streams (where they take questions), YouTube channel, and also private messages. As we enter 2019, they get even more important than ever before.

Sensing the growing homophobia in schools, former student Kabir Karamchandani formed a support group titled Garv in February to address the issue. While the 20-year-old may be miles away, pursuing his higher education in Oberlin, Ohio, his legacy is being carried forward by a dedicated team of 'woke' boys and girls. Interestingly, the Garv initiative might be included as a case study in a large scale survey conducted by Humsafar Trust on bullying in schools.

In October, the Diss track trend hit India when Mumbai underground rapper Emiway took on popular singer Raftaar. When rapper Raftaar said in an interview that there was no money to be made in underground rapping and named Emiway, the 22-year-old Mumbai rapper released a diss track called Samajh Mein Aaya Kya trying to address the issue. Then Raftaar released a song, then Emiway released another... well, you get the drift. What makes it good for you is that you can follow them and enjoy some quality music.

You browse the website and find a suitable storage plan, then order as many boxes as you need, and then pack and label your belongings.

What is it about Ludo King that has made it beat Temple Run, Candy Crush and Pokemon Go, to become the No. 1 free game on both Google Play Store and App Store? We dug deep to find out how this trend has seamlessly penetrated the lower rungs of the socio-economic segment, galvanising a strata that hadn't warmed up to digital games. Raamesh Gowri Raghavan, an ancient Indian games researcher and professor of archaeology at Mumbai University, believes the game has an innately competitive element which makes it addictive.

Their handcrafted cane chairs and tables, and upholstery can be seen at the BMC office, Bombay High Court, sessions court, sales tax, excise and police departments. If recruitment is through word of mouth, so are contracts, which means you can order from them, too.

Makarand Deshpande, the maverick playwright, finished his 50th original script, Epic Gadbad, marking a milestone in a glorious journey onstage. A farce, it is a conclusion to his previous play, Shakespearecha Mhatara, which was a hilarious take on King Lear. While it was first staged at Prithvi Theatre in July 2018, the playwright has plans to bring it back to the city in 2019 as well.

In 2018, the iconic theatre group Awishkar Theatre brought Aranya Kiran directed by Ajit Bhagat. The play, staged 10 years after the death of its late director-playwright Chetan Datar, is set in the Mahabharata. It revolves around a self-questioning Lord Krishna (played by Sushil Inamdar) in Dwarka. The string of monologues with various lead characters -- wife Rukmini, brother Balaram, foster parents Nand and Yashoda and lastly, mother-like Gandhari -- interrogate Krishna's trickery, political moves and worldview. The play is still being staged and the next show is in January itself.

A publishing house that started a reading movement back in the '70s, is set for a new innings to revive the language of its people. The publishing house was launched in 1974 by journalists Ashok Jain, Dinkar Gangal, Arun Sadhu and Kumar Ketkar, who created an informal organisation to spread the culture of reading among Marathi speakers. Over the years, it has seen several members come and go and even survived a slump.

When Aneesh Bhasin, co-founder at Svami, told us his tonic water has 50 per cent fewer calories than Schweppes, its main competitor, we knew the way we had our gin and tonic was going to change forever. Made from quinine sourced from Congo, cucumber and lime from India, and grapefruit from the US, Bhasin has increased the carbonation over the months because ""Indians like their fizz"". Svami is getting ready to launch more flavours, and a ginger ale by February.

The backstory behind booze

What and Where: White Lady cocktail at The Bombay Canteen; Chanel No. 6 at House of Nomads; Sherlock In A Pickle at London Taxi; and Red Monsoon at Hakkasan

This year, Yash Bhanage, co-owner at The Bombay Canteen, and his research team soaked themselves in the history of single screen theatres as inspiration for cocktails. Not just them, several other bartenders tried to create a story out of their cocktails. For instance, Jiaan Kris J Lam, House of Nomads, created Chanel No. 6 (in pic) as an ode to the fashion house, and Ami Shroff at London Taxi, whipped up a Sherlock-inspired drink which stood out for its prominent notes of gherkin, tea and rose. Order a glass.

At, Harajuku, on Chapel Road, co-owner Saleha Bawazir wanted to bring the street food of Harajuku to Mumbai. So, the restaurant offers a wide range of sweet and savoury crepes; Dorayakis, palm-sized treats comprising a sweet filling sandwiched between two round cakes, among other things. Vikram Khatri, executive chef at Hello Guppy, also overhauled the menu to introduce a range of new items including caramelised popcorn with crispy bacon, beetroot rice cracker and tuna nachos pizza. ""Everybody knows about sushi and ramen. It was time to educate people that there's a lot more that comes from Japan,"" he says.

Inspired by the legendary wrestler, Mini Punjab introduced The Dara Singh thali on its menu this year. Not for the weak-hearted, it packs in the best of unlimited eating. It features 33 items, and includes aloo paratha, chur chur de naan, makki di roti, murg mussalam rice, lamb yoghurt curry, chicken Amritsari and more. If you're in for a man-versus-food contest, here's your best bet.

Development consultant Ragini Kashyap, who started Third Culture Cooks -- a multinational supper club -- likes to tell a story with a bite. Her venture, Bordered dinner, explores border conflict by pairing food with peoples' stories and history. We sampled the Tamil-Sinhala conflict in Sri Lanka, and returned knowing a lot more about our neighbour's culinary diversity.

If you are severely intolerant to gluten, there is a chance you have stayed away from vodka, which is made from wheat, barley, or rye. Well, Tito's Handmade Vodka that is produced in Austin at Texas's oldest legal distillery is now available in Mumbai. The drink is made using corn. Tito Beveridge, who came up with the recipe, distilled the corn mash six times, because it was believed that corn retains some of its smoothness even after distillation. The process of making the corn-based vodka is similar to that of the making of single malts and high-end French cognacs.

It's not every day that you come across pepper in your pannacota, which is why pastry chef Husna Jumani's timut-infused creamy Italian dessert is noteworthy. It's the pronounced flavour of the Nepalese pepper -- spicy with hints of grapefruit -- that propelled her to pick this as the hero ingredient. However, it is an acquired taste, she warns.

The ingredients of Du Rhone might be a well-kept secret, but not its stellar reputation. So when the 140-year-old gourmet chocolate brand opened their first store in May this year, we were the first to rush for a blind tasting evening. Our favourite was the Coline which is a dark ganache with 70 per cent cocoa beans from Brazil and Papua New Guinea.

The last one year saw a rise in the number of gourmet delivery joints in the city. The menu at these kitchens range from Bento Buddha bowls to coconut-panko crusted shrimps with orange and ginger dips. The food, then, is the biggest selling point. We'd recommend the Mis Malaysian Seafood Bisque from Hello Green.

The wandering Maharaj is invited for weddings and funerals, casual get-togethers and Diwali dos, any affair in which the party size is too significant for a regular cook, and when guests need to be impressed. Om Maharaj specialises in sweets, such as rasgulla and ghevar; and Lallan Maharaj, who has also trained in restaurants and five-stars for 13 years, can be trusted to pull off Italian and Chinese dishes convincingly. Lallan says, ""In this line of work, the person who knows his job, doesn't need the title. I have not kept my name maharaj. It's all of you who call me maharajji. So, now, it has become a surname.""

From kombucha to vegetable broth, mixologists discuss what you can replace your calorie-laden mixer with. The almond milk soda cocktail at Colaba's Bombay Vintage has an interesting backstory. Here, Sean Pereira, bar operations manager, uses doodh soda consumed by farmers in Peshawar to keep themselves hydrated.

A food service in Bandra has been made special by autistic students, who have donned chefs' hats to make the lunch break worthwhile. The students belong to the Support for Autistic Individuals (SAI), a charitable trust set up by Kamini Lakhani and her husband, Anil. The young autistic cooks need a fair amount of support. ""It will take them anywhere between one and eight months for them to understand all the steps,"" says Lakhani.

What can you expect when the power couple behind The Table teams up with the boys behind The Woodside Inn? Miss T, a gastro Asian cocktail bar and restaurant. Every cocktail we sampled was characterised by an adventurous, refreshing and comforting tag. The Quixotic (R850) came with peanut butter-infused Jim Beam bourbon, hints of saffron and orange bitters. In the food menu, we liked the chicken and tender coconut curry (R900) that came with pandan rice. The curry was light without lacking depth. We liked the food for its simple execution of flavours and lack of pretentiousness, which is just what an Asian meal should be.

One of Goa's most loved restaurants, House of Lloyd, made its Mumbai debut this year. We met the chef for a taste of the Goa-inspired menu. He has selected the choicest of dishes including rassa omelette, pork chops and clams masala. Now you know where to head for a susegad experience.

Chef Scott Linquist (who runs the Miami favourite Coyo Taco) and Jason Hudanish introduced chapulines or grasshoppers as an off-the-menu dish at Mexican restaurant Xico. The grasshoppers don't have a distinct taste and the texture is close to crunchy prawns. A rich source of protein, you can either eat the dried grasshoppers directly, or on tortilla.

Shunned by society, trans-women have found jobs sans judgment at Third Eye Café. We visited the restaurant to find a place that serves decent food, and the opportunity to the third gender to lead a respectable life. Spread over eleven pages, the menu offers Italian, Oriental and Indian cuisine.

A hoppumm is a marriage between Sri Lanka's hoppers, a type of fermented pancakes, and South Indian appams, and three school friends from Bombay Scottish brought it to Bandra this year. Hoppumm is a 15-seater restaurant, exuding architectural influences from Sri Lanka. The highlight is the bowl-shaped Sri Lankan pancakes filled with a range of fragrant curries. To make it flexible, they offer combinations where you can pair a base staple -- hopper, string hopper (idiyappam), neer dosa, paratha or kothu roti -- with a flavourful filling.

Mastani is a milkshake that comes topped with a dollop of hand-churned ice cream. Some people also add fresh cut fruits, dry fruits and whipped cream. It is believed that when guests tried it for the first time, they would exclaim 'masta'. It has become a part of Pune's food heritage, and you can now try it at a tiny dessert parlour in Vile Parle called Karandikar Mastani House. A simple store with a couple of chairs, this Mastani house offers eight flavours starting from mango to the interesting Irish pudding Mastani.

Chembur, the eastern suburb which last made headlines for a culinary reason in November 2016 when Matunga's iconic eatery Mani's Lunch Home moved here, is now in the midst of a hospitality boom. Want to spend a day indulging your cravings? Do it with as few steps as possible as you start off with Pot Pourri, Theobroma, then 99 Pancakes, Keventers, London Bubble Co, The Koffee Works, Wok Hei and then China Villa.

Did you know that the hair dryer, apart from blowing hair, can be used to relight charcoals on the grill, soften chocolate and frost cake? Chefs across Mumbai are putting non-kitchen items to good use. The stand out was Empresa Hotel chef Ajay Chopra's ingenious hack of using a coal iron to press a quesadilla. Book a table to see for yourself."

At least 500 residents, including students and senior citizens, joined hands on Saturday morning to form a human chain to highlight the pathetic situation of at Bilekahalli. The protest virtually blocked the Bannerghatta Main Road, bringing traffic to a halt.

Residents have been protesting and campaigning against BBMP apathy, but the civic agency has not taken any steps, prompting citizens to hit the road. Residents have been asking the BBMP to shift the waste segregation point at the intersection of Road and to be shifted, but that too fell on deaf ears.

Besides, the location is being used as a local dump yard. The garbage thus gets mixed with the adjacent storm water drain, eventually polluting the Madiwala Lake. The area has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes and rodents, leading to diseases. The number of stray dogs and pigs is increasing - another worry for residents.

Miscreants frequently set afire garbage pile-up, triggering pollution and respiratory problems. Another problem is the lack of proper street lights. Recently, one person was killed in an accident due to the absence of street lights. ""I take this road every day and am shocked at the acute apathy on the part of BBMP despite repeated reminders. What will it take for them to wake up and deliver the promises? One life is lost and the hundreds of lives are at risk. Burning garbage next to gas tanks and gas trucks is a disaster waiting to happen,"" asked Dr Singh, a resident of Ranka Colony road.

Residents also say the road is being used as a parking lot by schools, gas cylinder trucks, trailers, cabs and private buses, adding to the mayhem. ""We are fed up, spending our time and energy appealing to officials in every forum possible to resolve our concerns. Despite paying high property taxes, why do we need to plead for basic services,"" said Gopi Venkataraman, another resident. ""Recently, stray dogs chased a boy near the plant early in the morning. He was hit by a vehicle. Luckily, he survived,"" said a resident."
"111","1029161785","2018-12-30","https://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-quest-for-mental-wellness-2701914","Quest for mental wellness","Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India",FALSE,"depression Statistics from the National Mental Health Survey of India, 2015-16, indicate that 150 million need support for mental disorders , Istock

Every year in December, Altmetric (a data science company, which tracks published research online and provides insights related to institutions, publishers, researchers and funders), comes out with a list of the top 100 scientific papers. This year 3 out of the 100 are on mental health and depression, with one being in the top 10 examining the relationship between exercising and mental health in US. The other two are on the side effects of consumption of anti-depressants and on prevalence of mental health issues in graduate education.

This is more than mildly alarming. As 2018 comes to an end, events like Elon Musk's breakdown on Twitter, the suicide of Stanford University physicist and entrepreneur Zhang Shoucheng (who was apparently in line for the Nobel Prize), and closer home, depression hitting IIT aspirants in Kota, or suicides of farmers make one point clear: The ogre of mental illness is staring at societies rich and poor, in many ugly ways.

The World Health Organization in March 2018 noted that globally some 300 million suffer from depression and in October 2018, perhaps in recognition, the United Kingdom appointed formally a minister for suicide prevention. Around the world, depression is now affecting the young, the married, the working professionals and entrepreneurs, farmers in rural landscapes and also the aged. Unfortunately, social stigma, delayed detection and an understaffed supply side with psychiatrists, counsellors, and therapists make the matter worse not just in India but in many developing countries. To complicate the story, given the big medical challenge of the blood-brain barrier, innovation, and efficacy in the performance of anti-depressant medicines have been underwhelming. A recent study in the UK reported that even toddlers may not be exempt, the defiant ones potentially showing symptoms tomorrow. Additionally, other findings here point to the gender element.

Even more concerning is that in India alone, statistics from the National Mental Health Survey of India, 2015-16 indicate that 150 million need support for mental disorders and this has been now repeatedly featured even in recent speeches of the country's political leaders, including the Prime Minister's and the President's. Some other studies have noted that some 20 per cent of the Indian population will be suffering from at least one mental health problem by 2020 and the lay of the land is complicated by the fact that therapy is not commonly embraced in India. In addition, as answered in Lok Sabha by the minister of state of health and family welfare, there are just 3,827 psychiatrists and 898 clinical psychologists in the country. Further the distribution of this limited mental health workforce is also geographically heterogeneous. While frank discussions here, especially by prominent members of the society like Deepika Padukone help, given that there are currently evolving deep changes in the social structure, mere recognition and awareness may not be able to bridge the gap between supply and demand, leave alone handle issues around financing costs for therapy and treating mental health in a market dominantly out of pocket in the broader healthcare context.

One way to potentially solve this problem may be to take advantage of entrepreneurship and technology leapfrogging the supply barrier. A technology-enabled multi-sided platform that guarantees confidentiality, gauge moods using natural language processing and artificial intelligence and matches therapists to unwell citizens could be a way forward, especially keeping in mind affordability and access. While international start-ups like Talkspace, 7 Cups and Better Help are already operating in this space, even here in India, platforms like TickTalkTo and YourDost are gaining prominence. Several organisations, in fact, are also using such platforms along with chat bots to promote employee wellness and thereby trying to improve productivity and reduce attrition.

In addition, policy interventions are also needed. For example, treatment of mental health should be added to India's national and statewide universal healthcare coverage programmes on a priority basis (encouraging here is to see that the Insurance and Regulatory Development Authority recently asked private insurers to include mental health in their packages) and brick and mortar investments need to happen to bridge the supply gap in professional psychiatrists, not just in urban but also in rural areas. In addition, the government could do well to turn to traditional medicines and wellness initiatives that promote healthy living. Finally, there is also an urgent need to attend to air pollution across India since recent research has found with postmortem brain samples from people exposed to high levels of air pollution (living in Mexico City and UK), the higher likelihood of brain disorders like Alzheimer's.

Also, in recent times, the Mental Health Policy, the new Mental Health Act, recommendations from National Human Rights Commission, directives from the Supreme Court of India, advocacy actions and the introduction of 'Happiness Curriculum' in Delhi government schools are all undoubtedly steps in the right direction.

This is precisely the mission driven multifarious approach required in a country where issues like farm productivity, joblessness, a pressure to perform and compete, societal transformations in the urban and rural landscapes are denting the overall quotient for happiness. One can also draw inspiration and learning from the much successful polio mission here, facilitate healthcare entrepreneurship in this area, spur public and private investment in structural transformation of the supply side and further augment financing of mental health treatment. As the Dalai Lama said, happiness is not something readymade, it comes from your own actions, it is time for the country to recognise that and bolster its quest for mental wellness going forward."

The state government on Friday framed rules to be followed by schools before any picnic or excursion. The new rule not only bans school picnic buses from plying between 11 pm and 6 am but now the schools will have to provide details of a number of boys and girls being taken for a trip, names of teachers accompanying, parents agreement letter, etc in an application to be submitted to the DEO.

The notification issued on Friday stated, ""It is important for students to be taken for educational purpose be it excursion, place visit, personal meeting, organisation visit, museum travel and picnic. But schools need to follow the rules framed by the state government.""

As per new rules, schools will have to form a panel or committee to discuss the desired destination/place, route, time-table, estimated time and cost. Apart from this, schools will also have to take an agreement letter from parents for the visit. It has also been mandated to have female teachers for female students as a guide. For every 20 students, one teacher should be assigned the duty.

To curb the menace of private tuitions run by teaching and non-teaching staff, the state government on Saturday issued a notification that prohibits such activities. The government has come down heavily on schools and have asked the schools to send a certificate (monthly) stating that no employee is running private tuitions. The notification stated: The department has received oral and written representation from student organisations complaining of teaching and non-teaching staff running private tuitions. If anyone is found breaking the rules, steps would be taken against the school."

The unrest in the Kashmir Valley has caused a considerable decline among other things, of the practice, performance/ exhibition of art and culture expressions in public spaces. While the Jammu region, especially the winter capital boasted of a busy calendar with its usual pre and post-Darbar move flurry of 'cultural functions' by different agencies of the state led by J&K cultural Academy and the state-funded NGOs working ostensibly for promotions and development of art and culture.

Hope the JMC's mayor and the team of carporators continue the initiative which has already started finding an echo in beautifully embellished walls of Jammu's private schools and other public spaces.

Coming to the creative practice of Visual Arts, which has given a new identity to cities like Kochi, Goa, just to name a few, the scene in J&K continues to be grim. One reason could be the changed priorities of the J&K Cultural Academy, which otherwise has been the main engine for initiating and sustaining the modern art movement in J&K through its Institutes of Music & Fine arts at Jammu/Srinagar and holding artist camps and exhibitions. The Academy's atrophy can be gauged from the fact that it failed to hold its coveted annual art exhibition at Jammu this year. Much to the chagrin of veteran artist like Triloke Kaul, who along with others had laid the foundation of modern art renaissance in the late 1940s in J&K.

Nonetheless, the individual artists continued to create, exhibit their works and win accolades albeit outside the state.

Theatre: J&K Cultural Academy has certainly given a spurt to theatre art by encouraging amateur theatre enthusiasts. Nonetheless, the NGO groups in Jammu led by dedicated theatrists have been significantly contributing towards theatre movement.

NATRANG: held more than 100 shows in the year and set a record by organizing 8 theatre festivals in which 32 different plays by the same group were staged. Its regular mega events/shows at different melas were 'Bava Jitto' & Mata ki Kahani. It also screened first ever film on Maharaja Gulab Singh.

In the run-up to the admission season, several schools are going all out to attract students, especially those residing in large apartment complexes. With a sprouting of private schools, and parents spoilt for choice, managements say they have no option but to market themselves.

From putting posters to holding workshops and promoting the school through stalls during community events, many managements are adopting a range of strategies for greater visibility.

A principal of a private pre-school in Rajajinagar said the process of connecting with residential communities involves learning through trial and error. ""We reach out to residents by setting up stalls during flea markets and community events,"" said the principal.

Sindhu G., a resident of HMT in Jaraganahalli, said it is a common practice for some schools to post posters in her apartment. ""Most of the schools are not well-known, and want to increase their student intake,"" she said.

Seema Sharma, a resident of Bellandur, observed that the community notice boards in her apartment complex are full of notices and posters from schools. ""While some just announce that admissions are open, a few are invitations to attend an open house where parents can see the infrastructure and learn more about the school's functioning and methodology,"" she said.

The CEO of a well-known international school said they introduced the concept of open house last year. ""We inform parents through multiple channels, including posters in apartment complexes and social media. The open house helps us communicate the school's philosophy and showcase the learning approach to parents of prospective students so that they can make an informed decision,"" said the CEO. ""The conversion rate of parents coming to the open house and applying to the school has been good. But, it is not done with the purpose of increasing the number of intake. We want parents to understand what the school stands for before making the most crucial decision of their child's life.""

Some schools, like that of a well-known chain that opened a branch in Vijayanagar, organised painting competitions for children in apartment complexes in the area while announcing that admissions were open.

""To survive the tough competition, it is important to get noticed. A lot of schools today have professional marketing teams that target the right population to ensure the school meets its admission requirement,"" said a spokesperson, adding that such intense competition forces schools to innovate and improve standards.

While most parents do not mind these initiatives, a few questioned whether education is something to be marketed and sold. ""Health and education are two basics rights and these should be non-commercial,"" said a parent."

Over the last 4 years, the mission has picked up pace and as government says turned into a national movement, with people from all walks of life doing their bit. One of the key successes of the Abhiyan are the Swachh heroes who have emerged across India. Swachhgrahis, as they are now famous as, are swachh warriors who are championing the cause of sanitation and hygiene in India and giving the much need impetus to the programme and help sustain it.

PM Modi, in an event organised to conclude the campaign Champaran Satyagraha, 'Chalo Champaran - From Satyagraha to Swachhagraha' lauded the efforts by awarding ten Swachhagrahis (sanitation motivators) who have performed outstandingly in their villages and set a benchmark for others, this year. The swachhagrahis from across the country are promoting Community Approaches to Sanitation (CAS) to motivate the communities to adopt collective behaviour change.

This Swachhagrahi started his journey by building a toilet at his own home after a voluntary organisation gave a presentation in his village about the diseases that can spread due to open defecation. From there, Ramesh actively contributed to the process of making his village ODF and continued to support the Mandal administration in community mobiliSation activities. He acted as a role model by working with the community to ensure that toilet construction material is available.

His close engagement with the community helped him win their confidence for daily monitoring, resolving issues being faced during construction, reporting the ground level problems to the officials concerned and getting them resolved. Due to Ramesh's unwavering efforts, his district is ODF today, and they are witnessing decreasing health problems and increasing productivity. Thanks to Ramesh's efforts, the village now has 506 toilets from a mere 45 before he started his mission. Along with this, Chittoor district achieved ODF title this year on April 1 with construction of close to 4 lakh (3,80,339) toilets.

I built 400 toilets and to ensure that people make use of these toilets I used to visit common defecation spots, both in the morning and evening, of all the six villages in the gram panchayat. If someone was found defecating in the open, I would ask them the reason behind not using toilets and counsel them, says A. Ramesh.

Ateeq Ahmad is not only a Swachhata Champion, but also a behaviour change communication Champion. Hailing from Bijnor district in Uttar Pradesh, Ahmad, A teacher and professor by profession, is a proponent of CAS as he has trained and encouraged many other motivators. With the understanding that generic communication tools can't induce behaviour change, he created posters, booklets, brochures and more, using examples relatable to local culture and context. While his tools have created the necessary impact in his block, they are now being scaled up at the state level, especially the Swachhata song, a booklet on the 'Key Steps of Triggering' and a couple of short movies on the issue of sanitation.

I have always been passionate about the cause of cleanliness and hygiene and propagated the same to my students. When Swachh Bharat was launched I decided to put my thoughts into practice and make a difference in my district, he says.

Alamarathupatty village of Tamil Nadu is ODF only due to the unprecedented commitment and passion of S. Rajalakshmi, an active member of a self-help group. Rajalakshmi participated in numerous sanitation and interpersonal communication activities, and supported many motivators into Master Trainers. She promoted access to toilets as a right, and made community mapping and motivation as her primary tools. Her regular meetings with Village Poverty Reduction Committee (VPRC) members, and awareness drives in schools, led to public drives for toilet construction and usage.

She hails from Nalanda district, Bihar and is a passionate Swachhagrahi who was nominated for her hard work for achieving ODF status for her village, panchayat, and later 10 wards in the vicinity. A mobilisation activity towards facilitating the construction of toilets, that takes months, or even years was completed in just two months, thanks to Rinku's passion and motivation.

Her main aim was to change people's mind-set and make the community aware about the issues associated with Open Defecation. She held detailed discussions with mothers and elders in the village about the health and economic benefits of constructing and using toilets, successfully, driving a Jan Andolan to construct toilets across villages.

Last year, I attended one swachh bharat abhiyan workshop and that was it. Soon, I started taking more and more workshops in order to learn different techniques so that I can motivate people to construct a basic necessity - a toilet. The villagers are not trained to use a toilet at home, they need to be taught and taught well. If they will face problems, then they will start going out in the fields, as it is an easy option. To change this, wherever I go, I make sure, I am training villagers to construct their own toilet, how to use a toilet and how to keep it clean, Rinku told NDTV.

Morish Jaria took it upon himself to make his Panchayat ODF and fully dedicated himself to the cause of safe sanitation. The biggest challenge faced by his panchayat as well as the community was lack of road connectivity, which hampered availability of material for construction. By motivating the community, carrying materials himself using bullock carts or cycles and even by foot in the more remote areas, he actively led the change. He acted as A role model and encouraged his peers to make all possible efforts to construct toilet, and then use them. His selfless work was also recognised by the District Collector, Simdega.

Jupelli Neeraja is not only an active Swachhagrahi but also a passionate 'Sanitation Champion'. She did all that a Swachhagrahi should do to empower the community members to construct and use toilets. In the beginning, the emphasis was on motivation, mason training, group meeting, and interpersonal communication, and later she shifted the focus to community monitoring. Neeraja led from the front, inspired and personally monitored all the common places of open defecation in her village, every morning. To sustain this momentum, she motivated the villagers to install an innovative method of using two PVC Pipes (6 inches width 1.2 Mtrs. Length) to pour vegetable waste, and converted it to compost manure for homestead gardens & farms.

Monika Ijardar emerged as one of the most devoted supporters of Community Approaches to Sanitation (CAS), a module introduced by the government focused towards rural India achieving ODF. This well-educated, young girl used the approach successfully to make her village and later the whole Gram Panchayat Open Defecation Free (ODF). But this fervent swachhagrahi didn't stop at that, she went ahead and used the same approach to mobilise the surrounding villages and Gram Panchayats. It was due to her unrelenting effort that 61 Gram Panchayats became ODF, and her block became the first in the district to become completely Open Defecation Free.

I tried motivating the women and girls of the house - with questions like 'how can you showcase your private areas to public like that', 'why don't you make a toilet, when you have an option. I have helped more than 1500 families, today they all are enjoying the benefits of having a toilet at home. I won't stop my fight, today I have made Raigarh free from open defecation, I will make sure more and more district get the benefit of a toilet, Monika told NDTV.

45-year-old farmer, Manilal used all the tools available in the armoury of a Swachhagrahi to catalyse behavioural change towards safe sanitation practices and toilet construction. Using motivation, interpersonal communication, village meetings, triggering, and awareness building activities he managed to bring about a huge difference.

He employed advocacy to promote safe (preferred) toilet construction technology viz. twin pit toilets. He turned the whole exercise into a ceremony - every morning, the Sarpanch and Nigrani Samiti members, accompanied by a priest visited households to mark the laying out of twin pit toilet (muhurath karna) construction. This novel practice motivated the households to construct toilets.

When we started the campaign, there were some 280 toilets in the village and we had to build over 700 toilets. I tell people to construct toilets, be disease free and save money on medicines, says Manilal Rana

Yeshi Wangmu's dedication towards the goals of Swachh Bharat Mission has motivated her to continue working to drive behavioural change in the villages of Jang Block - an area where the community members have long had a very negative attitude towards construction and use of toilets. Innumerable Gram-sabha meetings and Information Education and communication (IEC) activities were conducted to increase awareness and mobilise the community.

Not only for individual households, but she also sought wider cooperation from the Panchayati Raj Institution members to make IEC activities more effective. The village and Gram Panchayat are ODF today and the community members attribute this behaviour change to Yeshi's commitment to the cause.

Everyone has an ability to do something for the country. I didn't have any resource myself to bring about such a huge change, but I did make some contribution. All you need is dedication and desire to achieve something. I urge all of you who are sitting there, get up and simply talk to people. A lot can change, if you will start spreading the awareness to others, Yeshi told NDTV.

Bonti Saikia's never say die commitment towards making the village and Gram Panchayat ODF is something worth admiring. She left no stone unturned to ensure not just that each and every household had a toilet but used it. With education as her tool, Bonti started going door-to-door and started teaching people who didn't have a toilet at home about why it is important to get one and the basic rules to follow for a healthy life.

The methods used by Bonti Saikia were simple & persistent, adopted with the sole objective of making the society healthier and better. Today, her Gram Panchayat office is one of the cleanest and well-maintained in the district, and there has been significant decline in diarrhoea cases in the tea gardens of her Gram Panchayat."

The young headmaster of Government Senior Secondary School in Lalpur Village of Rajasthan's Jhunjhunu District, explained how a lot of families here are now preferring government schools to private ones for their children.

Bhadiya, who took charge as headmaster only a year ago, told how implementation of various programmes helped increase student enrolment from less than 200 to 222 this year. ""Innovative ideas such as no-bag day on Saturdays, concepts like emotional pillars, and teacher-student bonding, have worked well. They have boosted enrolment at this government school,"" said Bhadiya.

She was able to overcome a lot of issues with support from Piramal Foundation for Education Leadership (PFEL). The foundation has been offering leadership training programmes to school heads, youths and education administrators in the government system, while improving various education processes and deploying tools and technology.

""The idea of transforming schools through 'Headmaster Leadership' triggered during the Gujarat earthquake relief operations in Kutch,"" said Aditya Natraj, founder of PFEL. ""I noticed that while everyone was fleeing the affected area, one government school headmaster went back to help his students. Without waiting for support from the government, he mobilised the community and resumed classes under a tree. It was evident that a highly motivated headmaster, with good leadership skills, is what it takes to cause a significant impact on student learning."" Natraj noticed that there leadership courses for school headmasters were available only for some private schools, and not for government schools.

Maniram Mandiwal, who took over as principal of JP Janu Senior Secondary school at Jhunjhunu in 2015, found his institute had infrastructure to accommodate 2,000 students -- from Class I to Class XII -- but had only 385 students. Mandiwal managed to increase the enrolment to 1,724 students this year.

The girls -- their ages ranging from 6 to 15 years -- said they were made to consume chilli powder and the same was publicly thrust into their private parts. They also said they were beaten mercilessly with rulers. They said the torture was meted out by the home's women staff.

DCW Chief Swati Maliwal immediately informed the Deputy Commissioner of Police of the area and an FIR was registered at Dwarka Sector 23 police station.Maliwal also requested the Chairperson, Child Welfare Committee (CWC) to remove and overhaul the entire staff of the shelter home.

The event was organized in association with the Government of Telangana's India Joy that happens to be India's biggest gaming and entertainment expo. The second edition of Unite India had a key focus on Industry 4.0, trends in automation with advancements in data exchange and a lot more. The automotive sector also witnessed a healthy interest and was a key area of discussion. A lot of sessions were hosted around the automotive space and Express Drives was invited to be a part of this event.

In order to understand the company's plans in a better way and how its technologies and innovations will help in multiple areas in the automotive sector, we got a chance to interact with three key spokespersons from Unity Technologies - Hubert Larenaudie, President APAC & Global Head Distribution Platform, Andrew Bowell, Vice President Product and Tim McDonough, General Manager, Automotive.

Q1 - How the concept of virtual showrooms will help the customers in car buying and how Unity Technologies is contributing to it?

Ans - One of the things that we want to do is to build a more direct customer relationship so a virtual showroom, instead of a customer searching for a car online and then go to a dealer, is a great way to do that. The virtual showrooms that you see today are just for much better user experience and the question that may come to the mind is that why you need to look at a car that is not much bigger than a particular size while making such an expensive purchase. The reason being, a true virtual showroom will let you, in real time, take a walk around the car, zoom in zoom out, see the interiors, put on a VR headset or build a VR experience so that you can take a look at the car in front of your house or inside a parking place. So, it's a better user experience, its direct customer relationship with the OEM for something which the people are looking at.

Customers can also give feedback for manufacturing and if OEMs have a better configurator, it is also a good way to mint money and hence, can drive revenues. There are also new OEMs that are building electric cars and these don't want to necessarily build a dealer network. In that case, they can sell much more digitally compared to first buy a real estate. So we think its changing in multiple ways.

Q2 - Unity Technologies has tied up with multiple OEMs. So exactly with what OEMs, the company is working at the moment and does it have plans to add more manufacturers in near future?

Ans - So we are working with eight of the top ten. In this regard, we have made top progress since we made this business to make an exponential growth a year ago. And not all of them are public, you see the Volkswagen Group, Audi and BMW that are a part of the Volkswagen Group and there is Volvo, so there are eight of the top ten pretty much. And the same thing goes for the aerospace companies. They are using us as well.

Q3 - Coming to the vehicle servicing, how much time saving and beneficial you think real-time 3D and AR VR are to train the staff at the workshops? Because looking at the current infrastructure, the resources are very limited for this.

Ans - We think it is beneficial in two ways. One is the cost. The cost of building an application at Unity is relatively inexpensive and this is one of the prime benefits. We see OEMs doing two kinds of training. The first kind of training is training manufacturing workers and Volkswagen just recently put out their press release about it and we think they were very impressed with the results. They are getting new manufacturing line up in running. They are training 10,000 workers in 120 locations. So how do you do that? So they build a simulation of the factory in VR and they were able to train all those workers simultaneously with a very tight time window on all its locations and they were getting better training results.

In order to keep the training competitive, they said if you want to win, you have to make the best possible score, not just pass but you have to win. Such kind of scenarios lead to higher productivity and faster work on a factory line and that is worth the time and money. An inefficient factory, a factory not running at full capacity is painfully expensive.

The second kind of training we see happening along is the service. In the old school set up, the employee needs to look at the door, then go to the PDF, then look at the PDF and to and forth ten times. With AR assisted training, I will be looking through a Google glass like a Hololens or a magic Leap One, we put all of them and you see an overlay of instructions so the employee does not need to go back and forth and you can undo your tasks easily. Hence, you are saving time and you do not have to cognitively jump back and forth. So this is basically about being faster and delivering higher quality because you are really not making mistakes. So we think the benefits are very very strong.

Q4 - Speaking of driving schools in India, many of them are employing driving simulators nowadays. So is Unity Technologies working in that direction as well to train people in a much better way?

Ans - Interestingly, a Maruti Suzuki showroom in Gurgaon went ahead and told that they want a driving safety simulator. Basically, a driving simulator comes at a much later stage of the evolution. The first stage what we have seen is creating a full haptic base. A VR fire simulator as an example, one of the solutions based on Unity is Decon Labs in Melbourne and there is a professor who built a full HTC Vive firefighting simulator that gave an idea of how much of factory you can save. Coming back to the topic, the Maruti Suzuki guys reached out to Vive guys and the Vive guys eventually got us involved and asked if we could open doors with the University guys to show and they created a VR safety center and that was the output of that conversation.

So if you are saying a driving simulator, we don't have a used case in the Indian context. But in terms of firefighting, first, it came to the University and now it's our product. The equation is the training value and one of the matrices is realism where it is proving that the more realistic the simulator, the more training values are raised and the outcome is better training in terms of a driving school, a fireman and more. If you have seen our videos, you must have noticed that realism is the key to us technically.

AR-VR for the driving simulators will mostly be done in the west first before it is coming to India. There is a medical device company just to mention, at IIT Madras and through it, they have demonstrated the haptic feedback based precision surgery. They had a session called Merkel labs on the industrial track.

Q5 - Here at the Unite India 2018, we are talking about the internet of things, connected technologies, the latest trends in technologies, Industry 4.0, is Unity Technologies also contributing to the logistics and supply chains in India to ensure that there is not any delay in the delivery of a product in any way, directly or indirectly?

Ans - Not in India but we have some case studies witnessing in Singapore but it is quite not in the public domain. This is abroad technology platform and we have to do machine learning with Unity that is used in, for example, simulation, visualization training for automated vehicles. So generally it is a platform to solve the problems in that space. We probably can't mention that the customers were engaged with that or not publicly. In terms of Industry 4.0 what you just mentioned, we think Unity Technologies is currently in a very good position and where we want to be. On a broad level, the plan is being discussed in Malaysia and Singapore as those places are the hubs for logistics.

Q6 - Any plans to implement this in India as well in the coming years?

Ans - We think it depends on what customers are choosing to do. As a development platform, we will try to make it possible if customers can adopt it. Like there are production lines or power plants and for example, digital twins of a gas turbine and if someone wants the digital twin running in Unity to see what exactly is happening in that physical thing in the power plant. We do have customers doing that. So it is not a specific supply chain example but it is more of a power creation example.

Q7 - Now coming to vehicle design, how real-time 3D, AR-VR are changing the way how cars are being designed. What are the exact benefits?

Ans - 8 of the top 10 OEMs are using us and design is the first place where they all started. If you are an automotive designer, you are designing something as big as this table that's 3D and in case of a 19 or 21-inch monitor, that's 2D. It's very hard so they started using our technology because if you want to visualize your design in real size and human scale, you will have to prepare a model that will take months and a lot of money or you can use this technology called Powerwalls. Most OEMs have 1,2 or 3 so you have to sign up the Powerwall like reserving a really good restaurant so you need to wait a month, get on the Powerwall and if your boss suggests for a particular change which will take another month to do it.

After that, the designers might say that the boss forgot what he told them to do and now he wants to undo it and bring it back. So the repetitive cycles in designs were super slow. What we now have is CAT program with the help of which one can translate the data, bring it to Unity and put on a headset. With this, we do it and in like 30 minutes, we come back and make a decision. And it is much more collaborative. So the biggest benefit is better product design and we can see OEMs building designs faster with lesser mechanical models. Volkswagen gave us these statistics publicly that we can share. They saved up to 5 million Euros per model design by making their designs faster and reducing the number of mechanical models. So basically, it is better quality and lower cost.

Q8 - Would you like to talk about any future developments from Unity Technologies in terms of the automotive sector?

Ans - It is really interesting how much is being done. We have already talked about design and we have touched upon training as well. Another one would be sales and marketing which is really powerful.

We think the way cars are bought and sold is going to change. With more people buying online, they will finally get to the decision before they head to the showrooms. There are two more. One is autonomous driving so we have a number of customers today who are rather than trying to drive their cars are doing it at Unity with the simulative city.

So that business is going really fast. In addition to being cheaper and faster, the solution is also safer. If you can train a car what to do if a child is taking a ball across the street in the simulator, you can't really do it in real life. There are scenarios that are built with really good algorithms after training and simulation. We think we are helping make cars safer. In addition, many OEMs are trying to find out what all people are going to do in that car when they don't have to drive so you are seeing a lot of prototypes and a lot of screens in those cars and that will open a revenue stream. They are offering entertainment services, commerce services via those screens in the car that will be beneficial for all of them. So that's all being prototyped and developed at Unity.

Q9 - Any completely new area where the company would be venturing into when it comes to the automobile sector?

Ans - The last two are pretty new. Also, we think simulation is really just taking off because there is an ecosystem of roads and objects and Unity to generate scenarios and we can see that happening on a massive scale. For us, it is a big move. Simulation is going to happen on the cloud may be its a private cloud or hybrid private cloud and probably not in public cloud so there are going to be millions of scenarios running at Unity every single day. A lot of OEMs have been relying on us for R&D due to our efficiency and we have been focussing on the performance of the engines, beautiful graphics and it will really help us to create something really interesting and futuristic.

Q10 - Are there any challenges you see in the Indian market?

Ans - Well, India is moving really quickly but that only gives us more opportunities and challenges. The market is changing and even in one year, there has been a significant increase in the usage of AR-VR. The OEMs have been relying on us for better solution, graphics and at the same time, we also are growing with the market and it is a very positive surprise. Take an example of Tata and Mahindra, they are global and are currently among the top companies in the world. I don't exactly see any challenge except for the fact that the country is very big and this, in fact, is an opportunity. The number of submissions this year at Unite India compared to last year are quite high and the quality is also higher this time. With the coming of 5G, it is only going to be bigger and better and we a part of this big movement. And India is a very interesting market and is very big in terms of industries and servicing that is going faster as well."

On Thursday the police claimed that the girl was hurt due to falling from the bicycle. Girl child has also stated this in the court about falling from the bicycle. The police also claim that after the medical examination of the minor girl, the doctor has not even confirmed the rape.

On the other hand, the questions are being raised on police on being registering the case hastily under serious offences and the action taken by the police with the suspected minor in this case reflects the sensitivity of the police against children. Counselor's help was also not taken in this entire case. ASP Dinesh Kaushal told that on Tuesday evening, when the minor girl was cycling, she fell and was injured.

On Wednesday morning when mother was making her daughter bath, only then she saw signs of injury. When mother asked about the injury from daughter, she took the name of one of her classmates. After this the kin had taken the girl for treatment in AIIMS.

There the doctor also interrogated the child. But the doctor was also surprised by hearing that an 8 year old boy kidnapped her. But when she was asked about someone else's involvement in the incident besides the classmate, the baby girl shook her head.

Finally the case reached the police station. Then police had registered a case under various sections on 10 years old boy and on another. In the night, the girl's classmate was interrogated but he was unaware of the crime.

Doctor did not give clear arguments:

DIG Dharmendra Chaudhary had formed the SIT for the investigation of the incident. The SIT took the statements of the girl and her father and with the suspected minor boy, in which there was no proof of the molestation has come out.

Suspected child denied the crime. In the medical report of the child, the doctor did not give a clear argument about being raped. The doctor had written in the report that there was no injury marks found in the private part of the girl.On this basis the police took again the statements of the girl. In which she informed that she fell down from bicycle. After this, the police have recorded statements under Section 164 in the court on Thursday.

According to ASP Kaushal, this case will not be concluded now. The whole matter will continue to be investigated closely. Since there was talk of involvement of an adult accused in this case, the police had immediately registered an FIR under serious sections.

Counseling was to be done, minor boy felt mental trauma

Archana Sahay, the director of the child line, says that in this case both the children had to be counseled. The big question is how can eight years old girl can allege about molestation, when she was injured after falling from bicycle?

Why did she take the name of her old classmate? At the same time, the 8 years old child also got hurt with mental trauma when he had been brought for brought for the interrogation on allegation of molestation.

Emergency numbers should be written at public places

MP Child Rights Protection Commission has taken cognizance in the case of rape with an eight year old girl on Thursday. The Commission has instructed to write emergency numbers on schools and school buses and public places, in view of the growing molestation of girl child in the state capital. The Commission has written a letter to the State Education Center, School Education Department and Transport Department for this.

These numbers are:

Child Helpline- 1098, Dial 100, Women Helpline- 1090, Child Rights Commission No.- 0755- 2559900."

The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) will take over security of the highly sensitive Srinagar Airport. At present, the CRPF handles security here. The move comes after a proposal to handover security of all three airports in the state -- Srinagar, Jammu and Leh -- to the CISF was cleared by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) last month. As a first step, the CISF has conducted the first man-power survey at the Srinagar airport. According to officials, the agency would be initially taking charge of anti-hijacking operations.

GPS-enabled buses in Srinagar soon

The State Road Transport corporation (SRTC) will soon kick off the use of Global Positioning System (GPS) -fitted buses to ferry tourists in the state. An official said the state government is procuring GPS-enabled buses. ""It is also supporting purchases by private transporters for easing mobility and traffic congestion in the Srinagar,"" he said.

While the new buses would be added to the SRTC fleet, the private transport companies plying services in the city would be provided certain incentives for purchasing such vehicles. The move is aimed at providing better and hassle-free transport services to tourists i. The new fleet would have a two-fold monitoring system. One GPS control room would be established at SRTC while the second one would be set up at Traffic Headquarters to monitor.

Brick kiln owners asked to switch to green-tech

In order to protect the environment, the Governor Administration in Jammu and Kashmir has asked brick kiln owners of the state to switch over to eco-friendly Zig Zag technology. In zigzag kilns, bricks are arranged to allow hot air to travel in a zigzag path.

The length of the zigzag air path is about three times that of a straight line, and this improves the heat transfer from the flue gases to the bricks, making the entire operation more efficient. It ensures uniform distribution of heat, helps reduces coal consumption to about 20 per cent and also reduces emissions considerably.

School fee charged in winter months

Private schools in Kashmir charge tuition and bus fees for nearly three winter months during which the schools remain closed. By 15th of December, every school in the Valley announces winter vacations till March. However, despite closing schools, authorities charge the tuition and bus fare from the parents of the students and most of the schools force the parents to pay the winter fee in a single go before closure of schools for winter months. People have been appealing the Director School Education Kashmir to act against the schools, who are forcing parents to pay."

With careers today not limited to traditional domains, there are a plethora of options to choose from. One such unconventional, albeit fulfilling, career option is that of a physiotherapist. Physiotherapy is a science related to health care that focuses on restoration of movement and function of various body parts. Physiotherapists help diagnose and treat patients of all ages suffering from health problems or conditions that limit their mobility and affect their day-to-day activities. They also work with individuals to develop fitness and promote general well-being as part of a healthier and active lifestyle.

Healthcare services

A person who has undergone training as part of a graduate, postgraduate, or doctoral programme in the science of physiotherapy is eligible to take this up as a profession. To pursue this course, one must have a background in life sciences such as biology and anatomy, or a foundation in psychology or sociology. Higher degree programmes like masters or doctoral studies in the field of physiotherapy give candidates in-depth knowledge and a vivid analysis of various aspects of this science.

Physiotherapists are an essential part of the healthcare delivery system and play an important role in rehabilitation and other programmes that promote health and fitness in both professional as well as social communities. They are not only the providers of health but are also responsible for uplifting their patients from the mental trauma and pain associated with restricted movement and physical functioning.

Some roles and responsibilities of a physiotherapist are:

Diagnose and manage dysfunctional physical movement.

Promote improvement of all-round mobility and specific physical functions.

Work towards restoring, maintaining, and enhancing physical movement and optimal functions.

Promote overall well-being and fitness to ensure good quality of life.

Prevent and treat symptomatic progression of impaired physical movement, functional limitations, disabilities related to diseases, disorders, conditions, injuries or post-operative recovery.

Options

Clinical physiotherapists: They provide care to patients with activity limitations and impairments/ailments of any kind. They collaborate with other healthcare providers to address needs such as communication and the provision of effective and efficient treatment assistance. At a clinical level, they provide end-to-end care for patients, and undertake their assessment and treatment.

Engagement care officer: In this role, physiotherapists reach out to old patients who may be at risk of a relapse. By making sure that they follow the recommended exercise routine, they help ensure patients' long-term well-being.

Clinical and non-clinical roles: Other roles that physiotherapists can assume include consultation, education, research, and administration. Some may be a part of the quality control team as well and others can undertake key leadership roles in the business management vertical to ensure smooth functioning of a healthcare delivery centre.

Other options: Professionals with a degree/ diploma in physiotherapy have many job opportunities in India -- in hospitals, nursing homes, rehabilitation centres, and private clinics. With the advent of home healthcare services, physiotherapy services are also provided at home and offices. Physiotherapists also have ample prospects in out-patient departments of hospitals, clinics, community and primary health centres, health clubs, fitness centres, occupational health centres, schools for differently-abled children, and senior citizen centres. Since physiotherapy is also an important part of sports injury recovery programmes, physiotherapists find jobs in sports medicine and rehabilitation centres, too.

Prospects

Professionals in India with a degree in physiotherapy complemented by excellent soft skills such as teamwork, good communication, and critical thinking may earn anywhere between ₹8,000 and ₹15,000 per month as freshers.

While the remuneration varies with the company and set up, it also depends on the level of qualification and the college.

As candidates move higher on the experience ladder, the pay packages also get better. The growth in pay scale also largely depends on the professional abilities and the potential of the physiotherapist.

Chief minister Raghubar Das on Friday, while reading out his government's achievements in past four years, said that not a single charge of corruption or scam was levelled against his government during his tenure.

Speaking at a function held to celebrate the completion of four years of the BJP government in Jharkhand at CM House, he said good governance, right policies and commitments helped Jharkhand, which was synonymous to corruption and scams till few years back, to achieve hordes of milestones in the past four years.

""Now, people of the state proudly say I am a Jharkhand resident. This is the difference we made in the past four years,"" Das claimed.

In a bid to fulfill people's aspirations, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had created Jharkhand in 2000 but aspirations of the people were not fulfilled due to political instability, as a weak government does not have the power or commitment to take strong decisions, Das said, adding, most of the energy in weak or coalition governments goes in protecting the chair.

""Earlier, Jharkhand was known for left wing extremism. Due to government's strong decisions and efforts of security personnel, the extremism is taking its last breaths and peace prevailed across the state, which is the main rider of development,"" Das said.

The chief minister said that the government's focus has been on agriculture and rural development in the past four years. Under Ujjwala scheme, 47 lakh gas connections were provided while another 13 lakh women would get connections by March 2019. For women empowerment, Jharkhand is the first state in the country where property in the name of a woman is registered at Re 1.

He further said that 32% villages have been provided access to pure drinking water through pipelines so far. ""We are committed to provide safe drinking water through pipelines to all villages by 2022,"" he said, adding, houses would be provided to urban homeless by 2020. ""The project for urban homeless would start from Ranchi in January, where 27,000 houses will be built,"" he said.

Jharkhand government has so far provided jobs to 35 lakh people and one lakh youth got appointment letters on January 10, CM said.

The CM also counted the challenges on the occasion. He said more works needed to be done in health and education sector. School mergers and construction of five new hospitals are some of the initiatives that were taken in this regard.

Chief minister Raghubar Das also announced that the Mukhya Mantri Sukanya Yojana for girl empowerment and eradication of child marriages would be launched from January 1. Under the scheme, an incentive of Rs 5,000 will be given on birth of girl child. The amount will be credited to mother's account through direct benefit transfer, CM said. The incentive of Rs 5,000 will be given on enrollment at classes 1, 5, 8, 10 and 12. He said that an incentive of Rs 10,000 will be given if the girl remains unmarried till the age of 18 and Rs 30,000 would be given for her marriage under the scheme.

The chief minister also announced that Jharkhand would be fully electrified by December 31, 2018. He said electrification was a challenge in 10,000 houses of 247 villages. ""We have electrified the houses through solar power. Centre had given March 2019 as the deadline for electrification. We have achieved this three months before,"" Das said.

Gone are the days when Indian students opted for either engineering or medical courses after high school. Today's generation is not shying away from taking the road less travelled. Unlike before, they now have a pool of options to choose from depending on their personal interests and skill sets. This trend has also caught on with individuals studying overseas.

The 2018 Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange revealed that Indian and other international students in the U.S. are turning to off-beat courses. While traditional STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) courses continue to be their top preferences, some specialised courses such as robotics, automation, and mechatronics are also witnessing an increasing demand.

Here's a look at some courses that are set to gain popularity in the forthcoming year.

Robotics

Thanks to the rapid progress of AI (artificial intelligence), robots are no longer considered dumb-machines that are only capable of doing simple, repetitive tasks. With the arrival of humanoids like Sophia and SoftBank's Pepper, robots have made huge leaps in recent years. Simultaneously, the career options for students who specialise in robotics has expanded. From doing research to designing industrial robots, they have the opportunity to work in a variety of industries. Therefore, the number of students opting for courses related to robotics is likely to go up in 2019.

Automation

With the Fourth Industry Revolution upon us, automation has already started making profound impacts on the business world. Be it manufacturing, automotive, or retail, nearly every sector is now investing heavily on automating tasks that are tedious, repetitive, and dangerous. As traditional job roles are evolving, the demand for automation experts is growing by the day. This explains why a large number of international students are now leaning towards automation courses. Other than automation engineering, certification courses in industrial automation are also expected to take off next year.

Mechatronics

Mechatronics is a fairly new branch of engineering that has recently caught the attention of students. As described on Stanford University's online portal, it is at the intersection of mechanical engineering, electronic engineering, and software engineering. Broadly speaking, mechatronic engineering focuses on technologies involved in building intelligent electro-mechanical systems. After completion of their course, graduates can look for work opportunities in various areas including automation and robotics, AI and expert systems, sensing and control systems, computer integrated manufacturing systems, and transportation and vehicular systems. Since it is a specialised field, only a few universities currently offer this course in undergraduate and postgraduate levels.

Disability programmes

According to a World Bank report, one billion people across the world have some form of disability. At a time when people with disabilities make up 15% of the global population, the demand for disability support workers is on a rapid rise in many countries. In Australia, for example, the Healthcare and Social Assistance sector is speculated to grow by 16.1% by 2025, creating as many as 2,50,500 new jobs. Students with a degree in disability programmes can find a wide range of jobs. Be it a speech therapist or a full-time caregiver, the options are plenty. Students can also decide to work for government bodies after graduation. Most medical schools in popular study destinations offer specialised courses in disability care.

Infection control

Another course that is tipped to gain popularity in 2019 is infection control. This specialised field of study prepares students to work in an array of settings such as hospitals, healthcare facilities, government departments, and private labs among others. While only a handful of universities offer regular courses in infection control, students can opt for certificate courses or part-time programmes. In most countries, however, they need to get a license before they start their professional career.

Besides these courses, students are also getting lured by other interdisciplinary programmes like geophysics, marine engineering, and game design and development, says the 2018 Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange.

When it comes to Indians, the scenario is not much different. Although the majority of them still prefer to choose a safe career path, popularity for unconventional courses are slowly growing. And in the new year, it is expected that this shift in their demeanour will become more prominent."

On the lines of Anand Kumar's concept of 'Super 30' that imparts training to underprivileged students to crack IIT JEE, the Rajkiya Jubilee Inter College in Lucknow has proposed to start 'Special 50' wherein selected 50 students from across the state will be picked and especially designated teachers will teach them separately and prepare them to crack engineering and medical entrance examination.

District inspector of schools, Mukesh Kumar Singh had mooted this proposal to deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma recently. Singh said, ""On the basis of UP Board high school examination results, best 50 students will be identified. The Rajkiya Jubilee Inter College has best teachers who can work with these students and prepare them for the next level to crack the competition.""

He said, ""The school has hostel facility, best of the laboratories, good infrastructure, lush green outfield where they can play sports and good library. To sum up things, Rajkiya Jubilee Inter College in Lucknow has everything which an ideal school should have. So we are working in that direction to make this school a brand and the model can be replicated in other 74 districts across the state.""

On Wednesday, while inaugurating the first alumni meet of the school, Dinesh Sharma had said Rajkiya Jubilee Inter College will be developed into a model college and more experienced and trained teachers will be recruited. He had said that the state government wants educational institutions to impart vocational training so that students may become skilled as well.

Lucknow DIoS said if poor students of Super 30 can crack the toughest examination then why can't students from UP's government schools? ""There is no dearth of talent in our government school students; all they need is direction from teachers who can shape their future. I'm sure the state government will give its consent,"" Singh said.

According to DIoS once students from government schools will start cracking competitions, parents will be motivated to send their children to government schools instead of private schools where they charge hefty fees. DIoS is hopeful that a large number of poor students will be benefitted from this initiative."

New Delhi: Shais Khan, a 23-year-old masseur from Delhi, has a dream. He wants to be the next Sunny Leone, an unabashed porn star not confined to the seedy underbelly that is the world of Indian adult cinema today.

""I'm crazy about my dream,"" Shais, now a regular in Indian porn productions, told ThePrint. ""I don't have words to explain how crazy I am.""

Shais' introduction to porn came five years ago, when he took up a job at a spa owned by French nationals. ""I have been working here for five years, so my owners used to show me French (porn) videos..."" he said.

The idea of performing porn instantly intrigued Shais, who began filming adult videos with the help of friends.

""There's a profession for everything. There are schools for teachers and parlours for beauticians, but there isn't a porn industry in India, so those who want to pursue this profession have to find a way around it,"" Shais said.

While he has become a recognisable face in the Indian gay porn industry, Shais is waiting for porn to be legalised in the country, when he would be able to show off his ""diverse skill set"".

Studies show the Indian market is big enough to make porn a viable career option for the likes of Shais.

The sixth annual review conducted by Pornhub, released recently, showed that Indians love to watch porn, with the country accounting for the third highest daily traffic to the adult video site in 2018, behind only the US and the UK.

The same report suggested that nothing gets Indians quite as excited as seeing other Indians having sex: For the second year in a row, top searches for Indians contained the words 'Indian' or 'Hindi'.

Pari Tomar, a YouTube star, made big bucks off soft-porn videos (a less sexually explicit variant) until March 2016, when significant changes to the portal's monetisation and content policies rendered cleavage shots and heavy panting unprofitable.

""I used to work about 20-25 days a month, sometimes acting in up to eight short films a day,"" she told ThePrint. While it was allowed, Pari charged Rs 15,000 for a day of work. ""But now those films don't get produced anymore, [as] they tell me they were getting too vulgar for the internet. So I do mostly comedy.""

Richa Kaul Padte, author of Cyber Sexy: Rethinking Pornography, said Indians were looking for sexual content featuring Indians online. ""And because we don't have a porn industry in India, this demand is being fulfilled either by brown actors in American/Western porn, and by homemade porn -- which is made, either consensually or non-consensually -- by regular people in India,"" she added.

However, Indian policy, experts say, has often been out of step with this reality.

Despite the fact that the demand for well-produced Indian porn is growing every year, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) banned over 800 websites offering adult content in October, the censor board sanitises sexuality in Bollywood movies, and Section 67 of the IT Act criminalises ""publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form"" with imprisonment of up to five years and a fine of up to Rs 10 lakh.

The reasons span from moral objections, to the belief that porn is a major driver of sexual crime, as evidenced in the Uttarakhand High Court order that led to the TRAI directive.

But experts and industry insiders say such bans deprive the country of a vast revenue source, while potentially turning a willing audience to portals offering illegal content.

""All the money is basically going into the pockets of international companies,"" said Yash Juneja, a Jharkhand-based music store owner who also makes semi-porn films for private clients.

""They come shoot here, or Indians upload porn on their sites, and they earn all the advertisement and subscriber-based revenue,"" he added.

The true potential of porn in India remains unexplored: Some estimates peg the global porn industry's worth at $97 billion. The US, where porn is legal and users accounted for the highest daily traffic to Pornhub in 2018, is said to alone have a porn industry worth $10-12 billion.

Goutham Shivshankar, an advocate-on-record in the Supreme Court, told ThePrint that the ""the primary target in Indian law is 'obscenity' and not 'pornography', except child pornography, which is specifically and separately dealt with under section 67B of the Information Technology Act, 2000"".

While Section 67 of the Act rules ""publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form"" a punishable offence, viewing or storing pornography in India is not illegal.

This means that you can make a sex tape and store it on your phone, and you are clear legally as long as you don't upload it on a website or distribute it via email, WhatsApp or any other digital platform.

""If India legalises porn, we would stand out as the largest consumers of porn in the world,"" Vaibhav, an IT-consultant-turned-director who has worked on porn films, told ThePrint.

Legalising porn, he said, will ensure that India matches international standards, with the ensuing influx of capital and investment likely to bring Indian porn and its local purveyors out of the shadows and help them carve their own niche.

""The actors there (in the West) are doing it out of their own will. There is no desperation for money attached to it,"" he said.

""Jisko bhook lagi hui hai na, voh dhoondhta rahega jab tak uski bhook nahi mitti hai (A person hungering for something will continue to look for it till his desire is not satiated),"" said Vaibhav.

He said legalisation will also help throttle exploitative sex. ""Porn should be legalised... at least in the name of craft and art, because someone will not get molested,"" he added.

One of the most substantial arguments in favour of legalisation rests on consent. At least in perception, the porn industry has been globally linked with human trafficking, rape and assault, and the dehumanisation of women as sex objects.

But Padte argues that decriminalisation will prevent such exploitation.

""There are so many reasons why decriminalisation is a good idea,"" she told ThePrint, ""From distinguishing between consensual and non-consensual content to creating safe spaces for sexuality to developing a range of sexual expressions -- but I guess I would boil it down to the fact that criminalising sexual expression is a really bad idea.""

""It doesn't 'protect' anyone,"" she added. ""All it does is push the whole thing underground, which means that where violence does take place, we don't have mechanisms in place to address it.""

As it stands today, the porn industry in India largely works under the disguise of various ""legitimate"" professions - Several photographers, modelling agencies, massage parlours and smaller production houses supplement their day jobs with the recession-proof padding that porn provides.

Aungshita Chatterjee, 43, has dreams of becoming an international boudoir photographer, and while her aim may be a legal one, she tells ThePrint that ""at some point, a lot of the other photographers discovered that their DSLRs come with an in-built video option"".

""So yes, porn is being made -- in bedrooms and guest houses and studios, and it's uploaded on international servers or sold to clients from Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Russia, and the United Kingdom through brokers,"" she said.

According to Aungshita, who says she was also once offered $75,000 by an American producer named Cedric to shoot a porn film with Indian models, the porn industry is pan-India, with behind-the-scenes producers operating from Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta, and ""especially the south"".

But TRAI bans websites with pornographic content that are hosted on Indian domains -- so where does one upload these films?

According to Sameer, a Chennai-based filmographer who acts as the logistical matchmaker between a porn producer and a model in south India, Indians have found a way to circumvent even that obstacle. ""Everything is uploaded on Twitter, Tumblr and xvideos,"" he told ThePrint. When asked what happens in these movies, he said, ""Direct sex.""

South India is where the money is, added Juneja, because actors are easier to source, more willing to take risk on screen, and ""less likely to throw tantrums or be afraid of backlash from society"".

Sameer said at least a hundred such movies are produced monthly in the south, with actors getting paid up to Rs 50,000 per movie. The films are usually 50 minutes long and the whole production costs between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh.

However, much of Indian porn is defined by hand-held cameras, mobile phones balanced against a wall, mirrors, and low resolution, which doesn't seem to be satisfying viewers increasingly seeking out high-definition content.

According to the Pornhub report, 'HD' or 'high-definition' emerged as a popular keyword in searches keyed in by Indians.

In response to a report on ThePrint about the Pornhub review, a Reddit user claimed he had been ""looking for Desi HD for about ten years. It's just not there"".

""The best you get is a guy/gal with a good mobile phone,"" he wrote.

Everything apart, experts and insiders say the consequences of an underground industry can be severe. Informal productions don't entitle actors to health check-ups, salary standards, or protection from exploitation.

Even someone like Shais, who says that his years in the sex industry had forced him to develop a thick skin, knows everyone cannot be trusted.

He recalls paying a friend Rs 30,000 for a film he was told would be shot with good equipment.

The students of St Mary's School - ICSE, and their parents have to navigate through a narrow road, a missing zebra crossing, and taxis parked anywhere to get to it everyday. The parents claim taxi drivers often refuse to ferry them, allegedly because they want long-distance fares.

Nesbit Road where the school is situated, connects Dr B R Ambedkar Road to several areas in Mazgaon. It passes over the Central Railway tracks through a road overbridge, and this is where the challenge starts for the school going kids and their parents.

A woman traffic constable and a traffic warden are posted outside the school, but parents say there should be more such personnel there

With two schools and a college along this all important road, reaching the school through the traffic is a daunting task for kids and parents. There are three important educational institutions along Nesbit Road including St. Mary's School - ICSE, Burhani College of Commerce and Arts, and Diamond Jubilee High School near Byculla Railway Colony.

As the school starts in the morning and ends at around 3 pm, the biggest problem then the students and parents have to face, is crossing the narrow but busy road. Some private vehicles which come to pick up the kids are also parked anywhere.

While a lady traffic police constable and a traffic warden manage traffic when the school ends, the parents complained that there is a need for more personnel as there are two schools along the road. While the footpaths were in proper shape and condition, the zebra crossing was missing in many places. Some parents demanded action against taxi drivers who refuse to ferry passengers.

Major problems

. Illegal parking of private vehicles and taxis on the road and adjacent bridge

. Missing zebra crossing and traffic signal

. Few traffic personnel on duty

. Lack of dividers on the road"

Following the mode of campaigns run by privately-managed educational institutions, government schools across the state have started a massive advertising campaign ahead of commencement of the new academic session on January 1, featuring achievements and facilities of the schools.

Sources in the education department said the state government's recent decision to provide annual administrative grants to schools on the basis of enrolled positions has added an impetus to this campaign.

Banners portraying facilities and accomplishments at entrances of schools has become a common sight. Some school authorities have also launched a social media campaign, named Utsav Vidyarambha, an annual enrolment drive conducted every year with the help of local community and students, to enhance enrolment in schools.

""From this year, the publicity campaign for Utsav Vidyarambha has been launched on a massive scale. The prime thrust is to change the prevailing notion of most guardians that the quality of education in the state-government schools are not at par with private schools. Let's spread the message that trained and qualified teachers are imparting education in government-run schools and the admissions as well as other facilities are totally free for the newly enrolled kids at the primary level,"" a senior official of the education department told TOI on Friday.

Checking the decrease in enrolment, something which was detected as a major worry in Gunotsav, is the primary agenda behind launching such a publicity campaign, he added.

As per the new guidelines, schools with enrolment of 60 or below will not get any financial support, schools having enrolment of 61 to 400 will get financial support of Rs 20,000, schools having enrolment of 401 to 600 will get financial support of Rs 25,000 and schools having enrolment of more than 600 will get financial support of Rs 35,000."

I sometimes wonder when it stops being about celebrating love, though, and starts becoming a naked display that serves no real purpose. Pic courtesy/Twitter

I like Beyoncé as much as the next person, probably because it's hard to find fault with someone as hard-working and as obviously gifted. I do have mixed feelings about her turning up to a wedding reception though, not because guests at weddings shouldn't have the opportunity of gyrating to 'Crazy In Love' but because I wonder about the kind of message being sent by such blatant displays of ostentatiousness.

A significant number of people spent a lot of time discussing Beyoncé's appearance at a private wedding reception in India this month. They also spent a lot of time tracking the presence of other celebrities at the same function. There were Bollywood stars who danced, sang, entertained the guests and posed for selfies that promptly flooded Instagram along with hashtags congratulating the couple. There were reports about the food, lists about designers who dressed the guests, and rumours about the price of each invitation card. What I didn't see were questions about the point of the entire exercise or why it didn't matter to anyone outside the family.

There have always been big weddings, of course, because what's the point of having a lot of money if you can't tell the world about it? I sometimes wonder when it stops being about celebrating love, though, and starts becoming a naked display that serves no real purpose. After all, how different is a wedding costing a crore from one that costs 10 crore? Every decade brings with it a massive wedding for lifestyle magazines to swoon over. There was that steel tycoon, for example, who spent a reported $60 million to fly in 1,000 guests from around the world by private jet for a six-day reception in France.

Maybe there's nothing wrong with these insane amounts of money thrown at what is, after all, supposed to be a celebration of love. Maybe we would all do it if we could, because showing off is such an intrinsic aspect of human nature. Maybe it's sour grapes that compel some of us to moan about how the money could have been better spent by feeding the poor instead of pandering to the rich. And yet, there still seems something fundamentally wrong about a society that encourages these private celebrations and ignores what they signify. It still seems wrong to allocate more space to celebrity-spotting than to issues that are routinely brushed under carpets at the behest of the same people who throw lavish receptions.

I remember a massive wedding held at the Hotel President, when I was little. I don't remember who the people throwing the party were, but assume they were relatives of mine which may explain why my family was invited. I liked it, of course, because what child wouldn't be impressed by a dessert counter that went on forever? The fact that the people behind the reception no longer register in my consciousness says a lot about the impact these events have on attendees. Will the couple serenaded by Beyoncé have a better married life than the rest of us? Will the singer's presence insure them against rough weather?

One of the nicest things that some schools in Bombay now do is set up rules on what children can bring to class on their birthdays. When I was in school, I remember classmates sometimes arriving with truckloads of gifts, liberally distributed among their own classrooms as well as the entire institution, because that's how some parents wanted their children's birthdays to be celebrated. I remember the feelings of inadequacy those gifts left the rest of us with, because we had to make do with chocolate eclairs distributed among classmates on our own birthdays.

Austerity isn't a bad thing to inculcate in children, especially in a county as poor as ours, where the gap between the rich, the middle class and the shockingly poor only widens each year. If we raise children who learn to recognise the importance of life events, rather than the fireworks that celebrate it, maybe we will someday have a generation of Indians who learn to ask more questions about inequality than are being asked today.

So, invite Beyoncé, by all means. Bring in Presidents and Hollywood stars. Throw in a few free meals for the poor to balance it out and get some good press in the bargain. Try and look at the larger picture though, so we never forget that small gestures are often more meaningful than big celebrations that end up feeling mysteriously empty."

With the new academic year set to commence in the next few months, there are various key decisions that are now lying in the backburner as the CM is yet to allot ministries to the newly-elected members of the assembly.

Take for instance the schedule for common entrance tests and school admissions. Last year, the Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE) had declared the schedule for all common entrance tests on December 28 and released the admission schedule for schools on December 30. However, this year, the government is yet to commence the process for the same. ""The release of the schedule will take another 2-3 weeks. We have to wait before the minister of education department is appointed,"" said Papi Reddy, chairman of TSCHE, adding that there won't be much of loss as there is sufficient time before the exams are held.

Finalising of a committee to issue notification for fee fixation of professional courses also lies pending. ""First, a committee is constituted that will issue a notification calling applications from private colleges to fix the fee structure for the next three years. Once we receive applications, the same shall be audited and subsequently fee will be fixed. However, we have to wait for the minister to be appointed to seek approval on the committee,"" said Rama Rao, consultant at Telangana Admission and Fee Regulatory Committee (TAFRC).

Other aspects such as affiliation process for intermediate colleges and finalization of admission process for degree courses are also pending.

Making matters worse, several key positions such as principal secretary, commissioner of school education and chairman of the TAFRC also have to be finalised by the new education minister.

The delay by the chief minister has not only irked the opposition parties but also the parents community. ""The fee hike issue has been pending for the last four years. While the TRS party added the school fee issue in it's manifestos in 2014 as well this year, no results were yielded. Once the education minister is appointed, we intend to meet him and seek relief before commencement of the new academic year,"" said Subramanyam Neerukonda, president of Hyderabad School Parents Association (HSPA)."

The Bill seeks to amend section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 by replacing the assumption of consent under the pretext of a woman being married with the word, ""that her consent is given because she believes that he is another man with whom she wants to engage in sexual intercourse or sexual acts.""

Apart from that, the Bill also proposes an amendment to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act to allow for legal termination of pregnancy below twenty-four weeks, with exceptions such as endangering the life of the woman. The Bill also lays down a provision for public schools to provide girls with free sanitary napkins, as well as separate toilets for boys and girls.

Tharoor says that the bill seeks to shifting from the idea of 'no means no' to 'yes means yes'. ""The Bill seeks to restore a woman's autonomy, married or otherwise, including her sexual, reproductive and menstrual rights.

Buoyed by the recent assembly poll victory in the Hindi heartland states, the Congress's poll manifesto for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections proposes to roll out a road map for integrated development of agriculture. The party plans to effectively tackle farm distress and boost growth.

The Congress aims to provide an industry status to the agriculture sector. It plans to roll out a comprehensive package which includes crop loan waiver for small farmers and also focus on development of irrigation, poultry, dry land and barren land. The Congress's poll plank is: ""Towards faster and more inclusive growth"" to counter BJP's ""sabka saath sabka vikas"".

The party plans to focus on the promotion of micro, small and medium enterprises which it believes is a ""reservoir of employment generation.""

The party proposes to pay adequate attention on the skill development to encourage job creators instead of job seekers.

It also promises massive recruitment in schools and colleges and rationalisation of fee structure in private education institutions.

The manifesto committee's senior academician member told DNA, ""The Congress will give justice to all frustrated sections of the society and revive economic growth through reforms with human face. Investments will be encouraged in both public and private sectors with a thrust on welfare state. The party strongly believes that with this model the benefits of growth will reach to vulnerable sections of the society.""

''The government's role in Rafale deal, its mishandling of demonetization and implementation of GST regime will be highlighted. The party will also discuss BJP's alleged attempts to polarise society by raking up the Ram temple issue.""

The carnival began with the performance of girls from Sea Cadet Corps (SCC), followed by the Naval Band. A large number of students from around 30 schools, entertained the crowd with their myriad performances. The carnival, marched from Andhra University Convention Centre to the main venue at RK Beach. Students from DAV School, Visakha Valley school, Sri Chaitanya Techno, Sri Krishna Grammar School and many others took part, carrying placards 'We love Vizag'.

Athletes from the District Sports Authority, representing various teams such as hockey, football, basketball, archery, cycling and boxing were also part of the contingent.

Preeti MehraWith young people forming a third of the country's population and very few jobs available, skilling the youth has become vital for tackling unemployment in the long and medium term. How is that to be done?

Instead of guessing what skills are required to equip the massive youth population, listen to the youth and listen to the potential employers, says Omar Abdi, Executive Director for Programmes, Unicef, who was in India recently.

His agency is the co-ordinator of a platform that is bringing together multi-stakeholders who wish to turn the country's youth into a demographic opportunity. And to do it has been formed YuWaah! It is a platform that includes the Central government, state governments, the private sector, civil society organisations and several UN agencies. The aim is to co-create solutions for young people, including flexible learning programmes, life and employability skills, career guidance and work opportunities.

To bring about large-scale change through such a multi-partnership, YuWaah! plans to identify the priority areas, bring networks together, listen to adolescents and youth and involve them in creating the right solutions. Partners would also share funding and resources according to their role, strength and ability.

But first Unicef decided to listen to the adolescents and youth to understand their needs, aspirations and how they want to go forward. This was done through State-level consultations that threw up vital suggestions and pointed towards the challenges the young face.

""All my friends want to move out of my village for better employment opportunities. We need viable solutions at village level to address the issue of migration,"" said a young person from Bihar. His/her counterpart in Maharashtra wanted ""a Resource Centre in school and communities for career guidance, education and schemes related to employment opportunities."" A young girl from West Bengal said, ""In my local area, we girls lose the opportunity to build our own lives due to child marriage. This must be stopped. We must get equal opportunities to study, earn and to be independent.""

Youth from Jharkhand felt career guidance should be incorporated in the school learning so that after graduation it is easy to get information on education opportunities and career choices. A youngster from Gujarat requested for flexible learning and equal job opportunities for children dropping out of schools and those affected by seasonal migration. Many of the children spoke of challenges due to caste discrimination, the lack of access and affordability of secondary education, low parental support to break social barriers, hardly any flexible learning and digital education opportunities and, most of all, low self-confidence.

These voices, Unicef hopes, will help the partners sit together to ""design, scale up and deliver the education, training and support that young people need, to shape better futures for themselves and their societies.""

The UN agency points out that in the next 20 years, India's current population of 444 million children will enter the job market. ""It is a double-sided coin for India... and can be a big opportunity for India,"" says Abdi. ""This is the time to invest in our youth... a second big wave of investment after education."""

As the Opposition slammed the decision to impose President's Rule in Jammu and Kashmir, Home Minister Rajnath Singh told Lok Sabha on Friday said that no party was in a position to form government in the state and asserted that the Centre is ""ready"" for an Assembly election.

He also rejected claims by the Opposition that the BJP was propping up a regional party to form a government, saying that if his party had such an intention, it would have done so within six months of the Governor's Rule.

""The government doesn't conduct elections but the government is ready for the election. It is the responsibility of the Election Commission to hold elections... we are totally committed to the democratic process,"" Singh told the lower house while replying to the Statutory Resolution on imposition of President's Rule in Jammu and Kashmir.

The resolution was adopted by a voice vote.

As the 60ft-wide road does not have much of traffic police presence, it has become convenient for drivers to park their vehicles permanently there. Traffic police monitor the key Ambattur Industrial Estate Main Road, which is maintained by the State Highways Department. ""We have been facing the problem of illegal parking for many months. Despite complaints to civic authorities, lorries are parked along the stretch, making it risky for road-users,"" says V. Rajagopal, president, Anna Nagar Western Extension Phase - II Residents Welfare Association.

Connecting Ambattur and Tirumangalam, the 1.5-km road provides access for residents of many streets including Vinayakar Koil Street, Gandhi Street, Ambedkar Street and Anna Street to Anna Nagar, Thirumangalam, Padi, Kolathur and the Poonamallee High (PH) Road. Further, it also connects the residential area with the busy Jawaharlal Nehru (J.N)Main Road. The road is lined with commercial buildings, including private hospitals, schools, residential quarters and other public utilities such as banks and petrol pumps.

Every day, on an average, around 1,500 vehicles use the TVS Colony Main Road to reach various parts of the city. as The road is bitumen topped, less congested and has a wide footpath and streetlights. As a result, workers from hundreds of industrial units in Pattaravakkam, Korattur and Ambattur use the road to reach CMBT, Koyambedu.

Taking advantage of the width of the road, drivers of heavy vehicles, including tankers, park their vehicles on the road permanently to evade police patrol. Schoolchildren and senior citizens are scared to use the stretch as lorries take a sudden turn without noticing pedestrians. Further, drivers of these vehicles loiter around the spot all through the day, creating nuisance to the residents.

From the CBSE Class 12 Economics exam paper leak to alleged leak of Staff Selection Commission's (SSC) CGL 2017 exam. The probe is on in these cases.

The government's decision to scrap homework for Class 1, 2 students, and setting limits to the weight of school bags to granting the Institute of Eminence status to best institutes of India was praised by many, likewise many academicians criticised its role to dissolve University Grants Commission (UGC). As the year draws to a close, we look back at some of the crucial events and decisions happened in the education sector.

Year-ender 2018: Top education news of this year Institute of Eminence status

The Union Human Resource Development Ministry in July granted the Institution of Eminence (IoE) status to the IIT Delhi, IIT Bombay and IISc Bangalore. From the private sector, the Manipal Academy of Higher Education, BITS Pilani, and Jio Institute were granted the tag. The UGC had received 103 applications including JNU and Delhi University for IoE status. The selection of Reliance Foundation's non-existent Jio Institute triggered a political debate with the Opposition accusing the NDA of favouritism. As per the RTI filed by The Indian Express, the government internally disagreed about the Jio institute,

CBSE paper leak

The paper leak of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE Class 10, 12) examinations is one of the biggest education scams of this year, as the board has to cancel the papers of both Class 12 examinations following the leak. The police had made significant arrest in this case, 12 people were arrested from Bihar in connection CBSE Class 10 Mathematics paper leak, and three from Delhi for CBSE Class 12 Economics paper leak.

Advertising

To prevent the paper leak, from this year the board is planning to use encrypted question papers. Under the encrypted system, each examination centre will be provided with login details and the question paper will be printed in the school and then photocopied and distributed.

No homework for classes 1, 2 students, HRD ministry limits school bag weight

The students of classes 1 and 2 do not have to do homework, as per the directives issued by the Human Resources Development (HRD) Ministry to states and union territories. The directives also mentioned the prescribed weight limit of school bags for each class.

According to the official order, the HRD ministry has ""instructed all the states and Union Territories to formulate guidelines to regulate the teaching of subjects and weight of school bags in accordance with the Government of India instructions"".

As per these instructions, which the schools have been asked to comply with, institutions cannot assign homework to students of classes I and II. ""Schools should not prescribe any other subjects except language and mathematics for classes I and II and language, EVS and mathematics for classes III to V students as prescribed by the NCERT,"" the order said.

JEE Main to be conducted twice a year

The HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar in July announced that JEE (Mains) will be conducted twice a year. While the JEE (Mains) will be held in January and April, NEET will be conducted in May, the minister said.

The latest development has come as a breather for many students grappling with the inadequate time to prepare for these exams, which were previously conducted once a year. Earlier, students used to appear for these exams just after their Class 12 Board, forcing them to focus on their board and entrance exams simultaneously.

CBSE relaxes passing criteria for Class 10 students

In a relief to Class 10 students, the Central Board of Secondary Education has extended the passing criteria. ""To give relaxation to students, the board has decided to ease the passing criteria for Class 10 students from 2019,"" said CBSE chairman Anita Karwal. From next year, the students need to get a minimum of 33 per cent marks in theory and practical combined to declare pass in the subject.

""It has now been decided to extend the same passing criteria henceforth for the students of secondary classes i.e. candidates appearing for Class 10 examination 2019 onwards will have to secure 33 per cent (both taken together) in the subjects to be eligible to pass the subject,"" mentioned the official release. Earlier, CBSE had announced that students do not have to pass separately in theory as well as practical exams.

Senior executives can now be IIM director

Future directors of the prestigious Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) may no longer need to have anything to do with academia -- or even possess a PhD. According to rules notified under the IIM Act this week, executives, who have been in senior management roles for at least 15 years, will now be eligible to be appointed as directors.

The premier business schools, in the past, have been headed by corporate executives, but such examples are few and far between. Ravi J Matthai, the first full-time director of IIM-Ahmedabad in 1965, and Subir Chowdhury, who headed IIM-Calcutta in the 1990s, are two such examples.

Scrapping of UGC

The Human Resource Development (HRD) Ministry had in July announced its decision to replace the University Grants Commission (UGC) with the Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) by repealing the UGC Act, 1951.

According to a draft, which has been placed in the public domain by the ministry to seek feedback from the stakeholders, the new commission will solely focus on the academic matters and monetary grants would be under the purview of the ministry. The decision has not gone down well with a section of academicians, who have questioned the move saying politicians should not be involved in academic matters.

UGC scraps 100% weight for the interview in PhD, MPhil, brings in test

Rolling back the controversial selection rule for research students, the University Grants Commission (UGC) scrapped oral interviews, or viva-voce, as the sole criterion for admission to Ph D and M.Phil programmes.

The higher education regulator has amended the UGC (Minimum Standards and Procedure for Award of M.Phil/ Ph.D Degree) Regulations 2016 to give 70 per cent weightage to performance in the written entrance test and 30 per cent to the oral interview for the final selection of a candidate, The Indian Express has learned.

The commission has also permitted relaxation of five percentage points in the minimum marks to be scored in the written test by SC, ST and OBC candidates. So, while a general candidate will have to secure at least 50 per cent in the entrance examination to qualify for the interview or viva voice, a candidate from the reserved category will have to score 45 per cent.

Visva Bharati VC row: Tussle between govt and president on the appointment of VC

The government asked President Ram Nath Kovind to overturn his decision on the appointment of Visva Bharati University Vice-Chancellor (V-C) only after he ignored HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar's recommendation for the post and chose Swapan Kumar Dutta instead, according to official records accessed by The Indian Express under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.

As reported by The Indian Express on February 23, Kovind, in an unprecedented move, withdrew his assent to Dutta's selection as the head of Visva Bharati in Santiniketan, at the behest of the HRD Ministry. He also scrapped the panel of three finalists forwarded by the government last year.

National Medical Commission Bill

Government think-tank NITI Aayog has pitched for enactment of the National Medical Commission (NMC) Bill, 2017, observing that regulatory bodies the Medical Council of India and the Nursing Council of India have ""failed"" to ensure adequate availability and quality of health professionals.

In its 'Strategy for New India @75' document released on Wednesday, the Aayog has recommended revamp of the regulatory system of nursing education to ensure quality training in nursing schools and also stressed on developing centres of excellence in nursing and enhancing the stature of government nurses, as reported by PTI.

Chief minister H D Kumaraswamy has already announced in the budget speech that English will be introduced as a medium of instruction in 1000 schools from the next academic year. His decision has led to a huge backlash from Kannada activists, who have expressed fears that it will deprive the children knowledge of the local language.

After several prominent Kannada activists and other public personalities met him and requested that he reconsider, Kumaraswamy reluctantly agreed to put the decision on hold till a wider consultation is over.

Now former chief minister and Congress legislative party leader Siddaramaiah has reopened the debate by wading into the sensitive and controversial issue.

On Thursday, he attacked Kumaraswamy for his inflexible attitude towards Kannada and demanded that the proposal to make English the medium of instruction be dropped immediately.

Speaking to News18, he said, ""The primacy of Kannada in Karnataka is non-negotiable. Kannada is everything in Karnataka. I won't allow English medium primary schools run by the government. I will speak to the chief minister"".

A day later on Friday, the chief minister's elder brother and PWD minister HD Revanna hit back at Siddaramaiah, and defending the introduction of English in government-run schools.

Revanna said that English was the need of the hour and a global necessity. ""The knowledge of English is important. It helps our rural and poor children to compete with city children. They can get better jobs, can go abroad and it will be good for all in the long run. If the government introduces English medium in schools, poor parents don't need to pay exorbitant fees at private schools,"" he said.

He also lashed out at the Kannada activists for their hypocrisy. ""The same people send their children and grandchildren to English medium schools. They oppose when the government introduces English as a medium for the benefit of the poor and village children"".

Some Kannada activists clarified that they are not against teaching English as one of the subjects from the first standard and their opposition is only to introducing English as a medium of instruction. In their defence, they cite the Supreme Court judgment in favour of primary education in the mother tongue of the child.

Siddaramaiah, who is a fierce defendant of Kannada language and culture, is unlikely to change his stand and it may worsen the already strained relationship between him and Kumaraswamy.

According to JDS leaders, Kumaraswamy has taken it as a matter of prestige and not willing to drop the proposal.

The main opposition BJP is also opposing the move. Former chief minister BS Yeddyurappa told News18 that he was for teaching English as one of the subjects in primary schools and not in favour of English medium government schools."

In the late 19th century, the British upper class discovered the wild. They travelled to Africa by the boatload, armed to the teeth with mosquito netting and portable china... They were the early samplers of the safari.

In India, where we only have to venture into our backyards for similar experiences, the turn of the millennium brought into view the commercial potential, drawing domestic tourists to national parks and sanctuaries. Lately, however, in a multi-pronged bid to stem that tide, protect forest ecosystems from over-gazing, and yet keep revenue-streams high, several parks, reserves and sanctuaries have started to crank up the costs. This has resulted in the loss of the common Indian tourist.

For example, at Kabini River Lodge tour packages vary from ₹10,266 for a tent, to ₹15,700 for a cottage, per person per night on twin-sharing basis. Bandipur starts at ₹8,673. Corbett National Park, has stay-and-safari packages starting at ₹4,800 per person, per night. At Uttar Pradesh's Dudhwa Forest Rest House, rates start at ₹4,499 per person, exclusive of taxes. The rates increase by 40% on occasions like Christmas and New Year. Parks with higher traffic like Ranthambore and Bandhavgarh have sown a cash crop of private lodges for every budget.

""Wildlife tourism is becoming more exclusive and high-end,"" agrees Monish Mullick, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) and Chief Wildlife Warden - Uttarakhand. ""These parks cannot be made mass destinations. They are core and critical habitats of many endangered animals that have to be managed, protected and conserved.""

If wildlife tourism earlier objectified the animal and its habitat, its focus has reversed in the last decade to foreground conservation, and the development of local wildlife economies in aid of it. Several popular parks (invariably ones with higher big cat and big mammal sightings) are championing the low-footfall, high-revenue model. Perhaps they believe those who can't afford to see animals in the wild can always go to the zoo.

""The minute we limit a particular segment of society from visiting the forest, we've lost the idea of conservation,"" counters Shrilekha Venkateswar, founder of Wild Walk, a wildlife literacy and conservation company in Chennai. ""When you deprive people a chance to enter the forest, you're denying them the opportunity to know it. All stakeholders of the forest are crucial to wildlife conservation - the government, media, researchers, and the common man... if you knock one pole, the whole system is imbalanced. If entry fees, and costs of safaris and photography are to be raised, it should only be to cover operational expenses, not for profit,"" she maintains.

Sushil Chikane, proprietor of Journeys, a Pune-based wildlife tour company, says that the variation in rates across parks puts expensive ones out of reach. ""There ought to be standard rates at least in the national parks. It undermines conservation efforts if footfalls are only concentrated in a few places,"" he says, adding that if the middle and lower classes have never visited a reserve and seen the forest for themselves, they will never feel the need to support conservation policies.

""And what is conservation, but the cultivation of public opinion?"" posits Anirudh Chaoji, biologist and founder of Ran Mangli Foundation that creates income-earning opportunities for communities around Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve in Chandrapur, Maharashtra. Its star is on the rise, given the high tiger population of around 88. ""It is only when people have seen the actual tiger in its habitat -- not just read about it in a textbook -- that they feel the need to protect it. Ecotourism should be equitable tourism - not only funnelling revenue back into local communities, but making it affordable and accessible to all,"" he explains. Chaoji hails the reserve's efforts at this. ""Children from about 100 schools around the forest are brought to spend one night in the wild for free. Moreover, unlike outsiders who have to book safaris two to three months in advance, those from around the forest can avail of the cheaper canter, barely three days in advance,"" he says.

The Gordian Knot is really one of supply and demand. But if conservation is the ultimate aim, the most effective way, says Vijay Kumar, honorary secretary of the Madras Naturalists' Society, is to be inclusive. ""Reserve a day for schoolchildren, for people living within a certain radius of the park. And before every safari, an orientation programme ought to familiarise visitors with the vegetation, the effects of climate change on that park, and the challenges and benefits of conservation."" Not to forget, he adds, that a forest is more than just the sum of its tigers."

The civil supplies department, set up in 1918 when thousands of people fell victim to frequent episodes of famine, completed 100 years in August. The landmark event, though, went completely unnoticed. There were occasions when several pockets of princely Hyderabad state ran out of food stocks. Rice supplies, then, were rationed at 50 grams per head per day and it was increased to 100 grams only in 1950.

The pandemic flu of 1918 resulted in the decline of Hyderabad city population by 9.4% -- the population of Hyderabad state in the 1921 census was lower than that of 1911. There were more deaths than births and the decadal population dropped from 1.33 crore in 1911 to 1.24 crore in 1921. The flu which struck in September 1918 killed 46.5 people per 1000 that month and the death toll increased rapidly to 464 deaths per 1000 by Octoberend. Two per cent (3.50 lakh) of Hyderabad's population had been wiped out within a month.

2018 was also the year when the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), set up as Beri-Beri Enquiry Unit at Coonoor in Tamil Nadu, turned

100. It was shifted to Hyderabad in 1958.

Also completing a century was the Hyderabad Currency Act 1918 which introduced paper money for the first time. Earlier, only coins were in use. The Act came into force on June 4, 1918.

The Osmania University was also set up in 1918 though the institute celebrated the centenary in 2017.

While exams went online, campuses erupted with unrest and agitation

From reforms to resentment, 2018 was a mixed bag for students and parents. After almost two decades since its inception, common entrance tests such as Eamcet, ICET among others went online for those seeking admission to various professional courses.

In a major development, Telangana joined the national pool for medical courses by earmarking 15% of MBBS seats and 50% of postgraduate medical seats to students from other states.

What rocked Hyderabad this year was a string of student protests reported from top institutions such as Birla Institute of Technology Science, Tata Institute of Social Science, apart from other engineering colleges such as Vasavi College of Engineering, Chaitanya Bharati Institute of Technology etc. Their demands ranged from fee regulation to continuation of courses.

Those in school found no respite from the spiralling fee structure as the state government for the first time ordered school managements to maintain status-quo on the fee hike and issued an admission notification. Subsequently, on January 22, the Hyderabad High Court issued an interim order allowing schools to hike fee, leaving parents fuming. It was only closer to the end of year that the Delhi Public School, Mahendra Hills, decision to slash fee by 50% brought them some hope.

Apart from fees, two alleged cases of sexual abuse of primary students reported from a private school in Tolichowki, added to the angst of parents who demanded better surveillance in educational institutions.

City set to get an AIIMS, but will H1N1 deaths stop?

Right at the beginning, the government found itself in a spot with maternal deaths showing a three-fold jump since 2016-2017.

The core Hyderabad district itself reported as many as 105 maternal deaths compared to just 31 in 2017.

A worried healthcare department put all heads together and managed to bring things under control by strengthening government hospitals and introducing several health schemes, including KCR Kits, where pregnant women were given financial assistance in instalments towards the end of the year.

Fee regulation among several other issues triggered protests from students at top institutes such as TISS, BITS and many others

The maternal mortality rate (MMR) now stands at 70 female deaths per 100,000 live births. But right through the year, the government struggled to contain the deadly swine flu (H1N1) virus, with 154 deaths officially recorded till October this year and with 90% cases reported in Hyderabad city itself. If the battle to control the mutated virus was an uphill task, the dengue virus with 2,700 deaths and malaria with 1,500 deaths, underscored the government's failure to tackle diseases in Hyderabad. The health department also struggled to create more jobs and depute doctors and other necessary staff to rural areas, forcing patients to flock to Hyderabad's hospitals.

On a positive note, the decision to renovate the heritage block of the iconic Osmania General Hospital and build a new hospital premises, came as a welcome move. On December 20, Telangana received happy tidings, when the Union cabinet finally clearing the decks for the establishment of a new All India Institute for Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Bibinagar, at a cost of Rs 1,028 crore. The new prestigious facility spread over 200 acres will also have 100 MBBS seats.

From darkness to light. Or so I thought when I heard about my shifting from the dark dungeons of coal mines, as coal secretary, to the bright lights of school education, as secretary for school education and literacy.

However, I discovered soon that in the coal sector, mining was underground and mafias operated above it, but in the minefield of school education, it was the other way round. All the education mafias existed underground, and they were all masked, masquerading as so-called noble giants. Having taken on some of the mafias of the coal sector and partly succeeded in bringing the sector to order, the task was now to handle these 'noble giants'. It was made more difficult as there was no public outrage against invisible scams in education as was in the case of coal.

Everything seemed to be apparently in order.

To make matters worse, I was the fifth person to hold the charge of secretary in the education department in just two and a half years. Most of my predecessors with impeccable credentials in the education sector did not continue or were not allowed to continue. The government apparently found in me to be the most 'educated' person (I had never worked in this sector except for a brief tenure of three months in 1997 in adult education in Uttar Pradesh) to handle this sector.

It would be an understatement to state that the education sector was in bad shape - both in terms of budgetary allocation and human resource management.

Also read: My friend told me the coal sector was like 'Gangs of Wasseypur': Former secy Anil Swarup

The budgetary allocation for school education was Rs 55,115 crores during 2014-15. This amount got reduced in subsequent years. For instance, the allocation for 2016-17 was Rs 43,554 crore.

On the human resource front too, the situation was alarming. The department had five secretaries between 2014 and 2016. A number of joint secretaries were also changed during this period. It was like musical chairs reminiscent of my days in UP where it was rumoured that the only industry flourishing was the transfer industry.

In the two biggest states of the country, the positioning of top management followed a peculiar pattern. Whereas in UP, there were two additional chief secretary-level officers manning school education and secondary education separately (creating huge coordination problems), in the state of Bihar, one officer looked after both the education and health departments. Consequently, the health of education continues to suffer.

In addition to this, the mafias were having a field day, eating into the system, like termites. Fortunately, like all mafias, those in the education sector too were not a majority, but played a dominant role in decision-making. They were extremely well connected and deeply entrenched. There were a host of mafias, but the prominent ones were operating in these areas:

There are around 16,000 B.Ed and D.El.Ed colleges in the country. A large number of these exist only in name. If you pay them well, you can get a degree without an effort. It was rumoured that if you pay them more, they could even arrange for a 'naukri' (a government job). Action was initiated by then chairman of National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) Santosh Mathews, an upright officer, by issuing notices to all the colleges to furnish the details of their existence on affidavits. The idea was to ensure that only those that actually existed got recognition and in case of wrong information they could be prosecuted. It worked initially, but the colleges realised that quite a few of them could be in trouble. Despite the support he got from most of the states, he was put under enormous pressure by the mafias who took the 'judicial' route to pin down the chairman. He had to quit.

In a few northern states of the country, a number of examination centres are given on 'theka' (contract) for copying. These centres are highly 'priced' as they facilitate mass copying or cheating during examinations. The current chief minister of UP, Yogi Adityanath, came down heavily on this mafia. This was last done by Kalyan Singh in 1991, but thereafter no chief minister could dare to do that. Consequent to the steps taken in UP in this year's exams, more than one million students chose not to give exams. It is a reflection of the 'addiction' to mass copying.

The publishing industry thrives on the education sector. People with vested interests want to maintain status quo as this benefits them. It happens at two levels. As respective state governments provide free books to students, there are various ways in which money is made. The 'mandatory cuts' in getting the books printed centrally constitutes a substantial portion. The initiative taken by the UP government in 2018 and the consequent savings thereunder lends credence to this allegation. The Bihar government is toying with the idea of direct benefit transfers recognising the 'dealings' inherent in central printing and distribution.

The other level of money making is done by a handful of private publishers who enter into an 'arrangement' with the private schools in the name of quality, and compel the students to buy almost four to five times more expensive books as compared to the NCERT ones. If all the students of around 20,000 CBSE-affiliated schools were to source NCERT books, there would be an estimated annual expenditure of around Rs 650 crores. Compared to this, if they source books from private publishers, it would cost around Rs 3,000 crores per annum. The difference is too great to justify the quality argument.

The NCERT did a wonderful job in the current academic year to ensure that books were available on time so that the students were not compelled to buy expensive books, but this effort will need to continue. The NCERT will always be under pressure from people with vested interests to be 'inefficient'.

Most of the private schools in India contribute enormously to imparting quality education. However, some of them are bringing a bad name to this segment. There are some extremely powerful individuals who are able to get away with the most immoral things in education. They violate various norms, legal and ethical, with impunity because having been part of the official machinery at some point in time they know the tricks of the trade.

Irrational hiking of fee, charging huge sums of money to 'lend' their brand, harassing the brand assignees are some of the many tricks they practice. The chairperson of the CBSE Rajesh Chatur who chose to take them on was shown the door in 2017. His successor, Anita Karwal, one of the finest civil servants, was also set to be 'sacrificed'. But she held her ground despite pressure.

The good news in all of this is yet again from UP where the state has enacted a law on the fee regulation after consulting all the stakeholders. Hence, the legislation has been welcomed by all. Hopefully, other states will follow suit.

Just last week, Ajit Ranade, noted economist, went on record stating, ""A global slowdown might be inevitable.""

Part of the reason could be the United States. As Ranade points out, the trade wars triggered by that country has made markets nervous. In February, there was a huge selloff and sharply increased volatility. The Morgan Stanley Capital Index (MSCI) dropped by US$ 3 trillion dollars.

That caused currencies to take a big hit. Currencies of Argentina, Turkey, Indonesia and South Africa (even India) were badly affected.

Bright and the dark sides

But India still may not be so badly hurt because of two reasons. The price of oil, unexpectedly, has started to slip. That gives India some breathing space.

Moreover, as Ranade rightly states, the monthly inflow of domestic investors into the stock market, thanks to schemes like monthly Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) are now close to a healthy Rs 10,000 crore. They can now offset the sudden exit of foreign money.

But there are some nasty clouds that India will have to reckon with in the coming year.

First, the desperate need to create jobs. India has failed miserably on this front.

Second, the urgent need to bring in foreign direct investments (FDI). Without it, fresh investments in infrastructure might not take place. Already some of the bids for roadways had to be recast, and offered for rebidding, because there weren't any takers. Without such investments, job formation will continue to remain grim.

Many countries have slowed down their fresh FDI into India because of the government's refusal to give a clear response on dispute redressal. It does not want investors to take recourse to arbitration outside India (because the Supreme Court has already decreed that awards by arbitration tribunals from seats outside India cannot be reopened by Indian courts. But it is equally unwilling to give the same guarantee for the Indian arbitration centres. This is bad because the government itself is the biggest litigant in courts.

Third, expect government spending to slow down in the months following the elections. This has been the pattern for most general elections (see chart). Governments splurge money before the elections to woo an electorate. After elections, spending slows down. Except, this time, the expenditure slowdown will occur even as the global economy will slow down.

With little FDI, and the possibility of exports slowing down because of trade wars, India could face exceedingly painful times.

Unless. . . . .

Solution 1 - India should learn from Iran

There is a key lesson that India could learn from Iran. When Iran was in trouble, with little job formation, US sanctions, and little education, it needed to ensure that it could create jobs. One of its strategies was to build affordable houses - minimum area 800 square feet). After all, cement, land and steel were available domestically. Labour was homegrown. This activity needed little foreign exchange. India should do the same thing.

But to make it succeed, two things must happen. First, zero tolerance for any slums. That will make potential slum dwellers purchase houses rather than angling for free politically-backed housing on usurped land.

Second, the government must build at least 2 million houses (or more) each year. The demand exceeds 20 million homes (see chart). These figures were compiled in 2012. They should have increased by 25 percent at least since then.

If you build just merely 50,000 houses, you will get a black market. That is what happens when demand outstrips supply. That is bad for the country, bad for values, bad for people. Large numbers will create jobs; will create hopes for countless millions in India. The demand for housing will create jobs; that will create purchasing power; that will create more investments and more jobs. The virtuous cycle could get kick-started.

India can escape the paucity of foreign capital. It can create jobs for those not well skilled. The new roads built by the ministry of Nitin Gadkari will make commutes easier.

Solution 2 - there's nothing like the sun

As this author has pointed out earlier, India is blessed with lots of people and lots of sunshine. The government should make use of that. To understand its potential, one should look at Germany.

When the late Hermann Scheer, then energy minister of Germany, introduced rooftop solar in his country, he knew that most people would not bother to put up solar panels even though they were environmentally friendly. So he offered them the opportunity of letting the state put it up. Moreover, people could use the solar power generated free of cost. Whatever power was not used, they could sell it to an agency which would pay them for it. Thus the house owner would get some free electricity, and also payment for the electricity he did not use. The plan worked, and many houses opted for rooftop solar.

To make this work, Scheer created a layer of people who would install the solar, maintain it, set up bidirectional meters that would measure the amount of electricity sold to the agency. The agency, which was part of the layer that Scheer created, would clean the intermittent power from solar rooftops, aggregate it from hundreds of houses, and then sell it to the national grid for a price. The government subsidised the price.

Today, if solar prices have fallen, it is because of the market Germany created and showed the world how to create it. The Chinese saw a business opportunity and built capacities to meet this soaring demand. Together, they ensured that the price of solar panels fell from $3.50 per peak Watt in 2006 to under 30 cents currently (and the price keeps falling).

But what Scheer had not reckoned with, and what he discovered was that in eight years' time the middle layer employed more and more people - installers, cleaners, engineers, and more. By 2008, this middle layer accounted for more jobs than the legendary German auto industry.

This is a big lesson for India. India has more sunlight than Germany, and many more people - hence many more houses and rooftops. What India should be focussing on is the creation of middle layers in the form of decentralised cluster power generation and distribution centres. If huts don't have a good roof, just use a pole and put a solar panel atop it. But it must be done by the private sector, which will ensure that assets don't get misused or stolen.

Our reckoning is that this could create over 80 million jobs within two years (see table). But to make this work, the power to villages must go through he decentralised cluster mode run by private entrepreneurs. Each entrepreneur, in order to boost power consumption, would encourage rural folk to consume more power for business or lifestyle or both. That would create jobs, boost economic activity in rural areas, and generate wealth.

It would also reduce India's fuel import bills. It would provide electricity to the remotest village, and it would prevent energy theft that state grids are notorious for.

Other options

There are other things that the government could do. Promote tourism - but that also means reducing bureaucracy, sharp practices by agents, better hotels and toilets, and promoting a sense of security.

India could harness its methane potential, that could almost entirely eliminate the country's fuel import bill.

India needs to de-licence education, and focus only on the quality of output, instead of licensing schools and medical colleges. If India does not provide for a good education, the country's future is blighted.

It needs to focus on healthcare. Ayushman Bharat is only the first step. It will be painful for the middle class, as resources get diverted to the economically poor. But expanding effectively and reasonably priced medicare is crucially important. Remember, India's score on the World Bank's Human Capital Index is terrible.

India could focus on encouraging investments from China which has shown a huge investment appetite in the country - disregardful of the arbitration imbroglio or other irritants. India should carefully structure deals so that both countries benefit.

The centre of gravity for economic activity is shifting to Russia, China and India. If harnessed well, these trends could help India ride the tide.

Maybe, it will be a wonderful new year. But will the government (whichever one it might be) be willing to embrace this vision?

The government has said that school principals will be held responsible in case of a mishap while ferrying children in such vans.

In a circular issued by the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) on Wednesday, the principals or heads of schools (HOSs) were asked to ""strictly"" comply with the norms. ""This is to bring to the notice of principals/HoSs of all the private recognised unaided schools functioning within the territory of Delhi that a large number of school vans are operating illegally for ferrying students between their homes and schools without taking adequate safeguards towards safety of school children. It is also known that these vans are primarily hired by the parents. The Delhi traffic police and transport department have tried to impress upon the concerned school principals to brief parents not to use these school vehicles, which are not following norms,"" said DoE director Sanjay Goel in the circular.

It, however, added that the school principals were responsible for the safety of children. ""The concerned school administration shall be held responsible for non-compliance of directions by the school vans/cabs being used to ferry students of their schools, especially in cases where such vehicles (owned by schools or hired by parents) meet with accidents resulting in injury or death of the school children. The necessary action shall also be taken against the defaulting schools in case such an unfortunate accident happens,"" Goel said in the circular.

The move comes a month after an eight-year-old student of a private school was killed and nine other children were injured when a speeding goods carrier hit an overloaded private school van in north Delhi's Dheerpur. The incident had prompted the Delhi government to ask the transport department to formulate a fresh school cab policy by January 2019.

As per the Supreme Court guidelines, school vehicles should follow several norms -- such as having 'on school duty' written prominently on the back and the front, horizontal grilles on windows, first-aid boxes, fire extinguishers, reliable locks, experienced drivers and at least one conductor. The speed of the vehicle should not exceed 50km/h.

Meanwhile, the committee of private recognised and unaided schools in Delhi termed the government's order as 'impractical'.

""How is it even possible for the schools to monitor thousands of private vehicles ferrying students across the city. We take complete responsibility of children at the school campuses. But how can we keep a tab on all the modes of transport parents are choosing over school vans. We are going to oppose this rule and demand the government to withdraw it immediately,"" said SK Bhattacharya, president of the committee. He demanded similar order be issued for government schools as well."

The press conference by the four judges set the wheels of change in motion, according to Justice Joseph.

Aashish Aryan reports.

On the bright sunny morning of January 12, four senior Supreme Court judges held an unprecedented press conference and expressed their concerns about the professional conduct of the then Chief Justice of India, Justice Dipak Misra, over the assignment of cases.

In the virtual revolt against the CJI, Justices J Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan B Lokur, and Kurien Joseph questioned the system and said that a skewed allocation of cases was impacting justice delivery adversely.

The four judges had then repeatedly said that despite their best efforts to reach out to Justice Misra, there had been no response from him, which left them with no option but to come face to face with the nation (via the press).

Of the four, Justice Chelameswar and Justice Joseph have already retired since, Justice Lokur will relinquish his post by the month end.

Justice Gogoi is the incumbent CJI.

The press conference by the four judges set the wheels of change in motion, according to Justice Joseph.

Addressing reporters after his retirement, Justice Joseph said he had no regrets about the press conference.

He also expected Justice Gogoi to steer the ship more effectively.

Some legislators thought the judicial rebels had done the right thing, raising issues that were critical to functioning of this vital institution of democracy.

How far the political dispensation will respect the spirit of that revolt is another question.

#2 The landmark Aadhaar verdict Illustration: Uttam Ghosh/Rediff.com

But the Supreme Court ruled that Aadhaar will continue to be mandatory for State-sponsored welfare schemes and will need to be linked to the permanent account numbers for income tax purposes.

Udit Misra reports.

After a nine-judge Bench of the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in 2017 that the Right to Privacy was indeed a Fundamental Right under the Indian Constitution, all eyes were on the five-judge Bench of the apex court adjudicating on not only the legal validity of Aadhaar but also its usage.

Indeed, it was the Aadhaar case that required clarity on the Right to Privacy in the first place.

The apex court delivered an interim order in March and a full one in September.

While the court upheld the validity of the Aadhaar Act, albeit by a four-to-one majority, it severely restricted the parameters for its use.

Thus, starkly in contrast to the coercive annoyance that Aadhaar had become over the years -- with it becoming a pre-condition for everything from mobile services to banking to health care to monthly food rations -- its use has now become voluntary.

But the court ruled that Aadhaar will continue to be mandatory for State-sponsored welfare schemes and will need to be linked to the permanent account numbers for income tax purposes.

#3 IIMs and the autonomy mirage IMAGE: The Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad. Photograph: Kind courtesy IIM-A

2018 was a landmark year for the premier B-schools even as it ushered in a new era with the promulgation of the IIM Act.

Vinay Umarji reports.

Not since Infosys co-founder and former Indian Institute of Management- Ahmedabad board chairman N R Narayana Murthy took on then Union minister of human resource development Murli Manohar Joshi over the latter's decision to slash fees have IIMs seen such a prolonged fight for autonomy.

In that sense, 2018 was a landmark year for the premier B-schools even as it ushered in a new era with the promulgation of the IIM Act.

At first, IIMs welcomed the freedom to appoint chairpersons and directors in place of the earlier cumbersome process that required government approval.

However, the year saw IIMs raising other issues that not only threatened their autonomy but also increased administrative woes for them.

For instance, under the Act, IIMs can offer PhD as against the previous fellow doctoral programmes.

However, the government narrowed eligibility criteria by increasing the cut-off to 80 per cent from the 60 per cent for four-year undergraduate applicants.

IIMs say this would reduce the available pool of candidates, apart from reducing course work in doctoral programmes from two years to six months.

Further, the one-year post graduate programmes for executives with prior work experience of at least 5 to 7 years are set to be converted into two-year MBAs under the Act.

This too, IIMs believe, would lower standards and defeat the purpose of conducting one-year MBAs for working professionals.

The year ended with directors of all IIMs and the ministry discussing these issues via video conference in the second week of December 2018.

The ball now rests in the ministry's court.

#4 Volatile year for Indian currency Photograph: Francis Mascarenhas/Reuters

The rupee has now strengthened back to below 72 a dollar as oil eased to less than $60 a barrel.

Anup Roy reports.

2018 was a volatile one for the rupee as oil prices started rising and trade war concerns between US and China kept emerging market currencies on tenterhooks.

The partially convertible currency started the year at 63.7 a dollar, but trade war tensions, leading to currency war concerns, started pulling it down rapidly in the first half of the year.

The central bank tried to defend the currency till its previous record low of 68.85 a dollar.

However, once the currency crossed 70, the central bank maintained a hands-off approach to protect its reserves.

The movement accelerated in August when oil prices also started climbing up to cross $70 a barrel on concerns about US sanctions.

It was pretty evident after that that the central bank won't protect a level.

Two back-to-back rate hikes by the RBI by August, seen as a measure to protect the currency, were unable to stabilise the rupee, and by September, it had closed at its life-time low of 74.4 a dollar as oil crossed $85 a barrel.

The rupee has now strengthened back to below 72 a dollar, as oil eased to less than $60 a barrel.

But observers say the local currency's new level would continue to be 70 a dollar-plus.

#5 India's exports grow in 2018 Photograph: Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters

Despite reports of crippling capital inadequacy in the wake of the new Goods and Services Tax regime, double-digit export growth continued for half of the year.

Subhayan Chakraborty reports.

Despite a global trade war, India managed to grow its exports in 2018 but high crude prices and rising domestic demand continued to inflate the trade deficit at a faster rate.

The year started with monthly trade deficit soaring to a 56-month high.

By October, it had risen to more than $153 billion.

Despite reports of crippling capital inadequacy in the wake of the new Goods and Services Tax regime, double-digit export growth continued for half of the year.

On the other hand, imports also shot up as volatile crude prices made a comeback to haunt policymakers after a year of relative ease.

India's current account deficit is expected to triple to $19 billion to $21 billion in Q2 of FY19, or about 3 per cent of the GDP, from the modest $7 billion in Q2 last fiscal year, economists predict.

As a result, the government placed import restrictions and raised inbound duties on six separate occasions for hundreds of products including textile inputs, steel, mobile phones and solar panels, among others.

The move was strongly criticised for raising protectionist barriers at a time when economic growth was tepid.

But India managed to navigate through a field of tariff landmines as a trade war between the United States and China heated up throughout the year.

New Delhi countered threats by the Donald J Trump administration to cut market access for Indian goods by entering protracted negotiations with the US, that continue at the time of writing.

#6 GST and the problems aplenty Illustration: Dominic Xavier/Rediff.com

While monthly collections have crossed the Rs 1 trillion mark twice in the current year, they remain well below the desired monthly run rate.

Ishan Bakshi reports.

Even a year-and-a-half after its launch, the goods and service tax regime continues to pose grave problems for the central government's fiscal maths.

While monthly collections have crossed the Rs 1 trillion mark twice in the current year, they remain well below the desired monthly run rate.

This is despite the number of returns filed rising to 6.96 million in October, up from 6.75 million in September.

On its part, the government had hoped that compliance under the new indirect tax regime would improve with the introduction of the e-way bill.

However, data on Integrated GST domestic collections does not suggest a sustained increase in tax collections.

For the government to meet the budgeted indirect tax target, collections would have to rise to Rs 1.33 trillion per month for the rest of the current financial year, says a report by Kotak Institutional Equities.

Part of the shortfall could be plugged by distributing the unallocated portion of the GST compensation cess between the central and state governments.

Or, the Centre could hold onto IGST collections.

Despite this, the Centre is staring at a huge gap in indirect tax collections, which the report pegs at Rs 800 billion to Rs 900 billion.

#7 India's targets on climate change, Katowice and Paris Agreement IMAGE: Prime Minister Narendra Damodardas Modi with French President Emmanuel Macron. Photograph: @MEAIndia/Twitter

It took collective pressure from all developing countries, including India, to ensure the rulebook adheres to the letter of the agreement even if it did not stay entirely loyal to its spirit.

Nitin Sethi reports.

India finalised a report noting that it was well on the way to meeting two of its three targets under the first phase of the Paris Agreement.

Soon after, the Katowice climate change negotiations ended with a rulebook to the Paris Agreement.

It took collective pressure from all developing countries, including India, to ensure the rulebook adheres to the letter of the agreement even if it did not stay entirely loyal to its spirit.

For instance, the rules eroded the difference between developing and developed countries to a layer deeper than the agreement had rendered.

With the Paris Agreement itself pared down to let countries largely self-determine how much heft they should put behind the collective fight against climate change, the rules were not expected to deliver more.

But Katowice did deliver a set of rules that will monitor countries deeply for their delivery against the nationally-determined actions, particularly on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Countries could not, however, agree to the rules for the operation of the global market for trading in greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris Agreement.

Developed countries wanted developing countries not to take credit for the emissions they trade in.

Developing countries wanted the rich nations not to get to harvest the low-hanging cheaper emission reduction targets only to their account, leaving the poorer nations with heavy bills for technology in emission reductions.

The rules for the market mechanism were deferred to 2019, or perhaps 2020, just before the Paris Agreement gets implemented, starting 2021.

Next year will also witness a summit organised by the UN Secretary General, who has put his weight behind pushing countries to enhance their targets even before the agreement kicks off.

#8 Did Modi govt achieve the target in job creation? Illustration: Uttam Ghosh/Rediff.com

The controversy over job creation data is becoming as serious an issue as job creation itself.

Somesh Jha reports.

Until last year, official and private estimates painted a grim picture of job creation -- a key election promise of Narendra Damodardas Modi on the campaign trail in 2014.

In January 2018, the government sought to change the narrative.

A study commissioned by its own think-tank showed that seven million jobs were created in 2017-18 -- closer to the government's promise of providing 10 million jobs.

The study by two independent researchers analysed provident fund data held by the Employees Provident Fund Organisation to map job creation in the private formal sector.

The study predictably drew much flak from various economists for lack of transparency in computing the numbers.

Nevertheless, the government decided to halt all the job surveys by the Labour Bureau and began rolling out the EPFO payroll data on a monthly basis instead.

This backfired.

The payroll numbers provided by the EPFO are dynamic in nature so the figures of job creation kept being revised downwards -- bringing to light another reason the January study was considered unreliable.

The controversy over job creation data is becoming as serious an issue as job creation itself.

But as we move on to 2019, the situation could improve with several official data-sets lined up from the NSSO and the Labour Bureau.

#9 NPAs of Indian banks crosses past Rs 10 trillion Photograph: Reuters

This surprised many observers, if not the bankers, as the true extent of bad debt was not evident before the Reserve Bank of India arm-twisted lenders to disclose whatever was hidden under the carpet.

Anup Roy reports.

In the March 2018 quarter, the gross non-performing assets of Indian banks surged past Rs 10 trillion.

This surprised many observers, if not the bankers, as the true extent of bad debt was not evident before the Reserve Bank of India arm-twisted lenders to disclose whatever was hidden under the carpet.

There are many economic reasons for this NPA pile-up, but the numbers ballooned after the central bank's February 12 circular.

The circular said if a loan is not serviced for 90 days, it is in default and recovery proceedings can be started against it.

Not surprisingly, the gross NPA of all listed banks jumped to Rs 10.25 trillion in the March quarter, from Rs 8.86 trillion in the December 2017 quarter.

The March level was roughly 11.5% of the total loan book.

Adding restructured, and loans suspected to be falling into NPA, the share could be 13% to 14% of the loan book.

RBI's financial stability report says the gross NPA ratios of the banking system could reach 12.2% of the loan book by March 2019.

The good news is that the gross NPAs showed a downward trend in June and then in the September quarter.

This is largely because of the strict Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, or the fear of it.

Bankers now believe the recognition part of NPA is over, and the recovery needs to begin.

#10 A watershed year for corporate India Photograph: Joshua Lott/Reuters

Most of the big-ticket companies that were being forced to undergo a change in management as part of the law were part of the RBI-mandated list for debt resolution under IBC.

Ishita Ayan Dutt reports.

2018 was a watershed year for corporate India with some of its tycoons coming close to losing grip on their companies, courtesy the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.

Most of the big-ticket companies that were being forced to undergo a change in management as part of the law were part of the RBI-mandated list for debt resolution under IBC.

The RBI's first list comprised 12 large accounts with an outstanding claim of Rs 3.45 trillion.

The highest profile from that prized list is Ruia-owned Essar Steel.

Subsequently, the central bank came out with a second list of 27 NPAs that included the likes of Videocon.

The IBC was rolled out about two years ago with the objective of facilitating debt resolution.

Till September, in terms of recovery, financial creditors have realised Rs 584 billion against admitted claims of Rs 1.3 trillion.

Compared to a pre-IBC regime recovery rate of 26 per cent, the Code hasn't fared badly.

However, less than five per cent of the cases have been resolved so far (52 out of 1,198).

The resolution, which was to have been achieved within a maximum time limit of 270 days, has tripped on time-lines.

Of the 816 corporate insolvency resolution processes (CIRPs) underway, more than 29 per cent of the cases have breached the extended 270-day deadline within which resolutions were to be completed, and 19 per cent have crossed 180 days.

Yet bankers say these are but early problems of a revolutionary law that has changed the creditor-debtor relationship in significant ways.

Govt also pushed for RBI decision-making to be a more consultative process, meaning board members should have more say.

Kanika Datta reports.

After months of speculation RBI Governor Urjit R Patel submitted his resignation on December 10, the first incumbent to do so since economic liberalisation.

Tensions had been building for some time, especially from August, with the government appointing two loyalists to the RBI board -- maverick accountant and Swadeshi Jagran Manch co-convenor S Gurumurthy and cooperative banker and former Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad treasurer Satish Marathe.

Their induction was seen as disturbing the intricate relationship between the central bank and government.

It coincided with the RBI coming under pressure to part with a larger share of its capital reserves to shore up government finances and to ease lending restrictions on public sector banks under the Prompt Corrective Action regime, especially to the ailing small and medium enterprises sector.

The government also pushed for RBI decision-making to be a more consultative process, meaning board members should have more say.

Theb RBI interpreted this as a direct undermining of its central board.

With tensions mounting between Mint Road and Raisina Hill, Deputy Governor Viral Acharya delivered a speech outlining the case for the central bank's autonomy in the interests of long-term financial stability.

It was seen as a pointed message to the government.

There the issue rested in a miasma of rumour that the government would invoke the never-used Section 7 of the RBI Act -- which involves a direct order from the government to the RBI to carry out its wishes.

A day before the results of five state elections were to be declared and two days before a much-anticipated board meeting, Dr Patel officially put in his papers.

Two days later, former economic affairs secretary Shaktikanta Das, who had been the government's chief spokesman during demonetisation, was appointed as his successor.

The board meeting appeared to have gone off without incident, but this is only the beginning of a new story.

Sudershan Reddy sheds light on former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's vision, erudition and multi-faceted personality in this address delivered on PV's death anniversary. It gives us a peek into the man hailed as the architect of economic reforms in India....

Ladies and Gentlemen.

Let me, at the very outset, welcome you to the 2018 PV Memorial Lecture. I also wish to state emphatically that it is with a great deal of trepidation and humility that I accepted this invitation to preside over this memorial Lecture. And I believe that diffidence is justified in as much as we seek to deliberate about our times and the inflection points of our progress as a constitutional democracy in honour of a man whose life was marked with many great successes, and many reasonable people would also say some poignant and even puzzling failures.

The sweep of forces and events, and the multitude of dimensions we would have to take into account to develop a holistic picture, in order to comprehend the life of a person like P.V., would not be something that one could even hope to do any justice to in the 15 to 20 minutes or so that I have here. For example, if we were to start with his first elections in 1951 -- that he lost to a candidate of the Communist Party -- when the fledgling nation-state was trying to recover from the horrors of communal passions and traverse all the way to his last stint as a constitutional functionary in the 1990s, when the nation-state was arguably being pushed back into a cauldron, in which communal passions were again becoming the fuel to the fire of discontent, it would not be unreasonable to think of it as the completion of one cycle and the start of another cycle in the history of this nation itself. Add to that, just one more dimension -- -- of the changes in the political economy that he wrought as the Prime Minister, and evolution of P.V.'s thoughts -- -- and one begins to grasp the enormity of task of locating P.V. Narasimha Rao -- -- the man, his ideas, his achievements and failures and what lessons he might hold for us today.

As a person who interacted only to a limited extent with Narasimha Rao -- -- P.V., as he is affectionately called -- -- I will not deign to speak at length about him. I limit my role here to painting a rough, and obviously incomplete, a sketch of a few select areas that P.V., left his mark on. The hope is that this might thematically serve as a bridge between the man in whose honour these annual lectures have been organized and the fraught times we live in.

I had the opportunity -- -- nay honour to meet him on a few occasions. Both when he was in power, and also when he was not in power. He was famous for his erudition and it is only natural that it is talked up. From his mastery of 10 different languages -- that seemed to give him a deeper insight into human nature, of individuals and of collectives -- to his learning COBOL and coding for UNIX machines that seemed to give him insights into forces and processes that might be unleashed well after his lifespan -his thirst for knowledge seemed to know no bounds. I must confess that every single time I met him, I came away feeling enriched, intellectually stimulated and enlightened by the many different dimensions that he could visualize to a problem or an issue. If he weren't an active politician engaged in the task of deepening democracy, he would have been an incredible teacher and a scholar expanding the frontiers of knowledge.

However, he chose not to be an academic, but to be a public representative with a deep inclination to bring about change. In every position that he ever held he initiated and pushed forward reforms. From fixing the managements of temples to forbidding private practice by doctors in government hospitals (a practice that was leading to perverse incentives and practices), P.V.'s record clearly indicates that he had both the vision to see the big picture and also the inclination to work with the minutiae of details to attempt making government departments function better. Of course, the large changes that were initiated, when he was the Prime Minister, in the very manner in which the political economy is to be conceived and structured has been much celebrated. It ought to be a matter of collective shame that the acknowledgment of the pivotal and indeed the pioneering role he played in the reforms of 1991 was belated, and only recently have scholars, historians and biographers begun to tentatively sketch the contours of that story.

For me personally, the fact that P.V., was from the same hardscrabble rural background as I, and yet managed to rise so high on the leadership scale and make such immense contributions to the story of modern India, is what made him fascinating. A very reasonable and plausible argument can be made that Shri. Narasimha Rao's roots in rural India gave him a deep and an intuitive understanding of the structural roots of inequity and the possible avenues for strengthening the capacities of the deprived to assert and protect their innate human dignity. That connectedness and understanding, I believe, informed a lifelong commitment to bring greater dignity to the rural masses -- something that is seldom talked about today as part of the many successes in his career as a politician and a constitutional functionary. I would like to briefly mention three changes, amongst the many, he brought about that had the potential to transform the lives of rural masses.

The first, of course, are the land reforms he initiated in the erstwhile state of Andhra Pradesh. What was remarkable of course, was that the reforms he initiated were going to adversely affect him personally. As many in the audience may know, P.V. was adopted by a rich but childless Brahmin family in his native village, Vangara. He inherited 1200 acres of agricultural land of which he gave up 1000 acres to comply with the reforms he had initiated. The capacity to sacrifice for what he perceived to be the larger good must itself be treated as worthy of great respect and admiration -- -- especially by those of us who live in these times when personal aggrandizement seems to have become the lure for many in the political sphere. To that, we can add another dimension: that he conceived this reform as being necessary for deepening of democracy in rural Andhra Pradesh.

However much we may quibble that his land reforms did not really achieve the economic results that he had hoped for, we cannot but reflect on the impact it had on the minds of the intended beneficiaries of the measures. Even though the measures benefitted a much smaller number than envisaged, the discourse of right to ownership of land they had tilled and toiled over for centuries itself suggested to them a co-equal right to claim ownership of the country, and gave many from the deprived communities much local strength to be able to assert a role in the political processes and aspire to positions of leadership. Given the lengthy history of graded inequalities and consequent denial of inherent human dignity of vast swathes of the populace, the land reform measures he initiated, and the normative discourse that he unleashed have to be understood as significant milestones in our core constitutional project of social justice.

The second initiative that I would like to highlight relates to his exemplary work as the Union Minister for HRD in the Rajiv Gandhi cabinet in the mid-1980s. He was, of course, the creator of the HRD ministry, that combined various departments -- -- of culture, youth affairs etc, with education. Far more important was the New Education Policy of 1986 that he authored. Going past mere vision statements, he was the one who gave shape to the concept and implementation of Navodaya residential schools project. These schools were designed to identify the more talented of the rural students and provide them access to education of a quality that was comparable to what urban children were getting. While Rajiv Gandhi is credited with conceiving the idea, P.V., it has been widely argued was the one who threw himself, heart and soul, into designing and implementing this program. I would like to believe that the fact that his formal education was accidental -- -- in a rural and backward village of Telangana -- inspired him. It yet again reveals his insight that education was a vital and essential avenue for acknowledging and protecting the human dignity of individuals -- -- cutting across socio-economic and communal backgrounds.

The third initiative I would like to highlight is that his Government pushed through the 73 and 74 Amendments to the Constitution of India in 1992-93. These amendments substantially eliminated the discretionary powers of State governments and legislatures in conducting elections to local bodies in rural and urban areas. One remarkable change was the reservation of a third of the positions for women. Before you go rolling your eyes, let me summarize empirical research-based assessment by Professor Rohini Pande, of Harvard University, and her team. They studied 495 randomly selected villages in West Bengal and found that:

(i) Having female leaders dramatically changed voters' perceptions of the effectiveness of women, albeit it occurred only after repeated exposure;

(ii) That notwithstanding biased perceptions about men being more efficient, upon repeated exposure to women being in leadership positions changed voters perceptions that women could be as, and in fact more, efficient than even men; and

(iii) Most importantly, in villages which had women pradhans a couple of times, the aspirations of parents for their daughters, as well as aspirations of teenage girls were raised.

Let me hasten to add, at this point, that I am not implying that an urban background would have been an obstacle to his conceiving the urgency of the needs to initiate structural changes in rural societies. However, I do believe that in all the excitement about his role in initiating 1991 reforms we forget the much wider canvas on which he worked; and that insufficient work has been done by academicians, scholars, and biographers to repeatedly engage with the life of this remarkable man, to uncover his motivations and their sources.

While Vinay Sitapati's ""Half Lion"" is a substantial contribution in this direction, it is still only a first step.

More than most, in modern India, Shri. Narasimha Rao has been at the receiving end of the curse that afflicts the memory of leaders who have served in difficult times -- -- achieved much, and also claimed to have failed much. As Shakespeare's Antony intoned: ""The evil that men do lives after them; the good is oft interred with their bones."" It is good that many are now seeking to excavate the life and times of this son of India.

At the very beginning of my speech, I had asserted that I was humbled that I was asked to preside over this Memorial Lecture and that I was even a trifle scared. How could I not be After all these lectures are organized in memory of a man who wielded power throughout his life and yet seemed to be so capable of being detached when out of power, and go back to his romance with letters and knowledge.

In contrast to that, we live in times when leaders proclaim that they will rule for the next fifty years. Such braggadocio, a hallmark of authoritarian politics, which takes its roots in deep seated anti-intellectualism, is deeply disrespectful of the citizens and the democratic processes they sustain, and is essentially disconnected with the ethos of this nation. It is said that the world is a dangerous place where it is lead by demagogues who manipulate the truth. They lie, they know they are lying and they know that we know they are lying.

As institutions and all foundations of political discourse and polity, are assaulted by the vulgar and the violent, the memory of Shri. Narasimha Rao needs to be used to reinforce another set of beliefs: (i) that scholarship and capacity to deeply reflect and analyze the consequences of policy decisions is not a handicap for leaders but a shield against overweening arrogance when in power -- -- an arrogance that results in certitudes of ignorance and disdain for the poor and the weakest who will suffer the most; and (ii) that dignified and civil bearing, whether in power or out of power, are not signs of weakness but of a belief in the strengths of democracy and innate human dignity of our citizens.

So, I take leave with this thought. He may have been named ""Half Lion, Half Human"", but the boy from Vangara village grew up to be human. Fully, and all too human. But thank God for that. We should hope to see more of the likes of him."

President JKJCCPS Showkat M Chowdhary said the Fee Fixation Committee, as per the High Court Directions, approves the fee for a full calendar year and not on monthly basis.

He said the schools submit all the documents, income and expenses attested by Chartered Accountant, undertakings and declarations to the Fee Fixation Committee on the basis of which the fee is fixed.

""The private schools hire staff on yearly basis who are provided salary and provident funds for full year. No school hires staff as daily wagers. Accordingly, the schools charge tuition for full calendar year. The schools also make it sure that the teachers and other staff are paid properly. They also upgrade its infrastructure and other facilities on regular basis in an effort to impart quality education to the students so that they can compete not only at state or national level but at international level.""

About the transportation charges, JKJCCPS said the private schools charge for only 10 months even though they provide salary to the drivers and conductors for full year.

""Besides other charges including road tax, insurances are also borne by the schools for 12 months and there is no exemption from any authority or company to schools for the school buses during winter months. The schools only save fuel during the winter months on the basis of which only 10 months transportation fee is charged from the parents.""

JKJCCPS said transport facilities are provided to the students on no profit no loss basis.

""This facility is for the smooth transportation of the students so that they reach the schools and return back home on fixed times. It is neither prudent to say that schools will ply buses on losses.""

JKJCCPS said it is not mandatory for the parents to avail transport facility. ""If parents feel the transport is not viable, they can opt out of this facility and drop the students at schools on their own.""

It said the Coordination Committee has already given clear-cut instructions to the schools not to charge arbitrarily or make unnecessarily charges.

""We have also urged parents to register their complaints with the Coordination Committee for its prompt redressal.""

JKJCCPS urged parents no to resort to media trails instead seek better education for the wards.

""In today's modern world when competition is very high for the students, parents should exhort upon the school management to further upgrade infrastructure in terms of latest teaching aids and other facilities which should be integral part of class room.""

JKJCCPS further urged parents' association to sit with coordination committee over the issue and clear doubts, if any, regarding the fee charged from the students.

""We believe that media trials will serve no purpose but only hamper the school functioning and derail our effort to impart quality education. We will also like to invite media for open discussion and clear any doubts on the matter so that we focus on providing quality education to the students and help parents lay a strong foundation of their children."""

(HT File)

After four rounds of admissions, less than a quarter of the 1,400 reserved seats on offer in the city's private schools for differently abled students were filled this year. This has prompted the government to carry forward the vacant seats to the next academic year.

Hindustan Times had reported last week that the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) had invited fresh online applications for 1,268 entry-level reserved seats for a fourth round of admissions to the current academic year which has just three months left.

On Wednesday, the draw of lots were held for these seats but only 123 were filled. The DoE cited ""lack of applications"" for the large number of seats going vacant.

""Of the 125 applications we received during the fresh round of admission, 123 candidates were absorbed. The selected candidates have to approach the allotted school on or before December 31,"" DoE director Sanjay Goel said.

According to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (PWD) Act, 2016, three per cent of the total number of seats meant for the economically weaker section and disadvantaged groups (EWS/DG) category are reserved for children with disabilities.

Goel said that the department will carry forward the remaining reserved seats to next academic session (2019-20). ""The seats will be counted in the category during next year's admission,"" he said. The notification of admission in the entry level classes under the 25% reserved seats for the EWS/DG category is likely to be announced in the first week of January, next year.

Officials in the DoE said that they are planning to organise awareness campaigns among parents to motivate them to apply.

""There is lack of awareness among parents about the reserved seats because this was the first time the quota was introduced within the 25% EWS/DG seats. We are planning to organise campaigns to aware parents from the coming admission session,"" an official said.

Experts, however, said that the ""lack of inclusiveness"" in schools make parents reluctant from applying. ""Though the situation in private schools is better than the government schools, parents of children with disabilities are still reluctant from applying there. They think their kids will only be able to adjust in special schools. More efforts need to be put in to make campuses more inclusive by appointing trained special educators and providing better infrastructure facilities,"" said Dr Satender Singh, disability rights activist."

The district inspector of school (DIOS) PK Upadhyay said two schools, Cambridge School in Sector 27 and Bal Bharti School in Sector 21, have agreed to return hiked fees. While Cambridge School management agreed to return hiked amount per semester (₹17,000), Bal Bharti School has decided to return ₹7,000 as hiked amount in one semester.

""We had served notices to the two schools regarding hiked fees in the past and they have now agreed to roll it back. Till now, we have got confirmation from two schools only. We are probing other schools which have also hiked fees,"" Upadhyay said.

The move comes after continued agitation by the All Noida Schools' Parents' Association (ANSPA) against ""arbitrary fee hike"" which is not in accordance with the Uttar Pradesh Self Finance Independent Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act. The ordinance was first brought into motion on April 9, 2018 and the Act was enforced in August this year.

According to K Arunachalam, general secretary of the ANSPA, they had sent a complaint to the DIOS regarding six private schools, namely Apeejay School, Somervillle School, Amity International School, Delhi Public School, Noida, Cambridge School and Bal Bharti School, for increasing fees in an alleged arbitrary manner.

""Although we have received information regarding two schools agreeing to roll back hiked fees, they have not done it yet. If schools really intend to adjust the hiked amount with the future fees, they have to do it in the next quarter. It has been four months since the Act has been enforced, however, no private school has followed it yet,"" Arunachalam said.

On November 3, the district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar had held a meet with principals of all private schools in the district and asked them to decided their fee structure as per the newly regulated Act and upload it on their school's website within a week's time.

Reacting to allegations of inaction by the district fee regulatory committee, Upadhyay said, ""We will decide in the next committee meeting on schools which do not follow the fees Act.""

However, Asha Prabhakar, principal of Bal Bharti School, denied claims made by the DIOS.

""We had already returned the hiked fees to parents in July this year. The ordinance came in April and we were told to roll back hiked fees. There was a rise of ₹7,000 in the first quarter and we returned the amount in the second quarter fees. The claims of DIOS that Bal Bharti School has agreed to roll back fees now only is untrue,"" Prabhakar said.

The management of the Cambridge School could not be contacted at the time of this report going to publication."

Students enrolled in government-run English medium primary schools say they do not want to switch over to Hindi as a medium when they begin lessons in upper primary school after finishing Class 5. Their demand to convert some of the upper primary schools from Hindi to English medium is growing louder with every passing day.

Kajal Kumari, a student of English medium primary school Gejha in Gautam Buddh Nagar said, ""Switching back to Hindi will not be easy. I request the authorities to please do something so that we may continue to study in English after passing Class 5. It is through a lot of hard work that we developed a comfort level in studying in English. Now, if we go back to learning lessons in Hindi, it will undo whatever we learnt over the past few years.""

In 2015, the basic education department had converted a few primary schools of Uttar Pradesh into English medium institutions. The primary school Gejha in Gautam Buddh Nagar was also made English medium at this time. It has 434 students enrolled in it and most of them do not wish to switch over to a Hindi medium school.

Officials said that after seeing the craze for English-medium schools growing in the state, the BJP government decided to convert 5,000 primary schools to English-medium ones from the April 2018 session. At present, 4,97,108 students are studying in these government-run primary schools.

""In Lucknow alone, there are 44 such schools where more than 6,200 students are enrolled,"" said Amar Kant Singh, Basic Shiksha Adhikari, Lucknow.

Hariyali Srivastava, assistant teacher at primary school Gejha, said the problem was that most students coming to government-run primary schools hailed from humble backgrounds. ""Their parents can't afford to send them to private English medium schools in Class 6, as the fee is very high,"" she said.

Corroborating what the teacher said, Kajal added, ""I want to study only in a government-run English medium school because my father (an e-rickshaw driver) can't afford to pay the fees charged by private English medium schools.""

Zainab Khatoon, another Class 5 girl of the same school, said that she wanted the state government to intervene in the matter.

Making an appeal to senior officials in the basic education department, Srivastava said, ""The students have learnt all terminology in English. Now, they will have to study in Hindi medium upper primary schools, which will be very difficult for them. Our students are asking for help. They want schools to be made English medium till Class 10.""

Chhavi Agarwal, assistant teacher of another primary school, said she teaches 280 students. ""Similar requests are pouring in from my students too.""

Lucknow BSA Amar Kant Singh agreed with the teachers and said that the demand for English medium schools after Class 5 was ""quite natural"". ""After studying in English medium institutions, students will not like to go back to Hindi medium schools,"" he said.

A senior basic education department official added that they were aware of the growing demand for government-run English medium schools and were looking into the matter."

For quite some time, the para teachers have been fighting for regularisation of their jobs and a raise in their remunerations.

Currently, they have been organising dharnas outside the homes of BJP MLAs and MPs across the state. Not only this, a few ruling party legislators also have sympathised with the agitators. Taking advantage of the NDA's discomfiture, opposition parties such as Congress and JMM have thrown their weight behind the para teachers.

On Wednesday, the second day of its winter session, the assembly saw pandaemonium over the issue of the para teachers. Amid din and chaos, the treasury bench managed to get a few bills, including the supplementary demand for grants, cleared in the House.

As soon as the House assembled in the morning, it witnessed stormy scenes. Speaker Dinesh Oraon rejected a business adjournment motion moved by the opposition. He said a debate on the para teachers could be held during 'call attention', a motion for which was moved by some of legislators. Following this, opposition members began raising slogans accusing the government of being insensitive towards the para teachers.

Congress MLA Sukhdeo Bhagat alleged that the speaker and the government made a U-turn on the assurance given to the opposition during a business advisory council (BAC) meeting earlier. ""While chairing the BAC meeting on Monday, the speaker had said a special debate will be allowed. But when the opposition moved a business adjournment motion seeking a debate, the speaker turned it down,"" he said.

Bhagat added that apart from the issue of para teachers, there are other important issues such as the merger of schools that violated the students-teacher ratio and the death of more than 13 para teachers during the course of their agitation.

Refuting the opposition's allegations, BJP legislator Anant Ojha, who had moved a call attention motion, said the opposition parties were trying to run away from the debate. ""The opposition members are shedding crocodile tears on the issue of para teachers. If they wanted, they could have taken part in a debate under any provision suggested by the chair,"" he added.

JMM MLA Kunal Shadangi accused the government of deliberately ruining the education infrastructure to give space to private parties. CPI(ML)' Rajkumar Yadav alleged that the education minister Neera Yadav is trying to fool the para teachers. ""On one hand, the government issues ultimatums to para teachers, asking them to come to talks within 48 hours. On the other hand, the government doesn't say when and where a meeting on this issue would be called. Nor does it name the person who is authorised to convene it,"" Yadav said.

Congress's Badal Patralekh raised the issue of Shivlal Soren, a para teacher who has gone missing since November 15 after he was beaten up by police. ""Police are not still ready to lodge a missing persons complaint while the teacher's family is running around to find out where he is,"" he said.

The House could not have any discussion even though it met twice before and after lunch. In between, however, the government was able to table departmental resolutions from 2015 to 2017 for food and supply under the National Food Security scheme. It was also successful in getting approval of the House for a supplementary budget of Rs 1,117 crore and two bills, which included Technical University Establishment and GST Amendment. The Factory Act Amendment Bill, 2017 and the Wage Payment Amendment Bill, 2017 were recalled.

A few ruling party MLAs urged the government to be considerate towards the para teachers' demands. Two of them -- Vikas Singh Munda and Ramchandra Sahis -- took part in the para teachers' protest and sat on a dharna near the assembly gate. They tried to stop the chief minister and a few other members of the ministry from entering the assembly house for a few minutes. The chief minister and the ministers could enter the House after the marshalls interfered. Despite all this, the government remained unmoved over the para teachers' issue inside the House.

On Monday, the first of the current session, too, the assembly witnessed a similar chaotic situation."

4. Naveen Patnaik Meets KCR, But Supports NCR

The Chief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana state are both keen to play a greater role in national politics and are busy forging alliances or getting the support of other regional parties. But it seems in this, AP Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu has scored points over his rival Telangana state Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, as Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik has chosen to support Naidu.

KCR went all the way to Bhubaneswar to get the support of Patnaik for his proposed Federal Front against both the BJP and Congress. But 24 hours later, Patnaik sent a letter to Naidu through his representative, Member of Parliament Soumya Ranjan Patnaik, saying that his party, the Biju Janata Dal, is in favour of a non-BJP government in 2019. Patnaik has been maintaining his distance from both the BJP and Congress. Ranjan Patnaik said, ""Both the BJP and the Congress have faults, AP CM Naidu's policy is to choose the party which has less faults, and the Biju Janata Dal has the same policy as Mr Naidu.""

5. Micronutrient Deficiency, a Lurking Urban Malady

You may be full after a meal, but are you eating right?

The question assumes significance after a recent study by National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) has found that the diet of 62% of the urban population are micronutrient-inadequate. Micronutrient deficiencies or deficiencies of vitamins and minerals, often referred to as hidden hunger mainly due to diets inadequate in fruits and vegetables as well as whole grains and millets, are not apparent but considered ubiquitous affecting more than two billion people globally. Of them, one third reside in India.

The NIN study assessed the dietary adequacies of micro-nutrients among the apparently healthy adults from urban and semi urban set-up of Hyderabad and concluded that high prevalence of micro nutrient deficiencies is possibly due to the inadequacy of multiple micronutrients.

In this context, it needs to be mentioned that the elected representatives have to perform a tedious job. With the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ruling the NMC for the third consecutive term, corporators from opposition parties are finding it tough to get funds for development works in their constituencies.

A couple of corporators, however, have devised smart techniques to get their work done. One of the

corporators from North Nagpur, who has been elected for three consecutive terms, is known to be very aggressive when it comes to getting sanction for works and also getting them executed.

Every time he approaches the officials' chambers at NMC headquarters in Civil Lines, he starts talking loudly to send a message that residents of his prabhag are suffering due to lack of civic amenities. He ensures his voice reaches officers sitting in their chambers.

This ensures officials readily clear his proposals. He even maintains similar approach in the general body and standing committee meetings.

The corporator has got the Sugat Nagar School in his prabhag upgraded and it now competes with other private schools in North Nagpur. He also played a big role in developing a garden in his prabhag.

Though he often uses unparliamentary language, the ruling party leaders and, to some extent, officials ignore it as they view him as a genuine people's representative.

This diarist has even spotted him helping sanitary workers in cleaning the sewerage network. These qualities have made him quite popular among residents in this part of the city.

On the other hand, a few senior corporators from his party keep complaining to the civic chief about no funds for works in their prabhags.

Then there is central Nagpur's only independent corporator Abha Pande, who is complete opposite of the Congress corporator from North Nagpur. A soft-spoken person, she has a good rapport with officials, good contacts with MLAs and the city MP. She has also exposed many scams in the NMC. She never minds seeking guidance from citizens and even approaching reporters to resolve civic issues.

Another example is of former Congress corporator Manoj Sable. After his ward was reserved for woman, his wife Harshala got elected. A staunch Congressman, Sable has a good relation with the ruling party. This is how he too manages funds for works in his wife's ward.

GST refund glitches, refusal of the state to refund 42 per cent share of the Central incentives pertaining to the pre-GST period, stalemate in the land acquisition for major infrastructure development projects like four-laning of the Baddi-Nalagarh highway and rail connectivity has left the investors disappointed.

The only silver-lining is that the state gets top ranking nationally in the ease of doing business initiative in the fast-moving category. Its overall ranking has improved to 16th as against 17th attained last year. No new industrial unit has been set up due to the locational disadvantage and little has been done to break the monopoly of transport unions whose freight is among the highest in the country. The Pandoga industrial area in Una district has found no takers and little could be done to revive the case of seeking environmental clearance of 515 bigha land at Dhabota in Nalagarh where new industrial area is proposed.

The much-awaited bulk drug park, announced by the Union Chemical and Fertilisers Minister in April 2016, is yet to receive funds for developing the 663.11 bigha site at Aduwal village in Nalagarh. Efforts to set up a cement plant at Churah subdivision of Chamba district have failed to yield results. The government has again announced an investor meet, albeit with a difference, where the Chief Minister is slated to lead a host of senior officials within the country and abroad to attract investment.

The Mukhya Mantri Swavlamban Yojana, which fetches 25 per cent investment subsidy with a ceiling of Rs 40 lakh in plant and machinery and an interest subsidy of 5 per cent for three years, was introduced in May to promote employment. As many as 793 proposals were forwarded to the banks but barely 36 were sanctioned and funds worth Rs 7.88 crore were disbursed which speak volumes about its lack of popularity. Limited success is received under the ambitious 'Start-Up Himachal' scheme with barely 40 start-ups having received financial assistance.

The state was,however, rated as ""Hill State leader and an aspiring leader in developing an enabling start-up ecosystem"" nationally. The 5-year Central Capital Investment Incentive for access to credit at 30 per cent for plant and machinery announced for the micro, small and medium enterprises is the lone new Central scheme which brought some cheer to the existing units.

Students without uniform, scholarship

It was a challenging year for the government in the education sector as it grappled with downtrend in enrollment and filling of vacancies while facing stiff resistance from teacher unions in its bid to bring qualitative improvement in education.

The scholarship scam of Rs 250 crore was unearthed in the Education Department and preliminary investigations revealed that the tentacles of the scam spread to other states also. The government has now handed over the investigations to the CBI. The department remained under the scanner of the High Court which monitored the measures taken by government to fill vacant posts.

The regularisation of teacher has not been done since 2008 and resentment was brewing among teachers as a large number of teachers retired without getting promotion. The government closed 100 elementary schools with less than 10 students and proposed the merger or closure of more than 400 elementary schools.

Efforts were made to get the best from teachers as annual increment of 38 PGTs were stopped for less than 25 per cent results in Class XII board examinations. To arrest the flight of students to private schools, the government introduced pre-primary (Nursery) classes in 3,391 schools on a pilot basis from the coming session and so far, 30,000 students have been registered. The enrollment in government schools has dropped by 23.7 per cent in past 10 years.

Under pressure from student unions, the government took a retrograde step to revert to annual system from semester system under RUSA while the cluster university, which was set up at Mandi, is yet to be functional.

The government failed to provide free uniforms to students of government schools from Class I to Class XII under the Atal Vardi Yojana.

The government tried to lure power producers by offering sops like deferring 12 free power royalty and other measures. Yet the exit of power producers continued as there was no takers for most of the projects in the Chandra basin in Lahaul-Spiti.

Even as there was marginal increase in revenue from power to Rs 1,100 crore as compared to Rs 950 crore last year, yet the state failed to add even a single megawatt to its existing capacity. The government tried to lure power producers by offering sops like deferring 12 free power royalty and other measures. Yet the exit of power producers continued as there was no takers for most of the projects in the Chandra basin in Lahaul-Spiti. There was complete lack of interest in the 1000 MW solar energy projects in Spiti as the HP State Transmission Corporation failed to lay the transmission line to evacuate power from the region.

The Directorate of Energy allotted just two projects - the jinxed 780 MW Jangi Thopan to the SJVNL and the 447 MW Dugar in 2018.

No effort was made to store over rain water in the monsoon on the Giri, Dharampur khud, both tributaries of the Yamuna, that goes waste every year as Shimla and Solan continue to face water shortage.

Private power producers cited high cost of power generation and lack of infrastructure like roads and transmission lines as the main reasons for not showing interest in the projects.The existing power companies had to resort to shutdown of powerhouses owing to the high level of silt. As a result, power companies and state suffered losses due to the frequent shutdown, while the consumers faced power cuts and water problems for hours during the shutdown.

Caught in debt trap

With the debt mounting to almost Rs 50,000 crore, the poor financial health of the state remained the biggest challenge before the BJP regime in its first year in office.

The absence of major revenue generation and limited Central funding under various schemes prevented the Jai Ram government from undertaking any major schemes. Most big projects and schemes are being implemented through Central funding.

Even as the Congress cried hoarse about the poor fiscal management, the BJP regime raised loans to the tune of Rs 2,500 crore against a limit of Rs 7,600 crore. The salary component of almost 2 lakh government employees is Rs 11,000 crore while the pensionary burden is to the tune of Rs 6,000 crore annually. A sum of Rs 4,300 crore will have to be paid as interest on loans during the financial year 2018-19.

The biggest area of concern is the extra spending on recruitment, besides upgrade and opening of new health and educational institutions. The only silver-lining is the hike in revenue from the power sector from Rs 750 crore in 2017-18 to Rs 10,500 crore.

The biggest challenge before the CM, who holds the Finance Department, is generating resources for which the government is eying power, tourism, industry and mining."

The Associa­tion said that the fee was charged after examining and scrutinizing its income and expenses. President JKJCCPS Showkat M Chowdhary said the Fee Fixation Committee, as per the High Court directions, approves the fee for a full calen­dar year and not on monthly basis. He said the schools submit all the documents, income and expenses attested by Chartered Accountant, undertakings and declarations to the Fee Fixation Committee on the basis of which the fee is fixed.

""The private schools hire staff on yearly basis who are provided salary and provident funds for full year. No school hires staff as daily wagers. Accordingly, the schools charge tuition for full calendar year. The schools also make it sure that the teachers and other staff are paid properly. They also upgrade its in­frastructure and other facilities on regular basis in an effort to impart quality education to the students so that they can compete not only at state or national level but at in­ternational level."" About the trans­portation charges, JKJCCPS said the private schools charge for only 10 months even though they provide salary to the drivers and conductors for full year. ""Besides other charges including road tax, insurances are also borne by the schools for 12 months and there is no exemption from any authority or company to schools for the school buses dur­ing winter months. The schools only save fuel during the winter months on the basis of which only 10 months transportation fee is charged from the parents."" JKJCCPS said transport facilities are provided to the students on no profit no loss basis. ""This facility is for the smooth transportation of the students so that they reach the schools and re­turn back home on fixed times. It is neither prudent to say that schools will ply buses on losses.""

JKJCCPS said it is not mandatory for the parents to avail transport facility. ""If parents feel the trans­port is not viable, they can opt out of this facility and drop the students at schools on their own."" It said the Coordination Committee has al­ready given clear-cut instructions to the schools not to charge arbitrarily or make unnecessarily charges.

""We have also urged parents to register their complaints with the Coordination Committee for its prompt redressal."" JKJCCPS urged parents no to resort to media trails instead seek better education for the wards. ""In today's modern world when competition is very high for the students, parents should ex­hort upon the school management to further upgrade infrastructure in terms of latest teaching aids and other facilities which should be in­tegral part of class room.""

JKJCCPS further urged parents' association to sit with coordination committee over the issue and clear doubts, if any, regarding the fee charged from the students.

""We believe that media trials will serve no purpose but only hamper the school functioning and derail our effort to impart quality educa­tion. We will also like to invite me­dia for open discussion and clear any doubts on the matter so that we focus on providing quality education to the students and help parents lay a strong foundation of their children."""

Goal 11 of the SDGs, to build sustainable cities, has proved to be a particularly tough one for urban areas across continents.

This column last week looked at trends in urbanism through 2018, both as a wrap-up of the year and as learning for Mumbai. Here's a curation, in no particular order, of some innovations that cities across the world adopted, received acclaim for, and put to work to make life safer or more comfortable or equitable for their residents.

The over-arching purpose of innovations seemed to follow two routes: One was to align cities' systems and goals with the objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which the United Nations laid out a blueprint for, to be attained by 2030; the other was to adopt cutting-edge tools and technologies for urban issues to either offer solutions to old problems or present new ways to live.

The SDGs and the New Urban Agenda remain a challenge for cities. Goal 11 of the SDGs, to build sustainable cities, has proved to be a particularly tough one for urban areas across continents. The SDG Trends Dashboard this year was a bird's eye view of how countries are faring. The bad news is that no country even in the G20 bracket is on course to achieve the goals. Worse, among the G20, India is most in the red with a yawning 24% points average gap in achieving the SDGs by 2018 to make her cities sustainable, address climate change, provide water and sanitation, and clean energy.

Other cities are doing better. London, for instance, set out a comprehensive city transport plan in which cycling, walking, and public transport will take precedence over private motorised transport. This has the world's first Cycling Action Plan worked down to the city's boroughs to improve air quality and reduce road congestion. Mayor Sadiq Khan wants cycling, walking and public transport to form 80% of all journeys in 2041; not every Londoner approves but he has got the transport plan off the ground. And yes, London has a walking and cycling commissioner. New York City mapped its OneNYC Plan, to become the world's most resilient and equitable city, to SDG goals.

Wuhan, the Chinese city of 11 million, showed the world what to do with a big stinky garbage dump. Among Asia's largest dumps, once smouldering with trash fires and emanating methane to an extent that Wuhan's residents couldn't open their windows, it was reclaimed and turned into a green oasis which is now a popular recreation space, wedding venue, and site for international events. More than 20 departments of various tiers of government made it possible; Wuhan's innovation won it the top honours at the Guangzhou International Awards this year.

Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city, showed the world what public-sourced and equitable land-use planning looked like - and how to do it. For its Ruta 2042, like Mumbai's Development Plan 2034, the city's administrators engaged in the largest public outreach effort ever, soliciting inputs from literally thousands of residents across address, education and income categories.

Some innovations were simple and low-tech, but with far-reaching implications. Milan re-jigged its urban food chain; a new policy mandated that canteens in schools and public institutions would source from local/nearby agricultural producers, and restaurants could claim 20% rebate in tax if they donated excess food to charities in the city. Surabaya in Indonesia has a direct lesson for Mumbai. It mandated that the city's buses accept plastic bottles of designated sizes as payment. A three-in-one strike, it boosted public transport ridership, encouraged recycling, and reduced waste by 10% even when the city's population increased.

Urban tech is the definitive new frontier. And it goes beyond the ubiquitous 'Smart City' concept. From food delivery and retail consumption to co-working, co-living, city parking and real estate analytics, tech has been re-defining urban life, space, and mobility to an extent that urban tech companies and start-ups featured among some of the very largest venture capital investments this year. Blockchain technology is being slowly - and cautiously - adopted by cities for specific services. App-enabled services like e-scooters are being held out as a panacea for urban transportation headaches - but they are also causing new problems in a few cities.

Urban tech is clearly the space to watch out for next year but it brought home a truth: tech can transform or enhance life in a city but it cannot replace public policy and programmes."

The year that passed has been nothing but eventful and provided ample opportunities for The Hindu's cartoonists Keshav and Surendra.

10. During a 10-day tour of Bihar, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat said ""preparing an army takes six to seven months but we [RSS cadres] will be battle ready in two-three days...this is our capability and discipline that marks us apart."" A Sangh member later clarified that it was not a comparison between the Indian Army and Sangh swayamsevaks but that between the swayamsevaks and the general public.

9. Some of our most popular cartoons this year were on the eventful Karnataka Assembly election, which saw the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerge as the single largest party, but lose the upper hand to the Congress as news of them forming a coalition emerged.

8. In March, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu broke off his party's alliance with the NDA, citing the Centre's rejection of their demand to provide Special Category Status to the State, among other reasons.

7. In April, the iconic Red Fort was adopted by the private entity Dalmia Bharat under the Centre's 'Adopt a Heritage' Project, kicking up a storm. It later emerged that the Red Fort wasn't the only monument up for adoption.

6. After it's huge electoral success in the 2014 elections, the BJP had been a much-wanted ally for many political parties. The period that followed, though, saw the party trying to distance themselves from the allies - a move that backfired and saw them ""reduced to the role of a supplicant before potential electoral partners, the Shiv Sena and the Shiromani Akali Dal.""

5. Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha skirted controversy when he said in a press conference that ""there are some people within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) who do not want to see Narendra Modi as Prime Minister."" His comment was considered directed at JD-U president Nitish Kumar

4. In Maharashtra's Dhule district, five persons were beaten to death by a mob on suspicion of being child-lifters. This was just one is a long list of incidents in the rural hinterland where people were beaten or killed simply on suspicion of being child-lifters or thieves owing to false rumours on social media.

3. Delhi has been in a stretched-out power struggle between the Centre and State governments. In early July, the State government implemented a 'happiness curriculum' in all government schools for students from nursery to Class VIII to explore and express happiness.

2. Following days of 'will he, won't he,' Congress and JD(U) managed to iron out the terms of their coalition government and H.D. Kumaraswamy was made the Chief Minister of Karnataka. However, Congress still retained the power to call the shots in the Cabinet.

1. Our most-viewed cartoon of 2018 is by Surendra and was published two days after the Karnataka Assembly election results were declared. Even though the BJP emerged as the single largest party, the Congress managed to retain power following a post-poll alliance with JD(U)."

For the first time, a ministry created by the Government of India,is keeping its core focus on converging all skill development initiatives in the country under one National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF).Annually, more than One Crore youth, have been joining and benefitting from the Skill India program, a mission under the Ministry to equip youth with skills for better livelihood.

Some of the key achievements of the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship are:

PMKVY (1.0) was launched as a pilot in 2015, as a reward based scheme providing entire cost of training as a reward to successful candidates. The scheme was designed as a skill certification and reward scheme with an aim to enable and mobilize a large number of Indian youth to take up skill training and become employable for sustainable livelihood. Under the scheme, monetary reward was provided to successfully trained candidates. During its pilot phase, PMKVY (1.0) trained over 18 Lakh candidates in 375 job roles.

Fee Based Trainings: Under the student paid model for skill trainings being implemented by National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC)approved training providers, over 104 lakh trainings have been conducted till December 13, 2018 since inception. In FY 18-19 till November 2018, more than 23 lakh trainings have been reported in high demand job roles, across 35+ priority sectors, which include renewable energy efficiency specialist, smart cities - concept and implementation, solar technicians, rooftop gardening and F&B services specialist amongst others.

Long Term Training: Under the Long-term training module, there are a total of 15,042 ITIs in the country, out of which 2,229 ITIs got affiliated in 2108. The seating capacity of the ITIs in the country has been increased by 2,94,196 including supernumerary. Directorate General of Training (DGT) which is governing ITIs around the country, published under ""Affiliation Norms 2018"" which is available on www.ncvtmis.gov.in

The project was made effective in January 2018 with 28 States and 7 UTs across the country having submitted their consent for participating in SANKALP. The process of disbursements of funds to States/ UTs is underway. Regional workshops with States/ UTs are also being held to facilitate roll out. To promote decentralized planning, ""Award for excellence in District Skill Development Planning (DSDP)"" has been launched under SANKALP. 223 districts across 19 States/ UTs participated in this. To provide support to aspirational districts in skill development, Aspirational Skilling Abhiyaan has been launched by the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship. Financial assistance of Rs 10 Lakh is provided to each aspirational district through the SANKALP fund. Some other highlights under SANKALP projects are as below:

The reforms also saw launch of Guidelines for Training of Trainer (ToT) and Training of Assessors (ToA) for short-term skill development programs to further strengthen the teaching pedagogy in the ecosystem. This was done in partnership with Temasek Foundation and technical support from Singapore Polytechnic. These would enable convergence of multiple stakeholders such as DGT, NSDC, SSCs, Skill universities and private partners for ToT and ToA programs.

The NAPS scheme aims to promote apprenticeship training and incentivize employers who wish to engage apprentices extending them an opportunity to earn while they learn by enrolling into on the job training. The financial benefit to establishments under NAPS includes i) sharing of 25% of the prescribed stipend, subject to a maximum of INR 1,500 per month per apprentice and ii) sharing of cost of basic training with basic training providers; upto INR 7,500 for 3 months. The apprenticeship scheme engages students from ITIs, Polytechnics, schools, colleges and short-term courses (PMKVY, DDU-GKY, SDI and others). It was earlier restricted to only the manufacturing sector; but the government sees more opportunity for engagement of apprentices in service sector now.

The employers are also given the freedom to build their own curriculum under to conduct the apprenticeship scheme. These reforms have been brought about in the Apprenticeship Act of 1961 so that both the industry and the candidate can get more benefit and equal opportunities of growth. More than 4.8 Lakh candidates and more than 74,000 establishment have registered under the Act since the launch of NAPS.

(i) Bru Project: The project aims for skilling of BRU TRIBE of Mizoram, who were displaced and currently living in the Internally Displaced Person (IDP) camps in the districts of North Tripura. Under the project, 556 candidates have been benefited.

(ii) Katkari primitive tribe: Project aims to skill 1020 candidates from the Katkari tribe in Maharashtra.

(iii) Skill Development scheme for LWE districts:Government is taking many initiatives to bring back the Naxalites to the mainstream of our country.We are implementing the scheme ""Skill Development in 47 Districts Affected by Left Wing Extremism"", in the 47 districts affected by LWE.The scheme is assisting State Governments to establish 1 new ITI in each of 47 affected Districts. Out of the 47 districts, 39 districts are Aspirational.Apart from that, 2 Skill Development Centers are also being established in each of 34 affected districts.It will help the local youth to lead a decent livelihood by way of acquiring skill in these institutes.

(iv) Common Facility Centre for Filigree Craftsman:Odisha has a rich heritage of art and crafts that has been made popular by the work of local artisans, work that dates back over 1000 years. In an endeavor to further upgrade the skills of these talented artisans, and make them self-reliant, the Skill-cum-Common Facility Centre for Filigree Craftsman at Cuttack was launchedin April 2018.The centre enables further industry level training using/in latest technology. It also provides training on marketing strategies, including ecommerce, so that the artisans can be self-sustained and engage directly with buyers.

' '

A $15.5 billion market in the US, the youth sports market rivals the size of the $14 billion NFL. Youth sports markets are comprised of segments that represent revenue generation from travel, equipment, team membership, facility construction, software, and venue rental. Leagues who purchase and distribute sports software to teams or clubs have created a large market from what were previously disparate parts of what was not ever not even a market, just people buying clothes and equipment, and loosely organized groups of youth playing games on community fields.

As a result of this coalescence of the varying market segments brought about by youth sports software, the youth sports market has become well defined. Apps are used for communication. The primary purpose of youth and adult sports team sports is to deliver fun for the youth. Other agendas get mixed in, like building a strong and healthy body, developing a well-rounded and pleasant personality, developing team skills, and preparing a child to be a professional athlete. Youth sports depend on communication, tournament play, and video coaching that are needed to run a team effectively. Transaction management, registration, and fee collection are key aspects of some of the software.

Youth sports facilities can become part of a community development program. Every team, every sport has appeal and as there is more leisure, as the economy spins out more and more wealth at the top of the economic scale, there will be more spending on sports. Professional sports, betting, fantasy teams, semiprofessional teams, and teams just for fun will continue to look for venues and players.

Youth sports are sure to benefit from this trend. The brightest and the best will want to get top notch sports training for their children, and the entire middle class will follow as best they can. Sports are fun, the professional teams have begun to recognize that they need to invest in team development programs targeting children starting at age 3. This is when you can get the attention of the child and build skills incrementally that are providing a steady stream of youth available later for the professional teams.

Professional teams have noticed that the most ardent fans are those who played a sport as a youth. All the professional leagues have to invest in youth sports because otherwise they do not have players now and fans later.

Foundations and corporate arms of all large companies want to invest in supporting youth of the country and what better way than through sports. They can tie educational advancement of the sport interest.

Communities have to invest in youth sports providing activities that are supervised and better for all the residents, sports and teams have greater society benefits than the enjoyment of team play. Communities have found that it is cheaper to invest in planned sporting activities and keep children involved than to deal with the problems caused by kids that grow up without supervision, getting in trouble all the time.

The police departments have become interested in connecting with youth in a positive manner, spending money and time to get to know kids and provide guidance when needed. They are active in getting communities to fund development of facilities. It will be a problem to pay for all the facilities that communities want to build, so it will be interesting to see if communities find ways to contribute to the capital investment needed.

Private investment that sees benefit youth sporting programs is building in quantity. Foundations generally see the benefit of children being given sport opportunities.

The schools have by and large defunded gym programs for children creating a healthcare crisis of major proportion in the US and other parts of the world with childhood obesity and asthma creating lifelong chronic disease problems. The good news is that youth sports programs are becoming more available in more affluent parts of the world, poised to deliver healthy activity and build life long habits of movement and athletic skills development.

The market opportunity for youth team sports depends on a strong alliance between the schools and modern recreational facilities that meld education, drama, music and sports in a manner that supports learning and athletic development as one melded event.

With the advent of online learning, more students can move at their own pace and achieve academic excellence. One challenge is to make this happen in the context of incorporating sports achievement at the same time. Athleticism and brain development can be melded if education is done right.

Six in 10 children ages 6-12 regularly participate in team sports in the US. These sports programs are organized or casual.

With organized sports, there has been a rise in the number of travel teams, with the programs active at ever-earlier ages. There has been significant definition and growth in the youth sports industry. The coaching and league formation task is demanding for kids, families, and communities. Much of the organizational process has been automated with software.

The youth sports market is set to grow in response to increased interest worldwide in youth sports development programs. The programs are inherently satisfying to children and youth, giving them skills and accompanying self-esteem that translates to support academic skills as well as athletic ones. Software has become an important aspect of making team play easy to manage.

More changes are coming as digitization drives use of video so parents and children can share on the Internet the experience of team play. Video capture of game and practice play is poised to provide coaches and assistant coaches with an ever-increasing array of ways to help players improve play on the field.

Little league coaches bring a lot to the children whom they coach. The individual attention to skills development is a treasure to each child it touches. Stories proliferate about the value of little league coaches to girls and boys who had a dad or mom missing at crucial times of growing up. The same is true for the Girl's and Boy's clubs.

In these cases, a substitute parent is an invaluable part of forming a strong personality, able to be responsive to others, fit into a team, and perform with integrity. The coaches teach values in a context of fun.

The youth sports software is sold or given away free to teams, leagues and tournaments. Often a league will distribute the software to teams, clubs, or tournaments. Sometimes teams and clubs buy the software directly. A lot of youth sports software had been homegrown functionality bolted onto a stable platform. This homegrown small market software has basically become outdated, slated to be replaced with packaged, licensed or cloud software that is more robust.

The youth sports software provides registration and payment collection. The payment collection aspect of the software is sometimes important because it creates a way to collect a transaction fee that is used to pay for the software and provide continuing revenue to the provider.

The primary purpose of youth and adult sports team software is to deliver robust, automated process for the registration, scheduling, web site construction, coaching management, communication, tournament play, and video coaching that are needed to run a team effectively. Transaction management and fee collection are key aspects of some of the software.

According to Susan Eustis, leader of the market research team that prepared the study for WinterGreen Research, ""Vendors are making acquisitions to upgrade software so it is able to provide a wide range of capabilities. Modules brought in from different companies and developers are difficult to integrate into a functioning platform. Once a platform is in place, the organization of travel teams is facilitated.""

Market growth comes from increased benefits of organization in youth sports leagues. Travel teams and tournaments are in vogue. These do not happen in a consistent manner unless there is automated process in place. Automated process is just better for making a team function smoothly, eliminating vast amounts of politics. Shared resource is always a problem, having automated management is better. Once one aspect of the team management is automated, there is demand to automate all the processes across the board leading to plenty of consolidation and acquisitions in this market.

In a $15.5 billion U.S. youth sports market, the youth and amateur adult league travel teams are gaining traction because they provide family vacation fun while improving skills of a youthful player. This is a nascent market, there is no end to growth in sight. Markets are expected to reach $41.2 billion by 2023. Youth sports teams will continue to get more organized and depend on software to provide increased management efficiency. Video images of play will provide better coaching.

As many as 13 schools have recorded zero enrolment, while another 171 schools have fewer than 20 students. A total of 1,140 schools have fewer than 40 students.

These were the details furnished by the state in 2017-18 to the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), a database about schools in India, developed at the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA). According to officials, the reason for the low enrolment is parents' preference to private schools due to lack of infrastructure, teacher absenteeism, and poor quality education in government schools, among others.

This is in addition to 1,773 schools without buildings, which the government plans to merge with nearby schools with infrastructure. The merger plan comes after the state failed to land for the 1,773 schools. Most of these schools have been merged. Of them, 190 schools in Patna district alone.

The enrolment in government schools dropped to 1.8 crore in 2017-18 from 1.99 crore in 2016-17. The number is expected to drop further when fresh data is examined, diluting the government claim of more than 99% enrolment.

The most alarming trend reflected through U-DISE is that the dropout rate from Class 9 to Class 10- almost 25% of the total enrollment in 2014-15, which jumped to 39.73% in 2016-17, the period when there was unprecedented increase in the number of students failing in Bihar class 10 and 12 board exams.

One of the reasons for the drop, authorities admitted, is parents' preference for private schools for better education and infrastructure.

""If the incentives (such as scholarships, bicycles) attached with government schools are removed, the number will drop further. Many students get admitted to government schools to avail incentives but study in private schools. In 2011, when reports on inflated enrolments surfaced, it created a flutter,"" an education department official added.

Three years ago, the then principal secretary, department of education, Amarjeet Sinha, had said the duplication of enrolment in government schools could be up to 20%.

Bihar Education Project Council (BSEPC) director Sanjay Singh, however, said that the drop in students' number was due to government's drive to do away with duplication in enrolment. ""The number children availing mid-day meal has come down to 1.20 crore compare to previous years,"" he added.

Singh said that the sanctity of data was being maintained. ""Earlier, there was no data on private schools. Now, that is also being prepared. Around 12 lakh more students have joined private schools, not necessarily because they have suddenly opened, but because they are being documented,"" he added.

Singh said under the Right to Education Act, there should be a school within a kilometre for Class 1-5 students provided there are a minimum of 40 students. ""If that is not the case, teachers can be used elsewhere more effectively. Having 3-4 teachers for fewer than 40 children is not relevant,"" he said, adding he would do another appraisal in January after studying the reasons and reports of physical verification."

With the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) announcing on Sunday that exams for Class 10 are beginning on February 21, 2019, and those of Class 11 on February 15, city students have expressed their worries, saying exams should have started just at their usual time of March to leave them some time for preparation.

Madhur Vaidya, a student in a private school of Chandigarh, said, ""This year there is hardly any time for preparation. It is December already and we are going to have our board exams within a month. I am very nervous, especially for exams of Maths and Science. ""

Manpreet Kaur, a student of the Government Model School, Maloya, said, ""This year there is not even a single holiday between exams of political science and mathematics. I am worried how students, who have arts and mathematics as a combination, will study these for Class 12.""

However, Simran Singh, a student of the Government Model Senior Secondary School, Sector 37, said, ""I think the date sheet is fine, but we were not expecting the exams this early. Usually, the exams start in March.""

What teachers say

Arvind Rana, a teacher of social studies at the Government High School, Sarangpur, said, ""Students should also notice that they have been informed duly about their exams well in advance, unlike previous years when the date sheet was released in January end.""

""Because of the poor result last year, teachers have already prepared their students accordingly,"" Rana added.

Meanwhile, St John's High School principal Kavita Das said, ""In most of the schools, they finish their syllabus by December. Now, mostly practising and testing begins. My students will not be uncomfortable with early exams.""

Das said, ""When we had taken up this matter with CBSE, they told us that they are advancing smaller exams so that results are not delayed.""

While district education officer (DEO) Anujit Kaur could not be contacted for comments, sources in the DEO's office said, ""CBSE takes in consideration a lot of factors while framing the exam dates. While advancing the exams this year, they have kept the future aspects in mind as well. General elections are scheduled around March-April next year. They do not want admissions delayed because of that."""

We are all in constant pursuit, yet somehow more often we experience stress and anxiety.

No matter what we seem to do, happiness seems to escapes us, or remains only for a brief while. ""One of the most pleasing and beneficial arts in our life we can learn is the art of happiness,"" says Swami Mukundananda, international authority on mind management and creator of the challenge.

Inspired by the challenge, people across the globe are taking on a special new year resolution of achieving real happiness, instead of simply conveying new years wishes. Over the first 21 days of January, each day of the #HappinessChallenge people will take away practical tools and navigational guide for their own path to happiness.

Focusing on building inward happiness is a truly a small investment that has been scientifically and medically proven to improve better overall health, reduce stress, improve relationships, and increase energy and productivity.

The official global launch of the #Happiness Challenge takes place at JKYog headquarters in Dallas, TX, USA on December 31st. The launch opens with an exciting Happiness Scavenger Hunt, followed by the viewing and discussion of the first learning video. There will be a group challenge activity, followed by a Smile-and-Laughathon. Daily group happiness activities in Dallas will be followed live around the world through social media.

Happiness Ambassadors, volunteers who inspire others to take part in the challenge, have organized a growing number of events in USA, Canada, many parts of Asia, and Europe. Starting January 1st, thousands of Happiness Ambassadors across the globe are organizing both private and public group events to inspire people to participate in the challenge.

Organizers plan to set up Happiness Concierges in temples, ashrams, schools and hospitals, and other public and private places where they will dispense doses of cheer, smiles as well as learning resources about the art of happiness.

Having a global wide community focus on inner happiness will not only spread joy and sunshine inside, but it will have an outward positive effect on individuals and communities. It only takes a few percent of people around the world to have a huge impact on outlook, community cohesiveness, and even peace around the world. (NewsVoir)"

The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights, which has been making rounds of canteens in private schools to check if they are providing nutritious food, found that in all the 10 cases so far, students are being given food high in fat, salt and sugar content, something that is strictly prohibited.

DCPCR has been inspecting the schools to ensure effective implementation of Food Safety and Standard Authority of India guidelines, which are prepared by the central advisory committee of the body as advised by the Delhi high court in 2015. Recently, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights had asked states to ensure an effective implementation of the norms.

Ranjana Prasad, member DCPCR, said: ""NCPCR had decided to check if these guidelines were being followed and we are doing that in Delhi. We have so far covered 10 private schools in south Delhi. In most schools we saw that the canteens were selling HFSS food and gave whatever the students asked for. The children do not know what is good for them and what they should eat."" The canteens were serving burgers, chowmein and beverages -- all strictly prohibited in the guidelines.

A research recently published in the Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that there is a link between consumption of HFSS food and obesity. Numerous studies done among schoolchildren of Delhi, Amritsar and southern India show that the prevalence of overweight/obesity is high and on the rise. In urban post-pubertal children of Delhi, it increased from 16% in 2002 to about 24% in 2006. It is high among the affluent class and children of private schools compared to low and middle-income groups.

Apart from selling food that's high in sugar and fat content, none of these schools had a canteen policy in place.

""It is most surprising that none of the schools knew about the canteen policy. As per guidelines, the canteens are required to provide different kinds of food. They are supposed to have 80% of the menu as green food, which includes vegetables, fruits and others. It is important to raise awareness about it among schools, children and parents so that the children grow up healthy,"" said Prasad.

The inspection will be carried out in all the schools of the city and the Directorate of Education has recommended that the guidelines are strictly implemented."

According to the earlier norms, only government schools were allowed to become part of the board. Through the Maharashtra International Education Board (MIEB), the state education department aims to bring in a curriculum similar to that of international schools in state-run institutions. A total of 455 schools, including government, aided and self-financed schools from across the state, have applied to become a part of the board. In the first phase, the schools will follow the curriculum of the new board from pre-primary to Class 3, with Marathi as the medium of instruction for the first year. Currently, the governing body of the board is in the process of scanning the applications from schools to select the final 100.

Tawde said the government would pick 25 private schools and 25 aided schools, along with 50 government schools, as the first 100 schools under the board. ""We have got around 40-45 applications from private schools this year, so we decided to allow a few good private schools to join,"" he said.

Heramb Kulkarni, an educationist from the state, said the government needs to be careful before allowing private schools to become a part of the initiative. ""While some private schools are doing good work, they need to set criteria for selection. The move should not benefit schools run by politicians and big corporates,"" he said.

Government schools that would become a part of the selected 100 will be named 'Bharat Ratna Atal Bihari International School' in the memory of the late former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Currently, 13 schools in the state are being run as per the MIEB curriculum on a pilot basis. ""We want to ensure people pick state's international schools over international boards. Experts who are a part of the initiative have come up with a great curriculum,"" said Tawde."

Earlier, the state had decided to extend the programme only to government and government aided schools. ""We are now looking to give affiliation to 50 government schools, 25 government-aided schools and 25 self- financed schools,"" he said.

Of the 455 applications the new board has received, approximately 45 are from private unaided schools. ""We have received a lot of requests from schools to be affiliated to the board. We also thought it would be a good way to build the board's brand and give the schools a chance to look beyond the other international or national boards,"" said Tawde.

Currently, there are 13 zilla parishad schools in the state where the MIEB curriculum is being developed and delivered. For the next academic year, the state has called for applications to hand out 100 more affiliations. Even as the board plans an expansion, the curriculum is still a work in progress.

While already rolled out, the MIEB was officially launched on Tuesday by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and union HRD minister Prakash Javadekar.

Launched on the birth anniversary of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, all government schools affiliated to the MIEB will be called Bharat Ratna Atal Bihari Vajpayee International School.

""Vajpayee gave the country a direction in progress across sectors but education was very dear to him. Hence, launching the board on his birth anniversary is an apt tribute to him.

Officials, teachers and the department were all the same even four years ago, but what was missing was inspiration,"" said Fadnavis.

UIDAI has asked the school authorities and their managements to ensure that no child is denied admission for lack of Aadhaar.

Aadhaar issuing body UIDAI has asserted that schools cannot make the 12-digit biometric identifier a pre-condition for student admission and warned that doing so will be against the recent order of the Supreme Court. The word of caution from UIDAI comes at a time when admissions to nursery and entry-level classes have just begun in over 1,500 private schools in Delhi.

However, there have been reports of certain schools insisting on Aadhaar as one of the documents required for admission.

The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has said it is aware of the reports that some schools are asking for Aadhaar cards for student admission.

""This is not right. This is not as per the provisions of law...school admission and other facility to children cannot be made conditional to production of Aadhaar,"" UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey told PTI.

""In fact, schools should admit children without Aadhaar and ensure that children are given Aadhaar once they are in schools by arranging special camps for them,"" he said.

Asked what action could schools face if they continued to insist on Aadhaar, Pandey said that it will clearly be seen as contempt of court.

In September this year, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of Aadhaar but clipped the scope of the biometric identity project, ruling it was not mandatory for bank accounts, mobile connections or school admissions.

The apex court held that Aadhaar would remain compulsory for filing of Income Tax (IT) returns and allotment of Permanent Account Number (PAN), as well as welfare schemes.

The SC verdict emphasised that it would not be mandatory for school admissions, as also for the examinations conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Examination, National Eligibility cum Entrance Test for medical entrance and the University Grants Commission."

It has been republished from The Quint's archives on the anniversary of the deadly tsunami that hit Chennai in 2004.)

A brown stained building with a roof torn and windows shattered stood in Keechankuppam, a small fishing hamlet in Nagapattinam.

After the tsunami waves had calmed down and people came out of their safe shelters, they were rattled by sight in front of them. It took a long while for families to pick up the broken pieces of their lives and start over. Help poured in from everywhere and people began moving away from the coast into homes built by the government. New utensils and books were bought and memorials were built.

But this school in the village was left abandoned because the building was ruined beyond repair. There was a sense of fear looming over it.

80 children who studied in the school died in the tsunami.

I was 10 when the tsunami struck. We ran away and returned when everything was normal again. I wondered what the school would be like. The then Principal sent word to all friends of the kids who died in the tsunami, so I went to school and my teachers told that most of our friends had died... My best friend Sathyavani too. Even today I cannot forget her face.Kokila, who is now working as a teacher in the same school

Fast forward to 2017 - The school which was once in ruins has been recognised by the Tamil Nadu government as one of the best schools in the state with the highest number of children joining every year.

The Fear Is Real

Situated between the river and the sea, the people in the village feared sending their children to this school again.

The scene of giant waves gobbling up the school haunted them. Gradually, the strength of the school went down to just 92 in 2012, from 428 in 2004.

The school had to be renovated and so a teacher working in a village nearby was called in to give the school a second lease of life.

When the Going Gets Tough

A new school building came up in 2008. But still there were no kids joining school. Balu joined as the Principal of the school in 2013 and he took it upon himself to transform the lives of the children.

People of the village told him that if the school had facilities like no other, then they would fight their fears and send their children to school.

To begin with, he installed a projector and turned one of the classes into a smart classroom. By the next year, the entire school was turned 'smart' and everyone started looking up to Balu's school.

In 2015, 134 kids joined and the school was recognised by the Tamil Nadu state government as the school with the second largest number of children joining school in the state.

To overcome fear, we brought in smart classes and made the school worth coming to. Once the school got the reputation, many children came in. Today, at the cost for 45 lakhs, given by officers and the village, the school has become what it is today.R Balu, Principal

Balu got tsunami ravaged discarded furniture from banks and offices, repaired and polished them. Today, every classroom has tables with drawers and lockers.

Making wealth out of waste, literally, and a small reminder of the hardships they've endured.

Putting Private Schools to Shame

The school today has everything that a private school offers in terms of infrastructure. The classrooms are Wi-Fi enabled, it has science and computer labs, RO drinking water facilities, clean toilets, a huge playground, greenery all around, interactive classes, laptops and even a rooftop garden !

In the book, there will be only one picture, but here we have so much more. We can see places where we can never go in real life. For example, we usually see only one picture of Taj Mahal from the outside, but now we get to see what the roof looks like, what stones it us made of. I want to come to school without bunking a single day. Tamilarasi, Student

They have a recognised Parent Teachers' Association and conduct regular meetings to address grievances. The management works in the way Parliament does - the Principal is the President, teachers are the chief ministers and the children are in charge of departments like sanitation and hygiene.

For the Village, by the Village

The school's transformation was possible owing to the overwhelming support from the villagers, service organisations and government departments.

The village was impressed with the efforts of the Principal and so requested him to give a list of items that they can donate to the school.

Just like a wedding where the family goes on a procession with gifts for their daughter, the villagers prayed at the local temple and walked to the school with fruits, vegetables, tables, chairs, stationery, black boards, skeletons, equipment for the labs and whatever each one could donate.

One of the fisherfolk who didn't have the money to donate, gave a box of chalk pieces as a token of gratitude for building such a remarkable school.

But the Principal has bigger plans - at least five laptops for each classroom, exclusive computer science and physical education teachers, and school buses.

Showering Laurels

The PU school is one among 11 in its category in the State, and 100 in the country, to receive the Swachh Vidyalaya Puraska. The school got the coveted ISO stamp and was honoured with the Kamarajar Best School award by the Tamil Nadu state government.

Balu was awarded the Best Teacher National award by former President Pranab Mukherjee.

Memories Linger On

The school has a memorial set up for remembering those children who lost their lives to the tsunami.

The children who were traumatised by the deaths of their classmates are today serving as teachers in the same school.

Dear children, had you been alive, we would have given you such good education. Today you have not died, you have sowed the seeds of prosperity. Soon the children here will someday become IAS, IFS, IRS officers and you children should bless them all with such big dreams. An ode from Principal R Balu to the children who died in the tsunami

The past decade has witnessed an exponential rise in the adoption of smartphones, internet connectivity and e-commerce. This has subsequently opened up the entire country to smaller retailers and manufacturers.

In this backdrop, with the rise of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) adopting e-commerce, the next pillar of sustained growth will be to tap into global markets. Invest India, the National Investment Promotion and Facilitation Agency of the government of India (under the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion), partnered with Yes Bank Transformation Series, will present this challenge to the brightest minds across B-schools and tech institutes for crowd sourcing perspectives and solutions on how MSMEs can build momentum on growth and capture opportunities presented by global markets.

Yes Bank Transformation Series, which has emerged as an idea crowd sourcing platform has partnered with national institutions over the last three years, seeking to find answers to nationwide challenges. In 2016, the platform had partnered with the ministry of new and renewable energy, government of India, with students tackling the challenge of increasing the usage of roof top solar and making it viable. Last year, in partnership with Atal Innovation Mission, NITI Aayog, the platform sought ideas on the Indian government's ambitious goal of doubling farmer income by 2022 through technology interventions.

The Grand Finale of the 7th edition of Yes Bank Transformation Series witnessed 41 students comprising 15 teams from top educational institutes address themes on how to increase B2C exports from India, initiatives to promote India as a leader in MSME exports, and how Indian MSMEs can further leverage global opportunities. The solutions were presented to an eminent advisory council comprising subject matter experts and senior representatives from Invest India.

The sizeable impact of e-commerce on India's MSME sector supplemented by policy, market and technology interventions are the need of the hour to ensure prosperity for associated industries and the Indian economy as a whole. The forthcoming national e-commerce policy aimed at levelling the playing field for foreign and domestic players, offers significant opportunities for the MSME sector.

Rana Kapoor, managing director and chief executive officer, Yes Bank, said: ""Over the last five years, this platform which we created as a case study challenge has now become an innovator's club -- visualizing and actualizing innovations not only for us and our partner organizations but also for national challenges set by government agencies. Some of the ideas presented today, if implemented, have the potential to be game changers in the MSME space, and this is a matter of great pride for us. For us and for tomorrow's leaders who are an integral part of the Transformation Series, the challenge next year would be to co-create solutions using emerging technologies like AI/ML, blockchain, big data, which can directly be implemented across sectors.""

At the finale, Deepak Bagla, managing director and CEO of Invest India, said: ""MSMEs are the pillar of India's economic growth, contributing over 28% to India's GDP (gross domestic product). Today, MSMEs are embracing e-commerce as an opportunity to increase their geographical reach and access at minimal costs. Proactive support from the government and increased awareness will help create an online presence with access to a global audience. I believe the Yes Bank Transformation Series is a great initiative to catalyse growth of this sector by leveraging the brightest minds towards ensuring that MSMEs can benefit from the undeniable advantages of online platforms.""

The significance of the journey of over 100 days filtered into the morning session of the Grand Finale 2018 on 28 November. The top 15 teams arrived and presented exhaustive solutions to the advisory council. After an intensive round of debate, discussions and deliberation, it was decided that three teams had finally conquered.

'B Squad' from IIM-Bangalore edged out 'A Team Has No Name' (Indian Institute of Foreign Trade) and 'Cryptonite' (SJSOM, IIT Bombay) to win the Yes Bank Transformation Series 2018 award. ""At the finale, I was amazed by the ideas and the depth of the solutions presented by all participating teams. The judging panel was very diverse with industry experts from multiple domains. The questions asked by the panellists were very thought-provoking and also helped us in realizing the possible areas of improvement and further research, which we hadn't even thought of. And lastly, it was an amazing feeling when I realized that we had won,"" said Farhan Ansari, a member of the winning team from IIM-Bangalore.

The winners were awarded ₹5 lakh, the runner-up received ₹3 lakh, and the second runner-up won ₹2 lakh.

Samanvay, an ecosystem to bring together disconnected bodies, processes and policies. The platform will be fortified with a comprehensive micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) e-export policy to ensure coordination between government bodies, private companies and MSMEs in driving business-to-consumer, or B2C, e-commerce export growth.

Project Disha will be the on-boarding and pull initiative under Samanvay at the district level, aimed at assisting micro, small and medium enterprises to develop internet/e-commerce literacy.

This would enable on-boarding of MSMEs (generating awareness of required approvals/licences), sustainability (via single-point nodal body for all issues), and support through creating awareness on best practices, quality standards and technology.

Project Vihaan, regulated by the MSME Export Council, will provide targeted marketing assistance based on country of export and category of export, make cluster-specific marketing policies and provide brand building assistance.

First Runner-Up: A Team Has No Name, IIFT

For promotion of cross border e-commerce, the team recommended a four-pronged strategy to be implemented by the government-consolidation of rules and regulations through a single government policy for e-commerce, aggregator-led MSME cluster development model, amendments to foreign trade policy and simplification of customs, set-up e-commerce pilot zones to offer integrated services such as customs clearance, registration of goods, and bonded warehousing.

The team also proposed an e-commerce initiative called UnboxIndia, a campaign for an assorted gift box of authentic local Indian products to customers abroad, packaged as an experience.

Second Runner-Up: Cryptonite, Shailesh J. Mehta School of Management, IIT-Bombay

The team proposed a single national digital platform for MSMEs to obtain information and submit documents, and to provide them with the facility of bonded warehouses to allow storage, distribution and logistics operations of goods awaiting clearance from customs duties in the destination country.

Another salient solution presented includes leveraging and scaling the infrastructure of Indian postal system to provide a coordinated, interoperable monitoring platform for tracking shipments."

Gaps in infrastructure and lack of awareness are among the primary reasons why the Directorate of Education (DoE) has failed to draw applicants to seats reserved for differently abled children in the city's private schools.

For the first time this year, a three per cent quota for children with special needs was introduced within the 25 per cent EWS/DG category. Despite inviting applications thrice for about 1,300 seats in the category, 1,268 seats are still lying vacant with no applicants. The fourth draw of lots for these seats, to allot schools to applicants, will be conducted on Wednesday.

The Indian Express looked at reports of inspections carried out by the DoE across popular private schools in the city in 2015, to find that most lack the adequate number of special educators, disabled-friendly washrooms and even signage.

The DoE had inspected schools which were identified as having infrastructure to cater to differently abled children.

Of the 162 schools that were inspected to check for facilities for visually impaired students, 156 did not have Braille books, 132 did not have large print books and 143 did not have embossed maps and globes. Only five had Braille signage and 158 lacked tactile pathways. Special educators were missing in 114 schools and 110 did not have disabled-friendly washrooms.

Advertising ExplainedNot enough special educators in MCD, govt schools

Schools in Delhi -- government and private -- are unequipped to cater to students with special needs. In South and North Municipal Corporation schools, there are only 63 special educators against 1,084 sanctioned posts. Even in the city's government schools, the number of special educators is much lower than the requirement. Despite court orders and studies that make a case for integration of children in the same classroom, those with special needs are mostly sent to specialised schools. While specialised attention for differently abled children is required in many cases, there is barely any regulatory mechanism to monitor the functioning of these schools.

Of 169 schools inspected for facilities for those with hearing impairment, 160 did not have a speech therapist and 112 did not have visual and digital signage. Most schools out of 145 schools inspected for facilities for children with autism did not have tools of educational functional, language and communication, social behaviour and motor skills assessment.

According to disability rights activist Dr Satender Singh, one of the main reasons that such few applications come to schools is the lack of inclusive and accessible infrastructure and tools in schools. ""How many schools in Delhi are even accessible for persons with disabilities and how many have qualified special educators to help these students? There are also a number of learning disorders such as dyslexia, which require special teaching and learning tools. Given the gap, parents will prefer to send their children to specialised schools,"" he said.

The government also sees the lack of awareness as a challenge. Director of Education Sanjay Goel said that the department aims to step up publicity for these seats in the coming academic year. ""We will try to increase awareness about these seats. This is also the first time that this quota is being operationalised; once more students start taking admission through it, hopefully awareness will increase and we will also be able to encourage schools to improve their infrastructure,"" he said.

The process for nursery admissions for the 2019-20 session is already underway for applicants under the general category. The directorate, meanwhile, is yet to release the admission schedule for the EWS/DG category."

A strategic inflection point is upon us. Legacy structures aren't working. New capability creation is critical. Storytelling needs a makeover; while television commercials are not irrelevant, the digital footprint is growing rapidly and demanding that we think new, fresh and radical. Profits are at an all time low, fundamentals are at stake.

For agencies, the rapidly evolving business could either reveal new opportunities or open the door to a downward spiral. What must ad agencies do and how must they change, is a question that occupies most in the business today.

The good news is that new agencies have begun exploring models that are lean, agile, capable, responsive and hopefully more profitable. What has emerged are a bunch of compact, integrated structures framed by an expanding web of collaborative relationships. One also hears of a new agency that is built on the lines of a private equity fund focused on start-up companies. All these are exciting developments.

ALSO READ: App-based streaming services are the new moguls of advertising in India

Legacy agencies have also begun integrating acquired digital and CRM agencies with their main agencies. Clearly all these developments hinge on the objective of exploring new-age models of working to deliver superior counsel and value. The tectonic shifts and real threats notwithstanding, the centrality of ideas in value-creation hasn't diminished. In fact more than ever before, clients are seeking ideas that will help them grow in a VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity) world.

So what must inform the new age agency business model?

Diversity of talent: The 'Hollywood model' seems to be the way to go. A strong core team with capabilities like strategic planning (including data and digital), ideation and creativity, business development and production co-ordination complemented by special purpose teams. There may be an advisory board of subject matter experts and production services can be outsourced. Such models are highly adaptable, allowing us to reassess investment decisions more often. High engagement means motivation is strong and skills are evident allowing agencies to command a premium. However it needs high levels of collaborative and negotiation skills, enabling cultures, fluid structures and innovative training and development plans.

Non-standard deliveries: The output is going to get increasingly non-standard, forcing agencies to look beyond tried and tested ways of delivering what clients want. An integrated agency's mandate will be to create strategic-communication interventions anywhere on the value-chain.

Building leaders: For the longest time, this industry has operated on the belief that leaders create themselves. The year 2018, more than ever before, has highlighted the fact that we couldn't have been more wrong. There is a serious paucity of talent and it is time to tap new sources. Art schools, business schools and competing organisations need not be the only focus. We need to go wider and find, create, nurture and groom leaders with a superior state of new-age-readiness across creative, strategy and business.

ALSO READ: Brands hog the big screen as advertising on other platforms clutters up

The profit imperative: Agency remuneration needs a review. Generating good quality ideas and having the tenacity to produce them well, is a tough business. Technology may have made it more efficient but it can never make it easy. The fee system (arguably brought in as a fairer way of remuneration over the commission system) has in many cases, degenerated into a cost-saving measure. A tighter model with senior level engagement and sharper accountabilities will help reduce costs while making a stronger case for higher remuneration. However, we do need to move towards a fairer model, well-aligned with the eclectic talent and capabilities being sought, so that agencies could keep investing in new capabilities with an R&D mindset that the new age demands.

Transmedia brand engagement: It is an exciting world today with a zillion possibilities (including but also beyond traditional media) of conversations, messaging and transactions done through a careful seeding or sharing or gaming and what have you. Layer this further with fascinating data discoveries made through the AI lens, and there is a rich territory to play in. Moreover, as the human condition evolves, storytelling gets richer too. In the days and years to come, navigating this staggering array of touchpoints for creating a clear role for the brand in the lives of people will be a huge challenge. Optimising budgets while finding the conversation plus media sweet spot will not be easy. For new models to work therefore, we will need new talent structures led by classical brand champions and strategic planners for uncovering basic consumer motivations as well as writers, art directors, UX designers, data scientists, customer experience specialists, business strategists who know how to monetise and extract growth from personalisation and media-channel planners to help optimise the touchpoints.

Over the past few years and months, some moves towards a new model have been set into motion. But these are early days still and it will take some time for new models to settle down and hum like well-oiled machines. The list of things to be done or added or removed will keep growing and it will be a while before the emerging models settle down into lasting structures. Meanwhile, it will hold us in good stead to reflect on some of the imperatives that have emerged, as businesses and the way we do business keeps changing."

Later, the police lodged an FIR against Seema Tyagi, resident of Indirapuram, and Manisha Tyagi, a resident of Kakra village of Niwari area, and over a dozen others. They were charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

Seema Tyagi alleged the police concocted a story that the association members had confronted the police and tried to obstruct them from performing their duty at the meeting.

On Monday night, the police allegedly barged into Seema Tyagi's house when she was alone at home, ransacked the place and ordered her to report at the police station on Tuesday morning.

Christmas, marking the birth of Jesus Christ, was on Tuesday celebrated with fervour and gaiety across the country with lakhs of people thronging churches since morning to celebrate the day.

Across Mumbai and Maharashtra, the faithfuls thronged around 200 big and small churches in the city and suburbs. Many rang in the Christmas at midnight of Monday-Tuesday singing carols, hymns, sounding church bells and greeting each other 'Merry Christmas'.

Several lakhs draped in warm finery, attended the special Midnight Mass in churches, schools, colleges or open grounds which started at 10 p.m. on Monday that lasted till early on Tuesday.

Colaba, Fort, Mazagaon, Byculla, Marine Lines, Mumbai Central, Dadar, Bandra, Santacruz, Andheri, Malad and Borivali have been wearing a dazzling festive atmosphere since a week in Mumbai.

Gigantic multi-coloured stars, with ""Merry X'Mas"" in large letters, have been put up at prominent squares, housing complexes and other places.

Most Christian homes were lit up with Christmas stars, twinkling fairy lights, colourful festoons, big and small Christmas trees and the benevolent Santa Claus.

Mumbai's newest landmark, the Worli Christmas Tree, holding a record as the country's tallest naturally growing pine conifer tree, is now around 67 feet tall and beckons one from far away.

Following the Midnight Mass festivities, there were big and small private parties.

The festival was celebrated in the northeastern states with special prayers, hymns and masses in churches, followed by the traditional community feasting.

Over 5.3 million Christians live in Mizoram, Nagaland, Meghalaya and Manipur, while there is a significant number of them in Tripura, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.

The Governors and Chief Ministers of all the seven states conveyed their warm greetings to the people on the day.

In Tamil Nadu people celebrated Christmas with religious fervour, traditional gaiety and enthusiasm.

Bishops and priests led the faithfuls at the Midnight Mass in cathedrals and churches as bells tolled, signalling the moment of nativity of Christ.

Early morning masses were also conducted in many churches across the state.

People in new clothes thronged at their parishes for special prayers and exchanged greetings and pleasantries.

Christmas trees dotted various shopping malls and hotels across the state. The largest congregation was held at the Santhome Basilica in the city.

A festive spirit marked Christmas celebrations across Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh on Tuesday as thousands of people visited churches to offer prayers and did some last-minute shopping.

In Chandigarh, the Sector 19 Cathedral and other churches were beautifully decorated with hundreds of people joining in singing of Christmas carols and offering prayers since Monday evening.

Reports of celebrations also came in from Amritsar, Batala, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Patiala and Bathinda, among other places.

Kerala too celebrated Christmas as midnight mass and early morning services saw a host of enthusiastic believers congregating at their parishes.

With the priests pouring a few drops of wine into the mouth and handing over a piece of cake at the end of the services, the nearly four-week lent came to a close.

For all those devout Christians, who undertook the lent, the most important meal of the day was the breakfast, as non-vegetarian dishes returned to the palate after the lent break.

The traditional Syrian Christian breakfast included, appom, stew (chicken or mutton) fish molly, duck, beef, egg roast, steamed banana.

In Christian-concentrated areas of central Kerala, where floods created havoc in Pathanamthitta and Alappuzha districts, some churches conducted Christmas Carol at damaged homes and handed gifts to the residents.

Christmas celebrations in Kashmir missed the traditional snowfall this year as an unabated cold wave continued.

Urdu and elite private schools were also among the majority that either did not participate in the drive or saw poor turnout.

The civic body now plans to carry out a repeat drive in 200-odd schools that saw low turnout from January. BMC statistics show that the drive could be carried out in 3,242 of the 4,056 targeted schools in the city so far. The campaign will now span out from schools to the community.

Schools in five wards -- E (Mazgaon, Nagpada, Byculla), D (Tardeo, Girgaum, Walkeshwar, Malabar Hill, Altamount Road), M-East (Deonar, Govandi, Mankhurd), L (Kurla) and P-North (Malad) -- have seen poor coverage. ""Some of these wards have a predominant Muslim population. In order to allay their apprehensions, we have had meetings with community leaders and are hopeful of seeing an increase in acceptance,"" said Dr Chandrasekhar Chiplunkar, BMC's assistant health officer.

The city has an estimated 29 lakh children between the age group of nine months to 15 years, of whom around 17-18 lakh are school-going. ""We have managed to cover 73% of the targeted schools so far. Overall, though, we have vaccinated a little over 40% children,"" Chiplunkar said, adding several schools that had refused the drive in the beginning, are now willing to join in since the vaccination of over 12 lakh children has seen minimum adverse effects.

Elite schools haven't been able to convince parents though. ""A well-known pediatrician came to address parents' concern but they were still worried about the quality of the vaccination and the need to vaccinate if a child had already taken the dose. So the school had to back out,"" said a parent.

Meanwhile, community leaders are continuing their efforts. For instance, Dr Zahir Kazi, president, Anjuman-I-Islam, said their students had participated in large numbers. ""We are now telling others that our students have not suffered after vaccination and we hope that builds confidence among other parents. We have also suggested to the authorities to hold drives for students of all mediums to ensure the Muslim community does not feel they are the only ones being administered the vaccine,"" he said."

But what if your day job thrusts you alongside your champion? What if you not only perform the same role as him but have been touted as his potential replacement? Welcome to Zubayr Hamza's world.

""I grew up idolising Hashim Amla,"" Hamza told Cricbuzz shortly after his inclusion in South Africa's thirteen man squad for the upcoming three-Test series against Pakistan starting on Boxing Day in Centurion. ""He has been a hero of mine for most of my life. Just to be spoken about in the same sentence as him is a great honour.""

He continues: ""At first I was nervous to talk to him but he is so approachable. He is always happy to offer advice and we've had a few dinners together. I've already learned so much from him about batting, about being a professional, about how to conduct yourself in a change room. He's also very funny. Even if it adds some pressure I don't mind the comparisons.""

That is comforting to know for those who wish him well. The comparisons aren't going to stop.

For one thing, both right-handers prefer to bat at three and represent the Cape Cobras franchise in South Africa's first-class competition. Both relish batting for long periods and can soak up pressure and probing spells until bowlers knees turn to jelly. At that moment, he unfurls a volley of counter punches. And, in a country gripped by identity politics, it is impossible to ignore their similar skin tones or that they share the same faith.

There is no escaping that the powers of Amla are on the wane. He has scored just three Test centuries in the last two years - two against Bangladesh, one against Sri Lanka, all on favourable home wickets - and has seen his average dip to 47.23, below par for a player of his calibre.

Does Hamza's call-up herald a new dawn? Has Cricket South Africa's conveyor belt managed to churn out a Hashim Amla 2.0?

""I can only be Zubayr Hamza 1.0,"" the young man says with a chuckle. ""I can't go out and try and be like Hashim Amla. There will never be another player exactly like him. The way he scores runs, the way he hits the ball, his flourishing back-lift; he's such a special player and human. If given the chance I will go out and be the best version of me that I can be.""

Hamza grew up in the shadows of Table Mountain in leafy Rondebosch where he cut his teeth at the prestigious all-boys high school that bears the suburbs' name. Walking the same corridors and facing throw downs in the same nets as Gary Kirsten and Jonathan Trott, Hamza received all the cricketing education he needed.

""I wasn't one of those guys who went to private coaching,"" he said. ""The level of coaching at the school, as well as the history of the place, were enough for me. I started life as a fast bowler but when I realised that I wasn't growing fast enough I made the switch.""

He would go on to represent the South African Schools team as well as Western Province Under-19s. Though he missed out on selection for the triumphant Under-19 World Cup squad of 2014, captained by Aiden Markram and boasting Kagiso Rabada and Andile Phehlukwayo, Hamza knuckled down and kept churning out runs at first class level.

That same year, at 19 years and 113 days, he became the fourth youngest South African to score a double ton at that level by registering an unbeaten 202 against Namibia. In doing so he provided a demonstration of his immense powers of concentration, arguably the most potent weapon he possess in his batting arsenal.

""To be honest it's not something that comes naturally to me and is something I'm constantly fighting,"" Hamza confesses. ""My main objective when batting time is to keep doing the basics for as long as possible. That's something I've learned from watching the experienced players, Hash included. You don't have to be extraordinary all the time. You just have to keep doing the ordinary things well in extraordinary moments.""

Next to Hamza's bed side table is the book 'The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do, and How to Change' by Charles Duhigg. By examining the traits and rituals of legendary figures as varied as Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps to civil-rights activist Martin Luther King Jr., the author has drawn links between success and habit.

""The book has helped me on and off the field,"" Hamza discloses, suggesting a fair degree of introspection, another trait he shares with Amla. ""Repetition - that is the key to success. Of course you need to adapt but in order to get the most out of what you have it's important to keep working and working until the things you need to do out in the middle become second nature.""

Apart from his choice in literature, Hamza credits his franchise coach Ashwell Prince for developing his mental fortitude. When the former Proteas batsmen took charge of the Cobras last year he found a team in disrepair and languishing at the bottom of the four-day first class competition. Now, after six matches of the 2018-19 season, the Western Cape outfit are sitting pretty at the top of the table with five victories.

""Ashwell has instilled the same values in me that made him so successful,"" Hamza said. ""His attitude and work ethic are both inspiring. He'll admit that he was never the most gifted but his record [66 Tests, 3655 runs at 41.64, 11 hundreds] shows that he got the most of what he had. His mental strength is just incredible.""

Prince is equally complimentary of his young charge: ""He has everything he needs to make it at the highest level,"" he said. ""Mentally and in terms of his skill he ticks every box.""

From 52 first-class matches Hamza has scored 3648 runs at 49.29 with nine centuries and 23 fifties. Last year he plundered 828 runs from nine matches at 69 and earned a call-up to the South Africa 'A' team that toured India in August, averaging 52 from the two unofficial Tests.

If selected, Hamza will wear the number '100' on his cap. It will mark a seminal moment for the new, racially unified South Africa that restarted the Test cap counter when the Proteas were welcomed back to international cricket in 1991. For other, more cynical, fans, it will serve as a reminder that those who played in the sepia-toned era, including legends like Barry Richards and Graeme Pollock, have been forgotten.

""I try not to focus on those sorts of things,"" Hamza says, stating that he does not wish to find himself in the middle of any conversation around politics. ""The number on my cap won't be important. All that will matter is the badge on the front.""

He may have to wait a little while yet. Despite the absence of the recently retired AB de Villiers, The Proteas top and middle order looks set. Aiden Markram and Dean Elgar have formed a formidable opening partnership and Theunis de Bruyn and Temba Bavuma showed enough in Sri Lanka to be confident of their place in the side. With Faf du Plessis nailed on as captain and Quinton de Kick secure as the swashbuckling keeper/batsman, the last remaining position up for grabs is the one occupied by Hamza's hero.

""I can tell you, Hash is not going anywhere and still has a lot to offer,"" Hamza said, sweeping aside any talk that Amla's trademark wrists have lost their snap. ""Class is permanent and he is pure class. I'm patient. I have time on my side. For now, I'm just happy to be a part of the squad and learn as much as I can.""

South Africa's Test future is full of potential. In Kagiso Rabada and Lungisani Ngidi they have a fast bowling union with the potential to be as good as Ambrose-Walsh, Younis-Akram or Donald-Pollock. Keshav Maharaj has the potential to be his country's best ever spinner and Markram and de Kock have the potential to be the best players in the world in their positions.

It was in the middle order where things looked unsteady. The hole left by AB de Villiers will taking a long time to fill as will the one left by Faf du Plessis when he calls it a day.

It is far to early to tell, and the comparison could serve as a ballast rather than a springboard, but in Zubayr Hamza there appears to be an appropriate plug for the gargantuan hole that Hashim Amla will leave. If he can follow in the footsteps of his hero, Hamza 1.0 could be someone who inspires adulation for future generations."

A circular by the directorate of elementary education, dated December 20, stated that one section in class 6 of 310 government schools across the state would start using English as the medium of instruction from 2019-2020 academic session.

Tended lovingly since over 46 years by Douglas Saldanha and his elder sister Twila, who passed away in 2005, the tree shines in full glory with a big star at the top, over 10,000 fairy lights, cherubic angels, little fairies, reindeers and snowmen, streamers and festoons, tiny crosses and a paunchy and cheerful Santa, outside the Adarsh Nagar home.

""This year, the tree stands at more than an eight-storied building. We had a special inaugural event last evening and now many people have started coming to view,"" Saldanha told IANS.

Following the Midnight Mass festivities, there were big and small private parties.

Many youngsters and adults in Santa costumes went around distributing sweets and gifts to small children and the poor, visited orphanages, destitute homes and charitable organisations to spread love.

A majority of the malls, multiplexes and shopping plazas were specially decked up to lure buyers offering special festive season discounts and freebies.

Thane, Palghar, Ratnagiri, Nashik, Pune, Solapur and other cities also celebrated the birth of Christ.

Various Christian communities, like Roman Catholics, East Indians, Marathi, Konkani, and others celebrated it in their own traditional ways.

Many also availed their year-end break to hillstations or beaches, with most tourist resorts in Matheran, Mahabaleshwar, Panchgani, Jawhar, coastal Konkan booked to their brim till New Year week.

A group of class-9 girls from state-sponsored Plus-2 High School in Lava panchayat in Patamda Block of East Singhbhum district, about 30 km from district headquarter Jamshedpur, successfully saved their classmate Rabni Tudu from child marriage on Sunday.

Interestingly, the group of UNICEF's child reporters also included Laxmi Karmakar from nearby Rahedih village who was saved from the menace of child marriage by same group when they were in class-8.

Rabni's father had fixed her marriage in February next year though the final date was not fixed as yet. The preparation for Rabni's marriage was on in full swing in their house when this group of her half a dozen schoolmates led by Shreya Varma visited her house at Kiyabohal village on Sunday, accompanied by their former teacher Pankaj Kumar who is now posted at a Jamsehdpur school.

""For past few days, Rabni was secretly crying in the school but couldn't muster the courage to tell us her problem. After much effort, she revealed that she would be married off in February and her study would end soon. We immediately decided to visit her house and convince her parents against it,"" Shreya Varma told HT on Monday.

""This mission of education first, then marriage (pehle padhai, fir sagai) must go forward. I am happy that my schoolmates stood up for me and stopped my marriage. I will now join the movement against child marriage too. Pankaj Sir also did a lot to convince my father against it,"" an elated Rabni said.

Rabni's father Indu Tudu said in their community girls are married off at tender age and hence he had fixed his daughter's marriage in February next year. ""But I realised what her schoolmates are saying is right. So, I have decided to defer the marriage till my daughter completes her education. I have also intimated the groom's family about our decision,"" Tudu said.

Shreya led a group of girls, including Laxmi Karmakar, to Rabni's house and met her mother as her father was working in the farmland.

""Her mother told us that she too didn't want Rabni to stop her studies and get married at such tender age. We then called her father and told him the harms, ill effects of child marriage and that her daughter was a brilliant student. Though he was angry and reluctant initially, he eventually agreed not to marry Rabni off before attaining adulthood,"" said Shreya.

UNICEF observer from Adarsh Seva Sanstha (an NGO) Uttam Kumar Mahto said all the girls were UNICEF child reporters and wearing its badges when they visited Abani's house.

""They have been spreading awareness on child marriage, child labour and such issues in the schools and villages under UNICEF programme. We visit at least two schools a day out of 15 identified in Patamda Block. Earlier they had stopped Laxmi Karmakar's marriage too when she was in class-8,"" said Uttam.

Uttam added that a private coaching centre would felicitate the brave girls and Rabni Tudu on Tuesday. ""Owner of the institute has also announced to bear the cost of Rabni's education up to plus-2 level. We also took Rabni to children friendly Patamda police station today(Monday),"" added Uttam.

Officials had said that the illegally-run school's building was in a ""poor and deteriorated"" condition. ""There are 685 government primary and upper primary schools.

Singh said of late, some good companies have come forward to play their roles under the CSR initiative and they have adopted the schools after signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the administration.

We weren't even a single mass of land. Mumbai, or Bombay -- I'm not getting political here, but the city has had over 20 names since its inception -- started off as an archipelago of seven islands, which were just part of one ruling empire or another. Not till the seven islands were gifted as a dowry to the King of England in 1661, and eventually handed over to the British East India company in 1667 for a princely sum total of 10 Pounds per annum, did the development of Mumbai as the trading hub we know it as today, began.

While the Portuguese arrived in Mumbai much before the British, ruling the seven islands from the northern bastion on Bassein (current day Vasai), part of their key responsibilities was missionary work. Till the 1660s, the islands of Bombay were dotted with Catholic Churches, with St Michael's Church in Mahim dating back to 1534, St Andrews in Bandra established in 1575, followed by other churches in Dadar (Church of Our Lady of Salvation aka Portuguese Church), Byculla (Gloria Church) and so on.

Well, the English settlers weren't Catholics and in effect, only had makeshift chapels to worship in.

The first place of public worship for the followers of the Anglican Church came up on Christmas day, 300 years ago, in the form of St Thomas' Church.

But first, some history

Back when Mumbai was still an archipelago, the first thing that was done on the main H-shaped island of Bombay, was fortification. Be mindful that the East India Company was a trading company and India was not under the British Crown yet. So like any trading organisation at the time, they had to protect their land. The reason that the area around the current day CST station is called Fort is that there actually stood a fort surrounded by a moat -- protecting the island of Bombay and its natural deep-water harbour (the reason the East India Company was interested in Bombay in the first place) from marauders and pirates.

To enter this fortified city, there were three gates which led the way in. The gate at the northern-most end was called the Bazaar Gate -- that's where the Crawford Market exists now. The southern-most gate which was called the Apollo Gate is where current day Gateway of India stands currently. The gate in between was called the Church Gate -- the location of Flora Fountain. And no, that naming convention had nothing to do with the railway station of the same name nearby. In fact, it was the other way round.

Why it was called the Church Gate, you ask? Well, imagine you are standing outside this Church Gate before the 1860s, what you would then see in front of you was an archway, and through this archway you could see the spire of the St Thomas' Church.

Erstwhile Church Gate with St Thomas in the background. Archival image

St Thomas' Church is what gave the name to the gate, and eventually to the station beside it.

St Thomas' Church was the first Anglican Church in Mumbai, named after St Thomas, one of the 12 apostles of Jesus Christ and among the only ones to have had come to India. The foundation stone was laid in 1674 after the then Governor of Bombay Presidency, Gerald Aungier wrote to the Court of Directors for assistance ""to erect a small church for public worship in the centre of town"" according to Dr V Gupchup's St Thomas Cathedral Bombay: A Witness to History. But from 1675 to 1715, barely any work took place. The funds collected for the construction of the cathedral mysteriously disappeared. What we had, instead of a fully constructed church, was five metre high walls.

After 40 year slumber, church work begins

From 21 September 1714 to 19 June 1715, the then East India Company Chaplain, Richard Cobbe, carried out the service inside two rooms in a building in Fort. Cobbe wasn't too pleased with the unsuitable nature of these services which were carried out in such a private manner. In 1715, Cobbe took over the second part of the construction of this church with a resolve to finish it.

""I ventured to propose the building of a Church for God's honour and service, according to the rule of the Church of England, that all island might feel we had some religion among us,"" writes Cobbe in his book, Bombay Church: Or, a True Account of the Building and Finishing the English Church at Bombay in the East Indies.

19 June 1715, being the first Sunday after Trinity, is when Cobbe recommended a Sermon to preach about building a proper church to have a more public celebration of God. After that, work on the incomplete church began in all earnestness. Cobbe wrote to a whole bunch on probable financiers, requesting them to donate funds for the building of this church. Everyone from the East India Company to businessmen operating out of Surat to Persian businessmen were approached and they donated. The exchange of letters between Cobbe and the benefactors went on from July 1715 to 1720. A sum total of Rs 43,992 was collected in all.

On Christmas Day in 1718, 300 years ago, is when the first service was held in this church.

But it wasn't until July 1837 that the Church was consecrated as a Cathedral, which coincided with the appointment of the first Bishop of Bombay Thomas Carr -- a life-size memorial to whom lies just on the right side of the altar.

A work in progress, reflecting the growing city

The St Thomas' Cathedral as it exists today, was not how it looked in 1718 when it began its public services. In fact, the neo-gothic style of architecture whose interiors are inspired by St Thomas Cathedral in Ireland, got additional elements as the decades passed and funds were easier to come by. Thanks in part to the cotton and opium traders of the time. Many portions of the church were added in the following years. For instance, the tower and clock were added in 1838. The inner chancel was renovated and enlarged in 1860 along with the external buttresses.

It was almost like the church was growing along with the city. From a non-important back of the beyond, to a powerful financial hub during the British era -- the seeds for making Mumbai the financial hub that it is today were planted back in those days.

More than a church

St Thomas' Cathedral is unlike most other churches in Mumbai. The walls of the cathedral are decorated with beautiful poignant sculptures and bas-reliefs of soldiers lost to war, memorials to prominent personalities who have left their stamp in Mumbai's history, such as JA Ballard (after whom the Ballard Estate is named), and much more. The marble plaques remembering fallen soldiers have been financed mostly by their comrades or family members. Unlike the Afghan Church in Colaba, which was built in memoriam of Indian and British soldiers who died in the Anglo-Afghan War, the St Thomas Cathedral has more Anglican memorials.

The altar windows were designed in the 1800s by Victorian stained glass designer and manufacturer, Charles Kempe. There's an interesting bit of anecdote behind that as well. Kempe had hoped to become a priest of the Cathedral, but was prevented by his stammer. However, he said, ""If I was not permitted to minister in the Sanctuary, I would use my talents to adorn it."" And his artwork is there for all to see. The Cathedral is blessed with some impressive stained glass work. Enter the church and look right and you have a stained glass work showcasing St Thomas with the Holy Bible flanked by St Gabriel and St Michael. As you walk down towards the apse, the semi-circular wall also has fine stained glass work, some of which had to be restored over the years.

Back in those days, every church was associated with a school and St Thomas' Cathedral was instrumental in the creation of one of the most popular schools in Mumbai, the Cathedral and John Connon School in 1860.

The Cathedral also saw almost all the baptisms that took place among all the Anglican churches in Bombay back in the 1800s and early 1900s. It kept records of not just baptisms but also marriages and death in all of Bombay Presidency (an area encompassing Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, and parts of Sindh region). A register of these records has an entry of a very prominent person's baptism on 22 January 1866. The son of John Lockwood and Alice Kipling -- Joseph Rudyard Kipling -- was baptised in this very Cathedral. Yes, the author of books such as The Jungle Book and Kim, was a Bombay boy.

It was also considered to be the 'Zero Point' or the centre of the city. The 16 milestones laid across erstwhile Bombay used the Cathedral as the starting point. Come to think of it, the towering spires of the Cathedral back in the day made it the most prominent landmark on the Bombay island.

For probably the first time in the Cathedral's history, some of its artefacts -- around 41 in all -- have been showcased at the ongoing exhibition The Living Cathedral at the Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vaastu Sangrahalay. These artefacts include the Holy Bible that was used to read out from 1870, silver chalices and flagons, a Bishop's staff which has carvings of Jesus as a shepherd, fading black and white portraits of Bishops from years ago and much more. The exhibit is a good journey of the cathedral along with the city in which it existed.

But I'd say, visit the Cathedral instead if you haven't already. Even if you have, visit again, especially now that it has been decorated like a shining star. Walk around its premises, admire the supporting buttresses behind the chancel.

If there was one underrated gem in Mumbai, this is it.

Of these, at least half were from the SC/ST category, with 16 from the SC category and 9 ST students. The General and OBC categories accounted for 12 suicides each, reported the daily.

According to data acquired via an RTI, a majority of the students who committed suicide were boys. Further, the suicide rate hit the double digits in 2016, ringing warning bells in the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti, which issued a 11-page circular as reckoner on the issue.

According to the Express's investigation, the highest number of suicides were in class 12, followed by class 11, class 9 and class 10.

The reasons for suicides range from unrequited love, family problems, punishment in school, humiliation faced, etc.

Of the 49 suicides, 42 were death by hanging. The remaining cases involved drowning, jumping in front of a train and jumping from a height. Most of the victims were either found by their friends or teachers.

Speaking to the daily, the commission of the NVS Biswajit Kumar Singh said the period of the suicides peaked in the three months after summer vacations, and the exam months, confirming the possibility of the stress of domestic dispute, and academic stress.

The Express investigation involved 46 schools, of which 41 schools were approached for interviews, etc. Over the course of their investigation, it was revealed that the schools are currently facing several challenges.

The Navodaya schools were established in 1985 by the government to uplift sections of the poor by enrolling talented students from weaker sections of the society. Since 2012, the schools have boasted a 99 percent pass percentage in class 10 and 95 percentage in class 12, surpassing private and CBSE schools. Located in places with a higher rural population, over 2.8 lakh students currently study in these schools.

According to officials, the hubs have come up by merging three-four smaller anganwadi centres functioning from one big facility, which will serve as one spacious and vibrant play school for children aged 3-6 years. The government on Monday opened 101 hub centres across the national capital.

Officials said those studying in government schools start their education from Class 1 and are at a disadvantage compared to those who go to play schools, which use various tools for cognitive development during early childhood. Poor learning experience in early years creates a gap that gets further perpetuated as children progress to higher classes.

""Earlier, the anganwadi centres used to teach children orally. The government has now decided to make them learn speaking as well as writing and prepare them for bigger classes. The children will also be given homework,"" said Zaheen Begum, an anganwadi worker at a hub centre in Okhla's Batla House, which was inaugurated by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia. ""Parents who cannot afford to send their children to private play schools can now send them to hub centres where their education as well as one meal of nutritious diet would be take care of,"" she added.

The Delhi government has trained anganwadi workers under its new early childhood education (ECE) curriculum, developed by experts, which has many new learning features and techniques based on latest research on early childhood learning and development. Officials said they expect the new curriculum to make their children school-ready. There are about 5.5 lakh children, aged between 0-6 years, who benefit from 10,000 plus anganwadis across Delhi.

The Batla House centre, which has come up by merging four centres in the neighbourhood, has a small verandah outside, a learning centre for kids as well as other rooms. The centre has been decorated with small paintings and drawings to help children enhance their knowledge.

Since four Anganwadi centres have been merged into one, the hub has four workers and four helpers who teach children, look after their food and also take care of pregnant and lactating mothers who need assistance."

Inside the temple, Trinley Thaye Dorje, the co-claimant along with Ogyen Trinley Dorje for the title of 17th Karmapa or head of Karma Kagyu school, is preaching to his followers from all over the world on Buddhism. The 17th Karmapa will become the key leader of Tibetan Buddhism in case the 14th Dalai Lama dies without reincarnation. The two religious leaders have no common ground because the Dalai Lama, like China, recognises Ogyen Dorje, who left India for the US in May 2017 and acquired citizenship of Dominica in March this year, as the real Karmapa.

On Sunday morning after he discreetly meets a group of monks that has made its way from Tibet Autonomous Region of China, the frail looking but mentally alert 84-year-old spiritual leader of the Tibetan people talked exclusively to Shishir Gupta on wide-ranging political and spiritual issues. Edited excerpts:

How is your health these days?

Quite Good... Not very good ..... for an 84-year-old person, quite good. I go for morning walks in Dharamshala also....Here I take around 600 steps each morning in the monastery.

What was the reason for indefinite postponement of the 13th Religious Conference of the Schools of Tibetan Buddhism and Bon Tradition (November 29-December 1, 2018) in Dharamshala? The conference was called to discuss the future of the institution of Dalai Lama.

One important lama (Kathok Getse Rinpoche, Head of Nyingma school) all of a sudden passed away. The conference had to be postponed as it was a period of mourning . It has nothing to do with 17th Karmapa Ogyen Trinley Dorje not getting a visa to visit India. I could not meet Thaye Dorje as he was not present when I went for pilgrimage to the Stupa.

Do you talk to both Ogyen and Thaye ?

No I have not yet met Thaye Dorje. Recently, the two met in France. A rightful beginning. Shamar Rinpoche, nephew of 16th Karmapa Rangjung Rigpe Dorje who took refuge in Sikkim after 1959 uprising, told me that there were indications that Thaye Dorje was reincarnation of the previous Karmapa. In the meantime, Situ Rinpoche (the rival regent) appointed Ogyen Dorje as the Karmapa. I mentioned to Shamar that a high lama in 19th century had five reincarnations. It is possible for 16th Karmapa to have few reincarnations but the holder of the seat should be one. This is like the two Panchen Lamas with Gedhun Choekyi Nyima (proclaimed by Dalai Lama as reincarnation on May 14, 1995) still alive (other being Gyaltsen Norbu who was appointed by the Chinese government). But then some group told me that I should not be talking about the possibility of two or three reincarnations. I said, OK, then I will keep quiet.

Then who will decide the rightful one heir to the seat?

Situ Rinpoche found a remarkable child (Ogyen Dorje) in Tibet. They came to see me and finalise that. Then I said yes to Ogyen as the reincarnation of the 16th Karmapa.

There are now two Panchen Lamas, two Karmapas, now the question comes to the tallest lama, the Dalai Lama. Have you initiated the process of your reincarnation because the Chinese government has already initiated the process?

No, no, no. That is not my business. I made it clear as early as in 1969 that it was up to the Tibetan people to decide whether the very institution of Dalai Lama should continue or not. They will decide. I have no concern. Since the 5th Dalai Lama, the (person holding the) title was the head of both temporal and spiritual affairs. Since 2001, I have proudly, voluntarily and happily given up the political role. We have already achieved elected political leadership (Centralized Tibetan Administration in Dharmshala) and they carry their full responsibility about our temporal affairs. I have totally retired since 2011. So my thinking is more liberal than Chinese thinking which is more orthodox.

But how will people under stress in Tibet decide whether the institution of Dalai Lama should continue ?

It should be decided in a free country, not in Tibet, where there is no freedom.

Have you initiated the process of dialogue on the Dalai Lama institution?

No. Formally, not yet. As the Dalai Lama institution is close to Mongolia, Mongolian people should be involved. I think there should be an international Buddhist conference involving Himalayan people and other Buddhist countries to decide on this. My main concern is that my body, speech, mind and life should be useful to other people. So long as space remains and suffering remains, I remain. My daily prayer is the source of my inner strength. This institution of Dalai Lama, I half-jokingly, half-seriously say, has lasted six to seven hundred years should cease with the 14th with grace. If the 15th Dalai Lama turns out to be naughty as the sixth then the institution will cease in disgrace. The institution could voluntarily and democratically cease with the 14th Dalai Lama being quite famous (he laughs).

Has your middle way approach with China worked ? Is it going to benefit Tibetans at all?

Oh yes. Like Germany and France after centuries of fighting came together after second World War to form European Union on shared common values, we also want to be part of Peoples Republic of China provided the Tibetan culture, language, knowledge and environment are protected. We get more economic benefit for material development as China is rich economically but spiritually we can help million of Chinese Buddhists. This is mutually beneficial. Historically, Tibet has never been part of China and this even some Chinese historians admit. But past is past, we have to live harmoniously and happily together rather than talk in terms of our nation and their nation. People ask me about the future of India and China relations. I say that neither India nor China has the capability to destroy each other. They have to live happily side by side with minor irritants. Ultimately, Hindi-Chini bhai bhai should be the principle. One must remember that there are around 400 million Chinese Buddhists who are inspired by Tibetan Buddhism, which in turn derives majority of its strength from the Nalanda traditions.

There are media reports about Dr Lobsang Sangay, President of Centralized Tibetan Administration (CTA) often disregarding the advice of the 14th Dalai Lama. How is your relationship with him?

No. As he is the head of elected political leadership, all decision-making is in his hand. I have never tried to control the political leadership. But in the meantime, he believes me and trusts me. There are some small rumours.

Will Ogyen Dorje return to India ? We are told that the 17th Karmapa claimant is putting conditions to Indian Government for his return?

That I don't know. Most probably, I think he will return. I recently had discussions with the Ministry of External Affairs and told them that it is between the government of India and Ogyen to decide. I have no problems. It is his business. Not an important matter. There is no question of the Tibetan movement splintering in this context.

Are you looking forward to a pilgrimage to China ?

Yes. Sure. As far (back) as 1954, I expressed my desire to Chinese government to visit Wutai Shan, the home of 13th Dalai Lama. I was told that there was no road. I still have that desire but it is up to the Chinese government. Once a high Tibetan lama wanted to go to Bodh Gaya but his disciple said that the real Bodh Gaya is in your heart. Historically, the Wutai Shan is seat of Deva of wisdom. Whether I am there physically or not, that wisdom from the Deva is already in my brain....very sharp.

Is there any back channel open with the Chinese for resolving the Tibetan issue?

After we decided not to seek independence from China in 1974, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping decided to have a direct contact with us through my elder brother and the dialogue started in 1979. We sent four fact finding missions to Tibet from 1979 but the dialogue ceased with the death of Deng in 1997. The official dialogue again started under President Jiang Zemin in 2002 but ceased in June 2010. Since then there is only an informal channel open with Chinese retired officials and private businessmen coming to see me from time to time. And they have some connection with the top leader. The Chinese are not in touch with the CTA. We never used the word Tibetan Government in exile. It is the Chinese who have used this and recognized them (he laughs).

Of late various heads of government refuse to meet you fearing the reaction of a now all-powerful China? What is your reaction to it?

I have nothing to ask from any head of state or country. I think they are afraid of the Chinese reaction. I met Barack Obama as former US President and Nobel laureate as also late President George Bush Senior. My visit to Sri Lanka was cancelled at the last moment. I have not visited Thailand since it established diplomatic relations with China. I am never allowed into Buddhist countries because I am a Buddhist (he laughs) except Japan.

Any plans to visit the US and meet President Donald Trump?

No because of my physical condition. Normally, I used to go to the US annually for medical check-up. One Indian doctor found traces of prostrate cancer at the Mayo Clinic in USA. A team of 10 doctors discussed and ruled out surgery due to my age and side effects. Instead, I got radiation and have been completely cured of the disease. I have not travelled to US in the past two years as it is too far and I cannot handle too much physical exertion. So instead of going to the US for treatment, I go to a private hospital in Delhi.

US President Donald Trump has just signed "" The Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act 2018"", which allows the Tibetans to return to their homeland or else the Chinese officials stopping them face sanctions. What is your reaction to this?

The present president of the greatest democratic nation is little bit unpredictable. So I am in no position to comment on this as I do not know enough. But both the US houses have been strong supporters of Tibet over the decades and so has been the American government. American people love Tibet.

What is your reaction when you were asked to shift "" Thank You India"" event to mark 60 years of your exile in New Delhi to Dharamshala in April?

The Indian government tried to avoid any obstacle to their relations with China. That is understandable. That is OK. I was not unhappy. Not much. Nothing. Basically, our relations with India are centuries old since a Nalanda master introduced Buddha Dharma in Sanskrit tradition in the 8th century. My body is Tibetan but spiritually and mentally I am an Indian. Today 10,000 monks and now nuns are studying in Nalanda Buddhist traditions with total freedom and not under any restricted environment in Tibet.

Will you or your people ever be able to return to their homeland Tibet?

India is the only place where modern education meets ancient knowledge, which is needed to tackle emotions. I am committed to reviewing the ancient Indian knowledge to tackle emotions. For these things freedom is very important. My return to Tibet is of no use if there is no freedom. I prefer this country and this freedom and then I am the longest guest of India."

The HRD Ministry has revived plans of setting up its own school board for 'Ved Vidya' (vedic education), The Indian Express has learnt.

HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar hinted at this in his recorded message played before an audience at the inauguration of a residential school in Baruipur, West Bengal, last week. In his message, Javadekar stressed the need for imparting education with a mix of knowledge from the Vedas and modern education. He added that the government is working on setting up a school board to achieve this.

As first reported by The Indian Express on May 23, 2016, the HRD Ministry, then under Smriti Irani, had moved a proposal to set up its own school board for 'Ved Vidya', after rejecting a similar proposal moved by yoga guru Ramdev in 2015.

The proposal was submitted by the Haridwar-based Vedic Education Research Institute (VERI) run by Ramdev's Patanjali Yogpeeth. As per this plan, VEB, run and controlled by VERI, would allow affiliated schools to offer a blend of the traditional gurukul system and modern curriculum.

This proposal was red-flagged by the then school education secretary S C Khuntia on the ground that the state's sanction for a private board would open the doors for similar requests from other unrecognised school boards.

After Ramdev's submission was shot down, the ministry quietly scripted plans for setting up its own board for vedic schools. However, this too was put on the backburner for two years, until it was revived in May."

China was leaving behind decades of deep poverty when Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping flew to Japan in 1978 to seal a historic peace treaty between the two nations. Mr. Deng's trip featured a lower-key, but equally important visit -- to a state-of-the-art plant owned by Nippon Steel Corp.

The Japanese steel mill was seen as the model for a manufacturing beachhead China wanted to build in Shanghai, called Baosteel. It was the linchpin of plans to transform China's agrarian economy into an industrial powerhouse.

Baosteel's initial price tag was steep, $6 billion, equal to 36 times China's foreign-exchange reserves at the time. Mr. Deng's response became national lore: ""If we want to do this, let's do it big.""

Mr. Deng, who died in 1997, never got to see how big. At the time of his visit to Japan, China produced 4 per cent of the world's steel. This year, China is on track to produce more than half, a record 923 million metric tons, according to government estimates. It overtook the US in steel production in 1993, sped past Japan in 1996 and last year produced three times as much steel as the US, Russia and Japan combined. Steel made its shipbuilding and auto-making industries into the world's largest.

In the US, China's steel is used for everything from bridges and oil pipes to home appliances and cutlery.

China's emergence as a steel powerhouse over four relentless decades, driven by global demand and supported by government subsidies, cheap loans and tax breaks, helped the country become the world's second-largest economy from one of the poorest. It's also one of the main drivers of trade tensions coursing through the global economy.

Invoking national security, President Trump in March levied 25 per cent tariffs on all steel imports. The Commerce Department said this year that steel imports, singling out China's, were responsible for closing half the steelmaking furnaces in the U.S. since 2001 and reducing steel-industry employment by 35 per cent.

""Free markets globally are adversely affected by substantial chronic global excess steel production led by China,"" the department said. ""China is at the heart of the crisis.""

US-China trade tensions continue at a slow boil. An agreement this month between Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping signaled a temporary cease-fire while negotiations continue.

For anyone wanting to understand how China became dominant in steel, and the global repercussions of that transformation, the story of Baosteel provides answers. Renamed officially as China Baowu Steel Group Corp., it is the world's second-largest steel producer, trailing only ArcelorMittal SA. The company's sprawling complex sits at the mouth of the Yangtze River, ringed by dusty highways and 10-foot-high walls. It has become a familiar target in China's yearslong clash with foreign competitors and regulators in Europe, the US and at the World Trade Organization.

Within months of the Japan visit, Mr. Deng became China's top leader, and Baosteel broke ground with a balloon-festooned parade at Baoshan -- literally ""treasure mountain"" -- an area seven times the size of Manhattan. State media photos show a sea of helmeted workers surrounding a stage of officials.

""China should eventually be able to develop a steel industry comparable in size to the steel industries of the U.S., the Soviet Union and Japan,"" the CIA forecast in 1979, in a report declassified decades later. That turned out to be an underestimate.

At first, China capped its steel exports at 10 per cent of Baosteel's production, seeking to guarantee domestic supplies. ""China in the early 1980s did not plan to compete in international steel market anytime soon,"" said Chae-Jin Lee, a historian who wrote about Baosteel's early years.Then China discovered how exports helped to accumulate hard currency, and the export cap was lifted by the late 1990s. The spread of state-owned mills to all 23 of China's provinces helped steel exports to now account for a quarter of the world-wide total.

Soon after China bet its economic future on trade, other countries leveled accusations of its dumping, or selling products abroad at prices below production costs, in products from detergent to solar panels to ironing boards. A third of trade complaints against China since 2001 by the world's largest economies, the Group of 20, relate to dumping steel products.

By 2016, China's steel industry employed about five million. That lifted workers from the brutal vagaries of farming to the security of state-owned mills that often provided free or subsidized housing, hospitals and schools.

The industry built shipping empires to ensure access to Australian coal and Brazilian iron ore used in steelmaking and tripled the size of the nation's rail network between 1975 and 2017 to speed China's industrial boom.

China's steel-production surge drove down global prices a jaw-dropping 57 per cent from 2011 to 2015, triggering tens of thousands of layoffs around the world. Steelworkers in 2016 encircled the European Union headquarters in Brussels, demanding action to curb Chinese dumping.

Around that time, during the U.S. presidential campaign, Mr. Trump spoke out about imposing high tariffs on ""predatory"" Chinese steel imports.

Beijing said the US supported trade protectionism, and that China was defending free markets.

Help at home

China's steel mills were indistinguishable from the state for decades, run by central planners and buoyed by free land, cheap energy, government capital and low-interest loans.

For years, the arrangement was of little interest outside the country. That changed when China joined the WTO in 2001 and enjoyed sharply lower tariffs for its products. Over the next five years, China's net exports rose to 8 per cent of gross domestic product from around 2 per cent, official data show. Low-wage workers surged from farms to factories in China's industrialized cities.

The rich menu of subsidies helped China's steelmakers set prices 20 per cent to 40 per cent lower than the US, analysts said. U.S. regulators made their first move against Chinese steel imports in 2006: An investigation found that Beijing provided subsidies on pipes of between 30% and 45% of the product's value.

China's Commerce Ministry denied the charges and said it was a ""scapegoat of trade protectionism."" It didn't respond to a request for comment.

China agreed when it joined the WTO to fully disclose subsidies. It was required to report every two years the subsidies from both central and local governments. Five years passed before China submitted its first report, which included only central-government subsidies.

Beijing didn't provide an accounting of local-government subsidies until 2016, which, the U.S. delegation pointed out, was 15 years late. China has yet to provide the WTO with the full value of its subsidies.

Last year, China told the U.S. delegation that it provides no subsidies for steel. China reported this year that it had one steel subsidy, in 2016, totaling $4.4 billion from the central government, and $933,000 from local offices.

Private-sector analysts believe the subsidies are far larger, likely in the ""hundreds of billions of dollars"" since 2000, according to Usha Haley, a professor at Wichita State University who has studied Chinese steel subsidies.

""Thousands of Chinese steel companies list the subsidies they receive from central and provincial governments as parts of their profits -- sometimes to the tune of 80 per cent of profits,"" Ms. Haley said. China's official data said revenue from mills totaled $5.6 trillion from 2001 through 2017.

China said in a WTO filing this year that it made a best effort to provide clarity on subsidies, but the rules didn't clearly define local-government subsidies.

In 2016, US officials conducted a six-month probe in response to complaints from the American steel industry. They concluded that China provided subsidies on corrosion-resistant steel products, including those made by Baosteel, equal to about 40 per cent of sales value.

Regulators at the US International Trade Commission adjudicate such complaints. They compute the impact based on interviews with affected companies and analyze such factors as global raw-material prices and freight rates. It imposed tariffs on corrosion-resistant steel products, from 39 per cent up to 241 per cent. The latest 25 per cent tariff comes on top of these.

Baosteel denied the accusations in a statement at the time, saying its operations are based on ""market forces.""

For now, China's mill workers are more worried about layoffs than the impact of U.S. tariffs. They often gather to read about global industry developments posted on bulletin boards, and bosses give briefings. Beijing, facing depressed global prices and growing debt, has forced the closure of smaller mills. The government aided Baosteel by pushing a merger with its largest rival, Wuhan Iron and Steel Group Co., in 2016, nearly doubling Baosteel's capacity.

Big steel

Baosteel, which exports to 40 countries, provides steel to many of the Chinese companies that dominate the infrastructure of global commerce. The mill is the biggest supplier to China International Marine Containers Group Co., a state-owned enterprise that makes half the world's freight containers.

The company looks next to dominate the manufacture of container chassis that trucks tow on highways across the US.

""Our company was actually involved in pioneering both containers and container chassis in the 1970s,"" said Frank Katz, chairman of Pennsylvania-based Cheetah Chassis Corp. ""Today, nobody builds containers in the U.S. They're all built by CIMC in China. And recently, CIMC decided that they were going to come after the container chassis business.""

Baosteel also supplies Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries Co., another state enterprise, which makes 70 per cent of the world's port cranes.

John Wolfe, chief executive of The Northwest Seaport Alliance, which manages cargo operations at the ports of Seattle and Tacoma, Wash., said ""there is no equivalent U.S. manufacturer of ship-to-shore cranes, and there are few alternatives to Chinese manufacturers globally.""

The Alliance was granted a tariff exemption by the U.S. Trade Representative's office, allowing the delivery in coming weeks of four cranes on order.

Baosteel provided the steel that Zhenhua used to build newer sections of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.

At least once a month, in a redbrick office at Sherrill Manufacturing Inc., the last remnant of what was once the world's largest steel flatware factory, chief executive Gregory Owens opens Amazon.com Inc. and sifts through the offerings of his competitors.

In the dozen years since he and his business partner Matthew Roberts took over the ailing business, Mr. Owens has watched an avalanche of forks, knives and spoons land in the US from abroad.

China went from providing 20 per cent of US flatware imports in 1996 to 67 per cent last year. Department stores that used to feature such American brands as Oneida and Lenox have increasingly turned to generic flatware made in China.

At trade shows, Mr. Owens saw the Chinese evolve over the years from unsophisticated sellers in small booths to star brands on the main floor.

""We had to completely reinvent ourselves,"" he said. Mr. Owens's company has played up its made-in-America brand and trimmed marketing costs by selling to customers online.

On Amazon, Mr. Owens said, he sees new sellers with few reviews, imperfect English and good-quality products -- clues the newcomers are Chinese flatware makers trying to expand beyond retail stores.

He is right. Among the brands Mr. Owens noticed was Artaste, flatware made by a Chino, Calif., company with factories in China's eastern province of Shandong.

For its owner, Liu Yunxing, the U.S. has provided a triumphant career. His Cangshan brand of high-end stainless-steel knives were selected in October for a partnership with Michelin-starred chef Thomas Keller to use at his restaurants, including the French Laundry in California's Napa Valley.

The Chinese steelmakers that supply Artaste, Mr. Liu's lower-end brand, include Baosteel. His top-end Cangshan line uses German and Swedish steel, he said, but Chinese mills are catching up.

""I know Baosteel is good at some blade steel, too,"" Mr. Liu said. ""Potentially we will try it in future."""

Recording of videos of best teachers of the district explaing important chapters in Odia has already started. These videos will be uploaded to 'YouTube' and their links will be provided on the app. Besides the videos, the app will also provide detailed study materials and interactive practice tests.

""We thought of developing this app to provide resources to Odia medium school students on par with those studying in English medium private schools,"" said Mr. Kulange. Most educational apps for school students are in English or Hindi and some of them charge money for their services.

The Ganjam administration is planning to utilise increasing penetration of Internet and smartphones to rural areas to help Odia medium students learn better. Materials provided in the app will also help school students of rural areas who have little or no access to tuitions or coaching classes.

Those schools in rural Ganjam which are still out of reach of Internet connectivity will be provided tablets with materials of the app loaded to its internal memory that can be used offline.

The Ganjam District Collector chaired a meeting at Chatrapur on Sunday evening to discuss the progress in development of this app. Teachers in Ganjam are enthusiastic about this app as it will help them present their best teaching practices before a larger audience throughout the State.

On coming to know about the services of the police in the adopted schools, several higher officials are in queue to adopt the government schools in the district. By mobilising donations in the form of material, several police officers managed to construct additional buildings, playgrounds, toilets and compound walls in the adopted schools.

Similarly, they also provided chairs and benches in the adopted schools. While an additional building, compound wall and playground were constructed at Garividi high school, an additional building and playground were constructed at Jaddupeta high school in Nellimarla mandal. Similarly, toilets were constructed in 20 schools while furniture was provided in 30 schools.

Keeping in view ensuing SSC exams, they also distributed all-in-one study material that was prepared by experts, both in Telugu and English. A complete education is available only in government schools rather than in corporate and other private schools, Vizianagaram SP G Palaraju told TNIE. If proper amenities were provided, students of the government schools would create wonders, he added.

Majority of the top rankers in IAS, IPS and other exams of public service commissions had studied in government schools rather than in corporate and private schools. Keeping this in view we have adopted about 43 government schools in the district. It is made mandatory for station house officers to conduct meetings in the adopted schools by involving teachers, parents and even local heads once a week."

The Aayog said the quality of health professional training and adherence to standards is sub-optimal, including in the private sector.

To address the shortage of doctors in the country, the Aayog has suggested creating conditions to facilitate import of doctors, especially those of Indian origin working abroad, and also deploying teachers from universities abroad as visiting professors at AIIMS or NIEs while linking at least 40 per cent of district hospitals with medical colleges.

It also suggested developing framework for deployment of doctors and specialists from the private sector to government hospitals on a visiting or honorary basis and expanding the system of Diplomate of National Board (DNB) and Diplomas from College of Physicians and Surgeons (CPS).

""Workforce shortages and uneven distribution of doctors, nurses, specialists and allied health professionals plague the sector,"" the Aayog said, while observing that urban areas have four times as many doctors and three times as many nurses as compared to rural areas.

The Gautam Buddh Nagar administration has invited private players to join it in uplifting the infrastructure and quality of education in state-run primary schools under the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative, an official said.

The administration's move comes days after a wall of a private school collapsed in Noida's Salarpur village, killing two children and injuring three others.

Officials had said that the illegally-run school's building was in a ""poor and deteriorated"" condition.

""There are 685 government primary and upper primary schools. When the quality of established private schools is compared with government schools, there is a perceptible gap. The gap needs to be bridged,"" District Magistrate Brajesh Narain Singh said in an official letter last week.

While the initiative to invite private players is new, the administration had inked pacts with leading private firms such as the HCL Foundation and Paytm last year for partnership in around 100 schools.

Singh said of late, some good companies have come forward to play their roles under the CSR initiative and they have adopted the schools after signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the administration.

""Their work ranges from providing infrastructure facilities to improving the quality of education. At times the effort is in form of a joint venture as well. Many are doing good work.

On December 20, DoE had issued the fourth circular to invite applications for such seats from December 22.

In the meanwhile, admissions for entry-level classes for the 2019-20 session for general category seats have already begun and the process for reserved seats is set to start by the first week of January.

Following a Delhi high court order, DoE had in July notified 3% reservation for CWSN within the 25% seats reserved for the economically weaker sections in compliance with provisions of Rights of Persons with Disability Act, 2016.

When the first online application was invited, DoE received just 46 applications (3%) for the vacant CWSN seats. The draw of lots was subsequently postponed on account of such low applications. In the second round held in September, DoE finally conducted the draw of lots and admitted 17 students. A fourth circular was finally issued on December 20 to call for fresh applications.

The details of the schools where seats are vacant were notified by DoE on December 22 and the applications can be filled till December 24. The draw of lots is likely to be held on December 26.

The official document accessed by TOI mentions that skewed admissions have taken place because ""schools are hesitant in accepting"" such students. The district deputy education (DDE) officers have been asked to ensure that no children with special needs are turned away.

Disability rights activists said that schools have been denying admissions as they don't have the requisite facilities to make CWSN students inclusive.

Abha Khetarpal, a counsellor and disability rights activist, said, ""The 3% quota is complete eyewash as the authorities don't check on the schools. The CBSE checklist for schools to become inclusive includes facilities like accessible washrooms, smart boards, etc, but schools don't abide by the norms. There is no mechanism to take action on violations. Moreover, the special educators are not qualified. They are not even equipped to handle a child with epilepsy.""

The PIL for reservation of CWSN was filed in 2014 by the father of a child with special needs. In his plea, he had claimed that the guidelines under Right to Education (RTE) Act completely ignore the interests of children with special needs and disabilities."

Unlike a majority of the schools in the city, the Green Acres Academy is located on a road that was opened to the general public as recently as six months ago. Though the school takes its fair share of measures to minimise traffic congestion in front of the school's entrance, local residents complain that parents of students often park in front of their society's gates while they wait for their children.

Parents worry about children crossing the road to board buses even as cars drive by disregarding the school guard. Pics/Sameer Markande

The school currently has students from class I to class VII. The administration has implemented a system wherein students who have opted for the bus service board the school buses that are parked on either side of the road at 2:45 pm. The remaining students who are picked up by their parents have to wait inside the school building and are allowed to leave only after the school buses have departed by 3:15 pm. During this time, vehicles pile up in front of the school gate and traffic moves slowly for a period of 15-20 minutes.

The narrow road which is close to housing societies

Parents voiced their concern about children crossing the road to board the buses even as cars drive by disregarding the school guard. The problems increase during the monsoon season when parents tend to park as close as possible to the gate to ensure their children don't get wet in the rain which adds to the traffic congestion. The school will soon extend its classes till class X and local residents feel that a higher number of students will inevitably add to the traffic problem.

The school is located on a road that connects SG Barve Marg and Ramakrishna Chemburkar Marg which allows residents of Chembur and Kurla to use Sion-Trombay Road to move towards the Eastern Freeway.

Until six months ago, the road was private and blocked by a wall. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), however, demolished the wall and the road was thrown open to traffic. Local residents are now concerned that once more people start using this road, and the increasing number of students, the traffic issues will get worse.

DirectorSpeak

Aaditya Lohana,

Executive director of the school

'Our system is not very different from that followed by thousands of schools across the country. We have segregated the timings. Parents who come to pick up their children have been given a separate time which is after school buses have left. Parents park their vehicles 300-400 metres away and then walk to the school gate. Most neighbours have no concerns. But we are harassed by a self-interested group of people. We always follow laws and will continue to do so and provide the best education for the children of Chembur'

PoliceSpeak

Dr Saurabh Tripathi,

Deputy Commissioner of Police

'Parking in front of the gate is illegal and we will look into the issue. But as part of the long-term planning of the road will be taken up with local resident groups and school administration. If the school has additional students then additional parking to accommodate vehicles will also have to be arranged'

Voices

Ashwini Prabhu,

A parent

'Earlier this road was closed so there were no safety concerns for the children. But now vehicles use the road when children walk towards their buses. All buses should be parked on the same side as the school gate so that kids don't have to cross the road at all.'

Vishnu Shelar,

A shopkeeper

'When the school begins and ends, the traffic lasts for about half an hour, but clears up quickly. But parents park their cars in front of the gates of residential buildings which is inconvenient for people in the morning when they have to leave for work.'

Hemal Shah,

A local resident

'This used to be a service road. But after our society complained to the BMC as drunkards loitered in the area, they broke the wall and it was opened up. The parents must understand that there is a traffic issue here. They should opt for school buses instead of coming to pick up their children in cars. The traffic police should mark no parking zones. There are no proper footpaths which makes it difficult for pedestrians.'

Major problems

* Parents park their vehicles in front of the gates of residential buildings near the school

* Children cross the road to board their buses

* School van drivers take a long queue of students down the road to board vehicle

* Residents are concerned of the near future when more people find that the road is open to the public"

Gilmour talked to Firstpost about why he chose to look sideways, why he thinks stereotypes are bad for history and why there is more to it than just the debate of right and wrong.

When you began researching or writing this book, were you clear that you weren't going to do this chronologically? How different were the challenges then?

Of course I've written books chronologically. Biographies are of course chronological because they follow the life of a person. I did not find this particularly difficult, to be honest. So many years of research went into reading the personal papers, letters of so many people, I felt it made more sense, and was also easier, to look at the way they lived, approach all this thematically.

Obviously, I have had to leave out some people -- the likes of Robert Clive and Warren Hastings, for example, hardly appear in the book. But I don't think I've left out any occupations. I think, or at least I hope, I have discussed everything in the case of women at least.

The British in India, by David Gilmour

Why a social history of the British? Some would say a social history, or a 'literary history', is rather sympathetic towards the British. How would you respond to that?

There are different types of histories. There is a cultural history, economic history and so on. They can be studied separately. There have been a lot of political histories about the Raj from both sides. But there has never been a social history of the British in India.

There is the idea that people have that every Briton came to India to conquer it, govern it or exploit it for personal gain. But many more did not, many were here accidentally. For example, if you were a young 18-year-old Briton who had joined the regiment in Lancashire or Yorkshire, you didn't know you were going to be sent to India. A lot of the women who came here didn't come here out of choice either. So I wanted to concentrate on a lot of these ordinary people, who accidentally ended up here. Not just write about Viceroys and Generals.

You say in the book that British history, like any other, was down to individual character. Of course, an exhaustive document of each character is impossible to write, but how does one then balance this macro-study with the usually broader approach? Or do the two need to co-exist?

I always prefer to write about people as individuals and human beings and not as groups, categories and classes. And I thought that balance had to be brought in. As soon as you start writing about people as individuals all types of stereotyping dissolves because you see the complexity of motives on an individual level, which really is the crucial thing here. To club them together, like for example Edward Said does, where you are either an oppressor or a victim, leaves out all the different categories in between.

Said, for example, saw the Irish as victims. But to be a supporter of home rule for Ireland you did not have to be a victim. An Irish Catholic civil service officer, for example, who supported Irish home rule was happy to rule 48 million Indians while he was here. So it is complex on a personal level. Individuals often get left out of it, and I hate generalisations.

You write in the introduction that 'pig-stickers, like prostitutes, are also a part of history'. Are historians guilty of filtering? Would you say yours has been a bottom-up approach?

I think they are to some extent. Whenever historians write about the working classes they write in generalities. I have written two biographies of famous people [Rudyard Kipling and Lord Curzon] and that only helped me to want to write about the common people, those who have been forgotten. People in Britain are so distant that may not always care that their grandfather for a forest commander in India or a tea planter in Assam. They have been forgotten, and I felt they needed to be rescued.

Of course, we have very little time to read history as a subject in schools. Even in Britain, we are taught world history more than we are taught British history. There is only so much time. But I think it is important for schoolchildren to know the basic chronology of the country they live in. Afterward, you can specialise. But I really doubt how many hours can be dedicated to the exercise. I pity it, but that is how it is.

You have written two biographies about men who are variably popular in History (British and Indian). But here you ventured sideways into some of those who haven't yet been read or known as well. What did they reveal that was different from the likes of Kipling and Curzon? What were the similarities?

I have had a simple approach to this. To study the archives, the documents, the records and the reports, and go to the writing table and write. I don't think there has to be a debate about similarities and differences. I don't think writers should try and write from the perspective of the others. So I limited myself to Britons.

We still have this thing in Britain that a family might have letters that are 100 years old but they will ask questions like 'why do you want to read the letters of a medical officer' compared to some of the more famous people, Kipling as you say. And I say because even a century later they illuminate so much, about the way people lived and the key choices they made. I find that very satisfying.

A layered theme the book draws on is that of isolation, the loneliness of some Britons in India. What psychological impact do these numbers account for - this is a time when mental health wasn't a thing -- and does it point to the need of, maybe, exploring a psychological side to this History, for both sides?

It hasn't been done to a satisfying degree yet, not that I know of. One often comes across army reports about the suicides of private soldiers in the Indian Army. Private soldiers were aged 18-19 and they probably did not know anyone they could talk to. A lot of that is unexplained. There are just names and dates in documents. I wish there was more detail.

In the case of British women, for example, living in sub-district areas language was a barrier. Their husbands might have picked it up well before their arrival because they had to work and talk to locals. But with women it took time, they couldn't really make friends with locals that easily. Most of these women arrived as mothers, sisters and wives. Not until the end of the 19th century did some of them begin to emerge as officers, doctors etc. But yes, loneliness was a big thing, which I feel is still understudied.

Did anything during your research, in the archives, jump out at you?

I was constantly surprised. Especially just how few Britons were here, considering a lot of them went to Australia, to America and elsewhere. I think what struck me were the personal motivations of some of these people - beyond conquer and govern. Some of them were just desperate to get out of Briton.

The British comedian Norman Wisdom, who was very famous in the 1950s, for example only wanted to run away from his abusive father who beat him. So he joined the Army, and months later he was in Lucknow learning to play the trumpet. He had no idea, he would end up here but he did and lived here for six years. He honed his craft by acting in regimental theatres and returned to England, better than before. So that was a nice story that has stuck with me.

How has the understanding of the Raj's imperial past evolved in Britain over the years? Where does it stand today, what do you think needs to change, if anything at all?

Ten years ago, there were five volumes of Oxford History of the British Empire that were released, written by scholars from around the world, including India. It is not the most readable book, I mean you won't take it on holiday, but it was pretty comprehensive. I know there is this opinion that the British don't acknowledge this imperial past, but maybe that is because they are not needed to. Even when the Jallianwala massacre happened, the top diplomats in the British government condemned it outright. So I think it is absurd to demand an apology for something you haven't done. We can all regret it, of course, and acknowledge how it changed the course of events. But this demand for coming to terms with something seems to me a demand to agree with a person's own personal interpretation of history. I don't think we need to debate history, I think we should study it.

The 24-year-old from Sangatpura village in Punjab's Patiala district had no clue that the morning of 11 December would change his life forever. At six in the morning that day, he woke up to the sudden death of his 45-year-old father, a farmer and village head, who drank pesticide while his mother was getting the tea ready. The father had run up a debt of ₹40 lakh following several years of losses in farming and dairy businesses, and a failed attempt to find Singh a job in Dubai, which cost nearly ₹14 lakh.

Singh, who holds a master's degree in history, returned from Dubai after a 11-month wait to find a driver's job and took to farming. He now gets up at four in the morning. The nights go by worrying how the family land mortgaged to banks can be freed. After a hard day's work tending to the cattle and the wheat crop, his eyes swell up by evening. Singh repeatedly grasps his hair while speaking. ""I am hoping my (younger) brother will find a job... but that may not be enough to pay back the arthiya (commission agents in wholesale markets who advance credit to farmers).""

Since April last year, eight state governments, including Punjab, have announced a staggering ₹1.9 trillion in farm loan waivers. However, no relief has reached the Singh family so far. In June 2017, the newly elected Punjab government led by Amarinder Singh of the Congress approved a farm loan waiver package estimated to cost ₹10,000 crore. However, a year and a half later, just a fraction of farmers has benefited because of the strict conditions put up by the state.

Exactly a week after the death of Singh's father, on 18 December, Congress president Rahul Gandhi upped the ante against Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Gandhi said he would not let Modi sleep till the centre announced a nationwide farm loan waiver. Gandhi cited the example of newly-elected state governments led by the Congress in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, which signed on farm loan waiver schemes within hours of taking charge, in line with the party's pre-poll promise, and said that the Congress would announce a national farm loan waiver scheme if the party were voted to power in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

The Punjab experience, however, does not inspire confidence. Till date, ₹3,500 crore loans of 428,000 farmers have been waived, according to Jasbir Singh Bains, director of agriculture in the state government. The farm loan waiver has covered less than a fifth of the 2.6 million farmers in Punjab. The total disbursal is just 35% of the promised ₹10,000 crore.

""During the election campaign, Amarinder Singh promised to waive loans of all farmers, but a set of conditions imposed during the rollout ensured that most were left out,"" said Jagmohan Singh, state general secretary of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, Dakaunda, a farmers' group.

The conditions for availing the farm loan waiver make little sense in a state like Punjab where the average landholding is more than three times the national average. For instance, according to the agriculture census released this year, the average landholding in Punjab is 3.6 hectares (ha), but the state government decided to waive loans up to ₹2 lakh for only small and marginal farmers, who own up to 2ha. This ensured that farmers like Jagdeep Singh, whose family owns 2.4ha, were excluded.

There's more. The conditions say that only those loans taken by small farmers (who own between 1-2ha) will be waived where the principal and interest overdue did not exceed ₹2 lakh. This meant that a 1.5ha farmer, who owed banks even a rupee over ₹2 lakh, was excluded.

""With costs of farming going up and returns plunging, a waiver of ₹2 lakh means little to us; we will be back to where we are in no time,"" said Nirmal Singh, a farmer from Narmana village in Patiala's Nabha block. ""But this farm loan waiver is more a formality and less a reality... it's like luring a hungry child with a toffee and then taking it back,"" he smirked.

A crowd of farmers gathered around Nirmal Singh complained that as most families did not divide their land between members (say, a 3ha farm is still shared by the father and an adult son and his family), the waiver has eluded them.

In retrospect, the Punjab farm loan waiver scheme appears skilfully designed to exclude more farmers than those included, driven by the lack of fiscal space to deliver on the poll promise (in August last year, the chief minister requested the centre that it be allowed a one-time exemption from the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2013, which restricts its borrowing to a maximum of 3% of state gross domestic product or just ₹12,819 crore, so that it can implement the debt relief scheme).

For the once-prosperous farmer in Punjab, the cradle of India's Green Revolution, a debt of ₹15-20 lakh is common and debts of more than ₹40 lakh in a single family are not unheard of. While part of this is driven by the need to keep up with societal pressures -- such as spending ₹25 lakh on a daughter's marriage -- the debt crisis deepened as a result of commercial banks flushing farmers with credit to meet their lending targets. Desperate for a solution, the government is now contemplating an Act that places a limit on the number of guests attending a marriage and a forensic audit of the agriculture credit portfolio of commercial banks.

Data from the draft state farmers' policy released earlier this year shows that Punjab's requirement of crop loans is around ₹24,000 crore per season, while outstanding loans advanced by banks is ₹60,000 crore.

""There are around 26 lakh (2.6 million) farmers in the state, but banks have issued more than 40 lakh (4 million) Kisan Credit Cards. Over a period of 11 years (2004-05 to 2015-16) the credit offtake has increased by around eight times, while the value of production rose just three times,"" said Ajay Vir Jakhar, chairman of the state farmers' commission.

More than loan waivers, we need better public health facilities and schools,"" said Kaur, who now helps families, in which farmer suicides have taken place, receive state compensation."

This 58-year-old woman who makes a variety of podis (powders), soup mixes, health mixes, condiments and laddus out of millets, has seen her business grow over the years since she started it in 2013. Having started the business to support herself and her family, Ms. Janaki says though she has put her children through college and rescued her family through a financial debacle, she has not lost her entrepreneurial spirit. In conversation with Sanjana Ganesh, she talks about her drive.

""I got married in 1976 and moved to Madurai from Tiruchi. My husband worked at a private company in the city and we had three young children. I realised that an additional income would help the family finances. As the first step, I began working at a company that produced handlooms at Sellur,"" Ms. Janaki says.

She also reared goats and chicken but came to realise that they were not profitable.

She began realising the business potential of setting up a tea shop in her neighbourhood- Thathaneri.

""In the 1980s, this area was filled with paddy fields. There were no buildings. My husband and I decided to set up a tea shop in 1986 to cater to agricultural labourers. Soon Thathaneri became populated and people began demanding butter milk, curd and ghee also from us because of the good quality at our shop,"" she says.

Despite an upswing in business, Ms. Janaki found herself at the mercy of moneylenders when she built her house.

""We spent all my husband's pension benefits to get away from their clutches. In 2003, I joined DHAN Foundation's Sellur Federation and began saving. We were also trained in various trade skills,"" she says.

DHAN Foundation organised a special session for women on cooking with millets in 2008. The participants were encouraged to start their own businesses. This inspired Ms. Janaki.

""I attended every class that Tamil Nadu Agricultural University conducted on millets to expand my knowledge. Earlier, I had no idea about the different types of grains, now I am well-versed in all things about millets and love preparing the foodstuff,"" she says.

Now, Ms. Janaki receives regular orders from Chennai, Tiruchi, besides Madurai, and is planning to supply to schools, colleges and gyms.

Ms. Janaki says marketing her produce in tea shops was challenging since they are priced a bit higher, though it is healthier than the regular products.

""I hope that the business picks up once people realise the importance of choosing healthy alternatives,"" she says."

Some of the parents even had to ask the document-centre people to fill their form for a price. They others asked their employers to help them.

Of the 49 suicides witnessed from 2013 to 2017, half were by Dalit and tribal students, and a majority of them were boys, records obtained by The Indian Express under the Right To Information (RTI) Act show. And all, except seven, were suicides by hanging, and the bodies were discovered either by classmates or members of the school staff.

Known for producing the best results in board examinations, the JNVs, which were started in 1985-86, have become a passport out of poverty for thousands of underprivileged children. Since 2012, these schools have consistently recorded a pass percentage of over 99 per cent in Class 10 and over 95 per cent in Class 12, which is far better than private schools and CBSE's national average.

""The Navodaya Vidyalaya system, which began as a unique experiment, is today unparalleled in the annals of school education in India and elsewhere,"" states the official website of the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS), an autonomous organisation under the HRD Ministry tasked with managing all 635 JNVs.

Advertising

According to norms, at least 75 per cent of the seats in these schools are set aside for rural children. Hence, a JNV is never sanctioned for a district with 100 per cent urban population. A Navodaya Vidyalaya starts from Class 6 and goes up to Class 12. All admissions in Class 6 are done through a merit test. In fact, the popularity of JNVs is evident

from the fact that less than 3 per cent of the candidates appearing for the entrance test every year makes the cut.

However, data obtained by The Indian Express and verified individually with 41 out of 46 vidyalayas, shows that JNVs are facing a serious challenge. The Indian Express has not revealed the identities of teachers and school authorities it spoke to.

Currently, there are 635 JNVs with 2.8 lakh students. As on March 31, 2017, a total of 2.53 lakh students in the age group of nine to 19 were enrolled across roughly 600 JNVs. That same year, the number of suicides touched 14. Hence, the suicide rate -- suicides per population of 1,00,000 -- at JNVs for 2017 works out to 5.5.

In other words, for every one lakh students studying in these schools, almost six students committed suicide in 2017. This is slightly higher than the national suicide rate for a similar age group in 2015 -- roughly 3 suicides per lakh population aged 6 to 17 years.

Given the population in JNVs, the number in absolute terms is not very different from the suicide rate in the general population of that age, but what is significant is the profile of victims -- more than half are Dalits and STs.

Consider this:

-Student suicides in JNVs first hit double digits (12) in 2016 and peaked last year with 14 suicides. In all, there have been 49 suicides in 46 schools across 20 states in five years, from 2013 to 2017. The states of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal and Uttarakhand alone account for more than half of the total suicides.

-The largest number of student suicides (16) in JNVs was by students belonging to the SC category. SC and ST students together account for over half or 25 suicide deaths in Navodaya Vidyalayas. The general and OBC category students account for 12 suicides each.

In JNVs, seats are reserved for children from SC and ST communities in proportion to their population in the district where the school is located, but not less than the national average, which is 15 per cent for SCs and 7.5 per cent for STs.

According to enrolment data as on March 31, 2017, 55 per cent (or 1,41,022) of the total intake were students from the general category (including OBCs) and the remaining -- 25 per cent SC and 20 per cent ST -- from the reserved categories.

-Thirty five, or roughly 71 per cent, of the 49 suicides were by boys. The ratio of boys to girls in JNVs is 60:40.

-All suicides, except six, are by students in Classes 9, 10, 11 and 12. The highest number (15) is of Class 12 students, followed by Class 11 (11 suicides), Class 9 (9) and Class 10 (8).

-In 42 of 49 cases, students died by hanging. That apart, there were two deaths by drowning, two by jumping from a height and three by jumping in front of a train. Currently, there is no system in place for professional counselling of students traumatised after discovering or seeing their schoolmate's dead body on campus.

-The causes of suicides in JNVs are disparate and range from unrequited love, family problems, corporal punishment or humiliation by teachers, academic pressure, depression, and fight between friends. Of these, the first three are cited most often as reasons behind suicides.

Interestingly, suicides peak in the three months following the two-month-long summer break that ends in July and during the examination season, that is, January, February and March.

According to NVS commissioner Bishwajit Kumar Singh, the timing of suicides reflects that students, after spending considerable time at home during summer vacation, have a tough time adjusting to school life or that they are stressed over strained domestic relations.

Alarms bells went off in the Navodaya ecosystem in 2016, when suicide figures hit double digits for the first time. The NVS shot off an 11-page circular in November, 2016, listing out ways to spot suicidal tendencies and prevent suicides on campus. The circular states that when a suicide takes place within the school premises, a JNV cannot escape responsibility.

""A child cannot take all of a sudden such an extreme step without showing some visible symptoms in advance. Vidyalaya administration failed to detect such symptoms though these symptoms were heard or seen by the students they were taken lightly,"" it said.

However, three years after the above circular was released, much of government's plans for stemming the growing trend of suicides in JNVs remain on paper.

This year too India bagged five gold and one silver medals. The students were Amay Deshmukh from Jalgaon, Dhananjay Raman from Delhi, Mohit Gupta and Naman Singh Rana from Kota and Vaibha Raj who won gold and Varun Parua also from Kota won silver.

""Neither the schools nor students or parents are aware of this examination in the region, be they CBSE schools or the state board schools. In fact, none of them even understand the difference between a government-supported Olympiad and private Olympiads which are organized by NGOs and agencies,"" said Hemant Pande who is a former chemistry professor at Hislop College.

Pande was one of the science teachers (chemistry) from the Homi Bhaba Centre for Science Education (HBCSE) in Mumbai which trains the students for this Olympiad at national level. The government exam charges just Rs150 from students whereas the private agencies change Rs500-700.

Pande says that since this happens to be the only government-supported competitive Olympiad examination meant to promote science among students, there is a strong need to promote this examination in the region. ""I have been going to many schools in the city for promotion of this exam. Unfortunately, everywhere the private Olympiad agencies are found to have already booked dates. Schools also don't realize the importance of the government supported examination,"" said Pande.

This year besides Pande, VG Gambhir from HBCSE and Raja Ranjan from BARC were the ones who trained the students. For IJSO only about 30-60,000 students appear in the first round. Of these 300 are selected for stage II exam. Then from these 30-40 are selected for the theory and multiple-choice exam. And of these only six are selected for final competition at global level.

The IJSO preparation and exam develops love for science in students right from Std X. It triggers the thinking process in them and allows them to apply their knowledge. If these students then participate in the senior examination than they get preference in admissions to Indian Institute Science Education and Research (IISER) and the National Institute of Science Education and Research.

Pande tells that now he has taken up the job of creating awareness among Vidarbha schools on himself. ""I am retired now. I want to otherwise also promote the pursuit of science in students. This will also create competitors for higher examinations like the IRIS (Initiative for Research and Innovation in Science),"" he said."

A range of bags adorns one wall of a small store in Dhamani village in Pune district. Mangal Wagh arranges newly acquired beauty products on a shelf along the other. Passersby slow down to wave or call out a greeting to her.

Three years ago, Ms. Wagh (39) would step out of her house to work as a daily wager to look after her family of four. She had to take up work after her husband became paralysed. Today, Ms. Wagh owns a shop that offers wallets, handbags, schoolbags and beauty products, which are popular with women in the village.

Ms. Wagh owes her financial independence to the Ernst And Young Foundation and the Srinivasan Services Trust (SST), the social services arm of TVS Motors. The two organisations have been empowering women by setting up self-help groups in over 100 villages in Pune district.

Three years ago, Ms. Wagh took a loan of ₹20,000 and rented a shop in her village. Today, she teaches five children to make bags and is looking to expand her business. She said, ""I want to learn micro design in embroidery to sell more items. Hardly any shops offer these services here, so people come to me.""

Roopa Sanghuri from Wafgaon village shares a similar story. From being the owner of two cows and a few goats, Ms. Sanghuri now runs a beauty parlour after borrowing ₹10,000 from the self-help group in her village. ""I wanted to save for my daughter. Now, the parlour is running well and I earn around ₹300 per day and save ₹700 a month,"" Ms. Sanghuri said.

Financial independence has changed not only the lifestyle of these women, but also their outlook and standing. They are more confident and are respected in their villages. Sridhar Iyer, national director, EY Foundation India, said, ""Economic independence has a major role to play in women's social empowerment. We are trying to solve monetary issues of rural women by educating them on formal borrowing and low cost, sustainable means of livelihood.""

The self-help groups meet every month and discuss solutions to issues faced by women and their villages. The Gulani village, for instance, was facing water scarcity for seven years due to irregular monsoon, and the lake in the village could not meet the needs of 250 families. Most people had to fetch water from other villages, and the chore fell to the women, who had to walk two to three kilometres every day to get water.

With EY-SST's guidance and help, the women desilted the lake in May last year at a cost of ₹4 lakh. The women met 60% of the expenses through crowdfunding, while EY-SST provided the rest. The village now has water, and the fertile soil from the desilting work resulted in a better crop for farmers.

EY-SST has also helped renovate government primary schools in Khed taluka. Trees were planted, toilets built and school walls painted, prompting parents to withdraw their children from private schools and send them to government schools. The EY-SST operates self-help groups in 2,000 villages in 10 States with the help of local non-profit organisations, and 478 groups in 162 villages in Pune district."

All schools including government, aided and private have to submit the self-declaration as being tobacco free to the DEO. The schools were also directed to display sign boards in the schools.

The self-declaration submitted to the Director of School Education by December 28 will be forwarded to Voluntary Health Association of India.

While the temperature in the early hours dropped to 3.7 degrees Celsius, making it the coldest December night in four years, pollution levels breached the emergency mark once again. The last time the air pollution reached the emergency level was during the post-Diwali period in November.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast that another cold wave could hit Delhi in the middle of the week. Chances of respite from such high levels of pollution are low in the next two to three days, government agencies said.

A multi-agency task force headed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has already advised people with respiratory ailments to minimise exposure to such toxic air.

Citizens have been urged to reduce the use of private cars. While measures such as shutting down the Badarpur power plant, closing brick kilns and banning diesel generators are already in place, some more such as a ban on construction activities, rolling out the odd-even road rationing scheme and closing schools could be announced.

""The night temperature dropped to 3.7 degrees Celsius on Sunday because of cold northwesterly winds and a clear sky. It is the coldest December day since 2014. The temperature had dropped to 2.6 degrees in December 2014. In the last three years though, the temperature hasn't dropped below 5 degrees in December,"" said an official from the IMD.

The city was also engulfed in a moderate fog cover with visibility dropping to less than 500m. While within the city, the visibility dropped to around 400m in the morning, in Palam it was even lower at 300m.

""Even though the average Air Quality Index (AQI) value of Delhi worsened from 421 on Saturday to 450 on Sunday and remained in the 'severe' category, the concentration of particulate matter - PM10 and PM2.5 - crossed the 'emergency' or 'severe-plus' level mark in Delhi and NCR,"" said a senior official of the CPCB.

The last time when concentration of pollutants in the air had breached the emergency mark was during the post-Diwali period. The AQI had shot up to 486 then. On a scale of 0-500, an AQI value above 400 is considered to be 'severe'.

""On Sunday around 5 pm, the concentration of PM10 shot up to 553ug/m3, while the level of PM2.5 touched 377ug/m3. On November 9, after Diwali, the level of PM10 had touched 565ug/m3 and PM2.5 had shot up to 453ug/m3,"" said a CPCB official.

While the daily permissible limit of PM10 is 100ug/m, a value above 500 is considered to be an emergency situation. In case of PM2.5, while the safe standard is 60ug/m3, a value above 300 is considered to be an emergency.

""The night temperature could rise by a degree or two over the next two to three days because of an approaching western disturbance. It would however dip again after the disturbance passes away. We are expecting another cold wave around December 26 and 27,"" said the IMD.

The IMD has also forecast that moderate fog could engulf Delhi over the next two days because of low night temperature, low wind speed and heavy moisture levels."

BJP president Amit Shah on Sunday launched a scathing attack on the Congress for not bringing to justice the guilty in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.

Speaking at a conclave of the BJP's booth level workers in the national capital, Shah, in a veiled reference to the Congress, said that the Sikh victims had been denied justice for so many years because ""the perpetrators of the riots were also the protectors (of the accused)"".

He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre in four years of its rule had not only ""assured justice"" to the victims by formation of a special investigation team but also provided compensation to the affected families.

""After the formation of the Modi government, a compensation of Rs 5 lakh has been given to the victims and the formation of SIT has been done to punish the culprits,"" said Shah.

The BJP chief also lashed out at the AAP for what happened in the Delhi Assembly over the adoption of a resolution on the 1984 anti-Sikh riots and said it was like ""rubbing salt"" on the victims' wounds.

The Delhi Assembly on Friday adopted a resolution on the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in which it was demanded that the Bharat Ratna awarded to former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi be withdrawn, but the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) swiftly distanced itself from the reference to the Congress leader.

Later, Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi Manish Sisodia clarified that the lines about the former PM were not part of the original resolution placed before the House. He said it was a handwritten amendment proposed by a member, which and it cannot be passed in such a manner.

He questioned the Congress' stand over the issue and accused Congress chief Rahul Gandhi of supporting illegal migrants. ""In Assam alone, 40 lakh infiltrators were identified. Soon Rahul and his company started making a ruckus in the Parliament. Why are you so worried about them?

Various associations of school teachers in the state have already registered protests against the recommendation.

Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, the other day, gave a slew of recommendations in the Niti Ayog's 'Strategy for New India @ 75' and one of his recommendations was a complete overhaul of the school education system by improving the standards of teachers and revising the curriculum.

According to office bearers of Kerala School Teachers Association (KSTA), the recommendations will only lead to teachers losing their confidence.

""The periodical examinations to test the efficiency of teachers will only create differences among them. Also conducting the test is practically impossible. We will not allow this to be implemented in the state. We have many additional duties apart from teaching. If the quarterly examinations are implemented, there will be more pressure on teachers. Hence we will stage a protest to stop the Centre's move,"" said K C Harikrishnan, general secretary, KSTA.

He also said the Union Government's recommendation could be on the basis of the increase in the number of unqualified teachers in many schools in North India. "" In Kerala, the appointment of teachers are being made in a transparent manner and all are qualified too,"" Harikrishnan added.

The unaided school teachers and private school teachers have also echoed the opinion of KSTA and they said they can not handle more pressures and this will adversely affect the academic performance of the students.

""The Union Minister said in the recommendation that this will improve the education standards. But as far as Kerala is concerned, the academic performance of students are moving in the right direction.

""The teaching is also far better compared to other states. So there is no point in implementing the recommendation here,"" said Sreekanth (name changed), a private school teacher.

In the report, the Union Government has recommended that the spending on education should be increased to at least six per cent of GDP by 2022. Niti Ayog has addressed the key areas such as school education, higher education and vocational education.

The report has also made recommendations to improve enrollment, learning outcome, employability, and reduce stress on school children.

Meanwhile, A Shahjahan, General Education Secretary told Express that the state had not been intimated by the Centre on the recommendations so far.

""We have not been told so far to implement the recommendations. Firstly, we will be consulted and will discuss the practical possibilities. After the discussion, we will decide whether to proceed or not with the Centre's recommendations,"" he said."

It also suggested developing framework for deployment of doctors and specialists from the private sector to government hospitals on a visiting or honorary basis and expanding the system of Diplomate of National Board (DNB) and Diplomas from College of Physicians and Surgeons (CPS).

""Workforce shortages and uneven distribution of doctors, nurses, specialists and allied health professionals plague the sector,"" the Aayog said while observing that urban areas have four times as many doctors and three times as many nurses as compared to rural areas. Medical and nursing colleges are concentrated in a few states like Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Gujarat and Maharashtra.

Pointing to the severe shortages in the category of allied health professionals (AHPs) including medical lab technicians, optometrists and radiologists, the Aayog has sought the establishment of a Council to ensure standardization of education and putting in place quality control mechanisms for educational institutions, teaching methods and workforce management.

It suggested putting in place an updated curriculum for medical and allied professions that keeps pace with the changing dynamics of public health, policy and demographics.

As far as specialists are concerned, the Aayog observed that a large number of posts are vacant all over the country. According to estimates, India needs close to five lakh additional specialists, the report highlighted. There is also an acute shortage of medical faculty.

Of the 1,830 faculty posts across six All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), approximately 583 (31 per cent) had been filled up until July 2017, the Aayog pointed out.

Assuming 80 per cent availability, the Aayog estimated that around 8.18 lakh doctors may actually be available for active service. This gives a doctor population ratio of 1:1613 against the WHO norm of 1:1000, it said. The current nurse-population ratio is 1:588.

""Due to the suboptimal quality of training offered by several institutions that have mushroomed over the years, limited career prospects and poor working conditions, especially in the private sector, there is a significant shortage of skilled nurses in the country,"" the Aayog stated.

The current nurse-population ratio is 1:588.

""Due to the suboptimal quality of training offered by several institutions that have mushroomed over the years, limited career prospects and poor working conditions, especially in the private sector, there is a significant shortage of skilled nurses in the country,"" the Aayog stated.

""Private practice by medial faculty in teaching institutions is rampant in several states, compromising on the commitment to teaching and institutional clinical work,"" it highlighted.

Among the constraints the Aayog mentioned were poor infrastructure in many state and private medical/nursing/dental colleges.

It further said that health professionals in the public sector are inadequately compensated and motivation levels are extremely poor.Fair compensation in the private sector, for nurses, is also a challenge.

The Aayog has suggested creating a cadre of primary healthcare practitioners by introducing a three-year competency-based dynamic course for primary, community and family medicine and partner with private hospitals or private medical practitioners to skill technicians, nursing and para-nursing as well as para-medical staff to deal with paucity of health professionals.

(Written by Norimitsu Onishi and Selam Gebrekida)

India's most influential guru joined thousands of believers four years ago as the temple's first stone was set in the ground.

It was a glorious day for its builders, the Gupta brothers, the sons of a local shopkeeper who had risen, almost magically, to become one of the richest families a world away in South Africa.

The three brothers had flown back on their private jet to start work on the temple, a 125-foot monument of pink sandstone and white marble.

But one morning last month, as the sun struggled to break through the smog in Saharanpur, their hometown in India's north, the giant yellow crane raising the temple stood still -- in limbo, like the brothers themselves.

The Guptas are now in self-imposed exile in Dubai, evading arrest in South Africa, where they stand at the centre of a scandal that has already brought down the nation's president and exposed staggering amounts of corruption in the once-legendary party of Nelson Mandela.

Even here in India, the family's legacy -- so large that it has been elevated to myth -- faces collapse. The new temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva in their father's honour, is now being investigated for the same kind of self-dealing and fraud the family is accused of mastering in South Africa.

The rise and fall of the Gupta brothers is so improbable that in Saharanpur their story is told like a parable.

They began by selling shoes in South Africa and swiftly became central figures in the nation's post-apartheid history, outsiders who broke into the very pinnacle of political power. Seemingly overnight, they joined the ranks of South Africa's most influential families, playing a leading role in one of the biggest dramas after the end of apartheid: Who is getting rich, and how?

Mandela's election as president in 1994 set off a scramble by leaders in his party, the African National Congress, to amass wealth. The early ones succeeded through ties with rich white South Africans. Many others turned to the brothers from Saharanpur.

The Guptas found eager partners at all levels of the ANC, from bureaucrats to a sitting president, Jacob Zuma, according to dozens of interviews by The New York Times, as well as government investigators, international auditors, emails from a Gupta company, financial records and court documents.

Seizing on a chance encounter with a South African official in India decades ago, the three brothers cultivated ties to the governing party so expertly that it became difficult to draw the line between their business empire and the president's office.

They made one of Zuma's sons a business partner, enabling them to buy a coal mine through government intervention and set up a media business that the president helped guide himself, according to officials, company emails and people involved in the ventures. The president responded in kind, handing them control over strategic Cabinet selections and the boards of state-owned enterprises.

Now desperate to distance themselves from the brothers, ANC leaders dismiss the family as a legacy of the tainted era of Zuma, who was ousted in February by his own party.

But the story of the Guptas -- who landed in the country a year before the end of apartheid in 1994 and left with Zuma's fall -- is also the story of South Africa under the ANC.

The main agent of corruption was the party itself. ANC leaders have siphoned off tens of billions of dollars meant to improve the lives of their most loyal supporters, poor black South Africans.

They have crippled strong government agencies, like the national tax service, to benefit their own bank accounts. Some of the nation's new leaders -- the ANC officials promising a new chapter for the country now that Zuma is out of office -- have pocketed money intended for basic services, like schools.

The Guptas helped undermine the nation's democratic institutions. And like generations of foreigners before them, they took their windfall out of Africa, moving it to Dubai and India through a maze of dubious, and at times illegal, transactions, officials say.

And they became so powerful that they clashed with the Oppenheimers -- the family that once owned the De Beers diamond company and the mining giant Anglo American -- whose influence in South Africa had been unrivalled for a century.

But as the Guptas brandished their power, they incited a backlash, not only from ordinary South Africans, but also from a far more powerful constituency: the white-led business establishment and its allies, both increasingly worried that the brothers were putting the country's economic health at risk.

The Guptas' intimate role in steering the nation helped set off an electoral revolt that has already cost the ANC control over South Africa's biggest cities and could jeopardize its hold on the presidency.

From his self-imposed exile in Dubai, Ajay Gupta, 53, the oldest brother, denies all wrongdoing. He points out that they face no criminal charges in South Africa, adding that their family empire is now bankrupt.

Humble Beginnings

The father of the Gupta brothers, Shiv Kumar Gupta, owned a tiny shop that sold government rations, or subsidized food, here in Saharanpur. But he nurtured grand ambitions.

One day, Gupta called over his oldest son, Ajay, to recount a newspaper article on the war between Iran and Iraq. The price of rice had skyrocketed there because he told his son, all the traders had left the countries.

""But somebody is going in,"" the father said, Ajay recalled. ""He's getting this advantage because there's no competition.""

So Ajay, who had already set up a computer import business in New Delhi, followed his father's advice and went looking for opportunities in Russia, China and Singapore.

The middle brother, Atul, went to South Africa in 1993, right before it became a democracy. He kept going back, despite his family's misgivings.

""He alone was the bullish one,"" Ajay recalled. ""He loved the place.""

Atul settled in Johannesburg and sold shoes downtown. Then he started a company importing computer parts and assembling them for sale. And by chance, he made a personal connection to the ANC that would prove far more consequential.

During a trip home to India, Atul met a South African of Indian origin in New Delhi: Essop Pahad, the right-hand man of Thabo Mbeki, who was then Mandela's deputy.

Planting New Roots

When Pahad met Ajay, he was immediately impressed. Ajay got the big picture in South Africa, and seemed to understand that there was a place in it for the Guptas. In fact, the opening was vast, and Ajay exploited it masterfully.

In the late 1990s, as Mbeki prepared to become president, the ANC government was worried about the enduring power of white South African businessmen and dependence on Western nations. Forging ties with countries like India and China could lessen their influence, Pahad said.

Black South Africans had gained political power. But the white business elite, led by officials at Anglo American, had protected its own interests in the new South Africa. Long before the end of apartheid, Harry Oppenheimer, the head of the mining company, had led efforts to create -- and co-opt, some historians say -- a black elite.

When Mandela was released from Robben Island in 1990, Anglo American executives visited him at his home in Soweto. Other businessmen followed, to Mandela's delight, according to an authorized biography describing how he stayed at the estates of white tycoons and accepted gifts from them.

Mandela was particularly close to Oppenheimer, who gave him money, said Michael Spicer, a former executive at the company.

Oppenheimer put together a team of economic advisers for Mandela. In meetings, ANC leaders joined the country's top white businessmen to set the nation's post-apartheid economic course, Spicer said.

Soon enough, Mandela, who had supported nationalizing the economy, endorsed pro-business policies. Some historians argue that the policies contributed to South Africa's income inequality, and to an economy still based on cheap black labor.

But after becoming president, Mbeki moved to dampen the power of white businesses. He created his own group, which met at his residence each month, Pahad said. It included Cabinet ministers, top businessmen, rising stars in the ANC and an unknown figure: Ajay Gupta.

Ajay said he enjoyed the meetings. Mbeki sometimes even dropped by for lunch. Only a few years after settling in South Africa, Ajay had forged links to the highest levels of the ANC, thanks to his friendship with Pahad.

In the early 2000s, the brothers got their first big break: They won a large government contract to set up computer laboratories in schools in the nation's richest province.

Then they went on a buying spree, acquiring a struggling information technology company that helped them become one of the biggest computer distributors in South Africa. They later bought a uranium mine, a steel manufacturer and other businesses.

Hedging Their Bets

Even as the Guptas thrived off their ties to Mbeki's allies, they were reaching out to his archrival, Zuma, the No. 2 in the party.

The two leaders fought bitterly. So Pahad, Mbeki's right-hand man, was surprised to learn that the Guptas had cultivated ties with the other side.

""They were having some function at their home, and Ajay said to me, 'Do you mind if we invite Zuma?'"" Pahad recalled.

Money was an unspoken dynamic in the battle between Mbeki and Zuma: Who in the ANC had gotten rich since the end of apartheid? And, perhaps more important, who had not?

Mandela and some others -- including South Africa's current president, Cyril Ramaphosa -- became wealthy, in part through connections to white business leaders.

The Guptas hired or became business partners with the sons of powerful ANC politicians, like Zuma's son Duduzane, and Tshepiso Magashule, the son of Ace Magashule, the party's current secretary-general.

It fell to the youngest of the Gupta brothers -- the friendly and easygoing Rajesh, nicknamed Tony -- to keep the sons happy. They went to nightclubs together and hung out in the family's compound in Johannesburg.

Tony also took the lead in pursuing business in Free State province, where corruption had flourished under Magashule, its leader at the time, ANC officials said.

In an interview, Mxolisi Dukwana, then Magashule's provincial minister of economic development, recalled how he and his boss went to visit Tony in Johannesburg. The president's son, Duduzane, was also there, he said.

Express Opinion Sabarimala: The past and present Out of My Mind: Bankrupt economicsBy Meghnad Desai

Tony asked Dukwana to endorse a large-scale development project in the province, promising him a monthly cut, Dukwana said.

Tony added that he and the other two men in the room had a similar arrangement in a mining project, Dukwana said. He recounted Tony's saying that he ""personally gave"" monthly payments of about $71,000 each to Magashule and to the president's son.

""Then he asked them, 'Have I ever failed you?' And they both said no,"" Dukwana said.

Ties at the Top

The Guptas also gained great influence over the president and his affairs. According to witnesses in the government inquiry into the Zuma years, the Guptas had a say in choosing ministers, or even offered positions to candidates directly.

Duduzane Zuma, the president's son, helped the Guptas expand beyond mining. They started a newspaper and a television news station, ANN7, that thrived on government advertising, which their political connections easily secured.

As in other projects, Duduzane Zuma was the Guptas' Black Economic Empowerment partner in the venture. But it was clear he was simply a proxy for the president, said Rajesh Sundaram, an Indian journalist who worked directly under Atul Gupta to start the channel.

In meetings that Sundaram attended with the Guptas and the president, Zuma was intimately engaged in the network's launch. Seeing how close the Guptas were with Zuma, Sundaram said he once asked Atul, ""What if Zuma goes?""

""'Well, we've got everyone in our pocket,'"" Atul replied, Sundaram recalled.

Ruinous Miscalculations

As the Gupta brothers prospered, they flaunted it. But two events -- both, as it turned out, related to planes -- contributed to their undoing.

In 2013, the brothers chartered a plane with about 200 guests from India to attend the extravagant wedding of a niece in Sun City, South Africa's Las Vegas. They invited relatives, friends, businessmen and politicians, mostly from India.

But the brothers miscalculated. Using their political connections, they landed the plane near Sun City -- at a military base. Its use by a private family set off a government inquiry, turning the Guptas into a favorite target of opposition politicians eager to expose corruption under Zuma.

Soon enough, the Guptas were embroiled in another drama, one that pitted them against the Oppenheimers, the family dynasty that had been South Africa's most powerful for a century.

The Oppenheimers had sold their shares in Anglo American and De Beers for billions. The heirs to the fortune -- Nicky Oppenheimer and his son Jonathan -- opened an ultraluxury private terminal in Johannesburg's main airport in 2014, with fine dining and a gallery with art for sale.

But the Oppenheimers couldn't get permission to handle international flights. Despite countless letters and calls to ANC officials, the Oppenheimers were getting nowhere. Eventually, they sued the government, accusing the Guptas of using their political influence to stall the business. The brothers, the Oppenheimers said, wanted in on the terminal.

According to court documents, the Guptas sent a message to the Oppenheimers that they had ""the wrong BEE partner"" -- referring to the Black Economic Empowerment program. If the Oppenheimers chose a partner endorsed by the Guptas, the documents said, their ""problems would go away.""

The last straw was another appointment: In late 2015, Zuma chose an unknown lawmaker -- considered close to the Guptas -- as finance minister. Alarmed, the business establishment and its ANC allies struck back, forcing Zuma to remove the minister after only four days.

Within weeks, a major South African bank cut ties with the Gupta family. The country's other big banks followed.

Last Flight Out

The Guptas were getting nervous. Their most powerful ally, Zuma, was scheduled to step down as the ANC's leader in late 2017. The brothers would soon find out whether they had eggs in more than one basket.

The race to succeed Zuma was tight. His former wife Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma appeared to have a slight edge over her rival, Ramaphosa, the favorite candidate of the business establishment.

The Gupta empire was getting squeezed. Locked out of banks, the brothers could not pay their employees or debts. Their only public company was delisted from the Johannesburg stock exchange. South African companies, big and small, refused to do business with them.

Cornered, they sold a mining company and their media empire in quick succession. Many of their remaining companies filed for bankruptcy protection and are now managed by outside supervisors.

Everything might have worked out for them had Zuma's ex-wife won. But one of her supporters, David Mabuza -- who had become a kingmaker by diverting government money to finance his political rise -- flipped his votes at the last minute, handing Ramaphosa a slim victory.

South Africans, predicting the end of the Guptas, began tracking the family's prized Bombardier Global 6000 jet as it travelled to Dubai, Russia, Switzerland and elsewhere.

On Feb. 4, the Guptas turned off the jet's GPS tracking device, according to Canada's export credit agency, which had lent the Guptas $41 million to buy the Bombardier. The agency sued to get the plane back, saying the Guptas might use it ""to escape justice.""

Ten days later -- on the day Zuma finally gave up and resigned as South Africa's president -- law enforcement officials raided the Gupta estate in Johannesburg.

In its 'Strategy for New India @75' document released on Wednesday, the Aayog has recommended revamp of the regulatory system of nursing education to ensure quality training in nursing schools and also stressed on developing centres of excellence in nursing and enhancing the stature of government nurses.

The Aayog said the quality of health professional training and adherence to standards is sub-optimal, including in the private sector.

To address the shortage of doctors in the country, the Aayog has suggested creating conditions to facilitate import of doctors, especially those of Indian origin working abroad, and also deploying teachers from universities abroad as visiting professors at AIIMS or NIEs while linking at least 40 per cent of district hospitals with medical colleges.

It also suggested developing framework for deployment of doctors and specialists from the private sector to government hospitals on a visiting or honorary basis and expanding the system of Diplomate of National Board (DNB) and Diplomas from College of Physicians and Surgeons (CPS).

""Workforce shortages and uneven distribution of doctors, nurses, specialists and allied health professionals plague the sector,"" the Aayog said while observing that urban areas have four times as many doctors and three times as many nurses as compared to rural areas.

Medical and nursing colleges are concentrated in a few states like Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Gujarat and Maharashtra.

Pointing to the severe shortages in the category of allied health professionals (AHPs) including medical lab technicians, optometrists and radiologists, the Aayog has sought establishment of a Council to ensure standardization of education and putting in place quality control mechanisms for educational institutions, teaching methods and workforce management.

It suggested putting in place an updated curriculum for medical and allied professions that keeps pace with the changing dynamics of public health, policy and demographics.

As far as specialists are concerned, the Aayog observed that a large number of posts are vacant all over the country. According to estimates, India needs close to five lakh additional specialists, the report highlighted.

There is also an acute shortage of medical faculty. Of the 1,830 faculty posts across six All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), approximately 583 (31 per cent) had been filled up until July 2017, the Aayog pointed out.

According to the report, as of March 2017, there were 10.23 lakh allopathic doctors registered with the MCI or state medical councils.

Assuming 80 per cent availability, the Aayog estimated that around 8.18 lakh doctors may actually be available for active service. This gives a doctor population ratio of 1:1613 against the WHO norm of 1:1000, it said.

Although from school and college records, he is now 72 years old. A striking persona with his carelessly wrapped turban and walrus moustache, he is an easy man to talk to, what with the treasure trove of anecdotes he can recount from key moments in India's post-Independence history.

He says he was just five or six years old when Master Maadu Ram, a local Arya Samaj leader, visited his father's simple home in Gorakhpur village. Maadu Ram, Swarup says, fascinated him with his fearless advocation of rationalism against blind faith and idol worship. ""I have never since stepped inside a temple, mosque, church or gurudwara,"" says the man who now devotes all his time to educating others, including young school and college students, employee unions, farmers' collectives and even local khap panchayats (caste councils) who care to hear his unorthodox views.

Starting out in student politics in the early 1970s, Swarup, then a postgraduate student of history, recalls how he was rusticated from Hisar's Jat College in 1973, when he preferred to support a statewide school teachers' strike instead of taking a prized opportunity to work as a stipendiary teacher. ""The government was offering the jobs to break the teachers' strike and I refused,"" he says. The early influences and the heady days of student politics made for that inevitable drift to the Left (he became a card holder of the CPI(M).

But it was after 2008, when he withdrew from politics (he says, ""I simply did not renew my card in 2012"") that Swarup, who is now respectfully referred to as 'Comrade Krishan Swarup Gorakhpuria', really came into his own.

Back in Gorakhpur, he spearheaded the establishment of the Comrade Prithvi Singh Yadgaar Committee (a tribute to a local Left leader), which now has bustling premises on one edge of the village. It is among several places where he engages with youth, both of the village and from settlements nearby. Discussions range from sports, afforestation, organic and zero-budget farming to advances in science and education. The centre also serves as a sports academy, which sent as many as seven boys to the volleyball nationals this year, and a coaching centre to prepare young boys and girls for competitive examinations.

And while he watches over the centre in Gorakhpur, Swarup spends the remainder of his time addressing employees' unions, farmers and students. ""This is to inform people of their rights and responsibilities,"" he says. For instance, he spent weeks during a recent roadways union agitation in Haryana, talking to workers unions, advising them on how best to press for their demands. And he regularly visits government and private schools to similarly engage with students, whom he sees as the workforce of the future. ""I engage in agitational and educational activity,"" he chuckles. He is also head of one of the most progressive Khap panchayats in Haryana, through which he continues to wage a virtual war against female foeticide and honour killings amid Haryana's intensely patriarchal rural society.

But the comrade isn't merely a preacher. Two of his four children are in inter-caste marriages; on his insistence, his matriculate daughter-in-law went on to graduate and to teaching in a local school; and the delight on his face while visiting his grand-daughters in Chandigarh is telling."

India has been prepared for a long time now for an ""eventual"" pullout of American troops from Afghanistan but surprised by the Trump administration's sudden decision, as the rest of the world, it wants to know more about the nature and the time-frame of the cut-back to assess implications for its involvement.

Indians are concerned about the security of four consulates -- Jalalabad (in the east), Herat (west), Mazar-e-Sharif (north) and Kandahar (in the south) -- and the embassy in Kabul, personnel manning them and the projects India is running there as part of the reconstruction effort, as a top partner.

There has been no communication from the United States to India yet about the impending pullout, and it's been noted in New Delhi. But,people in the know said, assuming the Trump administration had indeed taken a call -- ""there has been no tweet or announcement as about the Syrian pullout"" -- they want to see which troops are being pulled out, those involved in counter-terrorism or those advising Afghanistan combat troops, or both.

India also wants to know about the time-frame of the cut back and whether American troops, marked for pullout, leave before the upcoming Afghan elections or after. ""Leaving before could determine the nature of the elections -- whether they will be free and fair -- which, in turn, could determine their legitimacy and the outcome,"" said a person familiar with the deliberations.

These two factors are critical to assessing the repercussion for India -- ""whether the troop-cut would be hugely consequential or one that can be managed"".

Afghan presidential elections are due next April, and Indian officials dealing with South Asia fear most a US drawdown in the first quarter of 2019, which they have considered more as a possibility.

US President Trump has been keen to pullout of Afghanistan, as was his predecessor Barack Obama, but has sought to base it on conditions and an arbitrarily drawn timeline as preferred by his predecessor. But the move to cut the troops presence has not been explained that whether it's linked to improvement in condition or tied to peace talks.

Even allies such as Germany and the United Kingdom who have large troops presence in Afghanistan were not consulted.

The presence of American and NATO forces has been critical for the security situation, and Afghanistan and New Delhi would be following developments arising out of the Trump administration's decision closely. ""Not only do we have four consulates and an embassy there in Afghanistan, but also a large number of ongoing development projects,"" said a person familiar with India's thinking on the matter.

India has invested heavily in the reconstruction of Afghanistan and from much before, the Trump administration sought to accord India a larger role there.

India helped the central bank of Afghanistan find its feet, starting just days after the Taliban were chased out of the country in late 2001 -- with the help of government bankers from Indian staying four to a room in a Kabul property -- - rebuild schools (former president Hamid Karzai's school, to begin with), get the transportation system running -- with the help of the Tata company -- and resurrect Kabul's main hospital, quietly and without fanfare.

But it has not been easy, or safe. There have been multiple attacks on Indian missions in Afghanistan, the embassy and consulates. And just this past May, six engineers of a private Indian company were abducted by the Taliban in Baghlan province of Afghanistan."

The programme kick started on December 7 after the department realised that it has been under performing in SSLC examinations every year despite having the potential to top the state. On December 17, all schools across the district organised a special meeting which was attended by parents, SDMC members and teachers.

""Our sole aim of this 100-day programme is to try our best to ensure all students pass the SSLC exam. Teachers have been given thorough training by resource persons on how to teach poorly performing students,"" explained a block education officer from Puttur. Those students are also given counselling on how to improve in examinations and face them without fear.

Another BEO said that some school teachers have adopted children who are poor in studies and give them extra classes in the morning as well as after class.

Some BEOs said all schools have adopted a method called 'passing package'. A BEO said that expert teachers are aware that which questions are likely to come in examinations and they are focused.

""An average or below average performer cannot grasp the entire syllabus. In order to help them, expert teachers have prepared a separate question bank and the children are taught to grasp concepts.""

Aam Aadmi Party convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday accused the BJP, the Congress and the Indian National Lok Dal of ignoring the all-important education and heath sectors during their regimes in Haryana.

Addressing a ""School and Hospital Rally"" in Sirsa, Mr. Kejriwal also hit out at the ruling BJP government, accusing it of destroying the feeling of 'brotherhood' in the State by resorting to caste-based politics.

""The ruling BJP in Haryana has focused on creating a divide between Jats and non-Jats and promoting politics based on casteism,"" alleged Mr. Kejriwal.

He appealed to the people to shun the established political players in Haryana and vote for the AAP, which would provide them with basic amenities to improve quality of life.

""When we took over in Delhi, there was a similar situation. We conducted an audit of private schools and made them return the amount they overcharged to parents,"" said Mr. Kejriwal.

In June, Deepak Malghan, an associate professor with the Centre for Public Policy at the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, made an unusual appeal to the institute's placement committee and environment club. The email - part request, part withering criticism - asked them to ""disinvite"" Hindustan Unilever from the job placements for management students in October.

In 2001, a thermometer factory owned by the corporation in Kodaikanal had dumped toxic mercury in the local environment of the popular Tamil Nadu tourist spot. The factory was subsequently shut. Earlier this year, activists alleged that the company's trial remediation of soil contaminated by mercury at the site in November 2017 had failed, possibly mobilising more mercury into the environment that it had recovered because it deployed a substandard process. They say that the company has refused to apply the standards follows in the United States. Hindustan Unilever has denied these claims.

The email was part of Malghan's larger mission to remind the Indian Institutes of Management, which are among the country's top business schools, of their responsibilities as public institutions even though they sit close to private business interests and influence. These institutes became degree-granting institutions with the passage of the Indian Institutes of Management Act in 2017.

""Disinviting them...will send out a powerful message that management institutions can actually walk the talk about corporate responsibility,"" Malghan wrote in his email. ""Disinviting Unilever from placements requires us to act like we are a real place of higher learning - with real students and professors in a classroom rather than customers and service providers. It requires us to act like a real university would - not like a glorified placement agency masquerading as a place of higher learning.""

Malghan's email elicited a ""censure order"" from the director of the institute on October 17 asking him to retract it. The note said Malghan must ""develop greater sensitivity"" towards colleagues and ""institutional stakeholders both internal and external"". Malghan retracted his letter on November 28 but ""under protest"" and after appealing to the board of governors. ""Thinking through the complex intersections between corporations, society, state, market, and the biophysical environment is an important learning objective for budding managers,"" he wrote. The retraction was shared with over 1,000 students. A week later, both the retraction and the original email became public.

This was not Malghan's first attempt to remind an Indian Institute of Management that it is a public institution. In 2017, he and doctoral student Siddharth Joshi co-authored a paper and a number of articles on the negligible social diversity among faculty members in the Indian Institutes of Management, arguing for affirmative action in the doctoral programmes that serve as a ""talent pool"" for faculty recruitment.

In the paper, Malghan had also criticised the culture of the Indian Institutes of Management to pay faculty members extra for a range of activities - such as conducting admission interviews - that in any other public university are standard academic functions teachers are expected to perform. The Indian Institutes of Management call such payments ""incentives"", but Malghan calls them ""bribes"". He has been unsuccessfully filing queries under the Right to Information Act, 2005, to obtain compensation structures of faculty of the Indian Institutes of Management.

In 2015, Malghan became the first ecological economist - studying the ""intersections between the human economy and the biophysical system that contains and sustains it"" - to win the VKRV Rao Prize, a top award for social scientists under 45. He has taught at the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, his first faculty position, for nine years. He spoke to Scroll.in about the role of these institutes as public institutions, the response to his criticisms and what the institutes must do to arrest their decline into the role of a ""customer service provider"".

""Business schools are the first departments on any university campus worldwide that are captured by vested interests including crony capitalists,"" Malghan said.

Edited excerpts follow:

Is there space for this form of activism in the IIMs? All professional education institutions seem to discourage it.

The short answer is that the limited space that exists is rapidly shrinking. My specific censure order is only symptomatic of much deeper structural problems. A more important question is should there be space for this form of activism, rather than is there space. The answer to this normative question is self-evident. What is a university that does not allow a free and open exchange of ideas? IIMs pride themselves as being crucibles for thought leaders - one of those vacuous terms that has its antecedents in the public relations industry. I think it is not the university's job to train shills for the elite. A university's mission ought to be to foster thoughtful individuals including voices of dissent.

Had you written about IIM policies before the paper you co-authored on faculty diversity? What prompted you to look at the IIMs?

My collaborative work with Siddharth [Joshi] is indeed the first time I have written publicly about IIM policies. The initial impetus for our work came from the fact that anecdotally everybody in the IIM system knew that IIMs have long been guilty of an unconscionable neglect of questions of diversity and inclusion in our doctoral programmes. The dubious methods used by IIMs to skirt constitutional and statutory mandates surrounding affirmative action were well-known internally. Like a lot of other contemporary Indian institutions, IIMs are an almost exclusively upper caste, and also mostly an urban upper class preserve. Based on imperfect data, we conservatively estimate that about 95% of all IIM faculty members are drawn from upper caste Hindu groups. Out of over 640 faculty members across 13 older IIMs, there are four faculty members from the SC [Scheduled Castes] groups and only one from ST [Scheduled Tribes] groups. The social composition of faculty at IIMs might as well have been produced by an apartheid regime.

Much of the credit for beginning this difficult conversation must go to Siddharth. Besides being a first-rate scholar, he is also a committed rights activist. I am a faculty member with tenure and really had little to lose materially. Siddharth was a graduate student yet to defend his dissertation when he first started work on the IIM social diversity project. Siddharth bravely withstood a variety of attacks and derision.

What was the response to the paper?

Initial reactions were predictable - when you are accustomed to privilege, any conversation on equity feels like oppression. As a sympathetic colleague pointed out, there was deflection. There was obfuscation. There was trivialisation. There were concerted attacks from colleagues ganging up. Finally, there was some personal vilification, too. Siddharth and I were largely able to tune out the negativity because there were a bunch of incredible colleagues and students across different IIMs who supported us in more ways that I can recount here.

Some among the IIM alumni have supported the sort of reform you have written about. Are there other faculty members who share your views?

I have to set the record right here. IIM alumni have not issued statements in support of the reforms that Siddharth and I have written about. If anything, we have reacted to enlightened alumni articulating the critical need for faculty social diversity at IIMs. If you have seen some limited reforms at most IIMs (except IIM Ahmedabad), the entirety of the credit must go to the global alumni network that has tried to remind us about Ambedkar's vision for the republic. The alumni have been at the vanguard of marginal changes (but revolutionary by IIM standards) that you have seen sweep the IIM system in the last couple of years

Siddharth and I have received some very important support from faculty members across IIMs. From over a dozen faculty colleagues that have openly supported us, I must single out Professor Mira Bakhru, a former faculty member at IIM Bangalore. Professor Bakhru was the first faculty member to write about social diversity deficit at IIMs. Many faculty colleagues around the country, across different IIMs have worked hard in the last two years to think through operationalising meaningful affirmative action in the doctoral programmes at IIMs.

What effect does this lack of diversity have on teaching, research and students?

The most important diversity that must be treasured by a university is intellectual diversity. I do not wish to suggest that intellectual diversity is somehow correlated with social diversity (ethnicity, gender, etc). However, there is strong evidence that a diverse faculty and student body with varied life experiences are crucial to the educational mission of a modern university. Actually, the IIM leadership recognises how diversity contributes to better outcomes for students and faculty alike. It is only that not all diversity axes are created equal. For example, IIMs have made tremendous progress on the gender diversity front at all levels - MBA students, doctoral students, and most significantly faculty body. However, there has been more reluctance to extend the gains from increased gender diversity to say social group diversity. Caste is the most significant axis of social heterogeneity in India, not to mention the most pernicious axis of stratification. Unfortunately, much of the reluctance to address deep-seated caste inequities can be attributed to a wholly misguided and indefensible notion of meritocracy that smacks of entrenched privilege.

In the two-year MBA programmes, however, IIMs do admit a very socially diverse class. But students from historically underrepresented sections of India do not find role models in their classroom. I can bet that a class on infrastructure management is going to look very different if the faculty body had adequate representation of Adivasi and Dalit groups who have borne the brunt of a rapacious infrastructure industry. Instead we now have classes on infrastructure that are taught by faculty members who serve on boards of crony capitalist firms. For example, at IIM-B [Bangalore] the infrastructure management class is taught by somebody who is on the board of an Adani company.

Finally, IIMs are elite public institutions with considerable normative influence on the national discourse. It is unconscionable that elite institutions are as skewed as IIMs are in terms of their social representation. This problem is not unique to IIMs or even to public universities in general. For example, my own guess is that the social composition of elite media houses is as skewed as IIMs. Some of the duplicity surrounding affirmative action policies including reservations at IIMs stem from misconstruing affirmative action as a welfare or poverty alleviation measure. Affirmative action at elite institutions is anything but. It is about representation at the elite decision-making tables.

You point out that IIMs have demanded autonomy but not exercised it for ""critical engagement with business practices"". In which direction do you see the institutions going under the new IIM Act passed last year? The new law has granted even greater autonomy to the institutions.

Yes, egged on by a consumptive urban upper class, the IIMs have used the unprecedented autonomy granted to these institutions (even before the new Act) for largely self-aggrandisement. IIMs do not see themselves as enlightened public universities. Autonomy for IIMs has largely meant abdicating their social contract as a public university. The social diversity deficit at IIMs is only one of the most egregious symptoms of these institutions abandoning their public mission. I believe the new Act will only exacerbate this trend even though it also provides a framework to recover the public mission. The litmus test for any university is this: does it use the autonomy to promote an environment where the life of the mind is nurtured and treasured? Available evidence suggests that IIMs fall short of this ideal by quite a bit.

You have mentioned the ""powerful faculty bodies and board led by corporate honchos"" that run the IIMs. How have they - and IIM-Bangalore in particular - responded to your criticism?

Individual colleagues and many students have supported or at least defended the exercise in self-criticism. The leadership has been much more, shall I say, sceptical if not hostile. Of course, several colleagues have also been very critical and a colleague has even described me as being obnoxious and a hypocrite. In general, the intellectual culture at IIMs (and I can speak most authoritatively only about IIM-B) is not open to critical inquiry. The problem is structural. Business school academia is focused not on understanding the world but on manipulating it. IIMs really are not an exception. Business schools are the first departments on any university campus worldwide that are captured by vested interests including crony capitalists. Quite often it is the case of not being able to criticise the very hand that feeds you. When students are reduced to fee paying customers, the professoriate has to debase itself into a customer service provider guild. The only exception to this otherwise bleak picture that I have painted is the doctoral programme that has been my refuge.

Why did you describe faculty members receiving incentives for research as ""bribes""? How did your colleagues react to this?

Many of my faculty colleagues have been upset with Siddharth and I going to town with IIMs' worst kept secret - the fact that faculty members at these institutions need special incentives to write academic papers, and ""upset"" is putting it very mildly.

There are three fundamental problems. First, we have made a fundamental category error - incentives and integrity are two very different objects. The idea that you can fix what is fundamentally an integrity problem with incentives betrays a certain kind of studied illiteracy. How can a professoriate that is so confused about incentives and integrity lecture in an MBA classroom about business ethics? If faculty have to be paid to do admission interviews, we really cannot complain about MBAs that are paid those vulgar bonuses to run the casino economy.

The immediate corollary of this category error is that faculty demand to be bribed to do anything at all - from reading and writing to admission interviews and supervising master's thesis project. An improved incentive structure will do nothing to fix this fundamental flaw with our system. Unless we recognise that we cannot bribe our way into making up for our original sin - jettisoning our innate integrity - we are doomed. Yes, we need a set of shared norms but not metrics that reduce the deans at IIMs wholly into a bean counter.

Second, IIMs are a public university - at least in theory. We have (if only an implicit) social contract with the Indian republic. Our current compensation arrangements are in breach of this compact. Every major public university (including business schools at public universities) has an open and transparent faculty compensation structure. Unless we are willing to publicly defend who and what we pay ourselves, the present regime is simply illegitimate. In the past few months I have filed several RTI [Right to Information] requests at various IIMs asking them to reveal their faculty compensation structure (the generic structure) but all of them have come up with the flimsiest of reasons to deny this information.

Third, we are a faculty body that has lost any sense of proportion. At a public university, compensation structure ought to be benchmarked against the means of the larger society. We are being non-transparent about our compensation structure because we are paying ourselves incentives that are patently indefensible. We may come up with any number of excuses to pay ourselves. My favourite is the one offered by several colleagues - we need to pay ourselves because we now aspire to send our children abroad (read Western university) for undergraduate education. We are perfectly within our rights to harbour such aspirations but it is not any Indian public university's remit to pander to these aspirations.

It takes a certain kind of entitlement to believe that being on 98.4 percentile of the income distribution in our country (this is at the beginning assistant professor level) as a public university teacher means living a life of abject poverty.

How has your own experience at IIM-Bangalore been?

On the balance, my time at IIM-B has been most fulfilling. I must especially single out the superb doctoral programme at IIM-B that has provided me an opportunity collaborate with, and learn from young scholars in disciplines ranging from social anthropology to hydrology. The dozen or so doctoral projects that I have been involved with have been the most important source of intellectual sustenance at IIM-B. Doctoral programmes at IIMs operate outside the din and media glare associated with the bread-and-butter MBA programme. While much of the IIM system is focused on celebrating corporate titans of the world, I have been happy to inhabit a much less glamorous space that has produced many outstanding scholars."

The department of public instruction has chalked out a 100-day rapid programme to help kids poor in studies.

The programme kickstarted on December 7 after the department realised that it has been underperforming in SSLC examinations every year despite having the potential to top the state. On December 17, all schools across the district organised a special meeting which was attended by parents, SDMC members and teachers.

""Our sole aim of this 100-day programme is to try our best to ensure all students pass the SSLC exam. Teachers have been given thorough training by resource persons on how to teach poorly performing students,"" explained a block education officer from Puttur. Those students are also given counselling on how to improve in examinations and face them without fear.

Another BEO said that some school teachers have adopted children who are poor in studies and give them extra classes in the morning as well as after class.

Passing package

Some BEOs said all schools have adopted a method called 'passing package'. A BEO said that expert teachers are aware that which questions are likely to come in examinations and they are focused.

""An average or below average performer cannot grasp the entire syllabus. In order to help them, expert teachers have prepared a separate question bank and the children are taught to grasp concepts.""

For children in DK, mathematics, science and English are hard nuts to crack.

31,370 students for SSLC

As many as 31,370 students from Dakshina Kannada will appear for the SSLC examination in March. Of these, 27,969 are regular students and rest include private candidates and repeaters. Last academic year, 28,686 students appeared for the examination and 24,556 passed.

This year, of seven education blocks, Moodbidri secured 91.05% results and was ranked tenth in state. Bantwal fell last in DK with a result of 86.74% and was ranked 100 in state.

A look at the organisations working to ensure zero food wastage in India","The Financial Express",FALSE,"In a country where around 196 million people remain undernourished, the issue of food wastage is a grave one. But there is hope in the form of a few startups and organisations that are working towards ensuring a 'no-food-waste' future for the country.

According to the United Nations Development Programme, up to 40% of the food produced in India is wasted every year. Reportedly, the quantum of food that Indians waste in any given year is equivalent to the amount of food the UK consumes. These figures are all the more shocking for a nation where millions go hungry every day and many more are undernourished. Food wastage occurs at two stages -- primary and secondary. The primary stage includes wastage of grains and uncooked food, while the secondary stage encompasses throwing away cooked food prepared at mass gatherings, restaurants, households, weddings, etc. Last year, the government's Comptroller and Auditor General found that 4.7 lakh tonnes of wheat -- valued at '700 crore and meant to be distributed among the poor via the public distribution system -- was wasted in Punjab in 2015-16 due to lack of storage facilities. ""Our biggest problem is that we don't know how to manage the glut. I was looking at how the US deals with its surplus. In the past, the US government has bought surplus tomatoes and strawberries from farmers and distributed them in schools. Has that ever happened in our country? Why can't we move our surplus onion/potato production to schools? There has to be a mechanism to facilitate that kind of transfer which is missing,"" says Chandigarh-based agricultural expert Devinder Sharma.

This symbolises a deep problem in a country, where at least 195.9 million people remain undernourished, as per the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation's report titled State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2018. For a developing nation that ranked 100 out of 119 countries on the 2017 Global Hunger Index, the problem of food wastage is one that requires urgent attention. According to a report this year by Boston Consulting Group, by 2030, the annual food loss and waste in the world would hit 2.1 billion tonnes, a staggering increase from the current 1.6 billion tonnes. That wastage would be worth $1.5 trillion against the backdrop of rising inflation, the report adds. ""Food loss and waste are projected to increase in most regions around the world, with a significant spike in Asia in particular,"" the report adds. While the above figures paint a rather grim picture of the world, and specifically India, there is hope in the form of a few startups and organisations that are working towards ensuring a 'no-food-waste' future for the country.

Tech to the rescue

Since the past couple of years, scientists have been working on ways to prevent food wastage. A key, and often ignored, facet contributing to the issue of food wastage is lack of optimum packaging material. Researchers from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, US, have, however, taken a step towards solving that problem by developing 'super slippery' packaging -- it basically enables consumers to squeeze out every last drop of a food product from the package, reducing food wastage, according to a study published this year. ""Small amounts of sticky foods like condiments, dairy products, beverages and some meat products that remain trapped in their packaging can add up to big numbers over time even for a single household,"" the study notes. The hydrocarbon-based polymers used in the packaging are not only very slippery, but also self-cleaning, the study adds.

In addition to scientists, entrepreneurs, too, have invaded the space, developing applications and websites to help restaurants manage their surplus food by making it readily available to those in need. One such initiative has been undertaken by Pune-based Sanjeev Neve, who, in 2016, launched Food Dosti app, a comprehensive zero-food-wastage platform that brings together eateries, customers and non-profits. The app provides partner restaurants a platform to 'publish' information on the surplus food they have. NGOs and non-profit organisations that have signed up get notifications and can then collect the surplus food, depending on their need. The Food Dosti network has partnered with most restaurants in Pune, its base city, and has now also expanded operations to Mumbai, Neve says. Besides, Food Dosti also rewards customers who visit partner restaurants by giving cashback whenever they finish everything that they order. I t also gives customers the option to order partial portions of food to reduce wastage and lets them order the remaining portion free of cost on their next visit to any partner restaurant.

""We are told all our life that we shouldn't waste food, but there is no incentive given for it. So we thought that if we incentivise people for not wasting food, that may attract more active action or cooperation from them,"" says Neve. In the next eight-10 years, he plans to partner with 200 restaurants in each city across the country. According to Neve, the issue of food wastage originates from 'lack of respect' and 'problem of plenty.' ""Food is not respected that much as it is available easily to people with means... if we go a little deeper, it's a problem of plenty,"" says Neve, adding that the government should guide farmers on what proportion of which crop to grow, so that we only have required proportions of everything and massive quantities are not lost in transit.

Community effort

Individuals and communities across the country, too, are working towards bringing about change. Minu Pauline, the owner of Kochi-based Pappadavada restaurant, set up a community fridge in 2016, the first in the country, outside the restaurant premises to provide people a medium to donate. Taking cue, Gurugram-based Rahul Khera, too, installed a refrigerator outside his society last year in Sector 54 with the help of other residents. ""After our initiative, nearly five such societies in Delhi-NCR also installed a refrigerator outside their societies,"" says Khera, an IT professional.

Many first-generation entrepreneurs are also setting up volunteer-led organisations to transport excess food to places and people in dearth. Delhi-based non-profit Feeding India is one such organisation that began operations in April 2014 to work towards the ""cause of hunger and food wastage"". The organisation has partnered with around 3,800 shelter homes across the country where it provides food as an incentive to assist people to get out of the poverty cycle. ""We give food to people in shelter homes as an incentive to come to school or a skill development centre... the aim is to not make them dependent on us giving them food... that way, they won't work... the food is given so that these people get out of the poverty cycle eventually,"" says Srishti Jain, co-founder, Feeding India.

Robin Hood Army, a volunteer-based organisation, is another frontrunner in this domain, helping surplus food reach the needy with the help of volunteers whom it calls 'robins'. While Feeding India is present in 65 cities across the country, Robin Hood Army has its presence in over 80 cities globally. Conceived and conceptualised in 2014 by Neel Ghose, Robin Hood Army has tie-ups with restaurants in cities it is operational in. Ghose was inspired by Portugal's Re-Food Program that has volunteers collecting surplus food from restaurants and distributing it among the needy. Similarly, the 'robins' collect food from the food partners and serve it at shelter homes, bastis, to people living under flyovers, outside hospitals, etc. ""Our mission is simple: eradicate food wastage and world hunger,"" says Aarushi Batra, co-founder, Robin Hood Army.

Another interesting initiative has been taken up by the dabbawallas of Mumbai who are famous the world over for delivering tiffins to around two lakh people daily for the past 125 years. In December 2015, the dabbawallas took up the cause of feeding the needy. Under their 'Roti Bank' initiative, the dabbawallas collect surplus and leftover food from weddings, etc, and give it to the hungry and homeless in Mumbai, feeding roughly 150-200 people everyday.

Not just community organisations, hospitality leaders are also working for the cause. From installing water recycling plants to waste converters, they are doing their bit too. In June 2016, ITC Maurya in Delhi set up an on-site waste recycling plant -- Bio-Urja -- which uses leftover food and minimal water to operate. ""Leftover food from the banquet is used in the plant, which is installed on the hotel premises. The gas from it is used in the employee cafeteria as cooking fuel. Soon, it will be a chain-wide initiative,"" says Manisha Bhasin, senior executive chef, ITC Maurya, Delhi.

Changing mindsets

One of the biggest hurdles, however, that organisations like Feeding India and Robin Hood Army admit to facing while setting up base is to convince restaurants and people to come onboard. ""In India, there is this stigma associated with jhootha khaana (leftover food)... no one wants to donate that,"" says Jain of Feeding India. That, and the problem of lack of awareness, were the biggest hurdles, she says. ""Initially, we faced a lot of problems in convincing people to donate food. There were many big corporates that had excess food and yet were reluctant to donate... now, people have become more aware,"" Jain adds. Batra of Robin Hood Army agrees: ""They (restaurants) weren't sure where the food was going and it took a little bit of convincing and showing them pictures and selfies we took during our drives,"" she adds.

Another challenge they continue to face is the perishable nature of food, especially cooked food that has a higher tendency to turn bad, and hence must be distributed and consumed in a certain time frame. Neve of Food Dosti app has, however, devised a way out. ""We have a contractual obligation with NGOs that whenever they collect food, they must upcycle it within two hours. We also have contracts with restaurants that whatever food they give must stay good for at least six hours,"" he says. ""That gives us enough time to ensure that whatever food is donated is always in a good condition. Also, the non-profit organisations collect food if and only if they have someone to feed right then,"" he adds.

Feeding India, on the other hand, works with the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India to ensure that the food received is fit to be distributed. Even with all the challenges, however, these organisations are going full steam ahead. And they don't just distribute food, they also work towards educating and empowering those at risk. Feeding India, for one, runs a 'Poshan to Paathshala' initiative under which it provides nutritious meals to children during school hours across India, thereby incentivising their attendance at school. They also run awareness workshops, mentoring sessions and computer classes across India for the holistic development of children.

Robin Hood Army, too, started Robin Hood Academy, which provides basic primary education to children it serves food to, in 2016. ""We piloted it in one city and expanded our scope to not just educating, but also facilitating admission for these kids in government schools. The idea went down extremely well with other RHA (Robin Hood Army) cities and now we have academies in over 23 cities with 500-plus kids having been admitted into schools,"" says Batra. They also help the poor get Aadhaar cards and also organise health camps, providing the poor health checkups.

Problem at procurement level

While all these organisations and initiatives are tirelessly trying to curb the food wastage menace in India, one glaring issue that remains largely unchecked is the post-harvest loss of grains. Year-after-year, a large amount of post-harvest produce gets 'ruined' prior to distribution due to lack of proper infrastructure. The Food Corporation of India, the central agency assigned the task of procuring foodgrains from farmers at minimum support price for distribution under the PDS system, has, in fact, faced massive criticism for wastage, misappropriation and fraudulent payments over the years.

From 2012 to 2014, the annual value of harvest and post-harvest losses of India's major agricultural produce was estimated at '92,651 crore (at average annual prices of 2014), according to a 2015 study by the Central Institute of Post-Harvest Engineering and Technology (CIPHET), Ludhiana. Nearly 27% of the cereals -- including paddy, wheat, maize, bajra and sorghum -- were wasted following production (the value of loss stood at '20,698 crore). In the case of pulses, 29% of pigeon pea, chickpea, black gram and green gram (valued at '3,877 crore) were lost at the post-harvest stage. The estimated loss of oilseeds stood at nearly 33% of the total produce. Losses in fruits ranged from 6.7% in post-harvest produce of papaya to nearly 15.88% in guava produce. ""Considerable losses during storage in market channels showed the need for multi-crop storages. Cold chain is essential to reduce the losses of fruits,"" the CIPHET study noted. The study also reported that 7% of poultry meat (valued at '3,942 crore) was lost -- of this, about 60% was lost during storage.

""After the grains reach the mandi is when the real problem begins. Both the private and government sectors are responsible for the losses that occur at that stage,"" says agricultural expert Sharma. ""We have the Agricultural Produce Market Committee and its task is to provide a platform for farmers to sell their produce. If a farmer goes there and finds lack of storage facilities and the grains rotting already, who do we blame? There should be a proper policy in place, delegating duties to the government and private sectors, which has not happened in our country.""

In an August 2016 release, the ministry of food processing industries said it had implemented the schemes of mega food parks, integrated cold chain, value addition and preservation infrastructure and setting up/modernisation of abattoirs to curb losses in the supply chain. ""The mega food parks scheme aims to provide modern infrastructure for food processing units in the country on a pre-identified cluster basis,"" the release noted. ""Under the scheme, grant-in-aid is provided at the rate of 50% of the eligible project cost in general areas and 75% thereof in difficult areas and hilly areas, subject to a maximum of '50 crore per project,"" it added.

As of the other schemes, the aim of modernisation of abattoirs was to provide hygienic finished meat and its products to consumers. ""So far, 41 abattoir projects have been sanctioned,"" the release said. The objective of the cold chain, value addition and preservation infrastructure scheme is to arrest post-harvest losses of horticulture and non-horticulture produce and provide remunerative prices to farmers for their produce. ""The scheme is primarily private-sector-driven and proposals under this scheme are invited through expression of interest,"" the release said.

Union food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, in a recent interview, acknowledged the gravity of the issue of wastage of food grains in the country and called for international collaborations to help tackle it. In India, food gets wasted even before it reaches the plate, she said, as opposed to the West, where wastage occurs at the consumption stage. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, too, signed memorandums of understanding with Denmark (known for its sustainable food practices and reduced food wastage) in the fields of animal husbandry, food safety and agricultural research, with the aim of taking cues from that country and working on its flaws. Time will tell whether these efforts will bear fruit, but for now, a lot needs to be done on this front."

Teams conducting the school evaluation survey under the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) are experiencing more resistance, with some private schools not allowing them to carry out the exercise saying they were unaware of it.

The Indian Express had earlier reported that North and South civic body schools had pulled out of the survey, claiming that it was being carried out with a ""political motive"", with an intent ""to show corporation schools in a bad light.""

According to the Commission, at least seven private schools did not let the teams on their campuses to proceed with the survey. All these schools have been issued notices, asking them to appear before the Commission with written responses, and stating that ""the schools are wilfully disrupting"" the Commission's work and doing so ""is a prima facie violation of the Right to Education Act"", officials said.

Suresh Kumar, manager of Vikram Public School in Sangam Vihar which was visited by a DCPCR team on Friday, said that he received a call only a day before, with the Commission saying that ""some people would visit the school"". He added that the school was not informed of the ""nature of their visit"".

""When the team arrived, we did not know what this survey was about. We just requested them to give us a day because many teachers were not present and we wanted to have a discussion on the same. Later, they explained the nature of the survey to us, saying that it was for the safety of the children, following which we told them they can carry it out,"" he claimed.

The principal of International Happy School in Chirag Delhi said that they did not receive any notice about the team's visit. ""I was not in the school at the time of their visit, and therefore would not have been able to give them the documents required,"" she said.

However, DCPCR member Anurag Kundu said that the Commission had informed schools of the visits in multiple ways.

""All schools had been informed about the evaluation through multiple circulars dispatched in November. That they did not read them is not on us... We have oriented nearly 190 private school principals on the exercise, surely the others would have picked up on the buzz. We have collected the complete database of all schools from all agencies and sent emails to all those who have registered their contact details. Even where all else has failed, we inform the respective inspectors of the schools a day before we would be visiting in their jurisdiction,"" he said.

He added that following complaints from schools, formal letters were dispatched to 416 schools Friday. He said the Commission has begun publishing the schedule of their visits on their Facebook page, and will soon publish their weekly schedule for the next four months on their website."

AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal Saturday lashed out at the Congress, BJP and INLD, accusing them of never paying attention towards improving schools and hospitals, adding it was only his party which improved the national capital's education and health sectors in the past three years.

Addressing a 'School and Hospital' rally in this district of Haryana, he promised to order an audit of all private schools in the state and return the ""excess school fees"" to parents if the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) came to power after the assembly elections next year.

""After 70 years of Independence, there is only one party which openly talks about schools and hospitals. Today, no party in the country has the courage to talk about hospitals and schools. We have improved the condition of government schools and hospitals in Delhi,"" he said.

Sirsa is considered a stronghold of opposition INLD.

""I want to ask you do you need hospitals and schools or violence between Jats and non-Jats?"" he said, adding the public did not want casteism or violence between Hindus and Muslims.

The Delhi chief minister accused the Congress, BJP and INLD of ""looting"" the country for 70 years.

""These parties looted the country for 70 years. If Kejriwal can change the shape of schools and hospitals in Delhi, why did not these parties do so in 70 years?"" he said.

""I appeal to the youth to support us and save the country. If these parties continue to rule for some more years, the country will not survive,"" he said.

Kejriwal also hit out at the Khattar government for not allowing him to visit a government dispensary in Karnal last month.

""I had gone to Asandh to see a dispensary. But the Khattar government stopped me midway. Am I a terrorist? I am the chief minister of Delhi. I was going to visit the dispensary and I had come to my Haryana, I was born in Haryana. Haryana is mine and it is not anybody's personal property,"" he said.

Praising his government in Delhi for changing the face of government schools, the AAP leader said even rich parents had now started admitting their wards in these schools.

""We have also been able to return the excess fee charged by private schools in the last 10 years. Have you ever heard of private schools returning fees? You change the government in Haryana and bring AAP to power.

""We will also not allow school fees to be raised in next five years. We had done it in Delhi and we will do so in Haryana as well,"" he said.

Kejriwal added that his government in Delhi had also decided that in case of power outage, consumers would be provided compensation.

It was in 2010 that Delhi's Shri Ram School Maths and Computer Science teacher Sujata Sahu first went on a trip to Ladakh. It was a solo trek, and on the third day, she began to face extreme difficulty breathing and walking. The low oxygen in the altitudes as high as 16,100 feet had given her Pulmonary Edema.

She needed to rest, and with the help of two passing trekkers, she decided to spend the night at a remote village --

""A village which has no road access, is reachable only after a day's walk, and one which boasted of just one home with three occupants. I had neither medicines, nor the ability to call my family, nor access to medical care,"" says 50-year-old Sahu, a resident of Gurugram.

In was in these conditions that she saw two tiny schools which totally changed her life.

The first primary school -- Sku-Kaya -- had five students and two teachers. It had two rooms which were being rebuilt. While one teacher had stayed in the village, the other had gone to Leh to get uniforms and mid-day meal supplies for the school.

The second school had eight children and three teachers. It was two of them who had stopped to help Sahu when she was feeling sick. They had been walking back to Leh for textbooks and uniforms

The children were being taught from English books, which was very alien to them as they had no electricity or TV or telephone connectivity and thus, had no idea what the outside world was like. Having never set foot out of their villages, the exposure level of these children was very low.

.In Ladakh, even the summer months were bitingly cold but that didn't stop the kids from coming to school to learn. ""One of the children even brought his little brother along, who was barely two years old and the love and care with which all the children and the teacher took care of the child was a lesson for me,"" says Sahu.

What really hit her on that fateful Ladakh trip was the sheer drive of the Ladakhi people there to keep growing and improving their circumstances.

""Their determination to come to school and learn, the eagerness of the teacher to learn something new to teach his students, and the aspiration of the parents to educate their children was my inspiration to drop everything and help these amazing people,"" says Sahu.

From a regular school teacher to Ladakh's 'Iron Lady'

""My experience with the schools in Ladakh gave me a path to follow, one that I knew I could contribute to,"" says Sujata Sahu, who had spent 12 years in the corporate world before starting to work with children.

But she had been working at the Shri Ram School for just two years at the time, and leaving this job was the hardest decision she had to make in her life.

""I was planning to take on a seemingly herculean task, in possibly one of the toughest terrains of the world. I had no idea about where I would get the funds from and was also not very clear on how much of an impact I alone could make,"" she says.

Moreover, no one had done something like this before her in Ladakh. But thankfully, she found with herself two strong founding partners -- her husband, Sandeep Sahu, who had been trekking in the region for almost 35 years, and Dawa Jora, a Ladakhi businessman, all of whom had the strong conviction that something like this was really needed for the region.

In 2011, unable to find other NGOs to partner with, the three founders went on a three-day trek to one of the most isolated villages in Lingshed (in Ladakh), carrying 1500 kg of education material on 25 horses, and crossing three mountains at extreme temperatures as low as minus 15 degrees.

The treacherous and steep pass they crossed at an altitude of almost 17000 ft inspired the name of the '17000 ft foundation'.

As she started off on her mission to provide Ladakh schools with the right resources to further the education of their students, she realised this wouldn't be very easy.

""One of our biggest challenges was convincing corporates that even remote areas with extremely scattered and small populations needed support,"" says Sahu.

For the first two years, the foundation worked only with the founders' own funds and kind contributions of friends and family members.

""Though no non-profit organisations were willing to take on Ladakh as a region, we were given support in the form of knowledge, pedagogy and even a large donation of books for our first 100 libraries,"" she says.

Sujata Sahu's undying passion to help the people of Ladakh earned her the nickname of the 'Iron Lady'.

How Ladakh poses a unique set of education problems

India is a geographical anomaly as it has every type of topographical setup, each of which comes with its own challenges. This makes it extremely difficult for the government to cater to every type of problem that can arise in this vast country owing to accessibility issues, extreme weather conditions etc.

Ladakh has almost a 1000 schools across Leh and Kargil, spread across 60,000 sq km of harsh mountains. Catering to a school going population of under 40,000 children, the average school strength of these schools is barely 25 students across the two districts, explains Sahu.

Teachers themselves come from remote villages and have to travel long distances for training, school supplies and even basic administrative functions, leading to long absences and shortage of staff, she adds.

Also, ""While teachers are given basic residential training during winters as well as in-service training, most of the trainings are not contextualized for the uniqueness of the Ladakhi education system,"" she says.

The extreme weather also adds to the problems with schools being shut for severe winters for three months in a year when the roads become inaccessible due to thick snow and temperatures as low as minus 35-40 degrees.

""Incredibly, despite the remoteness of the region, every little hamlet which has even 10 school going children has a tiny government school with teachers in attendance, thanks to the local administration. A little wonder then, that 89% of the schools in Ladakh are govt schools with the private schools present in just a handful of the larger villages,"" she says.

""What is commendable is that all these 900 plus schools are functional and have qualified teachers in attendance. What is even more remarkable is that every child in every village goes to school, managing to at least complete middle school,"" Sahu adds

However, it is only the larger villages which have middle schools and after passing class 5, children have to walk around two hours to get to school to continue their education. Public transport isn't available in such terrain and the army provides army vans for commuting.

.Despite the presence of these govt schools, the community here wants a better life and quality education for their children so they can get better jobs. This aspiration makes them send their very young children, often as young as three years old, to be enrolled in private schools, often extremely far away from their homes.

""Cut off from their villages and parents for months in a year, these children grow up in dormitories, hostels or with other families. Lacking the care and guidance they need in their growing up years, this leads to large-scale dropouts and a population of youth who are unable to go back to their villages,"" Sahu explains.

17000 ft works in these remote villages by improving existing govt schools so that parents would have faith in them and stop sending their children away so far that it disconnects them from their roots.

How voluntourism is helping 17000 ft foundation grow

Sujata Sahu started her non-profit organisation with just the founders and a few volunteers who were given the task to survey the entire length and breadth of Ladakh.

The team mapped around 600 schools after a seven-month-long study. Some of these schools had been bomb shelters during the Kargil war and the buildings had to be shifted multiple times.

The success of the volunteer programmes helped the foundation grow and each of these schools has been geo-mapped for travellers to find.

""We, very early on, piloted our volunteering programmes to involve outsiders in the work of our organization and to also understand if people could be encouraged to donate to such a cause. The enthusiasm and support shown by complete strangers told us that we were on the right track,"" says Sahu.

""Our volunteers, who are our brand ambassadors, then carried the story of our work into their workplaces and CSR then became our main source of funding. Voluntourism, as it is called today, still forms a good 25% of our annual budget and helps us maintain our backend costs,"" she adds.

Why playgrounds are so important in Ladakh schools

Though the govt schools all over Ladakh have proper buildings, they lack the proper facilities that make a school a happy, joyous and welcoming place for children. And in a remote location with rugged ground, a playground comes as a blessing.

""In these remote villages, where nothing is available, there are absolutely no options for children to play with. Though these schools have well-qualified teachers and very low pupil-teacher-ratio, parents often judge the performance of a school based just on the facilities they provide,"" says Sahu.

Thus, parents see the existence of a playground in govt schools as a very good incentive to not send away their kids to far-off private schools.

""Today, 17000 ft foundation has setup playgrounds in 140 schools with colourful swings, slides, see saws etc. many of which the team had to carry over horseback for days to reach our remotest schools,"" she says.

Solving the problem of no native language storybooks in Ladakh

A big aspect of Ladakh education that surprised Sujata Sahu was how the kids learned in English medium schools even though they have no exposure to the foreign language. Their native language was Bhoti.

""To add to this burden, children also have to study their local language as well an additional Hindi/Urdu from grade 1,"" says Sahu.

To enable the children to read better and get comfortable with the number of languages they have to deal with, 17000 ft set up libraries in 230 schools with simple and easy to read story books in English, Hindi and Urdu.

""However, sadly, there are absolutely no story books in Bhoti for children to read. Sensing this gap, we undertook a mission to translate storybooks from English to Bhoti.""

""In 2015, we launched our first phase where we translated 21 titles and published 21,000 storybooks for distribution into 300 schools,"" says Sahu.

This year again, the organisation not only translated another 20 titles, but also added illustrations and changed narratives to make them more relatable to the children of Ladakh.

What has 17000 ft foundation achieved so far?

In the span of just six years, Sujata Sahu's organisation has accomplished much.

""Today, 17000 ft works with 250 govt schools across Leh and Kargil and we are already seeing a reverse trend of children coming back from private schools back to the govt schools in their villages,"" says Sahu.

The organisation has set up libraries in 230 schools, playgrounds in 140 schools, and trained over 1500 teachers in various methodologies with a team which is in Ladakh every winter for training teachers.

17000 ft foundation has conducted multiple community workshops in 125 villages with over 10,000 villagers contributing to our workshops and programmes in the schools.

Recently, the organisation electrified and digitized 120 schools in Leh and Kargil, providing solar electricity and tablets with customized digital learning content, a TV, and a server to provide offline data syncing.

The DigiLab project is the non-profit's most ambitious programme bringing offline hybrid digital learning solutions to the remote villages.

The well-furnished digital labs supported by workshops from the team throughout the year can help the students learn independently with guidance from their teachers.

How crowfunding is helping 17000 ft foundation

Crowdfunding is increasingly coming up as a very important resource collection measure.

""17000 ft has been involved with ImpactGuru.com in multiple projects, the latest being the funding of a Playground for a very remote school in Kargil. We had also fundraised for our Bhoti Book Translation project through ImpactGuru.com and managed to raise more than we needed,"" says Sahu.

Fundraising platforms are great for helping nonprofits fund small projects that have tangible goals and timelines. It is an excellent way to help get the word out to potential supporters and garner more support for the non-profit, says the Iron Lady of Ladakh.

Future of 17000 ft foundation

Before 17000 ft was established, there was little or no attention on the remote schools of Ladakh, and today with all our work and efforts and the participation of the local communities, govt schools are looking and performing better and we are seeing a reverse trend of children coming back to their villages and govt schools.

""When we started, one of our biggest challenges was encouraging donors, volunteers, foundations and even corporates to focus on remote regions of Ladakh. Today, however, we are confident that our model is working and we can get the support we need,"" beams Sahu.

Sujata Sahu now wants to take this model to other remote and mountainous regions, like Arunachal Pradesh, or the remote areas of Himachal.

""We feel that we are closer now to our vision of a better life and education for all children, regardless of geography or terrain,"" she says.

On Thursday (December 20), over 35 trade organisations in Kerala came together to announce that 2019 will be 'anti-hartal year'. The Cochin Chamber of Commerce believes that the frequency of hartals - otherwise known as bandhs - in Kerala is cutting Rs 7,200 crore from the state's GDP.

""There were 97 hartals last year. The traders, hoteliers, bus owners and other establishments were facing a loss of crores of rupees due to such flash hartals,"" Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samiti state president T. Nasarudheen told PTI. """"We want all the political parties to co-operate with us. Even a minister had said the political parties need to find an alternative to such flash strike calls.""

On December 14, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) called for a state-wide strike in Kerala, to mourn the death of an activist who allegedly self-immolated at the Sabarimala protest site in Thiruvananthapuram.

Although the commissioner of police said that the deceased had set himself on fire for personal reasons - not because of the Sabarimala issue - the BJP state leadership announced a protest hartal.

Economic loss

According to anti-hartal activists, December 14 was the 97th strike in the state this year, and the sixth shutdown the party has forced in just three months because of the Sabarimala row.

V. Venugopal, the president of Cochin Chamber of Commerce, said that if a hartal is considered '100% successful', it takes away Rs 900 crore from the state's overall Rs 7.76 lakh crore GDP.

""Hundred percent successful means the entire state comes to a standstill,"" Venugopal said. ""State-run public transport system and private vehicles are forced to stop operating in fear of hooliganism. Shops, schools and universities are forced to remain closed and exams are postponed.""

The ripple effects continue through the economy - through delays in shipments and transportation, supply chain interruption, and damage to inventory.

""Even with local hartals, transportation through that area is impacted, with knockdown effects on other parts of the state,"" Venugopal said.

Breaking the habit

Some leaders, however, are ready to free Kerala from the habit. Shashi Tharoor, Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram, told The Wire that he has been a consistent opponent of hartals.

""When I entered politics, I pledged to oppose all hartals, even if my own party called one,"" he said. ""While I support the right of workers to strike, I consider it a deeply anti-social act to compel others to do so. Hartals have kept students from exams, patients from hospitals and cost crores in lost economic activity. No one has the right to coerce others into giving up their work or other commitments, whatever the cause.""

""I have kept my office and home office open and worked on all hartal days, on principle. I would be in favour of an all-party consensus against hartals,"" Tharoor added. ""It surprises me that a people as hard-working and industrious abroad as Keralites are so willing to enjoy enforced idleness at home.""

A bandh by any other name

In 1997, a full bench of the Kerala high court banned bandhs. The Supreme Court shot down the then Left government's petition to get the order reversed.

Bandhs were promptly renamed 'hartals' to get around the law.

In 2000, the Kerala high court ruled that the enforcement of a hartal by ""force, intimidation - physical or mental - and coercion"" was unconstitutional. This has not discouraged Kerala's politicians.

In 2015, Venugopal said, ""The previous the Congress-led government introduced the Hartal Regulation Bill. The Bill was sent to a Select Committee for consideration but has not seen the light of day since then.""

Indian National Trade Union Confederation (INTUC) Kerala vice president C. Haridas, an ex-parliamentarian, clarified that hartals are not the same as workers' strikes.

""Hartals announced by the BJP in the state are unnecessary and create loss for the state's revenue and inconvenience for the people,"" he said. ""Workers' strike cannot be seen like that. They are forced to strike for their survival.""

Hinting at the upcoming bank employees' strike on December 21 and 26, the union leader said that such strikes are necessary when the government is privatising and liquidating public sector units, putting workers' futures at risk.

Signs of improvement

According to a document from the State Planning Board, 85,000 person-days were lost due to strikes in Kerala in the financial year 2017 (up to July), as against 2.68 lakh in the year up to July 2013.

A Times of India report indicates that Tamil Nadu fared worse: it lost the most number of days to strikes in 2017 - 5.74 lakh - followed by Kerala (1.37 lakh) and Gujarat (99,883).

Informal workers hit hardest

The tourism sector, a mainstay of the Kerala economy, is bleeding from the impact of frequent hartals.

According to Venugopal, some 50,000 domestic and foreign tourists were trapped indoors due to the state-wide shutdown on December 15.

In Kochi, ""Around 2,500 foreign tourists - mostly from the UK and Germany - who arrived by a chartered flight and four cruise ships were left in the lurch when Kochi shut down.""

As part of the announcement of the 'anti-hartal year', the Kerala Tourism Task Force said the tourism industry will vehemently protest shutdowns, PTI reported.

It is in the informal sector, however, that workers are hurt most.

In general, wages in the formal economy are not cut due to hartal absences; firms often ask for work on weekends or extended working hours to make up for the lost time. Informal workers are forced to stay at home, and lose their day's income.

Rahman M., a fish seller in Kothamangalam, a central Travancore town, said that every hartal is a nightmare for him.

""People like us, who depend on daily business, who do business on the streets, are the ones who are the most affected,"" he said. ""I need Rs 1,000 every day for survival. My parents need medicines worth Rs 600 daily. With the remaining Rs 400, my family survives. It's stressful and painful when we lose even one day's business.""

Right To Education (RTE) helpline was launched recently by the Social Welfare Department of Karnataka, which allows one to lodge complaints and get information on the Act. The Executive Director of the Child Rights Trust, Vasudeva Sharma, spoke to RadioActive about how the helpline could be used effectively.

Vasudeva Sharma explained that the RTE Act had been introduced way back in 2009 in Karnataka, and a lot of calls used to be received by the Child Rights Trust members on their personal numbers seeking clarifications. Even though there were no instructions available regarding RTE at that time, they used to clarify or give information in a comprehensible way. Of late, the calls had been about more specific and less common information.

He said they had attempted to set up a hotline back then, which failed because their personal numbers were still popular. The new helpline would have to have employees well-versed in the intricacies of RTE - the national Act as well as the rules for Karnataka and section (12)(1)(C), because (12)(1)(C) was often misused.

He spoke about the dangers of (12)(1)(C) being misused and despite it having popular aspects like forbidding corporal punishment, or stating the kinds of facilities an institution must have, how that could cause people to lose trust in it. It gave the impression that (12)(1)(C) was introduced as an attempt to control private institutions, as the condition laid down for availing this provision spoke only of what was expected of the institutions without placing any responsibility on the government. With the rampant misuse of this section, private institutions became richer but could not be brought under the control - and that such situations would lead to mistrust in the RTE Act itself.

Vasudeva Sharma said that he used to find a lot of children in government schools, but of late the number had been dwindling because they had moved to private schools. However, over time, parents were faced with demands for multiple additional payments. This at times forced the children back into government schools, and other times, they continued education there despite the heavy expenditure.

He also proposed some solutions:

On the move to make 8th standard the equivalent of 10th standard, Vasudeva Sharma said that though there had been discussions, the Central Government was yet to make a decision. He opined that it could not be taken without thorough discussions and analysis but was apprehensive about the imbalance a positive answer would create.

Vasudeva Sharma said that ignorance among activists and officials will deprive the children of the rights extended to them by the government. He suggested that guidelines be prepared wherein the responsibilities of each official is clearly mentioned and that such clarity would enable effective implementation of the Act.

He added that ignorance causes lack of coordination between the concerned departments and organisations, which could lead to failure of the programme."

Yadav said that the schedule had been sent to all the block education officers and block elementary education officers who were responsible for passing forward the message to all schools.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - At least one protester was killed in the northern Sudanese city of Atbara on Friday, the security chief said, as people took to the streets across the country for a third day against price rises and corruption.

Police fired teargas at groups who gathered in Atbara and the capital Khartoum's twin city of Omdurman after noon prayers, witnesses said, and residents reported hearing gunfire in surrounding areas and in the southern state of White Nile.

Web users reported problems accessing the internet, and some accused the government of blocking social media including Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp in a bid to stop protesters communicating. There was no comment on that from the government.

Public anger has been building over price rises and other economic hardships, including a doubling in the cost of bread this year and limits on bank withdrawals.

At least eight people died during larger protests on Thursday when some demonstrators called for the overthrow of President Omar al-Bashir.

Security services said they used restraint in containing demonstrations that on Thursday took place as far afield as Dongola to the north and al-Qadarif to the east - and a government spokesman said 'infiltrators' in the crowd had spread trouble.

In a rare press conference, the head of Sudan's National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS), Salah Abdallah Mohamed Saleh, said seven people had been arrested in connection with the burning of ruling party office buildings in earlier protests.

""We recognise that we must have self-restraint and manage things wisely and take care of the lives of the people and of public property, and we are not bothered by demonstrations, but we are upset by the lapse in security,"" said Saleh, also known as Salah Gosh.

He said one person died during what he said was an attack on a police station in Atbara.

""LAPSE IN SECURITY""

Saleh blamed rebels with links to Israel whom he said had been brought into Sudan by a network based in Nairobi, Kenya, for inciting the violence. He did not offer evidence to back up the assertion.

Police had stepped up their presence outside Khartoum's main mosques ahead of the third day of demonstrations.

There were small-scale protests across at least eight neighbourhoods in the capital on Friday, but they were short-lived, witnesses said.

Authorities have declared states of emergency and curfews in cities in at least four of Sudan's 18 states, according to local media.

The education ministry suspended some school or university classes in the states of al-Qadarif, White Nile and Nile River, private TV channel Sudania 24 reported.

The ministry has also announced that it would shutter universities in Khartoum state and schools and kindergartens in the capital city.

Sudan's economy has struggled to recover from the loss of three quarters of its oil output - its main source of foreign currency - when South Sudan seceded in 2011.

Long lines continued to stretch outside of ATMs and bakeries in Khartoum early on Friday.

Bashir, one of Africa's longest-serving leaders, took power in an Islamist and military-backed coup in 1989. Lawmakers this month proposed a constitutional amendment to extend term limits that would have required him to step down in 2020.

However, in order to get an exact figure of the number of school going children and to find out their needs, the school education department is conducting the survey.Over 160 teachers will take part in the survey exercise that will start at 8.30 a.m. The TNSCB has requested at least one member of the family to stay at home.

They will also understand the needs of the children including the medium of education they prefer and what is lacking in the schools in the colony,"" said an official from the school education department.

Based on the survey, the School Education Department will conduct a meeting and decide upon amenities in the schools and upgrading the existing ones. Proposals for the same would be sent to the government.

""We have directions from the government to start a primary school immediately, if necessary. If the students need English-medium schools, we will send proposals for the same,"" added an official from the department. According to the TNSCB officials, the exercise will be carried out in other resettlement colonies soon.

Meanwhile, parents said the main problem they face was the improper functioning of government schools. ""They don't complete the syllabus on time.

Chairing a high-level road safety meeting, the chief secretary said, ""Eighty per cent accidents in the state take place due to mistakes made by humans, while 15 per cent occur due to bad condition of roads and adverse weather conditions. Five per cent of them are caused due to technical issues.""

He asked the Public Works Department (PWD), the Police and Road Transport Department to work jointly to reduce the number of accidents.

Stating that 505 black spots have been identified in the hill state, he asked respective district superintendent of police and PWD officials to jointly visit these sites to ensure improvement of the on-ground situation.

He instructed the police and district administration to mark dangerous sites.

Among the mishaps, most of them were two-wheeler accidents. Number of car and bus accidents have increased in their share in the total number of mishaps in 2018 compared to 2017 from 30 to 36 per cent and eight to 11 per cent respectively, the CS added.

Agarwal directed road transport department to conduct comparative study of the causes of bus accidents. The chief secretary said the quality of the 270 driving schools in HP should improve.

Stating that the police department has sent 1,643 cases of cancellation of license to Registration and License Authority (RLA), the chief secretary directed RLA to take necessary action on these cases within 15 days.

There is no doubt that the school education sector is beset with huge problems. However, whether the dismal performance is on account of policy gap or there are other factors that are responsible for the current state of affairs is a moot point.

Let us first try to understand what has not happened in the education sector. Why has it not happened? And, how can it happen (whether through policy intervention or otherwise)?

Two things have certainly happened during the current millennium. The infrastructure (school buildings) has shown remarkable improvement though there is still a long way to go. And, thanks to the mid-day-meal, we have managed to get the child to the school.

However, what is appalling is the poor quality of education that is imparted in most of the government schools. This is evidenced by the fact that the learning outcomes have actually come down during the past decade despite enormous amount of investments. The number of teachers has gone up substantially and the average pupil-teacher ratio comes close to the required levels.

However, this does not solve the problem of quality. To begin with, a large number of teachers are not qualified to teach, yet they are teaching. According to a rough estimate, out of eight million teachers around 1.4 million fall in this category. Politics has seeped into this cadre in the most insidious manner resulting in skewed distribution of teachers in most of the States as the tendency is to hang in and around urban areas.

The Right to Education Act did precious little on this front. In fact, the legislation made the task of delivering quality education complex and difficult. The focus of the Act is primarily on 'inputs' (like infrastructure) rather than 'outcomes'. It has created an adversarial role between 'public' and 'private' schools. The Act mandates under Section 12(1)(c) that even private schools ""shall admit in Class I, to the extent of at least 25 per cent of the strength of that class, children belonging to weaker section and disadvantaged group."" The manner in which reimbursement is to be provided has created a number of problems.

The norms and standards prescribed in the schedule for a school are far removed from ground reality. What is perhaps desirable has been made mandatory. This has resulted in a phenomenal increase in the number of teachers. During 2015-16, there were 39,608 government schools that had less than 10 children but each school was mandated to have minimum of two teachers.

The budget private schools, most of whom are doing a great job in imparting education, are under enormous pressure to meet the prescribed standards or face closure. No attempt was made while enacting this legislation to look at the ground reality.

The consequences have been disastrous. On an average, an amount of around ₹10,000 per child gets spent in government schools. The budget schools do it for much less and impart as good, if not better, education. Unfortunately, the focus so far has primarily been on regulation (legislations are perhaps meant for that) and not on development of the private sector. Consequently, even after eight years of enactment, the country is none the better than what it was.

The RTE Act has done more damage to delivery of education. Section 16 of the Act provides that ""No child admitted in a school shall be held back in any class or expelled from school till completion of elementary education.""

The 'expulsion' part can be understood but not holding back a child in a class has meant that a large number of children are getting promoted without acquiring the necessary attributes. The model of 'no detention' was apparently picked up from the West and transplanted in this country without taking into account the objective conditions obtaining here.

Yet again, the consequences have been devastating as there is a huge bottleneck getting created at Class X where the pass percentage has plummeted. The States were not even given freedom to take a call on the issue. The government has subsequently decided to provide an option to the States and the amendment is under consideration of Parliament.

A new Education Policy is round the corner. However, what needs to be understood is whether there is a need for a policy to address the issues that afflict school education. Most of the action relating to education lies in the States. In any case, the country is too diverse to consider a single mandate by way of policy for the entire country. If a teacher does not go to a school in Kerala, he could well be ""lynched"" but in some of the States of northern India, they consider it their right not to go to the school. There are instances of these regular teachers employing a ""substitute"" to represent them and even teach on their behalf.

What is actually required is an action plan clearly outlining: What needs to be done? How it will be done? Who will do it? And, by when it will be done? The roles of respective entities should be clearly defined so that the performance can be assessed. One has often wondered why should only the Centre assess the performance of States? Why can't it be the other way round?

The action plan needs to focus on the teacher who plays a pivotal role in imparting education. The entire value chain needs to be looked at, understood and interventions clearly outlined. Beginning with pre-service training, to selection process, to in-service training, to transfer and posting, to engagement of teachers in non-educational activities, to their promotional avenues and morale will need to be looked at.

An action plan for each State will have to be worked out in detail, clearly outlining the roles of the Centre and the respective State government. Intervention for each State will vary from State to State. Unlike the present dispensation, there will have to be sufficient flexibility in the central schemes to accommodate the differences among States. The whole approach has to be outcome based rather than input based as has been the case so far.

Our country has been obsessed with the western world. We had looked at Finland, England, Scotland, Holland and all the lands of the world but not at motherland. A lot of wonderful work is being done within the country but has so far gone unnoticed. ""Policy"" cannot help in this regard.

What needs to be done is to facilitate identification, understanding and scaling of successful practices. If these home-grown practices have succeeded in the prevalent objective conditions, the chances of their replication and scaling are pretty high as compared to an 'imported' idea or practice.

What is also required is to learn from States, like Rajasthan, that have turned it around through some remarkable State level interventions both administrative and financial.

Policy debates provide food for intellectual stimulation but what matters is what is done on the ground. Hence, the dire need for an action plan."

Soni, a 27-year-old woman and a mother of two, yearned for years to be independent, to work and to support her husband in running their house. She was married off at the age of 17 and was not allowed to step out of her house to work or study further. When she visited her friends, who were all economically independent, they made fun of her that she got married early, had children immediately thereafter and didn't do anything constructive.

It took a toll on her self-esteem. Soni did not get any support from her in-laws and her family. The whole process of convincing and winning this battle with her family to allow her to work and handover to her the school certificates so that she could enroll for a training, took seven years.

She now receives training in cosmetology in Ghitorni with the support of Ikea Foundation supported Disha Project, an initiative of UNDP India in partnership with India Development Foundation which aims to enable many more women like Soni to get skilled and be a part of the workforce. She dreams of educating her children and of a brighter future for them and is happy to contribute in running the household.

There are many women in India who are engaged in unpaid care work and as a result not a part of the workforce. Over the last few years, many efforts in India are being made to reduce inequalities between men and women and to bring them at par, not just at the workplace, but also in politics, in businesses and to make them breadwinners for their families. And why not, since evidence points out that increasing women's participation in the workforce will lead to an increase in GDP.

If female workforce participation (FWP) were to increase by 10 per cent, it would add $700 billion to India's GDP by 2025. Further, as per a 2015 McKinsey Report, if participation of females in the workforce were the same as males, India's economy would see a 27 per cent increase in GDP, a bigger impact than in any other region in the world.

The labour force participation rate for women has been decreasing, going from 36 per cent in 2005 to 27 per cent in 2017 (compared to 82 per cent for men). Currently, women in India contribute one-sixth of economic output, among the lowest shares in the world and half the global average. While there are several interventions by the government, civil society, and the private sector, to make the labour market gender inclusive, there is a need to ensure that such interventions are successful. For this it is important to look at the factors that prevent women from participating meaningfully in the workforce.

Today, there is heavy investment in programmes that support education of the girl child. Intuitively, it is assumed that the low female workforce participation is caused by poor education levels, with not enough girls finishing school and hence not having the requisite skills to participate in the labour market. However, when examining the trajectory of female literacy, educational attainment and workforce participation, the need for focusing on other social factors such as not being allowed to work by their families, restrictions in timings, safety, problems in mobility and in moving out of their homes to take trainings on developing skills which would make them market ready is crucial.

One major obstacle for young girls is information gap, as they are often unaware of their abilities, interests or opportunities. Several young women, especially from underprivileged backgrounds, are first-generation workers and are often limited by social norms and family networks when looking for work. Most government school curriculums do not include modules on aptitude, soft skills or career-counselling. In the absence of such support, girls are often encouraged to get degrees for the sole purpose of improving their marriage prospects, without being given an opportunity to enter the workforce.

Once they are made aware of opportunities and gain relevant skills, women also face barriers in accessing employment. It is seen that many women, particularly first-generation graduates from underprivileged backgrounds, have no place, either virtual or physical, to get information on job or skill development opportunities. These women need a platform, or employment marketplace, wherein they can connect with local employers, and understand which jobs align with their skill sets.

Today, employment marketplaces exist primarily for the formal sector, which makes up only 15 per cent of the total Indian workforce. This lack of a common platform for the informal and MSME sector is a key factor contributing to the low female workforce participation. There is a large demand for skilled work from smaller, hyperlocal industries, which have the capacity to employ many women but are completely cut-off from the skilling ecosystem.

The above problems show that a successful model for increasing participation of women in the workforce necessarily must have complementary strengthening by multiple stakeholders. The government is also making investments and focusing on skill development. For a robust skilling ecosystem, schools and colleges, skill training institutes, employers, and communities need to be strengthened together to make employment more inclusive.

It is important to incorporate a more nuanced approach to skill development which Disha Project aims to do. This initiative aims to identify and address gaps in women's access to employment by bridging the gap between education and employment for women. It has now rolled out in Telangana, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Delhi and Haryana with the support of the respective state governments and is addressing key issues faced by women in understanding their opportunities, gaining the required skills, and accessing the employment market.

The project is working to bridge information gaps in schools and colleges so that young women can make informed career choices and be ready for work based on their aspirations. The Disha project is doing this by providing them with aptitude tests, career-counselling, employability skills, and exposing them to private sector companies through internships and apprenticeships. Such interventions in the lives of young girls provide them with confidence and a sense of self-discovery that tangibly impacts their desire and ability to enter the workforce.

The project also supports young women in the search for employment through the creation of employment marketplaces. Recognising the need of local employers for skilled workers, and the abilities of graduates who have received skill training, the programme builds matchmaking platforms for potential employers and the workforce of the future, supporting women to train on the job and learn critical skills that meet the needs of the labour market.

Such programmes highlight the importance of stakeholders at all levels gaining a deeper understanding of the problems that women face, and addressing these problems through collaborative, replicable and sustainable interventions because collaborative efforts in the right direction will help more women to become skilled, placed and empowered which in turn will empower the nation.

How many people in Bengaluru use Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Company (BMTC) buses, which are perceived to be the lifeline of the city, everyday?

BMTC figures say the ridership is 51 lakh. This means BMTC, with its 6650 buses, sells 51 lakh tickets daily from the 70,892 trips it undertakes. Each bus undertakes an average of 5-6 round trips per day.

There are demands for increasing BMTC buses. But will more buses help? Look at the city's roads - the traffic crawls at such a low speed that even walking can help you reach the destination faster. BMTC buses are always stranded in traffic. Some buses are crowded, while others are empty.

BMTC is making profit of course, only by cutting off the routes that do not make profit. But sometimes, buses do not exist even on the routes that need them, and during the time band when most people travel.

The other day, I suddenly got nostalgic when I recalled how Bengaluru was in the year 2000 - the calm, cool era when Sampige Road had a lot of Sampige trees and Margosa Road had neem trees, where one could walk for hours on the well-maintained footpaths under the canopy of trees. The days when one just got into bus number 63 and sat peacefully for 40 minutes to reach Vijayanagar. Nobody could have predicted how things would change in just 18 years!

Recalling all this, as if in a dream, I walked from St Marks Road to Shivajinagar bus stand. The traffic and pollution didn't bother me because I was on a mission of walking down memory lane. I reached Shivajinagar and waited for bus number 63.

Even after waiting for 30 minutes, there was no sign of the bus. Finally I had to go for another bus that was headed towards Modi Hospital area. The time I spent from walking, waiting to finally reaching the destination was 2.5 hours. If I had used Metro I would have needed just 30 minutes. I realised that bus number 63 had become an endangered species, thanks to the Metro. Namma Metro's Purple line connects MG Road directly to Vijayanagar, but doesn't travel on the same roads as the bus, and doesn't have the same stops.

The buses that are headed to Laggere, R T Nagar, Sanjayanagar, Kaval Byrasandra, Jalahalli, Basaveshwaranagar etc from Shivajinagar still have passengers, while buses going to Peenya, K R Puram etc were almost empty. This could be because of the nature of connectivity these places have. This also tells us why BMTC is not the preferred mode of transport for many within the city and to those going to areas where there is some alternative connectivity like train or Metro.

When the status of BMTC buses within the city is like this, why would anyone prefer BMTC buses if they have another alternative, or can afford autos or cabs? Isn't it too ambitious to expect people to waste time on BMTC buses?

Interestingly, BMTC's 6600 buses are not the only buses operating in the city. There are 48,899 buses registered in Bengaluru, as per the data from Transport Department for November 2018, out of which 12,229 buses belong to educational institutions - that is, almost double the BMTC fleet! The rest of the buses are operated by private and corporate agencies.

These buses from educational institutions make two trips per day, to carry the students to school/college and drop them back. But there's more to it sometimes. Ever since BMTC trimmed the number of buses on routes that stop at Race Course Road, a bus from a reputed educational institution has been stopping in front of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan every day at 6 pm sharp. The bus picks up regular passengers and goes towards Vijayanagar.

This bus is always full, though operating like this is ""illegal"". The punctuality of this bus has made it a reliable choice among commuters who wait for it. That the BMTC has not observed this is surprising. All they have to do is to bring back route number 63 during peak hours.

What would be the actual number of people using BMTC? Among the 51 lakh tickets sold by BMTC, there are passholders and regular travelers who change buses to reach their destinations. Each ticket they buy is considered in the ridership, and a person who needs two buses to go and come back ends up accounting for four tickets.

Lakhs of people would have used multiple buses to go to a destination that doesn't have a direct bus. These commuters would also have taken the Metro, if the bus is a feeder bus. Because of all these reasons, the actual number of people traveling using BMTC everyday could be probably closer to 22 lakh or less.

Same with Metro trains - when they say they sell 4.5 lakh tickets everyday, actual number of people who use Metro would be half of it or a little less - let us assume it is about 2.2 lakh.

Railways, within Bengaluru and suburban areas, make about 120 trips per day, and have a ridership of 1.5 lakh approximately. Divide it by two assuming that the number includes return trips, and the passenger figure stands at about 75,000 to 80,000.

This puts the number of people using public transport, that is buses, trains and Metro at a maximum of 25 lakh, in a city of 1.2 crore people.

According to the 2011 census, the working population in Bengaluru was 42,46,927 - 45.52 % of the total population. The population was then 96,21,551 in the city. Now this would have gone upto 55.2 lakh, assuming 46% of the people are working today - and we have 1.2 crore people. We can safely assume that at least 50 lakh among the working population in Bengaluru need regular commute/travel options.

Add to these the students from the age of 4 to 20, who also need transport to get to their schools and colleges. What would be their number?

Census 2011 data says that 26.16% of the population in urban areas is currently between the age of 5 and 19. If we assume this population has either school-going, college-going or working people, all of them need to move from one place to another. 26.16% of 1.2 crores is roughly 31 lakh. This is the maximum number of youngsters and teens in 2018. Even if 10% of this is ignored, to account for various reasons, the young population that needs transport facilities could be 27 lakh.

To actually see and visualise the population that might need to travel, look at the data below for age-wise population taken from the Draft Revised Master Plan-2031. The percentage of people in the age group between 5 and 60 that mostly need to travel, excluding a good percentage of women between 25 to 60 who choose to stay home, is huge, and will continue to be huge.

So, here is a population of 77 lakh that needs to travel everyday, and we have roughly 25 lakh people using public transport; two-thirds of the population, that's about 52 lakh people, still depend upon private transport, shared cabs and taxis to commute.

The Draft Revised Master Plan -2031 has estimated that total estimated population willing to work including men and women in 2021 is 58,34,179 - 46.575% of the population eligible to work. This number goes up to 50% of the eligible population - 93,79,352 in 2031. These people need reliable transport to travel.

These numbers further indicate that Bengaluru's future transport needs will be huge, unless more people shift to work-from-home kind of jobs.

How many private vehicles are added to Bengaluru's traffic each month? Private vehicle data for October and November 2018 looks like this:

This data does not include vehicles that met with accident, or were taken to other states by people who move out, or the out-of-state vehicles in Bengaluru not re-registered, so the actual number of vehicles that are on the road could be less. However, even if 1/3 of the 78,49,740 vehicles are not on road everyday, the number of vehicles on the road is still huge.

Now what happens if the city adds more BMTC buses to this melee, without planning in advance? It will end up being a drop in the ocean, due to the rise in private vehicles, competition for road space and lack of robust road infrastructure. Lack of trust among needy passengers regarding the timeliness is just a by-product.

One cannot stress enough on the need for better public mass rapid transport in this city that's growing everyday. As calculated earlier, the existing mass public transport systems serve only 1/3 of the needy population at best. 2/3 of the population currently needs private transport, and it is hard to change it without credible alternatives.

And here is the city, struggling to meet the demand with more buses and more elevated roads, while delaying Metro tenders, light rail systems, commuter rails and rapid transport projects. The city needs a lot more trains, metro trains and more metro routes which carry more people at good speed, while buses and autos must complement these mass rapid systems instead of competing with them.

Planning the city's transport without taking all these facts into account, and without creating credible long-term public transport infrastructure for 75 lakh people in the city, is going to only add more private vehicles to the roads, and will cost the city a lot in the long run."

This shows that the department itself has not taken any major step besides issuing advisory in the case. ""She did not delay taking the action. The moment parents of the survivor told her, she immediately reported the incident to the police,"" a senior official told TOI.

Speaking about collaborating with Project ECHO Zoom for the Manyata sessions, National Convener of Manyata, Dr. Hema Divakar said, ""Divakars Speciality Hospital is the first ever Manyata centre in Karnataka, and hopes to introduce digital platform for training teams from private sector providers pan Karnataka and beyond. The ECHO Zoom platform eliminates need to travel every month for the training. Healthcare providers can train at their centres with faster turnaround time. We are aiming to certify 100 hospitals for Manyata in Karnataka in the next one year.""

""Having seen the ground realities in rural India, where there are no specialists available, I'm all keen on supporting the initiative to skill frontline providers and to save lives,"" said Dr. M. G. Hiremath, Vice President, FOGSI and Head of ObGyn, KLE Belagavi.

Signifying the importance of introducing digital platforms in medical trainings and educations, Dr. Hema added, ""Project ECHO Zoom is smooth, sleek, easy to connect and converse. With its brilliant video conferencing features, it offers much more effective experiential connect with lesser cost and wider reach over massive scale. Tata Cancer Research Centre used to get approximately 1,42,000 patients in a month from across the country, many of whom had to travel for days, stand in queue for hours together just for a follow up - these numbers have come down to 30,000 since the introduction of Project ECHO Zoom for empowering the local healthcare providers. We aim to take quality, affordable, maternal healthcare to even the most remote parts of Karnataka and slowly spread across India.""

Speaking on the latest initiative of ARTIST in collaboration with Population Services International (PSI), Dr. Hema, who is also CEO and Chairperson of ARTIST said, ""Parivarthan is an initiative to bring about mindset change with the healthcare providers which caters to the changing lifestyle of today's youth. There are currently 12 master trainer doctors in Bengaluru, who will train 100 doctors each, on building awareness on reproductive choices, knowledge, attitude and dispelling myths and misconceptions about contraception among gen next. These doctors will in turn reach out to schools and colleges to guide the youngsters on preventive methods, contraception, change in mindset, decision making, and accessible healthcare. PSI has been of great help in providing high quality contraceptives at a nominal cost to the network hospitals. It will also assist in running a helpline on these issues. In Phase 1, we aim to train 3000 doctors, who will reach out to 3000 schools and colleges.""

On the alarming increase in the rate of Diabetes among pregnant women Dr. Hema as the Vice-Chair for FIGO GDM Working Group said, ""We observe Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) awareness day on 10th of March every year. But one day a year is not sufficient, as approximately 1 in 5 women who develop diabetes during pregnancy go on to develop Type 2 Diabetes within the next 2-4 years. Diabetes is a real problem which needs many more healthcare providers to address in the correct manner.

Thereafter I'll write a TOI blog post on this topic.

Who are these economists?

Thirteen senior economists, including former Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan, IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath and Sajjid Chinoy of JP Morgan. Others are: Abhijit Banerjee, Pranjul Bhandari, Maitreesh Ghatak, Amartya Lahiri, Neelkanth Mishra, Prachi Mishra, Karthik Muralidharan, Rohini Pande, Eswar Prasad and E. Somanathan.

Unfortunately, I've not heard of any of these economists apart from Raghuram Rajan and read none of them before. I read only the world's best economists (with Hayek and Friedman being my benchmark), and no Indian economist comes in that category. And given what these economists have produced in this report, I will not be reading their work anyway.

In this report, they're OK on labour reforms, ordinary on most issues and pretty hopeless on agriculture, education and healthcare. Most importantly, they have totally missed governance reforms although they repeatedly point out the massive failure of government in every field. A major blind spot these economists need to fix.

The Imperative for Strong, Equitable, and Sustainable Growth

India is one of the fastest growing large countries in the world, having grown at an average of almost 7 percent for the last 25 years. There have been many notable reforms over this period - most recently, the co-operative fiscal federalism that has brought the Goods and Services Tax into being, the enactment of the Indian Bankruptcy Code, and the dramatic dis-inflation of recent years, partly as a result of a move to an inflation targeting regime.

While commendable, we should not be satisfied with this. India is still one of the poorest countries in the G-20, and poor countries ought to grow faster because catch-up growth is easier. As important, the benefits of growth in India have been distributed extremely unequally, with top incomes rising much faster than the rest. [Sanjeev: The real issue remains extreme poverty] We have seen new environmental challenges, in the form of sharp increases in both local pollution levels and in CO2 emissions [Sanjeev: CO2 emissions are GOOD, not bad] that, if unchecked, threaten to stall or reverse progress. India is also not creating enough jobs: even though data on employment in India are both low quality and controversial, the recent news that 28 million applied for 90,000 low level railway jobs suggests we are not satisfying the demand for jobs.1 Unfortunately, we are not well-positioned to follow the export-led growth path that allowed many Asian countries to climb out of poverty. Despite abundant cheap labor, we are not part of many global supply chains. Even as global firms seek to diversify away from China so as to reduce political risk, India is rarely seen as an obvious alternative. [That's because socialism has messed up everything in India]

Given India's continental size, it need not follow the export-led path. It will, however, have to ensure that growth generates jobs and incomes across the skill spectrum, in the process

There are tremendous possibilities for reforms that will take us towards faster and more equitable growth, as this report will lay out. However, we have to allocate scarce resources carefully to make sure that there is enough investment in sectors such as infrastructure to create jobs. India's aggregate fiscal deficit (state plus center) is still close to 6.5 percent of GDP, higher than almost any in the G-20, and not significantly lower than levels that existed five years ago. However, our investment rate has fallen sharply in recent years. Despite that, our external financing requirement (as measured by the current account deficit) increased appreciably earlier this year, increasing vulnerability. Moreover, to the extent that India grows while being more reliant on domestic demand than were other Asian emerging markets, it needs a much greater focus on macroeconomic stability than they did. For all these reasons, it needs to prioritize government spending better, focusing on filling clear investment gaps and protecting the vulnerable. It also needs to increase revenues by making the tax system more progressive both in taxes levied as well as through more effective collection from rich non-payers, by bringing more people into the tax net, and by charging users for government services where appropriate.

A key factor in spurring growth will be reforms that alleviate ""supply side"" constraints on growth and job creation. We have to enable both the industrial sector as well as the service sector to operate at larger scale. This involves embracing highly overdue labor reforms including allowing for a rich menu of contracts with workers that allow for more possibilities than just permanent workers and short term contractual labor in firms [Agree]. Such additional contracting possibilities could give workers more job security, give firms the incentive to train and invest in their skilling, even while giving firms more reason to scale up. Similarly, cleaner title to land, as well as a land acquisition process that protects the seller while simplifying acquisition, will reduce the cost of developing land, a critical need if we are to create jobs [Agree, but these economists should ask why Indian governance system can't perform this most basic function]. A more predictable and better regulatory environment - which prunes redundant or unnecessary regulation, carefully sets regulations in new areas necessitated by our development, and enforces regulations effectively and impartially - will create a much better environment for business. We must also improve the capabilities as well as strengthen the independence of our regulatory institutions. [Agree, but why is India's governance in such a mess even today?]

Scale is also key for productivity growth which, in turn, is essential for India to expand its share of world exports. The ongoing reorientation of the United States away from dependence on China provides India with a great opportunity to position itself as a viable alternative for cheap sourcing of goods and parts. But this would require macro and industrial policy reforms of the kind just outlined that remove existing impediments to India becoming a valued partner in global supply chains. Rolling back the recent increases in import tariffs along with a renewed commitment to resisting protective policies would be a good way of signaling this goal. [Agree]

In outlining an economic agenda, we have to recognize government capacity is limited - the number of government employees is often low relative to the tasks they are assigned [Sanjeev: TOTALLY DISAGREE here. The issue is SHEER AND TOTAL INCOMPETENCE AND CORRUPTION]. This is often compounded by low staff motivation and relatedly high absenteeism, as well as inadequate training. Government takes on too much, while delivering too little. Yet for growth to be equitable, a must in our democracy, effective and well-targeted government engagement is essential. [Why are these economists not talking about governance reforms?]

One partial solution is more decentralization, with more powers and funding delegated to the states, and perhaps more importantly, within the states to municipalities and panchayats. It will allow for a much more dynamic decision-making process, resulting in government policies that are more sensitive to local conditions, as well as more local democratic control of officialdom. [This is fine in principle but totally fails to account for the fact that the SAME bureaucracy and political incentives will lead to the SAME outcome.]

The strategic use of technology has the potential to help here as long as we are careful not to make a fetish of technology, are mindful of the human dimension of transactions, and deploy technology with enough safeguards. Technology can make it easier to monitor flows of funds and uses of funding locally, allowing for more devolution of funding, something that has been proposed by previous Finance Commissions. More generally, effective use of technology can also help substitute for government manpower, increase the points of access to government services, help monitor service provision, and reduce leakage in the system.

The debate on whether the public sector should occupy areas that can be done by the private sector will no doubt continue, and there is an obvious case for exiting areas where the public sector contributes little while draining the exchequer and distorting competition. [Sanjeev: Why is government involved in ANY business at all? And this is not a specific recommendation: a motherhood statement] The government should also reconsider its interventions in areas where it adds noise and uncertainty - for instance, the constant fiddling with agricultural import tariffs, the unpredictable closures or opening of export and import windows, and the inability to procure agricultural commodities or release them effectively, does significantly more damage than good to agriculture. While actions are taken in the name of the farmer or the consumer, it is the middleman who often benefits. [Sanjeev: there's nothing wrong with the middleman benefiting in a competitive and open market. But the market is not open. This recommendation fails to recognise the huge blockages on agriculture sector trade.]

Moreover, even when the consumer benefits from high farm production and low agricultural prices, which also help contain inflation, the cost to the farmers can be significant. The case of pulses is revealing. In 2016-17 for example, India witnessed its highest ever domestic production - close to 23 million metric tonnes -- likely reflecting a combination of a normal monsoon after successive droughts and the farmer response to higher market prices and MSPs. This was sufficient to fully satisfy domestic demand. Despite that, India imported a hefty 6.6 million tonnes of pulses (almost a third of total domestic production) at zero import duty - leading to a massive domestic supply glut, and a sharp and sustained fall in pulse prices over the next two years which continues to this day, with prices currently 30% lower than their 2016 peaks.

In addition to getting the government out of areas it should not be in, there is an equally urgent task of strengthening the government in areas it does poorly or is virtually absent in - for instance, regulating and certifying educational or medical service providers, apprehending and successfully prosecuting economic offenders [What about non-economic??!!], or regulating haphazard development and environmental despoliation without blocking growth. [When even murderers like Modi can remain on the loose, then what hope of justice? This was the opportunity to talk about governance reforms.]

For growth to be equitable and sustained, we have to reform our education, skilling, healthcare, and welfare systems significantly. Our record on primary education is dismal, with only about half of the children in class five able to do math or reading at the second-grade level. Parents have responded by increasingly migrating to private schooling, but private schools are only slightly better than government schools, and in their current form will not solve the problem of low education quality. [This is a TERRIBLE comment to make - to downplay private enterprise, the only thing that is working in India for the POOR] It does not get better at higher grades -- our PISA scores were so low that we refused to participate again in that international benchmarking exercise. The poor quality of human capital may already be constraining growth (industry is increasingly concerned about the large and growing skill deficit), limits its inclusiveness and prompt a premature move to replace workers with machines.

Healthcare is another area of major concern. In particular, the public system has largely been abandoned by the patients seeking regular primary care. They prefer paying for private treatment even though many practitioners are unqualified and prescribe the wrong treatment in more than 70% of the cases. This is partly a consequence of the failure of the public sector -- public sector practitioners are often absent, and when present they put very little effort into treatment. It is unclear how the recent Ayushman Bharat insurance scheme, which is the main current effort to deal with healthcare issues, will address this issue. [Sanjeev: with the BLATANT failure of government staring in the face, where is the talk about governance reforms?]

This is especially a problem because dealing with the large growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and the many, only partly-solved, child and maternal health issues, relies heavily on getting frontline providers to lead the charge. Similar concerns apply in the education sector. A failure to ensure high-quality education and health care provision means that a substantial proportion of our future labor force will grow up underequipped with skills needed in the labor market and suffering from the long term consequences of stunting and wasting. Much of the middle-aged population will be dealing with debilitating diseases that could have been prevented or controlled. This obviously limits the sustainability and the inclusiveness of growth.

The environment is, of course, a critical challenge to the continuation of our growth and to the extent to which growth translates into improved quality of life. Many of our cities are increasingly experiencing levels of pollution that border on the toxic. If we cannot manage the environment at our present level of development, greater growth will make matters far worse. [Sanjeev: once again, this points to severe government failure - but no mention of the need for governance reforms] The consequences of environmentally myopic policies are reflected, for example, in the rapidly falling water table in many parts of the country, which threatens the sustainability of our agriculture. Relatedly, climate change is already having very significant effects on productivity and the quality of lives in India and we need to be at the forefront of global efforts to combat it. [Sanjeev: this claim is, of course, CRAP]

That our current policies do not add up to an inclusive and sustainable growth agenda is reflected in growing agitation across our society. Agrarian unrest, and the constant demand for loan waivers, is now compounded by demands for some form of government support from sections of society that are nowhere near the poorest. This reflects Indians' growing anxiety about their future and that of their children in an increasingly winner-take-all society, where they often end up on the losing side. Our welfare schemes like the MGNREGA and Pradhan Mantri Gramin Awas Yojana are mostly directed towards the very poor (the one exception being the public distribution system), so they do not serve the purpose of protecting those outside that group. Without stronger, sustainable, and inclusive growth we simply do not have the resources to expand our welfare schemes significantly, [Sanjeev: BUT WHY SHOULD WELFARE BE EXPANDED?] but if we do generate that growth, not only will there be less demand for welfare but there will be more resources to service any demand.

The bottom line is that while we have performed creditably in the last 25 years across different administrations, we cannot be complacent about our economic challenges. They are mounting. We are a group of economists, each with different specializations and interests, who have come together to offer proposals for the way ahead. Some of us are based in India, some outside, but we are all closely engaged in, and concerned about, India's development. We do not belong to any party, nor are we from the government. We hope this non-partisan analysis of our situation, while not intended to be comprehensive, will help spur debate as India moves to elections. The rest of this note summarizes our proposals, and offers our consensus view on some of the key issues we face. We then append individual notes by members of the group, which offers more details of individual views and proposals. Each note reflects the view of the author(s) in their personal capacity, and does not necessarily represent the institution they are affiliated with.

Macroeconomic stability: a prerequisite to sustainable growth and job creation

India's economic history is replete with the same lesson: preserving and protecting macroeconomic stability is an essential prerequisite to strong and sustained growth. Every time macro stability has been traded off to boost growth, the economy has been pushed towards a crisis, the consequences of which have undermined the very growth that was the initial policy focus.

Ensuring macroeconomic stability has at least three elements to it: maintaining low and stable inflation, ensuring the consolidated fiscal deficit leaves enough space for private investment, and ensuring that the current account deficit is sustainable and can be financed largely through stable capital inflows, to help insulate the economy from sudden swings in global sentiment. High and variable inflation constitutes a regressive tax, with the poor bearing the biggest brunt, since their incomes are typically least indexed to inflation. It also dissuades foreign investors from investing in rupee assets. Similarly, large and unsustainable fiscal/external imbalances impart significant macroeconomic and financial market uncertainty, push up borrowing costs and risk premia in the economy and threaten financial stability. All this impedes private and public investment.

Fiscal consolidation to creating space for more investment

The economy has made significant progress in combating inflation in recent years. Over the last 4 years inflation has averaged just over 4% versus almost 10% in the previous five years, and household inflation expectations are getting progressively anchored. The same, however, cannot be said of the fiscal side.

While the center's fiscal deficit has been steadily brought down, the combined deficit of the states - even after adjusting for UDAY - has continued to widen in recent years and, thereby, largely undone the center's consolidation. Consequently, the consolidated fiscal deficit in 2017-18, stood above 6.5%, not very different from its levels five years ago. Our primary suggestions to make progress on this difficult issue:

De-risking the external sector

India's heavy dependence on oil imports often results in ""boom-bust"" cycles on the balance of payments when crude prices change. For example, the CAD narrowed to 0.7% of GDP in 2016-17 as crude prices fell and was then tracking close to 3% of GDP in 2018 when crude prices bounced back up. This resulted in a large balance of payments surplus in the first instance and a large deficit in the second. These sharp swings complicate monetary policy, as well as exchange rate and liquidity management, and create undue external and fiscal volatility (since oil prices also alter the fiscal math). We should:

Fixing the Stressed Sectors

Careful but quick policy reforms are needed for the sectors/areas that are stressed. These include agriculture, infrastructure (including power), exports and banking. There are common themes in any revival. Typically, we need to redeploy government effort in each of these sectors, focusing it on areas where it is truly needed to play an enabling role, while freeing the sector of excessive bureaucracy and intervention, which results in inadequate access to markets, distorted prices, and poor incentives. While the recent focus on improving India's ranking on the World Bank's Doing Business measures is commendable, we should guard against the temptation to focus on the specifics of the World Bank measures, while neglecting the broader impediments to producing in India. [Agreed] We now consider each of these sectors in more detail.

Agriculture & the rural economy

We need deep rooted transformation of agriculture, treating it not as a sector that has to be propped up through repeated sops, but as an engine of India's job creation and growth. For that, it is imperative that we thoroughly reform agricultural and land policies. In particular, a key source of agrarian distress in recent years has been that the terms-of-trade confronting farmers has turned progressively more adverse, partly as a result of policies to combat food inflation. While low inflation is desirable in itself, the impact on farmers also needs to be taken into account. A policy priority should be to reduce distortions in farm product prices as well as input prices. Another important enabler is technology, both in educating and informing farmers, as well as in opening access to markets. Some specific proposals include

Infrastructure

Accelerating the pace of the infrastructure build-out will help in a number of ways; it will create jobs in construction and new economic activity around the resulting roads, ports, airports, railways, and housing; it will promote inclusion as it connects interior rural areas to markets; it will make our exports (and import-competing manufacturing) more competitive as it reduces input costs such as land (as cheaper areas are connected) and power, as well as improves logistics and reduces transportation costs; it will open up India to both domestic and foreign tourism, which can be a tremendous source of semi- skilled jobs. This will require

Power

Despite having some of the largest reserves of coal, as well as having substantial unutilized power generation capacity, India is both short of coal as well as short of power. These are policy self-goals, arising from both the dominant presence of government in coal mining and power distribution as well as populist impulses in pricing. Nevertheless, our low base allows us to choose a path that is both more energy efficient as well as less polluting as we reform the system for the twenty first century. For this we need:

Exports

India's non-oil, non-gold current account has deteriorated by almost 3% of GDP in the last three years, suggesting an urgent need to improve the underlying competitiveness of the tradable sector. Boosting exports should be the lynchpin of that strategy. [Sanjeev: Any economist who says this is simply not a good economist. Refer to Kautilya, and the best economists who agree that IMPORTS are the key. Let consumption be the focus of economists, and exports are a minor subset of this production process.] The existing constraints in the export sector appear to be reflective of more general problems in manufacturing: low scale of production, low productivity, bureaucratic impediments, high cost of inputs like land and power. We have suggested ways to address these earlier. In addition,

Financial Sector

Given the non-performing asset (NPA) build up in the banking system, it is imperative we make the banking system more robust and well capitalized [Sanjeev: HOW? By taxpayer subsidy??], expand its capacity to extend credit, and improve incentives to lend to the most productive sectors. While the recent travails of the NBFCs are a matter of concern, some of their problems stem from an overly rapid expansion of their balance sheets as they grew to substitute for banks. Stability in the banking system will help spread stability to other parts of the financial system as, of course, will the reverse.

The main challenges for the banking sector are to improve governance, transparency, and incentives in the banking system. Key measures should include

The non-bank financial sector needs a strong banking system as well as deep equity and bond markets, supported by liquid secondary markets and a robust regulatory and legal infrastructure. Key priorities include:

Making growth inclusive and sustainable

A good job is often the most important form of inclusion. In addition, we need to help individuals obtain the human capabilities that will enable them to secure and hold that job, as well as protect those who cannot get jobs. Let us now turn to proposals on inclusion.

Education

The single greatest limitation of the Indian education system is its inability to deliver universal functional literacy and numeracy in primary school. Several studies show that students who fail to achieve basic skills by the end of class 3 learn very little in subsequent years even if they are enrolled in school. Our top education policy priority is therefore:

The Right to Education (RTE) Bill's input-based approach to education quality was unlikely to succeed given the extensive evidence that most school inputs are neither necessary nor sufficient for improving learning outcomes. RTE has led to an unnecessary and disruptive closure of several low-cost private schools that parents were choosing of their own accord. In many cases, even government schools are in violation of these input-based norms. We therefore recommend:

While improvement in schooling is a key building block to education, we cannot neglect either vocational training/skilling or college education. Both will be critical to providing our youth with the wherewithal for the jobs of the future. High quality research universities will be essential, both to train the teachers for our colleges as well as to fuel the innovation needed for the next stage of our growth. [Sanjeev: GET THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF THESE]

Dealing with the skills shortage

There is wide recognition that the current models of publicly subsidized skilling are not performing very well even though skills are extremely scarce. What seems to work better is the skilling provided by private firms that are training their own labor force. However, under current laws, firms can employ workers for up to one year after which they either have to fire them or make them permanent. Since there are significant costs and inflexibilities in making workers permanent, many firms keep workers on short contracts and terminate them before they can become permanent. This state of affairs serves neither the firm, which has to hire new workers frequently and has no incentive to train them, nor the worker, who has no security of employment, and who is not trained. At the same time, since the government is often the only employer that offers secure jobs, young people spend their twenties applying for these jobs rather than working. However, these jobs are extremely expensive thanks partly to the munificence of the Pay Commissions and therefore there are too few of them. As a result, a cynic could argue that the government and the private sector lack manpower, while young people sit at home filling applications and preparing for tests. We propose that:

Women's labor force participation

There are clearly both supply-side issues-families not allowing women to work, women feeling disempowered -- and demand-side issues -- lack of women-friendly jobs in the private sector as well as discrimination. Some useful first steps here:

Healthcare

There is much to be done to reform the healthcare system in India. Increasingly, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer play a much bigger role, so healthcare needs to be reoriented to address these.

Environment

Even while business complains about the difficulty of getting environmental approvals, the quality of our environment leaves much to be desired and with climate change looming we should be thinking in terms of reaching peak emissions within the next decade or so and then sharply reducing them. For all of this we need to get more professional about the environment and climate change, as well as more transparent about the regulatory process.

Social Protection

India has more than 400 separate social protection schemes. A vast majority of them are funded at very low levels and do very little. However, they absorb some amount of bureaucratic capacity. And despite the wide variety of schemes available on paper, as the many protests make clear, people do not feel protected. In particular while MGNREGA provides some support for the rural landless, most other relatively poor people have only the PDS to fall back on. This is one reason that it is so difficult to remove any government scheme, however inefficient. There is a clear need to create a reliable pipeline for providing compensation for losers, as we move towards a more rational system of social protection. The Direct Benefits Transfer is a good starting point and building on it by being credible in compensating losers will be key. Specifically we suggest"

The children eagerly anticipating the arrival of the legends represented Teach For India (TFI), an NGO supported under the Go Teach pillar of DHL Express.

Teach For India (TFI) is a nationwide movement that aims to eliminate inequality in education in India. They recruit India's most outstanding college graduates and professionals and place them as full-time teachers in under-resourced schools for two years.

In the short run, these young leaders act as a source of dedicated teachers in government and low-income private schools. In the long run, Teach For India will build a powerful and ever-growing leadership force of alumni who will work from inside and outside the educational system to effect the fundamental, long-term changes necessary to ultimately realize educational opportunity for all.

The event took place in an upscale hotel in the city where the children slowly gathered in numbers to meet in person the legends. The children accompanied by the TFI Fellow and a parent gathered in a boardroom-style conference room, adding an extra zing to the proceedings as they looked like mini-CEOs taking turns to pick the brains of the Manchester United legends.

The focus of the session was on the importance of sports in the holistic development of a child. While everyone agreed about the role that education plays in a child's upbringing, it was proven beyond a doubt that sport confers a unique set of skills that books cannot provide.

The two guests were perfect for the occasion. Englishman Wes Brown joined the Manchester United academy at the tender age of 12, and went on to spend 2 decades at the club, which provided him an education, and eventually, a flourishing livelihood. Dwight Yorke, from Trinidad and Tobago, was one of the most successful strikers in his era, and had fascinating insight about how perseverance can make all the difference in becoming successful.

The students, certainly not shy, articulated their questions very well and were bursting with enthusiasm when the legends walked into the room.

While the children might not have seen the players play live at their peaks, they were certainly made aware of the greatness that surrounded them and spoke to the legends with utmost respect and admiration.

The first few questions focused on the upbringing of the players, how they performed in school, the importance of coaches and mentors in their growth, and the people who inspired the players as role models.

The mood in the room was certainly lifted when one student stood up and asked the players whether they preferred Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo! This was not a question the legends were expecting, and they were thrilled to find out the level of knowledge the children had at such a young age.

This question seemed to spur them on, as they got more personal with the questions. The session ended with one child even asking the legends who the better player between them was, amidst a chorus of laughter.

At the end of the day, everyone left the room with smiles on their faces, whether it was the students, who by the end of the session were acting like seasoned journalists, the players, who were having a lot of fun, or the parents, who saw their children in a new light.

From walking in with excitement to leaving with dreams in their eyes, the students had a day to remember. Most, if not all, of them, have now become Manchester United fans for life."

The demand was raised in a meeting of the members of the JKJCCPS with the Director Education Kashmir, Dr. G N Itoo, to discuss with ""him issues relating to transport and sale of books at the school premises.""

The JKJCCPS delegation was led by its President Showkat M Chowdhary who was accompanied by its Vice President, Secretary General and EC Members.

JKJCCPS President apprised the Director Education Kashmir about the financial issues the schools are facing for its transportation of the services.

JKJCCPS demanded that the seating arrangement for the students should be made as per 1:1.5 ratio.

Dr. G N Itoo gave a patient hearing and assured support to the private schools by taking up the their recommendations with the Commissioner Transport Motor Vehicles Department.

JKJCCPS also apprised the Director Education about the request of the parents for arranging sale of the books at the schools as per the MRPs from the publishers.

The delegation informed the Director that schools only provide facility to parents for the sale of the books through booksellers at their school premises. They said a proper bill and receipt as per the MRP is given to the parents. The delegation also informed that the Director Education that the schools update the checklist of the books on their respective websites ahead of the results so that parents have the choice to either purchase the books from the open market or at schools. It said if parents find they have been overcharged or the books have been sold over the prices of MRPs, they can approach the schools administration for its resolution or they can also register the complaint with the Legal Metrology Department for quick action.

Director School Education also agreed that parents should have the choice to purchase the books from the open market.

JKJCCPS said that the parents should be asked to register their complaint if any wit the school administration for its resolution.

It urged the Director School Education that schools should not be blamed or maligned by posting the complaints on social media which tarnishes the images of the schools unnecessarily.

New Delhi: Private schools in India have over 20 lakh seats reserved each year for children from the economically weaker sections (EWS) of society, but only 20 per cent of them get filled, a report by legislative rights group Indus Action has revealed.

Under Section 12 (1) (c) of the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, 25 per cent of seats from private, unaided schools are reserved for EWS children. However, over the years, many schools and even state governments have not taken the Act seriously.

States like Delhi, Gujarat and Rajasthan have performed very well, but others are yet to catch up, the report said.

Indus Action is a Delhi-based organisation, which works closely with the state and Central governments on the implementation of legislative rights like RTE.

From an all-India enrolment figure of 5.1 lakh in 2013-14, the first year that the Act was seriously implemented by schools, the number declined to 4.8 lakh in 2014-15, then rose to 6 lakh in 2015-16, and finally hit a low of 4.3 lakh in 2016-17. The data has been collated by the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), which is the official data collecting platform of the government of India.

The 2015-16 figure represented 27 per cent enrolment on EWS seats, while for the other three years, the percentage has hovered around the 20 per cent mark.

The report also showed that many schools are still not opening their doors to children from poor families. The number of schools that offered EWS seats was just 16 per cent in 2016-17.

""Lack of school participation is one of the biggest reasons for a low fill rate,"" said the report.

Looking at the low rates of admission in the EWS category, the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development sent a letter to all the states earlier this month, asking them to submit reports on the issue. The ministry, however, said it could only play a monitoring role, and not force states to adopt the rule, as education is a state subject.

There are many reasons for low admissions in the EWS category, ranging from private schools not willing to give admission to students to parents not approaching schools because of lack of awareness.

""A major factor which affects enrolment in this category is the social stigma. Many schools don't open up their doors to children from the weaker section of society, thinking that they will not be able adjust with the rest of the children,"" said Kanika Verma, strategy head of Indus Action.

""Also, many parents are not aware that their children can get admission in private schools, so they end up sending them to government schools only. That is where we are trying to step in and create awareness about the Act,"" she said.

A private school teacher who wished to remain anonymous pointed to another factor. ""Apart from social factors, another factor that plays a part in EWS admissions being low is because there is a very big government school lobby in states, which pushes private schools to not admit children under EWS category, fearing a drop in (government school) numbers,"" the teacher said.

The EWS category is also misused by well-to-do people who are not able to get admission for their children through regular methods. Nursery admission is a major problem for parents, especially in Delhi. Earlier this year, the Delhi Police had arrested a man who produced a fake EWS certificate to get his son admitted in a reputed private school.

The Indus Action report said while the Act is supposed to cover both economically and socially-disadvantaged sections of the society, the breakdown of admissions data between the two categories indicates that the latter group is not getting anywhere near adequate coverage.

""These categories include child in need of care and protection, orphan children, children with special needs, child labourers, transgender children, HIV+ children, among others,"" it said.

""In Delhi, in 2018, only 1 per cent of admissions were under the disadvantaged category. In Gujarat in 2018, less than 1 per cent of admitted students were covered by students in disadvantaged categories.

""While several states have a policy to ensure gender equity in admissions, the policy has not been successful in admitting vulnerable children at a disadvantage,"" the report said."

Yet, as we watched him tell his story in the documentary 'Doing Time, Doing Vipassana', his face was peaceful and his eyes were calm.

He explained that although he'd committed many murders, he'd never felt any remorse about the lives he had taken, or even a connection between himself and his deeds. Then a new warden at Tihar introduced a voluntary programme of Vipassana meditation. At first only a few prisoners participated, coming in large part to relieve the monotony.

But something started to change in these men; and others, noticing the difference, began to join in their daily meditation sessions. From a few participants, the numbers soon swelled to a few thousand, and the atmosphere of the prison began to change. The meditators began to wear fresh clothes, clean their environment, and improve the whole prison grounds. They began to serve each other, caring for those in need and helping the elderly and ill.

But more importantly, their consciousness began to change. The man in the film explained that after meditating for some months, he began to realise for the first time in his life the enormity of the sins he had committed. He prayed to God to be forgiven, and eventually was allowed to contact the family of one of his victims to beg for their forgiveness.

The victim's family came to Tihar to meet their son's murderer, and not only forgave him, but also continued to visit. After a period of time, they even legally adopted him as their son.

Group practice of meditation is now being offered in prisons around the world. I recently read about a new meditation programme in some middle schools in the slums of San Francisco, California. These schools were notorious for their low attendance, low student academic performance, and so much violence that police cars were parked outside daily.

A new principal introduced a 15-minute transcendental meditation session at the beginning and end of each day. Within a few months, student attendance was up 98%, grades had improved dramatically, and violence was almost nonexistent.

At a time when each day brings some new act of violence that claims yet more innocent lives, these stories offer great hope for the future. They provide an answer to the question: How is it possible to achieve world peace?

As in the case of the meditating prisoners and students, human consciousness must first change on an individual level before broader social changes can take place. The Dalai Lama said, ""If we taught every eight-year-old to meditate, we would end war in one generation."" Laws can't control violence, governments can't prevent it, nor can wars stop it, because violence starts in the consciousness of the individual lost in ignorance.

Paramhansa Yogananda taught that peace must be found in the private heart through divine contact before it can be expressed in society. He wrote: ""Towards realisation of the world's highest ideal - peace through brotherhood - may yoga, the science of personal contact with the Divine, spread in time to all men in all lands.""

Let us join together in this wave of social transformation, and through our practice of meditation create a spirit of global unity that can lead to lasting peace."

Radhakrishnan on Thursday told the Commission of Inquiry looking into the death of Jayalalithaa that ambulances were not stationed outside the Poes Garden residence of the former Chief Minister as she was a private person who did not want others to know about her health condition.

N. Raja Senthoor Pandian, lawyer for V.K. Sasikala, said that Mr. Radhakrishnan had told the Justice (retd.) A. Arumughaswamy Commission that he had said that he had not known that Jayalalithaa's health had deteriorated alarmingly. Mr. Radhakrishnan, who had appeared as a witness for the second time, recalled that the late Chief Minister had attended two events the day prior to her hospitalisation: one where she distributed books to government schools and another where she flagged off two new lines of the Chennai Metro, attended by then Union Urban Development Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu.

Mr. Radhakrishnan said had he known that the late Chief Minister's condition was as bad as it was later revealed, he would have had an ambulance on standby outside her residence, despatched a team of government doctors to attend to her and taken her to a hospital. He said that the downturn in the Chief Minister's health was unexpected.

Mr. Radhakrishnan clarified why he reached Apollo Hospital only at 5 a.m. on September 23, 2016; Jayalalithaa had been admitted the previous night.

The Health Secretary clarified that he had stayed away as the late Chief Miniser had not wanted any government officials present during a visit to the Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research the previous year. At the time, Jayalalithaa had returned home the same day; Mr. Radhakrishnan decided to visit Apollo after he realised that the late Chief Minister had indeed been admitted.

Later, during an interaction with journalists, Mr. Radhakrishnan mounted a passionate defence of the treatment provided to Jayalalithaa as he had noticed mistakes in news reports on the treatment and death of the former CM.

He said that there was no conflict between the opinion of the doctors of Apollo and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. Mr. Radhakrishnan pointed to multiple reports of AIIMS doctors -- even on the day before the Chief Minister's cardiac arrest -- to say that Jayalalithaa did not need interventional procedures, including an angiogram.

Mr. Radhakrishnan said the option of taking Jayalalithaa abroad for treatment was discussed in the first week of October. The health secretary said that London-based intensivist Dr. Richard Beale was of the opinion that the facilities provided to Jayalalithaa in India were no less in comparison to what would have been made available to her abroad. To add to that, moving her at the time was considered highly risky as she was on a ventilator and hence, no decision was taken. The Health Secretary said that, as far as he knew, the Chife Minister declined to be taken abroad once she was conscious."

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), human papillomavirus is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. Over 60% of penile cancers, 70% of vulvar and vaginal cancers, and 90% of anal and cervical cancers are caused due to human papillomavirus infection. CDC also states that about 14 million people are newly infected by human papillomavirus every year in the U.S. According to the Cancer Council Australia, almost all schools in Australia have chosen to participate in the National Human Papillomavirus Vaccination Program. More than 9 million doses of vaccine have been given to girls and young women in Australia. This initiation resulted in approximately 90% decrease in genital warts among heterosexual women and men under the age of 21 years and approximately 50% decrease in disease of high-grade cervical abnormalities in girls under 18 years of age.

The project is aimed at providing tribals with an integrated platform to showcase their art, craft and organic products. The facility will also function as an interpretation centre.

Officials of SC and ST Development department said the haat will be of international standards and have air-conditioned pavilions for handicrafts made up of metal, stone and cane besides textile and transit, terracotta, pottery and an amphitheatre. The facility will also have a ticket counter for visiting the interpretation centre.

The CM also inaugurated the State level annual students' festival 'Sargiful-2018'. Sargiful, which has reached its ninth year, is organised to recognise hidden talents among SC and ST students in diverse spheres like painting, photography, music, creative writing through completions. Around 1,000 students will participate in the three-day event.

Speaking on the occasion, Naveen advised children to study hard and inspire others. The State Government has constructed hostels for over six lakh children belonging to SC and ST communities to help them pursue their studies, he said.

""Odisha is the only State in the country which provides maximum reservation facilities to SC and ST students from its own resources.

The average air quality index of the capital as on Wednesday, stood at 355, falling under the 'very poor' category as against the safe limit of 100 as prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board. This toxic smog, however, did not stop the kids of Delhi-NCR from standing up against one of the major sources of pollution - vehicle emission. Children in the capital braved the cold weather to give anti-air pollution message to the parents and other vehicle commuters. Their message? Stop idling when the car is halting for more than 10 seconds!

Students of Bal Bharti Public School, Noida formed a human chain and stationed outside the pick-up and drop points of these schools giving out key messages to the parents, drivers and others commuters to engage in the responsible use of private vehicles. They also aimed to promote use of school buses instead of private vehicles for commuting to school. Children spoke to the parents and drivers operating school vehicles to stop idling when around schools. They also educated the office commuters to turn off their engines at the crossings.

According to a study by IIT Kanpur in 2016, vehicular emissions contribute to 9% of PM 10 and 20% of the total PM 2.5 load in the city. Readings taken from Atmos Air Quality Monitors, suggest that PM 2.5 values spike up to 40 per cent more than the average PM levels inside the school area at the pick-up and drop timings. The 'No Idling' campaign, a part of the mandate of B.E.S.T. (Breathe Easy Stay Tough) Club school initiative of the Lung Care Foundation, will target parents, drivers and others who idle their vehicles outside schools.

The duration of idling usually varies between 10-20 minutes, while waiting to pick up the children from school or stuck in the traffic jam outside school at the time of school dispersal, thereby, exposing children to high levels of pollution right outside the school and in transit, says Mr. Abhishek Kumar, C.E.O. of the Lung Care Foundation.

Dr. Arvind Kumar, Chest Surgeon & Founder Trustee of Lung Care Foundation highlights that ""Children are most susceptible to sudden spikes in the air pollution levels, which is over and above the high air pollution conditions that prevail in our city most parts of the year. Prolonged exposure to such pollution spikes can lead to children developing asthma, bronchitis, hamper their mental and physical development.""

Mr. Rajiv Khurana, also a Founder Trustee of Lung Care Foundation explained how running cars don't just burn fuel but they burn oxygen too.

When we are waiting for our children in front of the school with our engine on, we are making them and their friends walk through the poisonous gases. I request all parents to be aware, be responsible and take charge. Mr. Khurana added.

Dr. Neeraj Jain, Chairman, Department of Chest Medicine at Sri Ganga Ram Hospital and Member Doctors for Clean Air Initiative also highlighted that how vehicular emissions contribute significantly to the deteriorating air quality of Delhi NCR.

When there is excessive vehicular movement and idling around schools, the toxic fumes cross the school boundary and affect the children studying inside the classroom or children playing inside the school ground. The young developing lungs and bodies of children can be permanently damaged by exposure to the sudden spikes of pollution around the school, said Mr. Jain.

""Many schools have air-conditioned school buses and in order to maintain the temperatures within the buses they often idle their vehicles for about 30-40 mins before the children start boarding their school buses and children are exposed to the fumes. My child always complains of cough coming back from school. She takes about an hour to settle down,"" a parent pointed out.

For the sake of our children, areas around the schools should be made as 'No Idling Zones' and a strict fine should be imposed on any violator,""another parent suggested.

Through this platform, Lung Care Foundation launched the #ParentsForCleanAir initiative under the B.E.S.T. club program where parents are invited to join hands for clean air initiatives to provide healthy clean air for their children.

Unveiling the banner with Mr Rajiv Khurana, Mrs. Asha Prabhakar, Principal Bal Bharti Public School, Noida stated that It is a matter great pride that the students of BBPS Noida have shown their social responsibility towards the most dreadful cause - air pollution. The parents of the school stand united with us through the Parents for Clean Air Initiative, and are an essential part of the functioning of the B.E.S.T. (Breathe Easy Stay Tough) Clubs. It is our joint endeavour to ensure children breathe good quality of Air in and around the school.

According to a study by World Health Organisation, 93% of all children live in environments with air pollution levels above the WHO guidelines globally. Ambient air pollution and household air pollution contributed to respiratory tract infections that resulted in 543 000 deaths in children under 5 years in 2016. The campaign is a sincere appeal by the children to all the adults to do every bit that they can to reduce air pollution and provide cleaner air for the health and survival of the present and future generations."

They are one of the few schools to have a mini waste paper recycling unit on its campus. Maintained by the Paper Recycling unit, the unit has been erected in a room and is made up of separate machines that include a small machine for pulping, screw pressing, drying and smoothening the paper.

Interestingly, campus annual reports and newsletters are all manufactured with the recycled paper. The school has a store where it collects all notebooks, newspapers, magazines and e-waste. Files carry bags, envelopes, photo frames, notebooks, diaries, calendars, tissue boxes, and pencil holders are some of the products made with the recycled paper.

iii The SAI has been implementing a number of sports promotional schemes across the country to identify talented sports persons in the age group of 8-25 years including those from rural areas and nurture them to excel at national and international competitions.

Presently, under SAI Sports Promotional Schemes 14143 talented sportspersons (9843 boys and 4300 girls) are being provided with regular sports training in 27 sports disciplines.

Further, under Khelo India Scheme vertical 'Talent Identification and Development', 1518 sportspersons have been identified (upto 07.12.2018) for support under the Scheme.

Relevant provisions for 'Talent Identification and Development' under the Khelo India Scheme

The National competitions involving schools, colleges, Universities and NSFs under Khelo India Scheme, National Championships, and National Sports Talent Search Portal of SAI, will provide a platform for identification of talented sports persons in priority Sports disciplines in which the country has potential/advantage. In addition to selection of prize winners, the duly constituted talent identification committee may also adopt globally accepted scientific methods to spot and identify talent in various sports disciplines. The identification of talented sportspersons will be done in a transparent manner through competitive performance and assessment made through scientifically designed battery of tests. Further, a National Talent Search Portal has been launched recently which will provide seamless access to upload individual achievements. In addition, the Gujarat model of mobile van will be adopted for carrying out scientific evaluation at remote places for better identification of the talented sportspersons. During the talent identification drive sporting talent hubs, discipline wise, including indigenous games, shall be identified and duly mapped. Efforts will be made through sports academies to conduct special programmes to encourage such specific sport / game in that area.

Out of the talented players identified in priority sports disciplines at various levels through different avenues, best talents in those sports discipline will be identified by the High Powered Committee and provided annual financial assistance, at the rate of Rs.5.00 lakh per annum, for a period of 8 years under a Long Term Athlete Development Programme.

This will ensure a sizable bench strength that the country is lacking at present. Additional funding requirement, if any, shall be met through mobilizing CSR support.

An amount of Rs.10 crore annually will be earmarked for maintenance of the Online Portal, identification of sporting talents through different avenues, including through advanced scientific profiling, short listing of talents and recommending the best talents for providing support. Identification of sporting talent will involve conduct of pan-India trials involving about 50,000 to 1,00,000 children by Talent Scouts (to be engaged for the purpose), in association with States/UTs. An amount of Rs.50 crore will be earmarked annually for providing annual financial assistance, at the rate of Rs.5.00 lakh per annum for 1000 athletes, for a period of 8 years, to identified athletes, under a Long Term Athlete Development Programme.

""We had agreed to the exercise keeping child welfare in mind but the government is using it politically to malign the image of corporation schools."" Goel said she had received complaints from 20-25 teachers about the conduct of inspection teams.

The little kids are asked ""motivated"" questions, Goel alleged. ""Which brave child gets beaten by teachers? Which good student brings the tea for teachers? When a teacher is talking on mobile phones then you don't disturb them -- such types of questions are being asked,"" she said. ""The purpose is only to create a controversy.""

Showing the files about the ""agreed-upon"" questions, she added that the survey was meant to be about issues like safety of kids, guard rooms and visitors in the school. Corporation officials were also asked to provide details of students' family members but they are yet to send any information.

DCPCR member Anurag Kundu, however, claimed that the corporations couldn't legally stop the inspections. ""DCPCR is not under Delhi government and it is an independent statutory body. It is legally obligated to monitor implementation of RTE Act in all schools. The education committee has no authority to stop us,"" he said.

Kundu said the teams were asking the questions agreed upon in joint meetings in September. ""The questions cited by the education committees are not being asked. Only questions like how do you feel in classroom? Are you allowed to ask questions,"" he added.

He also pointed out that Quality Council of India, a central government agency, had been selected as the project management agency for the survey."

The Niti Aayog has sought a hike in the taxes on tobacco, alcohol and sweetened beverages while suggesting that yoga be made a regular activity in schools to encourages healthy choices and behaviours.

In its 'Strategy for New India @75' document released on Wednesday, the government think tank has sought increase in the public funding on health to at least 2.5 per cent of the GDP as envisaged in the National Health Policy, 2017.

To improve the public and preventive health system in the nation, it also called for strengthening the village health sanitation and nutrition day platform to cover a broader set of health issues across various population groups instead of only focusing on child health.

The Aayog also called for activating multiple channels-- schools, colleges, women's groups, traditional events like fairs, social media platforms among others-- and prepare communication materials for catalysing behavioural change towards greater recognition of preventive health care.

It also recommended incentivising state governments to invest in creating a dedicated cadre for public health at the state, district and block levels and instituting a public health and management cadre in states.

The Niti Aayog further suggested that a designated agency needs to be set up with the required capacities and linkages to perform the functions of disease surveillance, information gathering on the health impact of policies of key non-health departments and maintenance of national health statistics among others.

Public health, the science of keeping communities healthy through the prevention of disease and promotion of health and wellness, has historically been a low priority in India, the Aayog said.

""Of the total current expenditure on health classified by healthcare functions, preventive care accounts for 6.7 per cent. The money spent on curing people on the other hand is 51 per cent of the expenditure with the remaining money being spent on pharmaceuticals, other medical goods and patient transportation,"" it said.

The report stated that public health action and management is a scientific and professional endeavour which should not be left to untrained employees relying on common sense alone.

The Aayog further pitched for reform in the governance of medical, nursing, dentistry and pharmacy education in the country, enhancing production of doctors, training non-physicians, engaging private sector and ensuring access to affordable drugs and medical devices.

Though eager to outsource it to SHGs, schools do have apprehensions about accountability in the way the system will be run. TOI has learnt that the issue will be discussed in the principals' association meet in January.

A principal of an aided school told TOI on condition of anonymity that the idea of outsourcing was not a bad one considering the hassles schools have to deal with. ""We have to coordinate with the officials who deal with MDM and maintain records of each and every transaction plus students fed. One of the office staff is continuously engaged in this operation only, so one would feel that it's best to hand outsource this operation,"" the principal said.

The current set up for aided schools is such that schools get rice directly from the government. The rice sacks are delivered every month straight to the campus from Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns, with no monetary exchange happening between schools and FCI. The quantity of rice sacks to be delivered is conveyed by the school to the education department, which then informs FCI about it. This is the only part of the purchasing process that is common for both urban and rural schools.

Vegetables, pulses and other cooking materials have to be purchased by urban schools which then get reimbursed within two or three months. In rural areas, schools have to simply pick up the ingredients from designated shops and the education department takes care of the payment.

Almost all rural schools have cultivated kitchen gardens and use fresh vegetables in their MDM. Apart from SHG, even NGO Akshay Patra is providing MDM to certain schools as pilot project."

"369","1022615192","2018-12-19","https://www.sportal.co.in/golf/the-truth-about-the-golf-club-agreement-the-tidewater-news/","The truth about the golf club agreement &#8211; The Tidewater News","Sportal - World Sports News - Live Scores",FALSE,"by Barry Porter

I wish I did not have to write this article, but the mis-information, mis-characterizations and downright untruths being spread about the agreement have necessitated that I do so. I am certain that some of the opponents will challenge and misuse the information below. I only ask that you check out the facts and be aware of opinions and misstatements masquerading as facts.

The first issue that I will address is that the payment to Cypress Cove is not a donation or a gift. The County negotiated a renewal of a Recreational Services Agreement with Cypress Cove to provide the following services:

1. Recreational Golf Services to the golf teams of Southampton High School and Southampton Academy at no cost to the schools.

2. Recreational Golf Services to any golf classes conducted by Paul D. Camp Community College and any golf team sanctioned or promoted by PDCCC at no cost to PDCCC.

3. Recreational Golf Services to the First Tee or any other club or approved youth group who serve Southampton County.

4. Access to the golf course for Southampton County Residents at a discounted fee. The fees (including green and cart fees) charged are $27.50 per 18-hole round on weekdays and $32.50 per round on weekends. Additionally, County students and County youth may play for $10 per round (which does not include the use of a cart.)

The services provided to the schools include practice balls, use of the golf course for practice and priority use of the golf course for their matches. Last year the value of these services exceeded $14,000. In the past, the golf course has provided these services for a nominal cost, but it can no longer afford to do so. In the absence of this agreement, it would have to substantially increase the fees it charges to the schools.

Several people have suggested just eliminating the golf teams because so few students participate. I believe that this proposition is grossly unfair to the kids who do choose to play golf. Not every student is big enough, strong enough or fast enough to play football, basketball, volleyball or any of the traditional high school sports. Some of them (including some of the kids who do play football, baseball, etc.,) discover golf and excel at it. There have been at least five students I know of who have earned college scholarships because of golf. Contrary to what the opponents would have you believe, most of the kids who play golf are not rich kids, and these scholarships are very important in making college more affordable for them.

Other critics suggest that the parents should pay all these costs as they do in all the other sports. All I can say to that is that I do not know of any parents paying fees to provide a football field, a baseball field or a gym for indoor sports. This agreement provides the equivalent of a football field for the students (both male and female) who chose to play golf. The cost of equipment, shoes, etc. is still the responsibility of the participant (or parent.)

Additionally, unlike most high school sports which offer only limited participation opportunities after graduation, golf is a sport that can be played for much of one's life. I played football, basketball, baseball and ran track at Southampton and enjoyed every minute of it. Lack of opportunities as well as injury concerns after graduation forced me to retire from these sports. I was lucky enough to be introduced to golf while in my 20s. Before I started playing it, I thought it was a silly little wimp's game. I soon found it to be a very challenging, extremely frustrating (at times) and quite athletic sport. It quickly filled the void I had from having to give up my high school sports.

Most people, like me, only discover golf in adulthood. Many County residents do play golf and others may be inclined to try it if an affordable opportunity is available. This agreement provides that opportunity. Cypress Cove is a private course and was closed to the general public until the original agreement with the County in November 2017. This year, County residents played about a thousand 18 hole rounds of golf under the agreement. The renewal of that agreement with a reduction in cost (from $30,000 to 25,000) to the County continues to make the golf course available to County residents at a discounted fee. I encourage County golfers to continue to use the course and suggest to anyone who may have an inkling to try it to do so. You may discover that you like it.

I constantly hear is that Cypress Cove is a private organization and the County should not give money or support a private organization. To the contrary, the County does it all the time. Every business and most, if not all the charities and community groups the County deals with, are private organizations. Southampton County Historical Society, the Blackwater Regional Library, the Community Concert Association, the Rawls Museum, the Western Tidewater Free Clinic and others are all private organizations. Yet, the County gives money to these ""private organizations"" money every year without any strings or requirements for any services.

Most agree (including some of the opponents of this agreement) Cypress Cove is a valuable community asset from a recreational and economic development perspective. Would it survive without our agreement? I do not know the definitive answer to that question. I do know that it would probably be more of a struggle and that our agreement last year did help them in a challenging time. I do know that If the golf course were to fail, the consequences would be extremely harmful to Southampton.

In the 2017 tax year, Cypress Cove paid $22,000 in Real Estate, Personal Property, Sales, and Meal taxes to Southampton. Not only would the County lose those revenues, it would see a substantial reduction in property values in all properties surrounding and near the golf course. Conservatively, the County would lose at least another $25,000 in tax revenue. Yet, this result may not be the worst impact to the County.

In 2018, the Social Services Child Abuse initiative, The Chamber of Commerce, Bronco Credit Union, Southampton Academy and Paul D. Camp Community College held Fundraiser Tournaments at Cypress Cove. These five tournaments raised over $73,000, all of which has been or will be used for worthy causes in our community. Other smaller tournaments were held, but these were the big five.

A recent letter to the editor in The Tidewater News incorrectly quoted me as saying that Cypress Cove made a lot of money on these tournaments. That statement could not be farther from the truth. What I said was that the above organizations made a lot of money from these tournaments and that the money would be used in our community for worthwhile causes. After expenses and lost revenue from closing the course, I would be surprised if the course does any more than break even on these events.

I and three other supervisors voted to approve the renewal of the agreement with Cypress Cove Golf Course because we believe the services it assures for Southampton residents are important and the $25,000 fee for doing so is an extremely reasonable cost. We understand the importance of the golf course to our community and think that supporting it is in the best interest of the County, just as we think that supporting many other local businesses is also in the best interest of the County.

Another recent letter in this paper stated that ""at least two of the county supervisors are either members of the country club or members of one of their boards,"" implying some improper actions. I have made it clear from the beginning that I am a member of Cypress Cove.

I continue to pay my dues even though my health issues have precluded me from using the facilities for the last three years. I do so, not because I enjoy wasting money, but because I strongly believe in supporting an asset that is vital to health of Southampton County.

Other than myself, I do not know of any other members of Cypress Cove on the Board of Supervisors. I do know that not any of the other three supervisors who voted for the agreement are members and that I am not on any of ""their boards."" As for my participation in the discussion and vote, I did seek and received legal advice from the County attorney with respect to any conflict of interest on this issue. This advice stated that I did not have a conflict of interest because I did not receive any benefit from the agreement which was greater than that of any other resident of the County. Had the advice been different, I would have recused myself from the process.

Anyone has the right to disagree with any decision of the Board of Supervisors and to express that disagreement. However, no one has the right to make up their own ""facts"" and spread mis-truths about it.

In its 'Strategy for New India @75' document released on Wednesday, the government think tank has sought increase in the public funding on health to at least 2.5 per cent of the GDP as envisaged in the National Health Policy, 2017.

To improve the public and preventive health system in the nation, it also called for strengthening the village health sanitation and nutrition day platform to cover a broader set of health issues across various population groups instead of only focusing on child health.

The Aayog also called for activating multiple channels-- schools, colleges, women's groups, traditional events like fairs, social media platforms among others-- and prepare communication materials for catalysing behavioural change towards greater recognition of preventive health care.

It also recommended incentivising state governments to invest in creating a dedicated cadre for public health at the state, district and block levels and instituting a public health and management cadre in states.

The Niti Aayog further suggested that a designated agency needs to be set up with the required capacities and linkages to perform the functions of disease surveillance, information gathering on the health impact of policies of key non-health departments and maintenance of national health statistics among others.

Public health, the science of keeping communities healthy through the prevention of disease and promotion of health and wellness, has historically been a low priority in India, the Aayog said.

""Of the total current expenditure on health classified by healthcare functions, preventive care accounts for 6.7 per cent. The money spent on curing people on the other hand is 51 per cent of the expenditure with the remaining money being spent on pharmaceuticals, other medical goods and patient transportation,"" it said.

The report stated that public health action and management is a scientific and professional endeavour which should not be left to untrained employees relying on common sense alone.

The Aayog further pitched for reform in the governance of medical, nursing, dentistry and pharmacy education in the country, enhancing production of doctors, training non-physicians, engaging private sector and ensuring access to affordable drugs and medical devices."

In a rare feat, a successful young Indian educationist in Australia has made his way into the Rajasthan Assembly with the dream to bring about a change at his native place, which he had left in 2005 to pursue higher studies. Defying the image of typical politicians, he led a successful election campaign in the rural heartland in the run-up to the December 7 State Assembly polls.

Wajib Ali, 36, has been elected an MLA on the Bahujan Samaj Party's ticket from Bharatpur's Nagar constituency. He has a thriving real estate business in Australia and he runs eight colleges and a school, along with his two brothers, in the cities such as Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.

Born in a Meo Muslim family of Nagar block's Sikri village, Mr. Ali went to Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia for education and later migrated to Australia. He came back to his native village in 2013, when he contested the Assembly election as a National People's Party candidate and lost to BJP's sitting MLA Anita Singh.

Since 2013, Mr. Ali has been active in the region, extending support to people's struggles and raising their issues with the government authorities. He joined BSP three years ago to earn an identity for himself and get ""political weightage"" for his work among the people, especially the Meos who were marginalised in the society.

Mr. Ali told The Hindu on Tuesday that he had come back to India with the desire to make a difference in people's lives and improve the social conditions in eastern Rajasthan's Meo-dominated region. ""This is the State's most backward area. Basic facilities are lacking here. Besides, Meos are treated with suspicion,"" he said.

In his election campaign, Mr. Ali succeeded in convincing the voters about his honest intentions. ""People from all castes voted for me in Nagar constituency, where Muslims comprise 20% of population. The voters were convinced that I had sacrificed my comforts in Australia to do something for them.""

""Moreover, I have defeated the idea of communalism and hate campaign, which is used for climbing up ladder in politics. Common people have reposed faith in me,"" Mr. Ali said.

In the election results declared on December 11, BJP's Ms. Singh was relegated to the third position, while Samajwadi Party's Nem Singh was the runner-up. Having secured 62,644 votes, Mr. Ali won with a margin of 25,467 votes.

Mr. Ali intends to focus on education and health in his constituency in order to raise the standard of living of villagers. ""I will work for improving the quality of government education system. Private education is not a solution, even if I open schools and colleges in Nagar... it cannot serve the numbers. Only a robust government education set-up can benefit everyone.""

He said he would also pay attention to the law and order situation and corruption in government offices."

For Komal*, a student of class II at a government school in south Delhi, her pink bag with Barbie doll painted on its front side is not less than a treasure.

Everyday Komal carries the bag on her shoulders, stuffed with at least eight to nine books and copies as she walks up to her school. 'Apart from regular set of books, I carry a diary as well for preparing notes', says Komal as we discuss her daily routine.

Class II Student Carrying a Bag Equivalent to Class IX

With Komal's bag weighing 4.6 kg, she is, unknowingly of course, carrying more than twice the weight that has been prescribed by the Delhi government recently.

In a circular dated 1 December 2018, the Delhi government fixed the weight of school bags for students of classes I to X. For students of classes I and II, the circular states that their bags should not weigh more than 1.5 kg. State governments, including Delhi, have come up with guidelines on the weight of school bags after they were told to do so by the HRD Ministry.

At 4.6 kg, Komal is carrying a bag equivalent to that of a class IX student!

For other classes the maximum weight of school bag, as approved by the state government is as follows:

Classes III to V: 2-3 KgClasses VI to VII: 4 KgClasses VIII to IX: 4.5 KgClass X: 5 Kg

In the same government school in south Delhi, students of class I were sitting on top of a cotton durrie spread across the floor. At 2.1 kg, Leena*, a student of class I, may not be facing any health problem but technically speaking, even she is carrying a bag daily, more than the prescribed weight limit.

Extra Diary Needed for Notes

Himanshi*, a student of class VI in a Rajkiya Kanya Ucch Madhyamik Vidyalaya (government school with classes upto XII) aspires to become a doctor. She doesn't like it when her bag is lighter as compared to other days when it weighs 5.2 kg. A heavy bag gives this sixth grader an assurance that she will do well in exams and fulfill her dream one day.

With five books and an equal number of copies, Himanshi's bag also doesn't comply with the weight limit, as has been suggested by the Delhi government.

""At times, the bag is heavy, but I don't complain as everyone at home will start worrying unnecessarily. After joining a learning center that's being run by an NGO, I prefer carrying an extra copy and diary.""Himanshi (Student, Class VI)

This teaching centre where Himanshi spends an hour daily after school helped in clearing her doubts on LCM (Least Common Multiple) problems in Maths and clarified her doubts regarding identification of a proper noun.

So, that extra diary and copy, meant for preparing notes at the training centre, are something Himanshi can't leave behind at home.

Students in the Dark About New Guidelines

Most of the students that The Quint spoke to were not aware about recent guidelines nor were they told about permissible limit regarding the weight of bags by their respective teachers. Due permission was taken from the principal in south Delhi as well as the mentor of the training centre being run by an NGO after which the interviews of students were recorded.

On being asked how the school will ensure the policy on weight of school bags is implemented in letter and spirit, the principal of an MCD school in south Delhi said:

""We are aware of the recent circular and would be discussing with our staff as to how we can implement the same.""Principal of a govt school in south Delhi

According to an activist associated with an NGO that provides teaching facilities at under-resourced schools, an initiative related to cupboards didn't work out.

'We encouraged students to keep books in a cupboard at TFI-certified classrooms but soon some students started complaining after their books went missing', says the activist who has worked with schools earlier in Ahmedabad and is now managing a training center in Delhi.

Is 'Support Material' to be Blamed for Extra Weight?

For Monalisa*, who would be sitting for board exams in less than three months, it is mandatory to carry books of all the subjects to school daily.

""I have six subjects to study, so, I carry all the notebooks and books along with tiffin and a geometry box. It's actually the Maths and Science books that are quite heavy.""Monalisa, Student (Class X)

On being asked whether her friends also carry books of all subjects to school, Monalisa said, 'it's even worse as other students also carry support material for the subjects of Maths, Science and Social Studies'.

Usually students at government schools prefer NCERT textbooks but some schools also distribute separate books of different subjects, commonly referred to as 'supporting material'.

The supporting material usually has chapters in condensed form with brief pointers and has objective as well as subjective questions in order to give students a sense of the exam paper.

""It's the teachers at our school who suggested that NCERT textbooks are not sufficient and therefore, we prefer 'support material'. When the session began, we were given only textbooks but since exams are drawing near, we have now been given support material as well for all the subjects except Hindi and Sanskrit.""Monalisa, Student (Class X)

Private Schools Fall Prey to Publishers' Demands

While government schools don't mind handing out extra books in the name of 'support material', private schools often fall prey to publishers who offer more lucrative deals.

An educationist who has been working with government schools in Delhi since last two years told The Quint:

""Private schools do follow the syllabus which has been prescribed. However, at times, these schools prescribe books that are not part of the curriculum as they get a commission, and this also results in heavier bags.""

Demand for Re-structuring the Syllabus

For Sharmila, whose children study in class VI, VIII and X respectively, packing bag as per the school time-table is among her foremost priorities.

Compared to the pressure that kids endure these days, measures such as limiting the weight of school bags seem half-hearted to parents like Sharmila.

""They should do something about the syllabus, nothing will happen with just reducing the weight of bags."" Sharmila, Parent

It seems that the policy-makers should have spent more time on the weighty issue of course and figuring out a way of embracing smart classroom instead of merely calibrating bags based on weight!

Rajan Singh graduated from IIT-Kanpur, went on to serve in the police force and today runs edtech startup ConceptOwl.

If that is not an impressive list of achievements, we are not sure what is! Rajan was with the Indian Police Service for eight years and served as the Police Commissioner of Thiruvananthapuram for three of those, managing a force of 3,500 policemen. However, the urge to tread a different path soon led him to the corporate world. ""After having served half my tenure as a Commissioner Police, I got bored and decided to leave,"" says Rajan.

He went on to study at Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania and joined McKinsey & Company as a consultant. From there, he moved on to New Silk Route Private Equity where he focused on growth stage companies in Asia.

But Rajan always wanted to be an entrepreneur and start his own company.

""As an investor, I used to meet a lot of entrepreneurs. I saw that the only thing which made them different from us professionals was the ability to take risks. I did not want to regret not taking a chance in life. I quit my job and took the risk of becoming an entrepreneur,"" he says.

In 2012, he began his entrepreneurial journey with edtech company CourseBrew, but his ""passion was science and at CourseBrew, the learning was not science-specific,"" so he quit. In 2o16, he started ConceptOwl - a teacherless online-in-classroom educational platform to help students prepare for entrance exams.

ConceptOwl was started in Thiruvananthapuram and Rajan sought to provide affordable science coaching programmes across Tier II and Tier III cities.

""Students in these areas lack quality coaching and lakhs are forced to migrate to cities like Kota or Hyderabad,"" he says.

The platform, with a website and application, tied-up with Kota's Bansal Classes for tests and practice.

In 2017, Rajan, along with Bansal Classes, started classroom teaching for students of standard 9 to 12, offering Maths and Science coaching in an independent center.

tied up with schools and began classroom programmes. However, he soon had to start teaching Physics himself as the company was unable to retain good teachers, as they shifted to Tier I cities for better opportunities.

""While teaching, I realised that students' attention levels and engagement would shoot up whenever we gave them problems to solve,"" he says. Thus, in early 2018, team ConceptOwl started creating videos, aiming to recreate a live-class experience along with problem-solving activities.

Currently, ConceptOwl's coaching programmes are available at Rs 20,000 per year, for classes 7 to 10 and at Rs 30,000 for classes 11th and 12th, and are a combination of online and offline education.

Rajan says, ""'Concept' links back to our goal of bringing back focus to concepts instead of just cramming. Also, my daughter is a Harry Potter fan and I found Hedwig cute. Not only that but owls generally symbolise wisdom.""

In a ConceptOwl class, the teacher is replaced by a facilitator or Classroom Manager, who manages the teaching as per the script. ""A pre-recorded video allows effective structuring and scripting for the teaching process,"" says the founder.

A facilitator is a Science graduate who can engage with students, enforce discipline and manage the class. They show videos on a smart television screen or projector, ask questions and collect doubts from the students. In case of a doubt, if the facilitator is unable to solve the problem, he forwards it to a team of instructors, also called the 'real-time remote instructors.'

These instructors either send responses or shoot a video to be shared with the class. With six instructors as part of the team, ConceptOwl also has five instructors working on an hourly-basis.

""Instructors are usually experts in the domain and besides having their concepts clear, they are able to solve problems and elucidate the concepts to the students,"" says Rajan.

Homework, assignments and tests are given online, and all students enrolled in the startup's courses are required to have an Android device with internet support.

While it currently operates as an after-school programme, ConceptOwl will soon start a franchise programme where a franchisee does not have to spend anything on instructor salary as the company will provide scripted videos themselves.

They cover school syllabus as well prepare students for entrances. ""We teach Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Math,"" says Rajan.

What started as a team of five, consists of 25 people now.

""We are all from small towns and can attest to the problem (of the lack of good coaching centres) first-hand,"" says Rajan.

Nisha Salim, who manages Product and Operations, was the first hire for ConceptOwl. Before that, she was running her own copywriting business. One of the other core members, Jayadevan, has a teaching experience of 30 years.

According to the KPMG 'Online Education in India: 2021' study, the Indian online education market was worth $247 million and had around 1.6 million users in 2016, and is set to grow to $1.96 billion and 9.6 users by 2021.

While there are several prominent players in the edtech market like Byju's, Khan Academy, Notesgen, AlmaMapper and Stuvia, ConceptOwl's model - combining aspects of traditional offline and modern online learning - sets it apart.

""While there are plenty of online players, parents still prefer sending their children to physical coaching centers,"" says Rajan.

The company claims to have a revenue of Rs 2 crore and says it is almost breaking even. He adds that ConceptOwl is poised to grow 10 fold in the next year.

It has raised Rs 3.5 crore since its inception, and its principal investor is SunTec Business Solution.

Rajan has tested the business model in two locations and is now rolling out the programme in 15 schools with 700 students in the districts of Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam and Alleppey. His goal is to reach 100 locations in the next 12 months, primarily in South Indian states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and some parts of Andhra Pradesh as well as North East India.

The ConceptOwl team is also building programmes in Hindi and other regional languages to reach out to millions of Tier II and Tier III students and provide them the same quality learning as found in metro cities."

Veer Arjun Singh meets Indians from other states who have made the beach state their home.

Photograph: Kind courtesy Pixabay

It's mid-August in Goa. The sand is damp beneath my feet as I walk along Candolim beach. The skies are grey and empty. And so is the land.

I finally spot one gentleman at a distance. He's armed with a stick and seems to be persuading strays to move along. He glares at me as I draw closer.

""Private beach area, sir,"" he says.

He proves to be the guard at the Taj Holiday Village and Spa resort, a touristy extravagance that brings thousands to Goa every year.

Once he loosens up, I ask about the empty beach and he says simply, ""Off-season."" I'm not convinced.

Where are the tourists, the backpackers and hippies, who legendarily swarm around Goa's beaches all year long?

A day later I meet someone who may be among the last of that generation. French-born Leo Cecil Michaud came to Goa as an 18 year old in 1992. ""There weren't any famous bars back then,"" says Michaud. ""The city was tripping on something entirely different."" He decided to stay.

In 2006, he opened a restaurant called Baba au Rhum, named after the French dessert, which retains a certain hippie charm. But Michaud says that almost 80 per cent of his guests are Indians, many of them recent immigrants to Goa from Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru.

Before I leave the restaurant, I try a new beer, the Susegado. A Goan cliche, the word is still a fitting name for a seasonal brew. The word has come to mean many things Goa.

Like the waters of the Arabian Sea, Indians have been hitting the shores of Goa regularly for years -- most holidayed and left; some returned to build holiday homes; and a handful stayed on to live and work and build a new life.

To the first wave of Indians who had come looking for a new home, susegado meant restfulness; a reprieve from India's rapidly expanding cities. These cities have now grown to bursting point.

After living in New Delhi for more than 10 years, artist Nityan Unnikrishnan decided he'd had enough. He moved to gentler Goa in April 2017, and waited for his wife, Rukminee Guha Thakurta, to overcome her apprehensiveness and make the move too.

""As a freelance design consultant, my work is entirely dependent on the Internet and staying connected,"" says Guha Thakurta. ""I told Nityan my living in Goa would depend on the Internet connectivity!"" She finally joined him in October 2017.

Nearly a year later, not only is Guha Thakurta still in Goa, she's as busy as ever. ""The Internet here is better than in Delhi,"" she laughs.

In her spare time -- and there's considerably more since she spends fewer hours on the road -- she's become a fond tender of fruit and vegetable plants on the multiple balconies of their sprawling first-floor apartment in Porvorim, sometimes gleefully sending pictures of dewy melons and dusky chillies to her city friends.

Guha Thakurta and Unnikrishnan are now looking for land where they hope to build a modest home of their dreams.

Noted photojournalist Prashant Panjiar and co-founder of the Nazar Foundation recently managed that particular feat, having built a 300 sq m modernistic house in Moira. He loves the fact that he can wear shorts almost everywhere. He says he's nowhere close to retiring.

""I am doing the same amount of work as I was in Delhi,"" says Panjiar, echoing Guha Thakurta. ""But I don't feel anxious.""

Caught in the frantic pace of city life, he says, people often feel like they are running out of time. ""Maybe I am relaxed because now I can see all the trees I want to see from my balcony.""

Not all fed-up city-dwellers have the luxury of taking the radical decision of moving cities, of course. Crucial is choice of profession -- no one with ""mainstream"" jobs can make the shift seamlessly, given that tourism and mining remain the mainstays of Goa's economy.

Being an artist, writer or freelancer of some description helps. Over the past few decades, the move was also more easily made by single people or couples without children, since Goa did not have many schools that offered ""quality"" education.

Even 15-odd years ago, though, some disagreed. ""More options in a city like Mumbai is an illusion,"" says Karan Manral. Distance and cost, he says, make many inaccessible. Manral himself grew up as a navy kid in South Bombay. But by the late '90s, the population explosion and traffic snarls had made him restless.

By 2002, he had quit his job as editor of Digit and Chip magazines and moved to Goa. ""The city I loved when I was growing up was moving too fast,"" says Manral. He met his future wife Yogita Mehra in Goa.

Their daughter Tara, 6, attends the Shiksha Niketan primary school in Saligao. Manral, who went to school in Mumbai, claims there aren't more than five schools in that metro that can match the quality of education his daughter receives. ""This is what we need for her foundation,"" he says.

Things have changed since Manral moved. Not only are there mainstream schools such as the Delhi-affiliated Ardee School, unconventional schools are gaining popularity.

Paradise School in Aldona is just two years old, and it's filling up with children of erstwhile Delhiites and Mumbaikars. Its Internet-based, alternative teaching method, SOLE (Self Organised Learning Environment), and International Cambridge Board is attracting expats, too.

Lisa Chowgule moved to Goa in 1989 from Mumbai. Since 1992, she's been running the Keshar Academy of Learning in Tiswadi, another alternative school, which follows the Waldorf teaching approach, and is also affiliated to the IGCSE or Cambridge board.

""There are no periods, no bells, no restriction of movement and no exams,"" says Chowgule.

For many who have made the move, Goa has also been about starting afresh. ""Goa is an opportunity to choose an alternative career,"" says Puja Mitra, who started Terra Conscious last year, an enterprise that promotes marine conservation and eco-sensitive tourism.

While Mitra arranges for boat-rides to discover the biodiversity of the Indian Ocean (especially the Indian humpback dolphins), her husband and co-founder Roshan Gonsalves gives scuba diving lessons. They have been living in Goa happily since 2012.

Manral and Mehra too built a new ""career"". In 2008, the couple started Green Essentials. They help people set up their own organic kitchen gardens, conduct workshops on sustainability and sell organic supplies at their store in Porvorim.

The drive to find a new vocation for all of these immigrants has in turn fed a cosmopolitan, alternative-thinking and culturally vibrant ecosystem.

Bhagyashree Patwardhan's Paper Boat Collective is a significant metaphor for the change wrought by newcomers. She too moved from Mumbai in 2012. ""Moving to Goa means a life spent less on the road and more at work.""

Now, her immaculately curated lifestyle store in Sangolda features clothes by revivalist designers such as Santanu Das, ceramics from Bengaluru emigre-turned-Goa resident Thomas Louis and a range of crafts. Paper Boat draws everyone with a taste for the chic and the ethically produced.

Designers Orijit Sen and Gurpreet Sidhu belong to the earlier wave of naturalised Goans. Circumstances took them back to Delhi for some years, but now their People Tree boutique, inside a beautiful old Portuguese villa, combines with the Gunpowder restaurant to bring a taste of big-city sophistication to a quiet, leafy village. The unit is named for the address -- simply, 6 Assagao.

The intermingling of old and new immigrants with locals happens at places like House No 248 in Sangolda, often over curated meals and jazz performances, or at annual multidisciplinary events like the Serendipity Arts Festival. Both Sen and Panjiar exhibited different aspects of Goa at last year's event.

For every person or family that hesitated before taking the plunge, Goa's lower cost of living has often been a decisive factor. Thanks to the wealthy Indians who built or bought second and third homes, about one in every five houses in Goa is vacant, according to the directorate of census operations.

Real estate prices are still climbing, especially at gated communities -- Sun Estates Developers's Solidago villas by the Nerul river start at Rs 40 million -- but rentals are low.

Manral and Mehra run Green Essentials out of an old, Portuguese villa, which is surrounded by enough land for their organic farming. The rent is Rs 20,000. They pay Rs 16,000 for their two-bedroom apartment nearby.

Anushya Sharma, a painter who moved to Goa from Assam in 2002, also lives in an old, Portuguese villa in Arpora, which she and her husband Jochem Vanderzwan, who works in restoration, rent for Rs 25,000.

Children from the neighbourhood often wander into their house to learn a thing or two about painting. ""Goa is about community living,"" says Sharma. ""But blending in takes time,"" she warns.

""I seem to meet someone I know who has moved here virtually every week,"" says Shrayragi Israni, who works with environmental action groups. But the sense of community bonding is so strong it can border on the oppressive for those who fled the big city in search of peace. ""This like-minded-people thing, well..."" sighs the reclusive artist Unnikrishnan.

Goans have been largely accepting of city folks, but there is some resentment. Goan lifestyle is not flamboyant, and gated colonies with luxury villas and swimming pools are viewed with suspicion.

Israni says the problem with the new settlers is that they continue to be urban customers who demand prompt services. ""Not all are aware of the kind of pressure they are putting on Goa's people and resources,"" she says.

Veteran Goan architect Dean D'Cruz feels that government neglect of essentials such as the Mapusa or Panjim bus stands and new focus on the proposed Mopa airport is breeding anger. But, says D'Cruz, ""A majority of settlers who are taking up old homes in villages are sensitive to the issues of the local people and the environment.""

Conservationist Joanna Pyres, who has a Goan pedigree but was born and raised in the UK, uses her engagement platform, Circlewallas, to bring together locals, Indian migrants and expats to find solutions.

""The know-how of a local, or the exposure of a settler, could be the missing piece to the jigsaw puzzle for a lasting solution,"" says Pyre, who has been in Goa for over ten years.

Journalist Vivek Menezes says that there are adjustment issues between locals and migrants the world over, but Goans are more tolerant.

""Despite the challenges, Goa is among the few places in the country where an outsider can become a local,"" he says.

It's an inviting idea. And many are accepting the invitation."

It Will Be Easier For Your Kids To Get Nursery Admission In Delhi Schools","swarajyamag.com",FALSE,"Representative Image (Sonu Mehta/Hindustan Times via Getty Images)

Some private schools in Delhi have come up with new criteria for nursery admissions, where-in they give points to children whose parents are are vegetarian, non-alcoholic, freelancers, have done original research among others, reports The New Indian Express.

According to the report, the criteria set up by these schools are in clear violation of the Delhi government's guidelines of nursery admissions. Apart from mandatory reservation of 25 per cent of seats for students of economically weaker sections (EWS) and disadvantaged groups, private schools can admit other students according to a set of criteria.

To discourage schools from selecting any arbitrary criteria, Delhi's Directorate of Education (DoE) had last month issued a list of 50 disallowed points including vegetarianism, social/noble cause, first-come-first-get, non-alcoholic, non-smoker parent and declaration of parents' education among others. The DoE reasoned them as ""unfair, unreasonable and non-transparent"".

However various schools are allocating points on the disallowed parameters, thereby flouting DoE's guidelines. Sumit Vohra, founder of an online forum for parent community told that a high court order bans schools from even screening parents occupation, PAN, income and other details.

He added that a complaint has been sent by him to the DoE against schools that make Aadhaar compulsory in violation of the Supreme Court's order."

This year they have enough options to choose from that includes Sabyasachi designed Priyanka Chopra and Deepika's Padukone's wedding collection or Manish Malhotra designed bridal wear for Isha Ambani. One news report suggests Anuskha Sharma and Sonam Kapoor's bridal lehenga's were the market callings last year. In Delhi's Gaffar Market and Linking Road, Mumbai these designs varied the range of Rs,12,000 to 1 lakh. Delhi are not two exceptions but a stroll in Brigade Road, Bangalore and Vardaman Market in Kolkata presents us the same picture. The most coveted brands such as 'Moncler', 'Gucci' , 'Armani' 'Louis Vuitton', 'Versace', 'Hermes' 'Heron Preston', 'Kenzo' and many more might be a big deal for some but the street markets across the country are thriving on first and second copies of these names. The penetration of internet has made accessible the ""duplicate goods"" to consumers from every section of the society. These practices certainly questions the Indian IP enforcement mechanisms but also casts doubt over the competency of present IP laws in fashion industry as a whole. The practices of design piracy and knock off is not merely middle class chase for luxury lifestyle but the practice is prevalent among the designers themselves and thus discourages the fashion industry for 'original works'.

@dietsabya, an Instagram handle inspired by New York based @diet_prada, social media fashion watchdog has been incessantly working to make the public aware about the blatant plagiarism by the designers themselves, sometime from young college students and sometimes foreign designers. As per Diet investigations renowned fashion designer Anita Dhongre copied designs from the students of JD institute.

Indian IP laws, specifically The Copyright Act,1957 and The Designs Act, 2000 gives two kinds of protection in the designer clothes . First is the protection for the drawings on any garment that may not necessarily include the shape/design of the garment itself . @dietsabya highlights this kind of copying by famous designer Nashish Soni onto Alexader Wangny's slogan. The second category includes the design/shape of the garment itself, attributing to its unique fabric and tailoring. Designers are aggressively pushing to protect their design rights of this category. Rohit Bal in 2017 became the first designer in India to get copyright over his entire collection and the spree was followed by number of other designers thereafter.

Kal Raustiala and Christopher Jon Springman in her paper ""The Piracy Paradox : Innovation and Intellectual Property in Fashion Design "" describes this problem as ""Copying enables designs and styles to move quickly from early adopters to the masses. And since no one cool wants to keep wearing something after everybody else is wearing it, the copying of designs helps fuel the incessant demand for something new.""

""Jeans represent democracy in fashion"" - Giorgio Armani

India is world's largest and noisiest democracy. Indian textiles and apparels have always been one of the most sought after globally. Currently, the Indian textile industry is pegged at around US$ 120 billion, and is expected to reach US$ 230 billion by 2020. It contributes approximately 2 percent to the country's GDP and 14 per cent to overall Index of Industrial Production (IIP). The industry has also attracted FDI worth US$ 2.55 billion during April 2000 to June 2017. Just like Indian democracy the fashion industry in India is too diverse. Some have classified the sector as per their purchasing power and social reach namely- ""Premier fashion""; ""luxury segment""; ""Affordable luxury"" and ""Mains stream brands"".

It is thus more relevant today that such a huge sector is not trapped in complex web of laws functioning across domains . Currently it is majorly regulated by Intellectual Property laws - Copyright Act 1957, The Trademarks Act, 1999, Designs Act 2000, and Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999, however none of the them is sufficient to deal with the sector in entirety.

Before the next collection for designers is launched, one question that disturbs the designers the most is how to prevent others from copying their original work which has been produced after rigorous intellectual labour. Whether to seek copyright protection of their original work or get the design registered to ensure its full scale commercial exploitation. This designer's dilemma came to the courtroom in Ritika Private Limited v. Biba Apparels Private Limited. In this case, the plaintiff, a boutique apparel designer brand, brought a suit against the defendants who have been a leading name in ethnic wear, for an injunction to prevent reproduction,printing, publishing, selling or offering the prints or garments for which the plaintiff claimed to be the first owner. The legal issue raised in this case was that once the copyrighted works of the plaintiff are applied for the making of any dress, and production of that dress exceeds 50 in number, whether the plaintiff losses ownership of her copyright works . The court made a distinction between designs eligible for copyright protection under the Copyright Act, 1957 and the Designs Act,2000. It held that copyright protects the original expression of the ""artistic work"" and offers limited protection to the commercial exploitation of the same, whereas the Designs Act is the chief tool to protect industrial application of the design, however the design need not to be always original. The court decided the dispute in favour of the defendants and the suit thus dismissed,relying on the bar under Section 15(2) of the Copyright Act, 1957. It was also held that had the facts been different from the 'application of the designs' to 'direct lifting of the design' the answer would have also differed. Here the 'direct lifting' would mean copy pasting the copyright work from its original form. Ultimately the web of IP laws proved to be counterproductive for Ritika Private Limited.

The need is being recognised globally to sync the laws relating to fashion industry and develop exclusive programs to make fashion lawyers more aware about their duties and responsibilities and bring consumer sensitization about their choices . The infamous Rana Plaza incident which killed over 1,100 garment workers in Bangladesh highlights the poor labour enforcement by the global fashion leaders such as ZARA and H&M. Thus there is a need for everyone to be aware about legal issues facing the fashion industry ranging from merchandising, distribution and franchising agreements to intellectual property and labour laws.

Multiple law schools have designed their curriculum focusing to cater the needs of fashion industry these include Fordham Law School, world's first Fashion Law Institute working with the support of the Council of Fashion Designers of America and Diane von Furstenberg offering JDand LL.M programs to the students. The course includes specialty in Fashion Law and Finance and Fashion Ethics, Sustainability and Development. In India such focused opportunities are quite limited. No full time graduation program is available but IIFD, Chandigarh offers limited opportunities on Fashion Retail Law in India and Diploma in Fashion & Law. Some short term courses are also available to students by leaders in global fashion industry these include coveted program by Milano Fashion institute offering exposure to brand protection ; fashion negotiations and specific agreements for the industry ;supply chain issues ; issues related to counterfeiting & fashion forgery.

One thing is clear the ad-hoc approach would serve no purpose and comprehensive and focused approach needs to be followed that cater all the interest of fashion industry in the country.

We at Khurana and Khurana are standing closely with the Fashion Industry, we have a dedicated team looking after Fashion Law issues.

Ltd, an education technology (edtech) startup, has raised $35 million in a Series C round led by education-focused investor Kaizen Private Equity, venture debt firm Alteria Capital and Brand Capital, the investment arm of media house Times Group, said a senior executive.

Toppr runs an app providing education content for students from Class 5 to Class 12. This includes test series, question banks, chats for solving doubts and preparation for entrance exams in engineering, medicine, law and chartered accountancy.

Existing venture capital investors of Toppr -- Eight Roads Ventures, Helion Ventures and SAIF Partners -- also participated in the round.

While 40% of the funds will be used for advertising and brand building, the remaining will be allocated towards product development, increasing engagement and investing in technology, Zishaan Hayath, the founder and chief executive officer of Toppr Technologies, told Mint.

India's education technology space is dominated by Byju's, which has raised $540 million at a valuation of $3.6 billion, in a funding round led by South African internet giant Naspers. The funding has made founder Byju Raveendran a billionaire overnight.

Byju's investors include Tencent, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners and private equity giant General Atlantic.

Although Byju's is bigger, Toppr's Hayath claimed students spend 110 minutes a day on the Toppr app, almost three times as much as Byju's.

""Our challenge is to demonstrate engagement, and that is what we are focussed on. Five years ago, no investor would have touched the education sector. We have established a category,"" Hayath said.

The Toppr app currently has about six million users, according to Hayath, a figure he hopes will jump to 30 million by 2020.

""Students are moving away from coaching classes, and our focus is on increasing their engagement time with the Toppr app, and substituting local tuitions with a digital platform,"" said Hayath.

In May this year, the startup raised $2.3 million (₹15.5 crore) from Alteria Capital.

Prior to that, it raised $7 million in October last year from Helion Ventures, Eight Roads Capital and SAIF Partners.

Hayath said that Toppr is already in talks to raise $80-100 million for its next round from new as well as existing investors.

He declined to elaborate.

The latest deal also marked education-focused Kaizen's second investment this year, after it co-invested in Varthana, a lender to private schools catering to students from low-income households, in April.

""We are very impressed with Toppr because they are focused on learning outcomes in a personalized manner. We have been tracking them for four years, and they have kept spending low and been investing in an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven algorithm,"" said Sandeep Aneja, managing partner at Kaizen.

He also said in the next funding round, Kaizen would like to increase its stake. It has picked up under 10% stake in the current round.

About 40% of Toppr's users are from Tier 1 cities, with the rest from smaller towns.

As the company expands, this could change, because Toppr does not have a geographical focus, and is looking for growth from all segments."

While rooting out such illegal schools is something governments have to do on a war footing, the condition of some state-run schools in the city is no better. Buildings with roofs partially caved in, cracks running across walls, leaking ceilings, broken urinals in washrooms and crumbling walls are what several government schools serve to the hundreds of students who turn up for classes every day. District elementary education officer Prem Lata Yadav, when asked about the state of infrastructure of government-run schools in the city, said, ""The reason behind the poor condition of school buildings is lack of funds. We've written to the education department to look into the issue.""

Government Senior Secondary School , Islampur

Concrete chunks can be seen falling off the ceiling, with cracks running across the walls, at GSSS Islampur. The building has 15 rooms with 550 students in classes VI-XI. Washrooms were stinking, there were no faucets and urinals were broken. The school principal accept the condition of the school's infrastructure is not good. ""A proposal to rebuild the school building has been placed before the authorities. This building will be brought down soon. MCG officials have taken measurements for the new construction a few months ago,"" said Kanwal Nain, principal. ""This building is small, old, and built on low land, because of which, at times, water accumulates at the entrance,"" he added.

Government Primary School, Satlaka

The 46 students of GPS Satlaka have to brace a school building falling apart at its seams. There are five classrooms, but all classes take place in only one, as the condition of the rest is terrible. ""One can spot cow dung on the floors, broken benches, blackboards and doors. Across the building, the seepage is so heavy that during monsoons this year, the roof of one classroom collapsed,"" said Virender Singh, guest teacher.

TOI also spotted dogs roaming in the classrooms. ""This entire building is unsafe and unfit for tiny tots. Since there is no guard, cows wander in and take shelter inside at night. I'm not paid to clean up the dung,"" said Rahisa, the school's sole sanitation staff. Since the building was constructed in 1972, no teacher has spent more than a year in this school.

Shivji Park Primary School

Shivji Park Primary School doesn't even have its own building. It operates out of Government Senior Secondary School Kadipur, whose classrooms are in a shambles. ""Students are forced to sit in the school hallway or even in the open, as none of the eight classrooms we've been allotted are usable,"" said head teacher Satpal. Even teachers of the Kadipur school are unaware when the crumbling walls were last repaired.

Govt Primary School, Kadipur

One look at the building of GPS Kadipur is enough to tll you that a disaster is waiting to happen. ""There are 180 students in this school. Every now and then, chunks of plaster fall off, making it dangerous for them. The old building has been declared a threat, and a new building is being constructed. Unfortunately, construction work stopped six months ago,"" said a teacher, requesting anonymity.

The 70 tiny tots who study in GPFGS Shivaji Park, have to cross mounds of garbage and pools of stagnant water to enter the premises every day. ""Every day, locals throw trash in front of the school. We've spoken with the authorities, but this doesn't stop,"" said a teacher, requesting anonymity."

According to police, the school building in Salarpur was ""too old and deteriorated"" and its wall collapsed due to the impact of some construction activity that was going on ""without any official approval"" in the adjoining plot.

""Earlier we found 174 unregistered schools in the district, of which 93 were shut down immediately and 22 more were closed after imposition of Rs 1 lakh fine on each.

""Schools will be given recognition only when they meet all educational and safety parameters,"" the BSA added.

The number of students appearing from government schools in Goa for the Class XII exam may be much lower than that figure appearing through private aided schools, but the overall pass percentage of aided schools was only one percent higher in the arts streams. And only two percent more students in commerce stream cleared the Class XII exam in private aided schools over government schools.

In the science stream, six percent more students from government aided schools cleared the exam over those who appeared from government run schools. But even this difference in performance was better than nationally, where the gap between pass percentages of government and government aided schools was around nine percent.

In the case of Class X too, the trend was similar in the state. Though only around 2,600 appeared for the Class X board exam through government schools, as against more than 23,000 through government aided, the performance was almost on par with only two percent gap in the overall pass percentage.

Some prominent schools are also giving points to those opting for pick and drop service.

Apart from the mandatory 25 per cent of the total seats reserved for children from the economically weaker sections (EWS)/disadvantaged groups, private schools can select a set of criteria against which they allot specific points to each applicant for admission into nursery or entry level classes.

To ensure that schools don't adopt any arbitrary criteria, the Directorate of Education had last month issued a list of 50 disallowed criteria, including vegetarianism, social/noble cause, parents' education, declaration regarding picking or drop, first-come-first-get, non-alcoholic, non-smoker parent criteria. The DoE said these criteria were ""unfair, unreasonable and non-transparent"".

But several schools are openly allotting points on such criteria, flouting the guidelines. Mahavir Senior Model School for instance, is giving five points each to children of parents who are non-smokers, vegetarian and teetotalers. Darshan Academy in north Delhi has reserved 15 points to ""freelancers or original research/recognition received in the area or contribution, physical or professional work, (both pro-bono) through a registered NGO or freelancers.""

Some popular schools such as Tagore International School, East of Kailash and Vasant Vihar, Apeejay School in Saket and Pitampura, and Bloom Public School have separate points for areas covered by school transport. In its guidelines, the DoE had pointed out that declaration regarding picking or drop is ""illogical"" and it is the choice of the parents to opt for school transport or not. A senior DoE official said the criteria would be reviewed soon and action would be taken against schools flouting the norms.

""Schools are asking parents' designation, organisation name, PAN card details, annual income, etc... As per a high court order, such screening is banned even if points are not being given for these,"" said Sumit Vohra, founder of admissionsnursery.com, an online forum for parent community. He has sent a complaint to the DoE regarding schools making Aadhaar compulsory, which is against the SC orders."

Not surprisingly, private coaching institutions have started offering special classes to crack the Symbiosis entrance tests.

Though the admissions would be based on ranking in the all India entrance exam, the institute had promised to reserve 25% seats for students with Nagpur domicile. They would also be given 15% concession in fee.

TOI was the first to report about the premier institution's entry into Orange City, with NMC allocating 75-acre land at Wathoda in East Nagpur on December 29, 2016.

Symbiosis will start admitting students to four programmes from July 2019, when the first phase of its campus is completed. Symbiosis Pro Chancellor Vidya Yeravdekar confirmed this in a SMS reply.

Three of its institutes -- Symbiosis Institute of Business Management (SIBM), Symbiosis School of Law (SSL), and Symbiosis Institute of Planning, Architecture and Design -- would offer MBA, BBA, BBA-LLB, BALLB, and BArch degree courses. The institute has recently started recruitment of faculty members and non-teaching staff too. SIBM will have intake of 120 students while SSL will have 240 seats.

Students appearing in the entrance exams for the institute's flagship MBA and other courses next month would be able to opt for Nagpur as the study centre. Private coaching centres have been quick to exploit the opportunity, and started offering preparatory courses for students from the city and region.

Nihit Mor, who runs one such centre, said the response to Symbiosis's centre is huge. ""We are getting queries from a lot of parents, who were earlier reluctant to send their kids, especially girls, out of the city,"" he said.

Mor added that Symbiosis schools are among the best in the country and would offer world class education in Nagpur itself. ""Symbiosis BBA is among the top 3, and law among top 10 in the country. These are good options for Nagpur students, and they no longer need to leave the city for studies,"" he said, adding that the application process may start in January.

Experts feel aspirants must get their domicile ready since it will be the proof to claim the benefits offered by the private institute. However, they also added, parents and students need to understand that the Nagpur campus so far doesn't have 'deemed university' status, like other Symbiosis institutes."

A government order said the aim was to encourage parents to send children to anganwadi centres and enrol children in government schools as well as improve learning, speaking and writing skills.

Minister for School Education K.A. Sengottaiyan said earlier this year that the School Education department was keen on offering LKG and UKG classes for children across the State. The government order too stated that they recognised that the number of students in the age group of 4 to 5 years had been declining in anganwadis as parents had turned to private schools for quality education with infrastructure such as modernized buildings, uniforms.

Administrative approval was granted to 2,381 anganwadi centres, which have 52,933 children in government middle schools across the State, on a pilot basis for three years. While the School Education department will incur an expenditure of ₹610.57 lakh , the Social Welfare department will incur ₹162.75 lakh.

Under the Early Childhood Education programme, each anganwadi centre would be allotted ₹5,000, which will be used to meet expenses for educational kits, teaching and learning materials such as pencils and crayons.

The School Education department has been instructed to ask the extra teachers to conduct kindergarten classes. The government is also planning to conduct a baseline survey to study the learning outcomes and improvement in attendance among other indicators as part of the pilot implementation of these classes."

The Ministry of Women and Child Development has placed the draft policy on its website and invited comments from stakeholders until January 4. This will be the first policy dedicated to the protection of children, an area that until now was only a part of the broader National Child Policy, 2013.

The Supreme Court had earlier directed the CBI to investigate allegations involving 17 shelter homes for children, destitute women, beggars and senior citizens in Bihar following the case of sexual abuse of more than 30 girls in a shelter home in Muzaffarpur in the State. The apex court had also asked the Centre to consider framing a national policy on protection of children.

As per the draft, the policy will apply to ""all institutions, and organisations (including corporate and media houses), government or private sector"".

The draft policy recommends that all organisations must have a code of conduct based on ""zero tolerance of child abuse and exploitation"". It requires organisations to lay down that employees don't use language or behaviour that is ""inappropriate, harassing, abusive, sexually provocative, demeaning or culturally inappropriate"".

Institutions should also designate a staff member to ensure that procedures are in place to ensure the protection of children as well as to report any abuse. Any individual who suspects physical, sexual or emotional abuse must report it to the helpline number 1098, police or a child welfare committee.

Unlike the National Child Policy, 2013, the latest document doesn't talk about children who may need additional special protection measures: including those affected by migration, communal or sectarian violence, children forced into begging or in conflict with the law, and those infected with HIV/AIDS. It also doesn't talk about the role of the state for ensuring the protection of child rights or addressing local grievances.

""We welcome the decision to bring a national policy, but its subsequent versions will need to go into a greater detail,"" said Priti Mahara, Director (Policy, Advocacy and Research) CRY. ""The document needs to define what child protection is as well as what it means by institutions or organisations.""

Ms. Mahara added that the norms should be designed in such a way that organisations can customise their policies according to the nature of their work, thereby, giving them a sense of ownership on safeguarding children's rights.

""A policy has four aspects -- creating awareness, prevention, reporting and responding,"" said Prabhat Kumar, Technical Advisor, Child Protection, Save The Children. ""This document needs to go into all these aspects, especially a reporting structure involving various nodal bodies and a monitoring mechanism for implementation of the guidelines. Moreover, while it talks about organisations laying down a code of conduct, it doesn't explain what is acceptable behaviour such as conduct of teachers in schools,"" he observed.

Mr. Kumar suggested that the government could use the opportunity to go beyond the role of institutions and look at the role of individuals. ""Perhaps the government could look at ensuring that all officials in public service give an undertaking that they will not exploit children,"" Mr. Kumar said."

He also described Kashmere Gate as an ""incubation centre"" for universities, saying it is a coincidence that several varsities, which were based in the area, are now moving to bigger campuses.

""We had launched the 'happiness curriculum' in government schools. Now we will launch the entrepreneurship curriculum from the next session onwards for secondary and senior secondary students.

""We need to instill confidence among our children in school right from the beginning of secondary education that after completing their education, they should aspire to be job givers and not job seekers,"" Sisodia said.

He explained that after at least 15 years of formal education, if a large number of the youth are not confident of creating something new, which can give them gainful return and add value to the economy, then as a society ""we are failing to nurture their full potential"".

Sisodia said, barring a few exceptions, once a child completes elementary schooling and joins the secondary classes, his entire orientation, which is largely shaped by the teachers and parents, is to secure good marks in exams, get admission in a good college and get a job with decent pay package.

This is considered a trajectory of success and anyone who either secures less marks or fails to join college or fails to secure a job is deemed as unsuccessful, he said.

""This trajectory is obsolete in today's day and age when new ideas and technologies are driving our way of life. If our schools and colleges continue to churn out batches of students who are going to join the queue with the mindset of job seekers we will soon be left with very small number of job givers,"" Sisodia said.

He said the entrepreneurship curriculum will be for students of classes 9 to 12 with the vision that every child should have the confidence of being creator rather than just being a consumer.

""The curriculum shall be based on a four-fold framework-- inspire through stories and case studies of entrepreneurial journeys, educate through self designed micro research, involve through local community and facilitate by supporting in developing ideas into projects,"" said Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio.

To take this idea forward, he has directed the secretary education to set up a high-powered working group having senior faculties from SCERT/DIET, school principals and individuals having domain expertise as members.

""SCERT Delhi will organise a conference in January where it will invite organisations and individuals to present their ideas for the design of the entrepreneurship curriculum as per the framework of the government to a working group.

""Based on the inputs received, the pilot curriculum shall be rolled out from April 2019 onwards,"" Sisodia said.

He said they will try and ensure they take it to private schools as well.

In the convocation, as many as 1,161 students, comprising 504 undergraduates, 656 post graduates and one doctorate, were awarded degrees.

Thirty-eight chancellor gold medal, vice-chancellor gold medal and exemplary performance silver plaque were given to students across the years at the event.

Baijal congratulated the students and also suggested that entrepreneurs should be supported by the government when they start out.

'Metro man' E Sreedharan was the chief guest at the event. He said the future of the country lies in the hands of engineers and technocrats and not politicians.

The desire for globalization, urbanization, better education and employment opportunities is driving the ELT program. With the advent of the Internet, information and communication technology (ICT) tools are being used to provide learning content in digital form. Digital English learning consists of digital content and products that facilitate language learning through ICT tools.

The number of students entering graduate schools in English speaking countries has increased, making the biggest contribution to the growth of this market. In the tertiary education sector, universities in the United States, Australia, the UK and Canada are required to take the English Test (TOEFL), the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) and the International English Test System (IELTS). Students are required to enroll in a private English Language Institute (ELT) in order to earn excellent grades on this exam. These developments have increased demand for ELT in countries like India and China. The number of graduates who move to countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States for advanced research each year is increasing markedly. This increase in English learners will drive the growth of the global digital English learning market during the forecast period.

It is the largest public gathering and collective act of faith, anywhere in the world. The Mela draws tens of millions of pilgrims over the course of approximately 55 auspicious days to bathe at the sacred confluence of the Ganga, the Yamuna, and the mystical Sarasvati. Primarily, this congregation includes Ascetics, Saints, Sadhus, Sadhvis, Kalpvasis, and Pilgrims from all walks of life.

Kumbh Mela is a religious pilgrimage that is celebrated four times over a course of 12 years. The geographical location of Kumbh Mela spans over four locations in India and the Mela site keeps rotating between one of the four pilgrimage places on four sacred rivers as listed below:

Each site's celebration is based on a distinct set of astrological positions of the Sun, the Moon, and the Jupiter. The celebrations occur at the exact moment when these positions are fully occupied, as it is considered to be the holiest time in Hinduism.

Why in News? One of the most active volcanoes of Indonesia, Mount Soputan volcano, erupted recently. It is located on the Sulawesi island in Indonesia.

Background: Indonesia sit along the Ring of Fire region, an area where most of the world's volcanic eruptions occur. The Ring of Fire has seen a large amount of activity in recent days, but Indonesia has been hit hard due to its position on a large grid of tectonic plates.

Vulnerable: Indonesia is at the meeting point of three major continental plates - the Pacific, the Eurasian and the Indo-Australian plates - and the much smaller Philippine plate. As a result, several volcanoes on the Indonesian islands are prone to erupting, with Bali's Mt Agung taking the headlines last year and in 2018. Indonesia is home to roughly 400 volcanoes, out of which 127 are currently active, accounting for about a third of the world's active volcanoes.

The Ring of Fire is a Pacific region home to over 450 volcanoes, including three of the world's four most active volcanoes - Mount St. Helens in the USA, Mount Fuji in Japan and Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines. It is also sometimes called the circum-Pacific belt.

Around 90% of the world's earthquakes occur in the Ring of Fire, and 80% of the world's largest earthquakes. The 40,0000 kilometre horse-shoe-shaped ring loops from New Zealand to Chile, passing through the coasts of Asia and the Americas on the way.

It stretches along the Pacific Ocean coastlines, where the Pacific Plate grinds against other, smaller tectonic plates that form the Earth's crust - such as the Philippine Sea plate and the Cocos and Nazca Plates that line the edge of the Pacific Ocean.

The people most at risk from activity in the Ring of Fire are in the US west coast, Chile, Japan and island nations including the Solomon Islands. These areas are most at risk because they lie on so-called subduction zones - which are boundaries that mark the collision between two of the planet's tectonic plates.

The Ring of Fire is the result from subduction of oceanic tectonic plates beneath lighter continental plates. The area where these tectonic plates meet is called a subduction zone.

The world's deepest earthquakes happen in subduction zone areas as tectonic plates scrape against each other - and the Ring of Fire has the world's biggest concentration of subduction zones.

Sources: the hindu.

Mains Question: The greatest concentration of volcanoes is located in the Circum - Pacific region, known as 'Pacific Ring of Fire'. Examine why and also explain features of these volcanoes.

Context: Telangana TRS chief K Chandrasekhar Rao has called for an economic and political overhaul in India. KCR's pitch, like that of many regional leaders, is an increase in state autonomy by weakening the concurrent list.

The Constitution of India has provided for a division of powers between the Central and state governments. Under the Seventh Schedule, there are three lists - the Union, State and Concurrent.

Since 1950, the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution has seen a number of amendments. The Union List and Concurrent List have grown while subjects under the State List have gradually reduced.

The 42nd Amendment Act was perhaps one of the most controversial. Effected in 1976 during the Emergency by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, the amendment restructured the Seventh Schedule ensuring that State List subjects like education, forest, protection of wild animals and birds, administration of justice, and weights and measurements were transferred to the Concurrent List.

Former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister CN Annadurai was one of the first to advocate for state autonomy and federalism at the Centre. ""It will be sufficient if the Centre retains only such powers as are necessary for preserving the unity and integrity of the country, leaving adequate powers to the states,"" he said in 1967.

Taking his idea forward, the Tamil Nadu government under M Karunanidhi constituted the PV Rajamannar Committee to look into Centre-State relations. While the Committee submitted its reports in 1971, the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly adopted a resolution three years later demanding that the Centre accept the state's views on state autonomy and the recommendations of the Rajamannar Committee. The Rajamannar Committee spurred other states to voice their opposition to the Centre's encroachment on subjects that were historically under the state's purview.

PM Indira Gandhi had constituted the Sarkaria Commission to look into Centre-State relations. However, the recommendations of the Sarkaria Commission were not implemented by successive central governments.

Mains Question: Examine whether Article 246 is the cornerstone of centre state legislative relations? Discuss whether Concurrent list created confusion with respect to extent of legislative power of centre and states?

Context: over 12,000 women in the US have sued Johnson & Johnson over claims that the talcum powder manufactured by them is the prime cause behind their ovarian cancer. A recent investigation by Reuters claimed that the talcum powder was contaminated by carcinogenic asbestos, making it poisonous and life-threatening for women using it on themselves.

Talc is a mineral in clay mined from underground deposits. It's the softest mineral known to man and that makes it useful in a wide range of consumer and industrial products.

Asbestos is also found underground, and veins of it can often be found in talc deposits, leading to a risk of cross-contamination, geologists say.

Asbestos is a set of six naturally occurring silicate minerals, which all have in common their eponymous asbestiform habit: i.e., long (roughly 1:20 aspect ratio), thin fibrous crystals, with each visible fiber composed of millions of microscopic ""fibrils"" that can be released by abrasion and other processes.

They are commonly known by their colors, as blue asbestos, brown asbestos, white asbestos, and green asbestos.

Inhalation of asbestos fibers can cause serious and fatal illnesses including lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis (a type of pneumoconiosis).

Countries settled on most of the tricky elements of the ""rulebook"" for putting the 2015 Paris agreement into practice. This includes how governments will measure, report on and verify their emissions-cutting efforts, a key element because it ensures all countries are held to proper standards and will find it harder to wriggle out of their commitments. This global deal is meant for climate actions by all the countries across the globe post-2020.

The Katowice package includes guidelines that will operationalize the transparency framework. It sets out how countries will provide information about their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that describe their domestic climate actions. This information includes mitigation and adaptation measures as well as details of financial support for climate action in developing countries.

Besides transparency framework, the Katowice package also includes guidelines that relate to the process for establishing new targets on finance from 2025 onwards to follow-on from the current target of mobilizing $100 billion per year from 2020 to support developing countries.

It also includes how to conduct the Global Stocktake (GST) of the effectiveness of climate action in 2023 and how to assess progress on the development and transfer of technology.

The global rules are important to ensure that each tonne of emissions released into the atmosphere is accounted for. In this way, progress towards the emission limitation goals of the Paris Agreement can be accurately measured. Currently, climate actions of rich nations for pre-2020 period are being guided by the Kyoto Protocol.

There was a row over carbon credits, which are awarded to countries for their emissions-cutting efforts and their carbon sinks, such as forests, which absorb carbon. These credits count towards countries' emissions-cutting targets. Brazil, which hopes to benefit from its large rainforest cover, insisted on a new form of wording that critics said would allow double counting of credits, undermining the integrity of the system. This issue has been put off until next year.

Largely absent from these talks, which had a technical focus, was the key question of how countries will step up their targets on cutting emissions. On current targets, the world is set for 3C of warming from pre-industrial levels, which scientists say would be disastrous, resulting in droughts, floods, sea level rises and the decline of agricultural productivity.

The key deadline is 2020, when countries must show they have met targets set a decade ago for cutting their emissions, and when they must affirm new, much tougher targets.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the global body of the world's leading climate scientists, warned two months ago that allowing warming to reach 1.5C above pre-industrial levels would have grave consequences, including the die-off of coral reefs and devastation of many species.

If we extrapolate from the IPCC's findings, the world has little more than a decade to bring emissions under control and halve them, which would help to stabilise the climate.

After years in which the world's carbon emissions appeared to be stabilising, they are on the rise again. Coal use continues and oil is still the engine of much of the world's economy. Clean energy is coming on-stream at a faster rate than many predicted, and the costs of it have come down rapidly, but its adoption needs to be speeded up.

Infrastructure, such as energy generation plants, transport networks and buildings, is a central issue: infrastructure built now to rely on high-carbon energy effectively locks in high emissions for decades to come. Some people are also saying we need to invest in projects to remove carbon from the atmosphere.

The UN will meet again next year in Chile to thrash out the final elements of the Paris rulebook and begin work on future emissions targets. But the crunch conference will come in 2020, when countries must meet the deadline for their current emissions commitments and produce new targets for 2030 and beyond that go further towards meeting scientific advice.

That conference may be held in the UK or Italy, both of which have bid to be hosts. The UK's intention in offering to host is to signal it will retain its role on the world stage after Brexit. The event may also provide a welcome change from wranglings over Brexit and intractable trade deals.

Mains Question: The Rule book agreed to in COP 24, is not ambitious enough to prevent the dangerous effects of global warming. Critically analyze.

In the context of establishing quality residential schools for the promotion of education, Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRSs) for ST students are set up in States/UTs with provisioning of funds through ""Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution"".

The establishing of EMRSs is based on demand of the concerned States/UTs with availability of land as an essential attribute.

As per the budget 2018-19, every block with more than 50% ST population and at least 20,000 tribal persons will have an Eklavya Model Residential School by 2022.

EMRS is a Government of India scheme for model residential school for Indian tribals (Scheduled Tribes, ST) across India.

IMPRESS scheme has been launched to promote Social Science Research in the country

The Government has approved ""Revitalizing Infrastructure and Systems in Education by 2022"", accordingly the scope of institutions to be funded through Higher Education Financing Agency (HEFA) has been enlarged to encompass School Education and Medical Education institutions, apart from Higher Education.

The Government of India, in August 2018, had sanctioned the scheme ""Impactful Policy Research in Social Sciences (IMPRESS)"" at a total cost of Rs. 414 Cr for implementation up to 31.03.2021.

1500 research projects will be awarded for 2 years to support the social science research in the higher educational and to enable research to guide policy making.

Implementing Agency:

Indian Council of Social Science and Research (ICSSR)

Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR) was established in the year of 1969 by the Government of India to promote research in social sciences in the country.

Higher Education Financing Agency (HEFA) is a joint venture of MHRD Government of India and Canara Bank with an agreed equity participation in the ratio of 91% and 9% respectively. It is for financing creation of capital assets in premier educational institutions in India as part of rising 2022. HEFA's scope is greatly expanded to cover school education, educational institutes under Ministry of Health, etc.

HEFA is registered under Section 8 [Not-for-Profit] under the Companies Act 2013 as a Union Govt company and as Non-deposit taking NBFC (NBFC-ND-Type II) with RBI.

10 monuments adopted under the 'Adopt A Heritage' project

It is a collaborative effort by Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Culture and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), State/UTs Governments and envisages development and maintenance of tourist amenities at heritage sites and making them tourist friendly, to enhance tourism potential and cultural importance in a planned and phased manner.

The aim of the project is to provide basic amenities that include cleanliness, public conveniences, safe drinking water, ease of access for tourists, signages, illumination, Wi-fi etc.

Funding of the Project:

The project envisages involvement of Private/Public Companies/Organizations and Individuals to adopt Monuments, Natural Heritage Sites and other Tourist Sites, primarily under CSR. No fund is given by Ministry of Tourism.

Archaeological Survey of India has identified 100 monuments as ""Adarsh Smarak"" for upgradation of existing facilities/amenities like Wi-Fi, cafeteria, interpretation centre, brail signage, modern toilets etc.

The government school in her home town, Chopasni village, can now give competition to city schools after it was upgraded with help from donors. Chanchal and her elder sister Pratibha study in the village school now.

Several people from the village who shifted to Jodhpur city just to provide better education to their wards have returned to the village. Some private schools in the area have shut down due to shortage of students, say villagers. The Chopasni Government School is getting students from nearby villages, too, said block education officer Manohar Singh.

The school's transformation began in 2015 when an alumnus, Himmat Singh Ratnoo, became its principal. The school has recorded 100% results since then. The school has a projector room, computer labs, CCTV cameras, library and RO water facility.

""My first aim was to bring the children out of the inferiority complex of studying in a government school. Along with the villagers, I wrote a letter to ONGC and HPCL requesting help to construct two separate toilets for girls and boys as part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR). The school thus got two toilets that cost Rs 3.5 lakh each,"" said Ratnoo.

""Several girls who dropped out after a certain age due to lack of toilet facilities in school returned to study here,"" said Tima Ram Dhandhu, a villager.

""The next step was ensuring sufficient number of teachers. At present, there are 17 teachers in the school. I contacted several philanthropists and wrote letters to many others requesting financial assistance. The Rotary Club donated a projector and we raised over Rs 4 lakh to construct gated boundary walls and a prayer ground. Several others, including the village panchayat, contributed to construct classrooms in the school and install CCTV cameras,"" said Ratnoo.

Jay Narayan Gehlot, sarpanch of Chopasni village, said that the entire village made it a vision to give a good school to the children of the village. ""Having a school like this in a village like ours where the health facilities could not reach is an achievement. The entire village made it a vision to get better education facilities for our children. The panchayat collected money to make four new rooms in the school,"" said Gehlot.

Suresh Ratnoo, panchayat shayak, said he went door-to-door along with the teachers of the school explaining the developments in the school to the villages and motivating children, especially girls, to join the school. ""We told the people that the school has better education facilities and toilets. Now the number of girls and boys who study in the school is almost the same. From a single village we managed to bring 50-60 new students to join the school, ""said Suresh.

Sarla Ratnoo, a student of class 12, said: ""I can dream big now as I can continue with my education. Had the school been far away or without facilities, it would not have been possible.""

The school has a strength of more than 350 students and provides Identity cards and uniforms. ""CCTV cameras have been installed in the classes. The teachers and I keep watch over every activity in the school. We keep organising sports and other extra-curricular activities from time to time to give boost students' exposure,"" said the proud principal."
"402","1021142976","2018-12-18","https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/174-illegal-schools-in-noida-villages-but-no-action-against-them/story-eN7jMP2hbajB5zBdJ8MnsJ.html","174 illegal schools in Noida villages, but no action against them","Hindustan Times",FALSE,"Monday's mishap, in which two children were killed after a wall of a school collapsed, has brought to fore the lackadaisical attitude of the Noida authority, which has never acted against the owners of unauthorised unsafe buildings, which are being used for schools in villages, officials said.

There are 174 illegal private schools operational in villages without requisite approvals for the buildings, officials of education department in Gautam Budh Nagar district said.

The Uttar Pradesh government on April 23, 1976, had established the New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (Noida) and, according to the Master Plan 2021, the city is spread across 2,031 hectares, comprising 81 villages and 168 Sectors including residential, commercial and Industrial uses.

The Noida authority has the mandate to regulate buildings of all kinds, including schools, in urban and rural areas. It has the power to issue notices and seal illegal and unsafe buildings.

After the twin building collapse in Greater Noida's Shahberi, in July 2018, killed nine persons, the Noida authority had conducted a survey and identified illegal buildings in all villages.

On August 3, the Noida authority had identified 1,757 buildings, which were constructed without approvals.

""However, we did not count unsafe buildings, which are being used for schools in villages. The administration and education department should look into this issue,"" a Noida authority official, not authorised to speak to media, said.

Noida authority chief executive officer Alok Tandon and additional chief executive officer RK Mishra were unavailable for comment on the issue despite repeated attempts to reach them. The authority' officer on special duty, RK Singh, refused comment on the issue.

Over 70 of 174 illegal schools are operational in Noida villages, officials of education department said.

""We had acted against illegal schools in 2017 and over 85 were shut down then. We are taking necessary action in this regard and schools, which are illegal, will face tough legal action,"" BN Singh, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.

Officials of the district administration may also write to the Noida authority as to why it did not act against owners of buildings, where illegal schools are operational.

These illegal schools cater to over 1 lakh students. They do not have affiliations to the Uttar Pradesh state education board, the Central Board of Secondary Education or any other board. These schools mostly cater to the children of factory workers and daily age earners, who cannot afford to send their children to recognised private schools.

""Each school, on an average, accommodates over 1,000 students and the fee is in the range of ₹800 to ₹1,500 a month. All these schools are sheltered by the education department. These school buildings do not have any safety measure in place. Some schools have over 1,000 students studying in small and dinghy buildings that have no setback area or fire safety systems in place,"" a school teacher, requesting anonymity, said."

In a public statement, Marriott explained it received an alert from an internal security tool about an attempt to access the Starwood database on September 8, 2018. This prompted an investigation that exposed a history of unauthorized access to the Starwood network dating back to 2014. It is the second largest known data breach of consumer data on record and stands as a stark reminder of the importance of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy that is not only reactive, but also proactive and preventative.

The Marriott data breach affects approximately 500 million guests who are in the Starwood database because they made a reservation on or before September 10, 2018 at a Starwood property in any of the 129 countries and territories in which the company operates. For 327 million of those guests, the information accessed includes their name, passport number, date of birth, gender, phone number, mailing address and email address. For some, the information also includes payment card numbers and payment card expiration dates. While the payment card numbers were encrypted using an algorithm known as Advanced Encryption Standard encryption (AES-128), Marriott did not rule out the possibility they were decrypted by the hackers. For the remaining 173 million guests, the information accessed is limited to their name and, in some cases, other data such as mailing and email addresses.

Marriott has been widely criticized for the delay in detecting the security issues that led to the data breach and notifying consumers whose data was compromised. The company is now working with security experts to improve its security and phase out Starwood systems. While Marriott believes it is ""premature to estimate the financial impact"" to the company, many commentators believe there will be significant financial cost and reputational harm. By comparison, the Equifax Inc. cybersecurity breach in 2017, which affected 148 million people, caused a reported $400 million in recovery costs and Equifax ranked sixth on the Most Controversial Companies Report from RepRisk that year.

In the U.S., the offices of the Illinois, Maryland, New York and Pennsylvania attorneys general opened investigations into the breach and Marriott may also be subject to a number of other state attorney general investigations. These can lead to state enforcement actions resulting in significant fines under consumer protection statues, data breach notification standards and/or data security obligations. A class action lawsuit was also filed in the U.S. alleging Marriott failed to take appropriate measures to protect and secure the confidential and personal information of its consumers, which violated consumer protection statutes, constituted a breach of confidence and was reckless and grossly negligent. In Canada, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner contacted Marriott, but has not yet opened an investigation.

The Marriott data breach highlights the importance of a proactive and preventative approach to understanding a company's security risk profile and implementing a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, especially as consumers are calling for increased levels of digital security. On October 25, 2018, Ankura Consulting Group published a report, Information Security Trends that Maximize Competitive Advantage, which recommends the following:

1. Businesses need to be aware of and be honest about vulnerabilities and proactively monitor and enhance their information security.

2. Consider creating a program of continuous investment in information security and ensure a plan is in place to cope with unexpected data breaches.

3. New cybersecurity tools, many of which utilize machine learning, deep learning, and other forms of AI and ""info-safe"" cultures, are necessary to protect information held by companies. Utilizing information security measures that are free is a minimum safeguard.

4. Robust cyber risk insurance and a proactive crisis communications strategy help a business to cope in the event of a data breach.

5. Effective cybersecurity involves adopting an enterprise risk management methodology that encompasses not only technology but also the equally important people and policy aspects of cybersecurity.

While some of these recommendations require significant expenditure, others, such as employee cybersecurity awareness training are relatively inexpensive and easy to implement. Regardless, it is not enough to react to a cybersecurity threat, as this approach can result in increased exposure, greater recovery costs and reputational harm. A proactive and preventative approach is necessary, which includes evaluating business- and industry-specific threats and risk indicators, and creating a cybersecurity program that corresponds to a business's unique risk profile. This may include a combination of risk assessment, predictive analytics, risk mitigation and business continuity planning. Working with counsel who can highlight the relevant issues to be aware of and assist in preventing and addressing cybersecurity attacks in a highly efficient manner is very important.

A nationwide study carried out by by the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy has revealed a lot of praise and a certain degree of criticism expressed by urban Indians for government programmes. The data also shows that urban residents believe that it is the government's job to ensure the provision of basic amenities to them, reported Mint.

The study was a result of several multi-year Lok Foundation-Oxford University surveys in which more than 100,000 urban households participated.

It was found that almost as many urban children attend government schools as private ones, with half of all parents stating that they chose government schools due to greater affordability, while a third said it was because of their quality.

A greater number of households cited the quality reason in better-administered states such as Uttarakhand, Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, while in more backward states such as Jharkhand and Bihar, people cited affordability as the main reason.

A majority of urban Indians also stated that they would prefer going to a government hospital over a private one, in case of both a minor and a major ailment. The most cited reason was again affordability.

However, higher middle income and rich households were more likely to rely on private healthcare.

Three-Fourths of urban residents were also found to have a ration card, with 70 per cent stating that they used the cards to buy subsidised rice. Two-thirds of respondents said that they were satisfied with the functioning of the Public Distribution System (PDS).

Even when it came to employment, 60 per cent of households believed that it was the government's responsibility to fix the jobs crisis, and not the private sector's."

The disclosures by the Jesuit provinces of Maryland and USA Midwest are the latest chapters in the ongoing sexual abuse scandal roiling the Catholic Church and come after 153 Jesuits were publicly identified by two other provinces earlier this month.

Maryland released 24 names with allegations dating back to 1950 and USA Midwest released 65 names dating back to 1955. Many of the individuals are deceased, and some were previously publicly known to be accused of sexual assault.

""On behalf of the Midwest Jesuits, I apologise to victim-survivors and their families for the harm and suffering you have endured. Many of you have suffered in silence for decades,"" Brian Paulson, head of the province headquartered in Chicago, said in an open letter.

Jesuits form the largest male religious order in the Catholic Church, with around 16,000 members worldwide. They operate 30 colleges and 81 schools in the United States and Canada.

The names made public on Monday, 17 December included dozens of priests with multiple allegations of abuse who served in educational institutions.

The priest with the most recent allegations was Donald McGuire who died in federal prison in 2017 while serving a 25-year sentence. His was among the names that had been previously publicised.

Numerous men have accused McGuire of molesting them when they were boys. The first allegations dated to the 1950s, when he worked at a Jesuit private high school in Chicago, and went as late as 2005.

""Most of the Jesuits on our list entered religious life from the 1930s through the early 1960s. In retrospect, our evaluation of candidates, as well as the training, formation, and supervision of Jesuits was not adequate,"" Paulson said.

Paulson added that the organisation had learned from its mistakes, and has improved training for Jesuits and was holding them accountable if abuse allegations are made.

The latest revelations came as religious orders - which do not fall under the same church hierarchy as diocese - are starting to face similar scrutiny as the rest of the Catholic Church and embarking on efforts at transparency.

Earlier this month, provinces overseeing Jesuits in more than 20 western, southern and central US states released lists of 153 members accused of child sexual abuse.

As per a top government official, the speculations of an auction being held before the end of this fiscal year in March are to be dismissed. The announcement comes directly from Telecom Secretary Aruna Sundararajan, who has said, ""The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has given preliminary recommendations. However, the (5G) task force has given a broader set of spectrum bands. The Department of Telecom (DoT) is concurrently working on both."" She said on Monday that the telecom department would be in the condition to hold an auction in late 2019.

Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea Demand for Delayed Auctions

It is also worth noting that the DoT has not yet charted the schedule for the upcoming auction. Previously during the conversations with the DoT officials, they had remarked that a sale in the FY19 was rather unlikely since the industry remains burdened under huge debt and most of the companies remain cash-strained. The issues of revenues and profitability are one of the major ones in question right now. However, back in August the sector regulator, Trai had recommended the auction of 4G and 5G airwaves. Later to promote the sale of the airwaves, the regulator had cut down the price of the premium 700 MHz band by 43%, bringing it down to Rs 6,568 crore a unit and set Rs 492 crore per unit as the minimum rate for 5G.

It is also worth noting that there has been a clash of interests between the operators regarding the auction of the airwaves. While Reliance Jio wants the sale to happen at the latest and agrees the prices suggested by the Trai, the newly merged Vodafone Idea does not wish for any auction before the year 2020, on the other hand, Sunil Bharti Mittal led telco Bharti Airtel has taken middle ground and wants the 4G auction to happen at latest, with the 5G auction to be postponed for 2020.

In another related development, the telecom secretary has sought support from states in deploying telecom infrastructure at a massive rate so that the network can be increased by as much as three times by the year 2020.

Sundararajan said, ""We aim to increase from 18 lakh to 50 lakh base transceiver stations, and from 14 lakh kilometres of optic fibre cable to 55 lakh kilometres by 2022."" In a one of its kind workshop which saw participation from state governments, she highlighted that the ongoing BharatNet program aims to connect 2.5 lakh gram panchayats or village blocks and that it would not be possible without enough support from the states. With enough support, the government aims to achieve the target of $100 billion of investment along with the creation of four million new jobs. Not only this, but the project looks forward to $120 billion of additional revenue annually with the contribution of $670 billion to GDP. To put things into perspective, currently, only 10% of jobs are created with $20 billion of investment. In turn, this contributes to $30 billion to the government in revenue and $ 170 billion in contribution to the country's GDP.

BharatNet to Achieve Big Goals by 2022

The secy also urged the states to rationalise Right-of-Way (RoW) charges. Adding to her words, that to empower the BharatNet ambition, the centre would take help from private telecom operator and also public telecom companies. The centre is also going to sign MoUs with state governments to ensure custodianship of telecom infrastructure as well, the secretary remarked.

Sundararajan's statement read, ""We are telling states if they need dark fibre, they can be incentivised which will create a demand-based pull."" When asked about the deadline of the BharatNet project she said, ""Our effort is to do as much as possible by March 2019. Wi-Fi should be available in the next six months.""

Another fact which was revealed during the workshop was the department statistics, which highlighted that a lot of bandwidth had not been utilised by the states, although it is being provided for free to institutions like schools, healthcare centres, police stations and post offices. The project aims to empower 12.5 lakh such institutes with high-speed Internet access by April next year.

She added that BharatNet is the most extensive program and the government has diverted substantial funding for the project. However, if the states do not want it, then the people are going to be devoid of the services. She also added that the government aims to provide the services to every household in India by the year 2022. The secy said, ""It will be India's imperative to achieve Broadband for All, and India is uniquely placed to reap digital dividends.""

Telecom minister, Manoj Sinha also added his thoughts. He said, ""With accelerated efforts over the last two years, we have reached the halfway mark to connect 2.5 lakh gram panchayats."" He further added, ""Rs 20,000 crore worth mobile connectivity projects are underway in Northeast and Left-Wing Extremism (LWE) affected regions."""

While a similar project proposed earlier was shot down because of lack of funds, officials are hopeful that underprivileged students will finally be able to get their hands on this 'elite' technology, this time around.

According to officials in the civic body, the proposed virtual reality classroom will go beyond pairs of VR goggles and envisions a complete immersive environment. It is learnt that the VR setup proposed will also include chairs, state-of-the-earth goggles, headsets with motion tracking sensors and special interiors.

""Teachers will be able to ingrain concepts in students' minds easily with this technology,"" said a top corporation official, explaining experiencing how body parts work or seeing space in VR, would leave a lasting impression in students.

VR setups in the city, which are generally present in malls, are limited to gaming and cater to a very small section of society. ""We want to give students this modern technology even before private schools,"" said the official, claiming that the facility will be open to students from all corporation schools and can help broaden horizons.

Officials from the corporation's Education department, also expressed confidence in the proposal's potential to induce an affinity to technology. ""Students often think that engineering courses are just about coding.

The education department has also sanctioned Rs 10 crore as annual funds for the functioning of the board.

A government resolution issued on December 15 states that schools affiliated to the board will be named after former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. ""Branding of zilla parishad schools as international institutes was a priority because government schools require the right positioning. Private schools which wish to affiliate themselves to the board can continue to use their own brand identity,"" said Francis Joseph, head, development and strategy, MIEB. The board's logo and the new identity of the schools will be launched in the city on December 25 -- the birth anniversary of Vajpayee.

Last year, the government set up the MIEB with the intention to provide an international curriculum, which, over the past few years, has been a draw among private and English medium schools, to state-run schools. The curriculum is being developed at 13 zilla parishad schools and the board will hand out affiliations to 100 more for the next academic year.

The Lok Foundation-Oxford University large-scale, multi-year surveys, administered by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, covered more than 100,000 urban households.

Among other issues, a set of Lok Surveys conducted in the summer of 2016 asked respondents about their experiences in accessing government services.

Overall, nearly as many urban children go to private schools as those attending government schools, the survey showed. While half of the households said they send their children to a government school because it was more affordable, a third did so because it was of better quality.

In most better administered states -- Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, Delhi -- more people chose government schools because of their quality rather than affordability, while in the poorest states with least administrative capacity, including Bihar and Jharkhand, the lack of money dictates the 'choice' of school.

Given a choice, urban respondents were divided down the middle over whether they would prefer to send their children to a government school that charged less fees, or be given cash to subsidize tuition fees at a school of their choice. The poorest overwhelmingly preferred subsidized government schools, while the rich preferred cash subsidies.

The story was similar for health, although in this case, a majority of urban respondents said that they would go to a government hospital for both a minor and a major illness. Given a choice, a majority again said that they would choose a government hospital, and the most important reason was affordable healthcare.

In the case of higher middle income and rich respondents, a majority went to private hospitals or doctors.

When asked whether the government should improve state health facilities or give citizens a fixed amount of money to go to the hospital of their choosing, a large majority wanted better government hospitals.

Three out of every four urban respondents saying that they had a ration card (including those with above-poverty-line cards) that they could use to access the public distribution system (PDS). Nearly 70% said that they used it to purchase subsidized rice, and nearly half said that it made up a significant amount of their monthly food budgets. Despite the denouncement of the PDS as creaky and failing, over two in three said that they were satisfied with its functioning. Nearly as many people said that they preferred getting subsidized grain from the ration shops as those who said they would prefer cash instead (49% to 51%).

Respondents also believed that the government should be responsible for providing electricity and piped water, and despite shortcomings in the provision of the two, most did not agree with paying extra for longer hours of electricity or water.

Across age, location, caste, and class -- in fact, even more so for upper castes and the rich -- the first preference of respondents in terms of employment was a government job for themselves, confirming findings of other surveys.

Over 60% of urban respondents felt that the way to fix the issue of poor growth in jobs was for the government, and not private companies, to create more employment.

Yet, Indians might not always believe that government programmes have benefitted them to the extent that they might credit a state or national government for it. Despite a majority across states saying that they use government schools and hospitals and a large majority saying that they use the PDS, 45% said in the Lok Survey that immediately followed the 2014 election that no government programme had benefitted their family in the last year, or they did not know if any had.

Sometimes, the blame or credit for the scheme is laid at the wrong door. Following the 2014 election, 20% of respondents to Lokniti's nationally representative National Election Studies said that they had benefitted from the United Progressive Alliance's Mahatma Gandhi National Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), but over two out of three credited the local or state government for it. Over 20% benefitted from the National Rural Health Mission, but over half of them credited the state government for it.

Post-election analyses -- as during the last week -- abound with assertions that the presence or absence of ""development"" made all the difference. Yet, evidence for such claims remains weak. Before the 2014 Lo Sabha elections, urban respondents to the Lok Survey said economic growth would be the biggest issue influencing their voting choice (and another 13% cited changes in their personal income). After an election in which the incumbent was dislodged, however, more than half said that their financial situation was better than it was five years before.

Globally, too, the evidence on whether voters reward better government service provision is mixed.

In South Africa, a comprehensive study of post-apartheid service provision showed that voters did not systematically reward the African National Congress in constituencies where basic services reached or improved.

In Uganda, a government scheme to provide grants for skilled enterprises successfully raised employment and incomes, resulting in voters being able to free themselves from patronage systems. But this also made them more involved in opposition mobilization, research suggests."

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)'s ambitious plan to promote the use of bicycles in the city is all set to go off tracks as the civic body has diverted Rs 50 crore of the Rs 55 crore -- allocated for the development of basic infrastructure for it: bicycle tracks and stations -- to pay for water charges to the state irrigation department.

""The civic administration had proposed the diversion of Rs 50 crore, meant for bicycle infrastructure, to pay for the water charges demanded by the irrigation department,"" said Yogesh Mulick, chairperson of the standing committee. He said the irrigation department has demanded Rs 224.53 crore from the PMC as water charges as per the revised rates fixed by the Maharashtra Water Resource Regulatory Authority (MWRRA) for the water drawn by the civic body.

The civic administration proposed that it was possible to divert the Rs 50 crore meant for the cycle track project to pay for the water charges to the irrigation department. The PMC draws water from the Khadakwasla irrigation circle to meet the drinking water demand of the city. The irrigation department submits its bill on water charges every two months. In February 2018, the department submitted the rates for water based on consumption.

The civic body had made a budgetary provision of Rs 28.79 crore for paying the water charges in 2018-19 considering the revised rates. Thus, there is a shortage of funds to pay the water charges as per the revised rates and the dues of previous year. The irrigation department had allocated 11.5 TMC (thousand million cubic feet) for the city along with a 10 per cent rise as per need. Thus, the PMC was eligible to draw 12.65 TMC for the city. However, the MWRRA, during a hearing on water supply, fixed the quota at 8.16 TMC for the PMC.

The civic administration said the MWRRA decision was without considering the water consumption in two Cantonment Board areas, hospitals, schools, Race Course, railways and gram panchayats adjoining the city. The PMC draws 17 TMC water in a year and, with the

8.2 TMC fixed for the civic body, a large quantity of the remaining water is being charged as per the rates for increased consumption.

Accordingly, the irrigation department has demanded Rs 224.53 crore as water charges. The civic body had earlier paid Rs 65 crore to the irrigation department and has now sanctioned an additional Rs 50 crore by diverting funds meant for cycle track.

Bicycle plan

In December last year, the PMC general body approved the comprehensive bicycle master plan for the city to build 470 kms of cycle tracks, stands and introduce a public sharing of bicycles scheme.

The scheme

The PMC appointed private companies to start the public sharing of bicycles scheme by making available one lakh bicycles for use on rent. The scheme was first started by the Pune Smart City Development Corporation Ltd in Savitribai Phule Pune University and Aundh in January. It was also implemented on JM road, Magrapatta and agriculture college.

Cycle tracks

New cycle tracks were built by the PSCDCL in Aundh, Baner and Balewadi. However, the civic body has not been able to add to the cycle infrastructure."

2. Fresh BJP Plea On Bengal March

Calcutta High Court on Monday gave the BJP the liberty to move a fresh petition against the Bengal government for disallowing its proposed ganatantro banchao yatra (save democracy march) even as a public interest litigation was filed seeking a high court order to the administration against such programmes.

Justice Tapabrata Chakraborty allowed the BJP to file the petition when its lawyer Saptangshu Basu sought the court's nod to challenge the administration's denial of permission for the march.

The court also assured the BJP that it would hear the plea on Tuesday.

The BJP had initially called the procession rathyatra and later named it 'Save Democracy March'.

3. Oil-Water Combo Leads To Pile-Up On Bypass

At least a dozen bikers were injured and four cars piled up after a stretch of EM Bypass near Tagore Park turned slippery when oil and tar used to repair the stretch got mixed with the rainwater.

The oil and tar was applied on the road on Sunday as a base layer after portions of the road had disintegrated because of the ongoing Metro construction work. However, it had started raining within hours of the repair work on a section of the six-lane road. The oil mixed with water and turned a large stretch of the slippery. Bikers skidded and and drivers found it difficult to control the cars, leading to the pile-up.

6. Users Lose Money To E-Wallet Fraud

The city has seen a sudden spurt in e-wallet and banking app frauds, with the police in Kolkata and Bidhannagar receiving six such complaints in the past two weeks.

Most of the e-wallet and banking app frauds took place in the brief gap between payments being made and the money transferred to an account, said the police. Sometimes, after a payment has been made on the app, the money doesn't get transferred immediately due to technical reasons. But scared of losing their money to fraudsters, the users try to call up the customer care numbers. ""Many of these numbers they find online either lead them to fraudsters, or had been hacked into. A few minutes later, the victims usually receive calls and the accused pump out their banking details and siphon off money from their accounts,"" said an officer, adding Jharkhand gangs could be involved.

The application process for admissions to entry-level classes in over 1,600 private schools began on Saturday.

The Directorate of Education (DoE) has also advised parents to not approach these schools till the department issues further orders in case any penal action is initiated against schools found to be defaulting the new rules.

""In order to maintain transparency and uniformity in admission, the admission process of these 105 schools at entry level for session 2019-20 shall be on hold till further orders,"" a senior DoE official who was familiar with the matter said. ""If it is found that the said schools are taking admissions despite being prevented to do so, necessary action as per norms will be taken without any further notice,"" the official added.

The distance of student's residence from school, sibling quota, parents being alumni of the school, single child, first child are some of the criteria listed by schools for admissions to the entry-level classes. According to the schedule released by the DoE, the application window will be open from Saturday and the last date of submitting application forms for nursery class admission for 2019-20 session is January 7.

The first list of selected children, along with marks secured by them, will be out on February 4.

The second list will be out on February 21 and the nursery admission process will conclude on March 31.

Twenty-five per cent seats in pre-school, pre-primary and class 1 will be reserved for economically weaker sections EWS)/disadvantaged groups under the Right To Education Act. The directorate had instructed all private schools to upload their criteria -- with points for each criterion -- for admission in open seats, on its official website by December 14. There is, however, no clarity yet on the schedule of the EWS admissions.

The government has also set an upper age limit of less than four years to be eligible for nursery, less than five years for kindergarten, and less than six years for admission to class 1. The proposal for an upper age limit was challenged in the court last year. Though a Delhi High Court order last year had allowed the imposition of the upper age limit, the DoE had decided that the order will be applicable only from 2019 academic session. Apart from the abolished criteria, the schools have been given autonomy to come up with their own points system.

""I'm now able to comprehend difficult topics in subjects such as Maths quite easily. The visual elements and videos coupled with animation makes the learning experience a funny and interesting one,"" he says.

While students in Kerala are already accustomed to additional tuition and coaching classes post and prior to their school hours, the trend of using learning applications as an instrument for extra tuition is slowly spreading among school students, especially those in high school classes.

Education apps such as Meritnation, myCBSEguide or My Study Park that caters to CBSE, ICSE and state school students have turned into familiar household terms.

A section of these learning applications provide detailed lessons of subjects from classes IV to XII while certain apps help you prepare for competitive examinations such as CAT, GMAT, JEE and NEET.

Common features found in these education apps include short videos for explaining topics, sample questions and solved papers, guides and personal mentors to evaluate the performance of students. The use of these learning apps have undoubtedly witnessed a rise in the recent times.

""We started off nearly six months ago with a handful of users.

Trai has made a preliminary set of recommendations for 5G, which is under examination of the ministry, she said. But since the ecosystem is not ready, it (spectrum auction) will be only after July-August next year. ""The minister has given a timeline of 2020 for 5G rollout and it (5G rollout) will start at that time. But it doesn't mean the whole country will have 5G at one go,"" she said on the sidelines of a seminar on national digital communications policy (NDCP) vision of the telecom department. Sundararajan said 5G technology field trials have begun.

The task force referred by the secretary is the 5G steering committee, chaired by Stanford University's professor emeritus AJ Paulraj. The panel has made several recommendations to drive 5G adoptions in areas like spectrum policy, regulatory policy, standards and education to DoT.

Earlier, the telecom regulatory authority of India (Trai) had recommended auction of 8,644 MHz at an estimated base price of Rs 4.9 trillion, which included radio waves for 5G services.

The telecom ministry's panel on 5G has said 6,000 Mhz spectrum can be made available without delay for the next generation mobile service. Vodafone Idea, a key telecom player, said on Sunday that it has urged DoT to delay auction to as the 5G ecosystem is not ready and 4G optimisation will happen by then.

The July-August timeline is significant for telcos preparedness for the auction in view of the huge debt that the industry is reeling under. They blame it on pressure on their revenue and profitability due to heightened competition in the sector.

In August, Trai recommended auction of airwaves across seven 4G bands, besides 5G spectrum. The regulator slashed the base price of premium 700 MHz band by 43 per cent to Rs 6,568 crore a unit and also set Rs 492 crore per unit as the minimum rate for 5G.

Sundararajan also asked states to ensure full utilisation of the BharatNet infrastructure. ""But for few, most states have not been able to use them (the BharatNet Infra), so we are now bringing private players and some PSUs for WiFi services. After WiFi, utilisation will be ensured,"" she said.

The ministry will also sign MoUs with states to use the BharatNet connectivity and connect various development institutions. ""We are asking states if they want dark fibre, they can take it from BharatNet Infrastructure and market it. We will go for revenue-sharing with states to incentivise them. This idea is to create not just a supply push but also a demand pull for this infrastructure to raise its (BharatNet) utilization,"" she said.

The secretary asked states to rationalise levies for rights-of-way permission to telcos for laying fibres and setting up towers. ""If you levy 40-50 times the charges, how will the infrastructure be built,"" the secretary asked.

""We are preparing the country for 5G through aggressive fiberisation. To meet the need for large number of towers, as envisaged under the 5G roadmap, then we have to bring states on boards as the power to grant rights of ways for setting up towers are with states,"" she said. Sundararajan also said the government planned to raise optic fibre cable spread from 1.8 million km to 5.5 million km by 2022. On WiFi, she said, ""Our effort is to do as much as possible by March 2019 and Wi-Fi should be available in six months,"" Sundararajan said. She was responding to questions on BharatNet deadline, which is around the corner.

The event, also attended by states, was part of the government push to speed up BharatNet programme expansion that aims to connect 250,000 gram panchayats. It also aims to achieve $100 billion of investment, create 4 million jobs and with $120 billion of additional revenue contribute $670 billion to GDP, she said.

The names made public Monday included dozens of priests with multiple allegations of abuse who served in educational institutions.

The priest with the most recent allegations was Donald McGuire who died in federal prison in 2017 while serving a 25-year sentence. His was among the names that had been previously publicized.

Numerous men have accused McGuire of molesting them when they were boys. The first allegations dated to the 1950s, when he worked at a Jesuit private high school in Chicago, and went as late as 2005.

""Most of the Jesuits on our list entered religious life from the 1930's through the early 1960's. In retrospect, our evaluation of candidates, as well as the training, formation, and supervision of Jesuits was not adequate,"" Paulson said.

Paulson added that the organization had learned from its mistakes, and has improved training for Jesuits and was holding them accountable if abuse allegations are made.

The latest revelations came as religious orders -- which do not fall under the same church hierarchy as diocese -- are starting to face similar scrutiny as the rest of the Catholic Church and embarking on efforts at transparency.

Earlier this month, provinces overseeing Jesuits in more than 20 western, southern and central US states released lists of 153 members accused of child sexual abuse. (AFP) KUN"

At Ambit, we spend a lot of time reading articles that cover a wide gamut of topics, ranging from zeitgeist to futuristic, and encapsulate them in our weekly 'Ten Interesting Things' product. Some of the most fascinating topics covered this week are Management (Rocker's guide to management), MedTech (Using AI in diagnosing Cancer), Behaviour (National character stereotypes mirror language use), Technology (Robots controlled by paralysed people), Environment (Plasticphobia: Will going plastic-free harm the environment?) and Politics (When presidents were people) among others.

Here are the ten most interesting pieces that we read this week, ended December 14, 2018.

1) A rocker's guide to management [Source: 1843magazine.com]

Some interesting management lessons can be taken from the historic rock bands the world has seen. And this piece throws light on how some of the most famous bands in the world have managed to stick together over the years, while others broke apart. So, what's the most important thing? Finding the right combination of personalities pays off. As an investor, Garry Tan, co-founder of Posterous and Posthaven, says he probes the relationship between a start-up's founders as much as he does its business model. For him, the relationship needs to be deeper than the project.

Talking about Coldplay, they have been together for so many years. Why? Because they have a shared vision of success. All the band members get an equal cut even though Chris Martin is the lead. This democratic model depends on individual members believing that each has the group's interest at heart, not just their own. Coldplay knew they wanted to be the biggest band in the world; each member had the same clear-eyed ambition. Their equal income split works like equity shares: every partner has a direct interest in keeping the band together.

Marie-Louise von Franz, a psychoanalyst, wrote that ""whenever one is in a group...one has to draw a veil over a part of one's personality."" Gains from collaboration are traded off against self-expression. Occasionally, she said, it's the other way around: a group can become united in spirit and each individual expresses themselves more fully than they would be able to by themselves. A ""superpersonal harmony"" prevails. This rare condition, says von Franz, is what lies behind myths such as the Knights of King Arthur.

2) Powerful Predictors: Diagnosing Cancer in India using AI [Source: digital.hbs.edu]

In India, less than 10,000 pathologists have to service a population of 1.3 billion people. While the number of pathologists are too less, approximately 74,000 women die from cervical cancer every year, accounting for one-third of the burden of cervical cancer deaths globally. To take on this challenge, a company is using artificial intelligence (AI) to detect cervical cancer. The company here is Aindra Systems, founded by Adarsh Natarajan. Aindra is demonstrating how strategic use of automated technologies has the potential to democratize access to quality care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

Aindra's end-to-end diagnostic platform takes biological samples which are stained by an autostainer, converted into a digital image, and then analyzed by AI algorithms to differentiate between cancerous cells and healthy cells. This three-part process is done onsite at a clinic, eliminating the need for the tedious process of manual staining and the transport of large batches of samples to distant laboratories. As a result, patients are told if they have cancerous lesions within 1-2 hours instead of 5-6 weeks.

Aindra's platform makes a strong case for the use of AI to address global health challenges, but AI-assisted technologies require vast amounts of labeled, high-quality data to train the AI algorithm, data that doesn't exist in many low-resource environments. In the case of healthcare, poor quality data could lead to fatal outcomes. AI-powered cervical cancer detection, in combination with widespread human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, has the potential to prevent deaths from cervical cancer globally -- an historic achievement. Companies like Aindra could play a key role in reducing the burden of disease in populations with poor access to high quality care and set the stage for future entrepreneurs from LMICs to develop AI-assisted technologies using human-centered design.

3) What's next for marketplace start-ups [Source: andrewchen.co]

In this essay, Andrew Chen, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, talks about the future of marketplaces. This essay covers: 1) why services are still offline; 2) the history of service marketplace paradigms which include the listings era, the unbundled Craigslist era, the ""Uber for X"" era, and the managed marketplace era; 3) the future of service marketplaces; and 4) the future opportunities.

Over the years, the buying habits have changed. From physical stores to online, people have started shopping online. These ecommerce shopping portals account for trillions of dollars in market capitalization. The next era will do the same to the $9.7 trillion US consumer service economy, through discontinuous innovations in AI and automation, new marketplace paradigms, and overcoming regulatory capture.

In the next 20 years, there'll be immense opportunities where technological, operational and regulatory hurdles persist. The services sector represents two-thirds of US consumer spending and employs 80% of the workforce. The companies that reinvent various service categories can improve both consumers' and professionals' lives-by creating more jobs and income, providing more flexible work arrangements, and improving consumer access and lowering cost.

4) In conversation with...Françoise Barré-Sinoussi [Source: mosaicscience]

In this conversation, Françoise Barré-Sinoussi reveals how she identified HIV as the cause of AIDS, and also talks about her receipt of the Nobel Prize, and the latest efforts to prevent, treat and manage HIV. When Françoise Barré-Sinoussi, along with her colleague Luc Montagnier, found the virus that causes the disease, it proved monumental, a boulder thrown into a lake whose ripples still fan out today. It proved critical too, transforming our understanding of AIDS as it bulldozed through country after country, bringing blindness and pneumonia and death like a grim huckster.

Effective treatment might have been developed in 1996, but three things prevented Barré-Sinoussi from giving up her fight against the disease: the lack of availability of antiretrovirals - of today's 35 million sufferers, only about a third receive treatment; the limitations of the treatment, which can cause a kaleidoscope of side effects; and the galloping rise in the number of infections. Barré-Sinoussi is ""concerned"" about young people, who are ""too relaxed"" about HIV because ""the education campaigns are not sufficient...there is not enough information"". A 2013 survey in Scotland found one in ten pupils think HIV can be transmitted through kissing.

Since 2008, when the first known case of an HIV patient being 'cured' was reported, dubbed the 'Berlin patient', a growing wave of stories have appeared citing research from around the world on what could lead to a cure. But scientists largely prefer the term 'functional cure' (Barré-Sinoussi favours 'remission' or 'sustained remission'), using it to describe a scenario in which a sufferer no longer needs antiretroviral therapy (ART) but his or her body is not wholly free from HIV. When asked whether functional cure will be available, she says, ""Maybe we will have a treatment that will be effective not for all but for some."" Also, on getting a complete cure, she says even she is doesn't know when that will happen.

5) National character stereotypes mirror language use: A study of Canadian and American tweets [Source: journals.plos.org]

Stereotypes about national character, i.e., individually held beliefs regarding psychological traits of world nations and cultures, are ubiquitous, stable and influential. The importance of these beliefs for the functioning of individuals, groups and societies is hard to overestimate. National character stereotypes, or beliefs about the personality characteristics of the members of a nation, present a paradox. Such stereotypes have been argued to not be grounded in the actual personality traits of members of nations, yet they are also prolific and reliable.

Stereotypes of Canadians and Americans exemplify the paradox; people in both nations strongly believe that the personality profiles of typical Canadians and Americans diverge, yet aggregated self-reports of personality profiles of Canadians and Americans show no reliable differences. The linguistic behaviour of nations mirrors national character stereotypes. A study conducted by using 40 million tweets from the microblogging platform Twitter quantified the words and emojis diagnostic of Canadians and Americans. Another study explored the positivity of national language use.

In other studies, the 120 most nationally diagnostic words and emojis of each nation are presented to naive participants. They are then asked to assess personality of a hypothetical person who uses either diagnostically Canadian or American words and emojis. Personality profiles derived from the diagnostic words of each nation bear close resemblance to national character stereotypes.

6) Why are Indian managers so damn good? [Source: qz.com]

The co-authors of Made-in-India Managers, R Gopalakrishnan and Ranjan Banerjee, discuss why some of the Indian-born global corporate leaders are successful. Leaders like Satya Nadella (Microsoft), Indra Nooyi (formerly PepsiCo), Sundar Pichai (Google), Shantanu Narayen (Adobe), and Nitin Nohria (Harvard Business School) have had a significant component of their early upbringing, living experiences, and education in India. According to the authors, they are ""made-in-India managers.""

After studying these leaders and others who were in leadership positions in global organisations across the world, the authors got an answer to their question; How did being 'made-in-India' help you get where you are today? The experience of growing up in India had shaped them positively in fundamental ways. There were basically four features that made them stand apart.

Competitive intensity: the authors conducted informal focus group to understand their perceptions of management education in India. One of the consistent themes that emerged through the interviews was their perception of Indian students as industrious and diligent. India's foremost business school, IIM Ahmedabad, admits one student for every 400 applications. Diversity and inclusion: This comes to save them when adjusting to a different or a variety of cultural environments. Such exposure begins early in life. It is not unusual in school to share lunch with people from different states -- a vast variety of cuisine is shared, understood, and appreciated.

Dealing with ambiguity: Indians learn to deal with a lot of things that are uncertain, and develop the ability to quickly assess situations and help themselves without waiting for the system to help them. Family values: The percentage of India-made leaders citing a family member as an influential role model is significantly higher than for their Western counterparts. The formative role of the family in shaping values through demonstration, stressing the value of education, and proving an ""always there"" support provides a strong value core that builds resilience. The strengths of the made-in-India manager emerge from the coming together of multiple, interlinked features with the ability to ""think in English.""

7) Cafe opens in Tokyo staffed by robots controlled by paralysed people [Source: soranews24.com]

Who said robots and humans can't live together? On 26 November, a ribbon cutting ceremony was held in the Nippon Foundation Building in Akasaka, Tokyo for a very special kind of cafe. Called Dawn ver.β, this café is staffed entirely with robot waiters. So what's new? Most of the places have robots. While this café's waiters' are robots, these robots are controlled by paralysed people.

Developed by Ory, a start-up that specializes in robotics for disabled people, the OriHime-D is a 120cm (4-foot) tall robot that can be operated remotely from a paralysed person's home. Even if the operator only has control of their eyes, they can command OriHime-D to move, look around, speak with people, and handle objects. Created in collaboration between Ory, NPO Nippon Foundation, and airline ANA, Dawn ver.β is designed to resemble the titular cafe from the 2008 anime Time of Eve, which is also contributing to the project.

During this time a staff of ten people, with conditions such as ALS or spinal cord injuries and working from home, are paid 1,000 yen (US$8.80) an hour (a standard wage for part-time work in Japan) to serve up coffee and interact with the clientele. But more importantly than money, these people are also given a newfound independence. In an age where people are afraid of robots taking all the jobs, it's nice to see an instance of robots giving people jobs for a change, especially in such a meaningful way.

8) Plasticphobia: Will going plastic-free harm the environment? [Source: BBC Radio ]

In this podcast, Tom Heaps, Rural Affairs Correspondent of BBC News, and a United Kingdom television and radio reporter and presenter, talks to several experts on plastic and its effects on our lives. The idea of plastic saving nature feels like environmental blasphemy today with its near universal polluting presence. We are all encouraged to live plastic-free, but does this put the interest of the planet first? Or are we at danger of damaging environmental side effects?

Most of the things that we use in our daily lives are made out of plastic. Be it spoon, bottles, earphones, mobiles, kitchen accessories, office accessories, etc. In UK alone, there are around 13bn plastic bottles used for water and soft drinks. Also, we are irresponsible in disposing these plastics. It's said that by 2020 all our plastic would be home compostable. Susan Lambert, curator of the Arts University, Bournemouth, feels that plastics are water-saving, land-sparing, etc. Tom Heaps also visited a plant where the company made plastics from plants. CEO of Biome Technologies, Paul Mines, says that they use plants to make bioplastics. And these bioplastics are used in making plastic materials like cups, bags, etc.

But one question that needs an answer is whether it is harmful for the environment? As these are made from plants, wouldn't it harm the nature? Mr. Mines says that these bioplastics are compostable within 3 months compared to years that it takes for a normal plastic bottle. While compostable plastic is one option, the other one is recycling. Steve Mahon from Armstrong Energy feels that we can turn all the plastics that are burnt or dumped into oil again. Armstrong Energy is making oils from plastics. So they are taking it back to its original form.

9) 'An education arms race': Inside the ultra-competitive world of private tutoring [Source: the Guardian] Every parent wants their offspring to be a master at whatever they plan to do in their careers. And to make that possible, they'll work day and night so that they can afford the best education for their kids. You can gauge this by the number of students being dropped at the Explore Learning tuition centre for extra maths and English coaching. The Bradford branch of Explore Learning is a tiny window into Britain's booming private tuition sector, now worth an estimated £2bn. Founded in 2001 by Bill Mills, a Cambridge maths graduate, the business now has 139 centres around the country (plus five in Texas run by a sister company). They are located mainly in shopping centres, so busy parents can get on with their weekly shop while their offspring perfect their times tables, punctuation and grammar.

The families who use the centre come from various walks of life. Some parents have their own businesses; others work at Bradford Royal Infirmary. There are families from Latvia, Poland and the Philippines. The parents talk about giving their children ""an edge"", the ""leg up"" they never had. Geoff Clayton, a retired garage worker, has been bringing his 10-year-old grandson, Brooklyn, to Explore Learning for about nine months. Brooklyn lives with his grandparents and likes football, Minecraft and maths. ""He's done really well,"" says Clayton. ""His reading has got a lot better, everything's got better."" The membership takes a significant chunk out of his pension, but he is happy to pay it to give Brooklyn ""a bit of a leg up"".

Initiatives aimed at making tuition more accessible already exist: some agencies pledge a proportion of their tuition to poorer pupils for free, while non-profit programmes such as the Tutor Trust connect tutors with disadvantaged schools. Explore Learning offers ""scholarships"" that give a 50% discount to parents on income support or jobseeker's allowance.

Some parents buy extra tuition to support children with special educational needs such as dyslexia, which mainstream schools are increasingly unable to meet. One mother from Nigeria said she sought extra support for her child as a practical response to racial discrimination: ""Any child from a minority has to be many times better than their white counterparts to be able to get into the top schools and universities."" But, not everyone is positive about the impact of tuition. ""It can cause students to not work in lessons,"" said one teacher. Another said: ""The need for tutoring frightens me. Schools should be able to offer students the support they need in class sizes that are manageable.""

10) When presidents were people [Source: the Atlantic ]

In this digital age, people are so exposed to fake news that they fail to differentiate between what's real and what's fake. This article, and Richard Ben Cramer's book 'What it Takes', shows how the era of politicians like George H. W. Bush and Donald Trump have seen dramatic change. Mr. Bush showed himself to people and was human-like, emoting genuine feelings. He didn't shield stuff that made him human from the people who covered him.

More so in those times a person's word mattered (since people were overall less about faking it). The spurts of doubt didn't matter, Mr. Cramer writes: Nixon had told Bush, to his face, that he was innocent, and for Bush, that was that. ""That was what he had to give, that was the measure of loyalty -- and the requirement of the code: personal commitment,"" Cramer writes. But, today's fast-paced life, era of reading headlines and low ""real"" interactions have made us judge, jury and executioner quick to write off things/people at a moment's notice.

In the Donald Trump era, where cries of ""fake news"" abound and the president views the media as the enemy, it's hard to imagine a resurgence of such access to politicians as people. A politician today is much more robotic, hence becoming less empathetic and way more rehearsed (can be read as fake) and everyone (not just politicians) is moving towards this. This is now becoming innate and something like-lie about your feeling and actions enough and that might just become the new normal or acceptable feeling (less human perhaps)."

""Vaping is reversing hard-fought declines in the number of adolescents who use nicotine,"" said lead author Richard Miech, from the university's Institute for Social Research. ""These results suggest that vaping is leading youth into nicotine use and nicotine addiction, not away from it,"" Miech added. Vaping Trend Rises in US As Drug and Opioid Use Declines; Here's Why It's Still A Bad News.

The annual Monitoring the Future survey, by a team of researchers at the University of Michigan, showed that the increases in adolescent vaping from 2017 to 2018 have been the highest ever in the past 43 years for any substance use in the US. The percentage of Class 12 grade students who reported use of nicotine in the past 30 days significantly increased to 28.5 in 2018 from 23.7 in 2017.

Nicotine use is indicated by any use of cigarettes, large cigars, flavoured or regular small cigars, hookah, smokeless tobacco, or a vaping device with nicotine. Marijuana vaping also increased in 2018 -- 13.1 per cent for 12th graders, up from 9.5 per cent last year. ""Vaping is making substantial inroads among adolescents, no matter the substance vaped,"" said Miech, adding ""In 2018 we saw substantial increases in vaping across all substances, including nicotine, marijuana, and adolescents who reported vaping 'just flavouring.' Quit Smoking: 5 Steps To Deal with Nicotine Withdrawal.

The survey showed that factors that make vaping so attractive to youth include its novelty and the easy concealability of the latest vaping devices, which better allows youth to vape without adults knowing about it. ""If we want to prevent youth from using drugs, including nicotine, vaping will warrant special attention in terms of policy, education campaigns, and prevention programs in the coming years,"" Miech suggested.

The study covered 44,482 students from 392 public and private schools in the US.

""These results suggest that vaping is leading youth into nicotine use and nicotine addiction, not away from it,"" Miech added.

The annual Monitoring the Future survey, by a team of researchers at the University of Michigan, showed that the increases in adolescent vaping from 2017 to 2018 have been the highest ever in the past 43 years for any substance use in the US.

The percentage of Class 12 grade students who reported use of nicotine in the past 30 days significantly increased to 28.5 in 2018 from 23.7 in 2017.

Nicotine use is indicated by any use of cigarettes, large cigars, flavoured or regular small cigars, hookah, smokeless tobacco, or a vaping device with nicotine.

Marijuana vaping also increased in 2018 -- 13.1 per cent for 12th graders, up from 9.5 per cent last year.

""Vaping is making substantial inroads among adolescents, no matter the substance vaped,"" said Miech, adding ""In 2018 we saw substantial increases in vaping across all substances, including nicotine, marijuana, and adolescents who reported vaping 'just flavouring.'

The survey showed that factors that make vaping so attractive to youth include its novelty and the easy concealability of the latest vaping devices, which better allows youth to vape without adults knowing about it.

""If we want to prevent youth from using drugs, including nicotine, vaping will warrant special attention in terms of policy, education campaigns, and prevention programs in the coming years,"" Miech suggested.

The study covered 44,482 students from 392 public and private schools in the US.

Interestingly, regular tobacco use remained at its lowest point with only 3.6 per cent of high school seniors smoking daily, compared to 22.4 per cent two decades ago.

Use of prescription opioids and tranquilisers also declined in 2018. Other illicit drugs, including cocaine, synthetic cannabinoids, and MDMA as well as alcohol also remained at historic lows.

But that myth didn't last for too long as people started hating vapers for being pretentious. However, a new study shows that vaping may still be popular among US teens despite some of the negative perception surrounding it. Only last month, a study conducted by the 2018 National Youth Tobacco Survey, released by the Food and Drug Administration, revealed that vaping has reached epidemic proportions in the US. Now, a new report by the Institute for Social Research says that vaping among American teenagers continue to increase. But on the bright side, the use of drugs and other opioids has reduced in comparison. The report is based on an annual survey of drug and alcohol among eighth, 10th and 12th graders in the US. A total of 44, 428 students from 392 public and private schools across the country were studied. The study showed that vaping was the second commonest form of substance abuse after drinking.

Vaping is the practice of inhaling vapours of nicotine through an e-cigarette. Unlike tobacco smoking, vaping doesn't involve the same health hazards and is considered somewhat safe.

A vaping device comprises a mouthpiece, a battery, cartridges filled with vaping liquid. When the device is switched on, the cartridges containing the liquid are exposed to heat, creating vapours or aerosols, which are then inhaled.

According to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, there has been a 78 percent increase in vaping among the youth between 2017 and 2018. The FDA has also said that vaping has reached epidemic proportions.

While it's called a safer alternative to smoking, vaping does have its share of side effects. A small-scale experimental study by Professor David Thickett from the University of Birmingham showed that vaping could be damaging the human immune system. The study was published in Thorax, which said that the practice could be damaging vital immune cells. Is JUUL Safe?

A study published in April says that the flavouring agents or chemicals used in vaping liquids could be increasing free radicals and toxins that cause cancer. The damage can vary depending on the flavour. US FDA Seeks Ban on Flavoured E-Cigarettes As Teen Vaping Increases.

A team of researchers from the New York University School of Medicine also found that vaping could be dangerous and should not be promoted as a safer alternative to smoking. E-cigarette smokers also have a higher risk than non-smokers to develop lung and bladder cancer, and heart diseases, despite the myths surrounding vaping.

It's encouraging to know that drug and alcohol use is decreasing among the teenagers, but the growing trend of vaping among the same age group could be troublesome for the above reasons.

Part of the popularity of vaping could stem from the fact that it's promoted as a safer alternative and the notion that vaping could be good for health. Popular culture has also promoted vaping as a ""cool"" habit, which has led to its immense popularity among the said age group.

The USB-shaped vape pen can also be used discreetly without causing any suspicion. The flavours also add to the appeal among the youth. One way to control the hazards among the youth is to implement regulation of tobacco products by the FDA."

Only 757 offenders were fined for smoking in public places in Bhubaneswar till October this year. The enforcement drive, however, yielded better results in Cuttack with the police having penalized 3,930 offenders in the first 10 months.

The Cotpa, 2003 prohibits smoking in public places like hospitals, busy markets, buses, railway stations, bars, hotels, offices (government and private), auditoriums and theatres among others. The Act also prohibits the sale of tobacco products to minors. The violation of the norms attracts a penalty of up to Rs 200. The state government imposed a ban on the manufacture, sale and use of tobacco in 2013.

In Bhubaneswar, the police penalized 118 persons in August. January and October are the only two other months where the number of offenders, penalized by the police, crossed a little over 100. The police have collected Rs 76,750 as fine from 757 violators till October this year. Interestingly, the enforcement drive was largely carried out near shops that sold cigarettes. The police hardly inspected premises of hospitals, bars, hotels and offices.

Cuttack, however, put up an impressive enforcement data. On any given day, the police penalized at least 400 persons. The police have so far collected Rs 3.37 lakh as fine from 3,930 offenders till October in Cuttack.

""I shall examine the exact cause of the low enforcement rate in Bhubaneswar compared to Cuttack. We will intensify the drive against people, who smoke in public places. Police stations will be asked to strictly implement the Cotpa norms,"" deputy commissioner of police Anup Kumar Sahoo said.

In 2017, the police had penalized 1,490 persons under Cotpa in Bhubaneswar and collected nearly Rs 1.53 lakh as fine. In Cuttack, altogether 5,046 persons were fined and nearly Rs 4.5 lakh fine was collected last year.

Experts slammed the police for the poor enforcement of the Cotpa rules. ""We expect the police to show the same amount of seriousness in implementing the Cotpa norms just as they do in case of traffic rules. It should not be limited to sloganeering and taking out rallies on 'World No Tobacco Day'.

As per the reports, the universities manipulated test scores for more than a decade to ensure more men became doctors. Officials said it was because female applicants tended to perform better in the interview part of the assessment since ""women mature faster mentally than men.""

As reported by Business Insider, the private Juntendo University in Tokyo told a Monday press conference that it set lower pass marks for men in its entrance exams, which included an interview.

Women make up 21% of all Japan's doctors, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare said in 2016. That is the lowest proportion of female-to-male doctors among all 36 countries in the the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the non-profit Nippon Communication Foundation said.

Juntendo University representatives said this was because female candidates tended to perform better in interviews, so the rigging was a ""measure to help"" their male counterparts.

In August, investigators found that Tokyo Medical University, one of Japan's top medical schools, systematically altered admissions test scores to make sure women wouldn't get in.

The university marked down female applicants' scores to keep their numbers below 30% of the student body, the report found.

Officials on Monday said that it would accept 48 people from that batch - of which 47 were women - from 2019 onwards, and refund the entrance test fees for the remaining 117, the Japan Times reported."
"444","1020394193","2018-12-17","https://yourstory.com/2018/12/clean-energy-startups-village/","What clean energy startups are doing to ensure every home, business and farm in Indian villages is electrified","YourStory.com",FALSE,"As of April 28, 2018, India's villages were said to be 100-percent electrified. But what does that really mean? Some startups have taken on the mandate to make it a ground reality through their clean energy products.

The Indian government had set its sight on 100 percent electrification of villages and held it is a key achievement. In April, Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted, ""28th April 2018 will be remembered as a historic day in the development journey of India. Yesterday, we fulfilled a commitment due to which the lives of several Indians will be transformed forever! I am delighted that every single village of India now has access to electricity.""

The Ministry of Power maintains that village electrification targets under the 'Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojna' (DDUGJY) have been achieved well before time. While the scheme mandates electrification of at least 10 percent of the households in a village for it to be tagged as a success project, the Central government said that electrification level in rural areas is more than 82 percent ranging from 47 to 100 percent across various States.

Political rhetoric aside, is that the ground reality? Piyush Jain, Co-founder of ONergy, maintains that 100-percent electrification of villages is still a dream. ""You continue to have villages where power remains inaccessible. And even if a village has access to power, it is fleeting in nature.""

Piyush's ONergy, a renewable energy venture, is presently on a mission to ""light up"" rural villages, and over the past eight years, it has completed multiple solar rooftop projects with a combined power capacity of 10MW, has solarised over 300 institutions including schools, installed over 250 solar micro-grids, 5,000 solar street lights and has sold over 500 solar irrigation pumps.

Recognising the variation in the level of electrification across various regions and states, the government launched the 'Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana'- Saubhagya to achieve universal household electrification by the end of December 2018. Aiding the government's effort in this mission is the 'The Energy Access India' (EAI) programme - funded by United States Agency for International Development, and implemented by the Miller Center for Social Entrepreneurship and New Ventures India - which works with multiple startups, including Aga Khan Foundation, Grassroots & Rural Innovative Development Private Limited, ONergy, and Oorja Development Solutions.

""We wanted to address the constraints faced by clean energy enterprises that are serving the base-of-the-pyramid population; people who earn less than $3,000 (around Rs 2.15 lakh) per year, through commercially viable business models. We prioritised working on those states that faced the greatest challenge in accessing energy,"" Andrew Lieberman, Senior Director at the Miller Center for Social Entrepreneurship, says.

India accounts for a third of the entire global population that lacks access to electricity. According to a report by The Climate Group, there are 300 million Indians who lack access to electricity, and another 100 million have access to less than four hours per day.

""Our definition of electrification of a village is different from the government's. Access to energy is not binary in nature -- households do not move from lack of access to energy to having access in one step. Access to energy needs to be reliable. Complete electrification cannot be you having power for less than four hours a day or no power for many days all together,"" Andrew explains.

Since the presence of infrastructure alone is not equivalent to actual access to energy, the EAI's aim is to increase access to clean energy for low-income communities who primarily lived in rural pockets by providing accessible energy infrastructure at homes, businesses, and fields. Hence, the programme worked with startups who advocated for off-grid solutions.

""Every family, every community has varied needs and they access energy differently. A farmer's requirement is different from a household or that of a small business,"" Piyush adds.

The lack of access to energy resources, according to a report by World Resources Institute and International Finance Corporation, has forced villages to rely on informal markets where, often, they end up paying more money. Hence, the select startups were tasked to create commercially viable, and scalable access to energy.

One of the key challenges faced by startups was the lack of consumer willingness to pay for access to power due to the subsidies offered by the Government of India. The government's commitment to provide financial support for 2.75 million solar pumps in both on- and off-grid areas not only undermined the markets by reducing consumers' willingness to pay, but also led to delay in their decision to adopt newer technologies.

""Distributed solar power hasn't scaled up in rural India for two reasons: first, because the upfront costs are too high, and second, because traditional lenders are uncomfortable underwriting the technology and consumer payment risks,"" says Paul Needham, Cofounder of Simpa Networks.

While Simpa Networks initially provided only solar home systems, in 2013, to increase their reach and profit margin, the clean energy startup began to develop a consumer financing facility to enable customers to pay for these systems, along with a catalogue of household appliances. In the process of developing this business model, Simpa became an expert in understanding local customer requirements. They began to develop packages of technology that meet the needs of rural India and positioned themselves as a leading distributor of household appliances to the last mile across the country, regardless of how individual households access energy.

Instead of selling products that consumers in rural and semi-rural areas cannot afford, Simpa Networks starts by selling the services of the products through a pay-as-you-go system.

Paul explains: ""After the completion of an 18-month contract, the system unlocks permanently, ownership is transferred to the customer, and the system provides electricity free and clear.""

Mlinda, the Kolkata-based international startup, designs, installs, operates, and maintains solar microgrids for rural communities in Jharkhand. These microgrids are capable of providing 24x7, three-phase electricity that can power productive loads. They act as an engagement platform to work with the communities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote environmentally positive forms of production and consumption, and improve energy efficiency and the gross domestic product of each village. The startup also works to develop special skills in-house to educate communities and create market linkages. It helps communities produce and market value-added products such as organic rice and mustard oil.

To realise the target of 100GW of off-grid and grid-connected solar energy by 2022 the Government of India requires a funding of $100 billion.

""The total energy access investment opportunity in India may be as high as $48 billion a year by 2030. The availability of funding is a key challenge not just for clean energy entrepreneurs in India, but also for investors that wish to support them,"" says Colm Fay, from University of Michigan and co-author of Closing the Circuit: Accelerating Clean Energy Investment in India report.

While investment in off-grid energy enterprises is growing globally -- annual investment increased from $18 million in 2013 to $284 million in 2017 -- the percentage of off-grid investments in Asia has declined dramatically from 31 percent to less than one percent during the same period. The reasons for the slowdown is attributed to the aggressive grid expansion policies that pose a threat to commercial viability of off-grid business models.

Hence, Colm recommends startups to frame multiple dimensions to access energy with complementary products or integrated demand creation, thereby addressing those needs which cannot be addressed by the grid that are available through government subsidies.

To ensure commercial viability, often due to limited demand and low willingness to pay, startups are providing complementary products and services to generate additional revenue. Grass Roots Energy Incorporated, brought in incorporated additional revenue from by-products of energy production. The startup utilises biogas or biomass waste-to-energy generating systems to generate electricity. The residue from biogas production is used and sold as agricultural fertiliser.

India has crossed 25 GW in terms of total installed solar capacity and is moving closer to the 2022 target of 100 GW. With sustained efforts from both the government and startups, India, the world's third-largest energy consumer after the US and China, can meet its target which is a part of its global climate change commitment."

At recent, coveted Juntendo University has been questioned over its gender bias admission process. Women Demand Compensation From Tokyo Medical University Over Admissions Row.

This year, the university received the Tokyo Metropolitan Government's top award for its contribution to female empowerment. Juntendo University has recently admitted setting a higher bar for female applicants to pass the entrance exams. In a conference, the university acknowledged its unfair means but had argued to practise the same as a measure to narrow the wide gap between the abilities of men and women; reported Japan Times. The private Juntendo University further clarified that it set lower pass marks for men in its entrance exam, which included an interview. Japan Medical Schools Deliberately Pass More Men Than Women Says Survey.

At December 17, press conference, a Juntendo official said, ""Women are more mature and have better communication skills than men."" They have been keeping different passing scores for men and women for about the past decade. A social psychology professor at Hiroshima University, Kiriko Sakata told the Japan Times, ""That is far too unjust. They are pretending that there are academic grounds (for their practice), but this is nothing more than plain discrimination against women."" Sakata further said that it is inappropriate to apply gender standards when evaluating individual academic skills.

Its score manipulation came in as a surprise to the nation. Wondering about its status upholding women empowerment, media reports claim that in Juntendo University, the number of women doctors have a significant portion in its faculty. The medical department has seen an increase in female employees to 11 in 2017 from only 2 in 2011. This was one of the main reasons that the Tokyo government honoured the university for the female empowerment award."

For Ravi Kiran, childhood was not an easy one, as his father, an industrial worker in Hyderabad, lost his job in 2007, prompting his mother to take up odd jobs to run the household. In such a situation, schooling became a distant dream for Ravi, till his family learnt about ICFAI Republic School - renamed as Ekalavya School in 2013 - that provides education to underprivileged children charging minimal fee.

Today, Ravi works as a data analyst at Wipro Technologies in the city. He owes a lot to the school, where he learnt the skills and went on to became a successful software developer.

Located in Fatehnagar in Hyderabad, the walls of Ekalavya School echo with many such success stories. Run by IIM-Ahmedabad Alumni Association (IIMAAA) Hyderabad Chapter in partnership with RBL Bank, the school in the current batch has 310 students spread across class 1-10th, of which 45% are girls. The school will be rechristened as Udbhav RBL School from the next session starting in April 2019.

The association runs another Udbhav School in Rasool Pura area in partnership with Coromandel International. The school has 523 students that have an average family income of Rs 6000-8000 a month. Their parents have to pay 10-15% of the school expenses, while the rest of the expenses are borne by the association. Giving a thrust on girl child education-the schools now has 56% of female students.

Over the years, the students at both the schools have made a mark, by winning accolades in academics, sports and other co-curricular activities. For instance, Snagannagari Pravilika, class X student from Udbhav School has won several awards in girls power lifting championship at various competitions held at district level, state level and national level in the past two years. Pravilika says that the school provided her with the facility of smart classes and, hence, she was able to dedicate extra time for practising the sport.

Both the schools, located in Rasool Pura and Fatehnagar, had been taken over by IIMAAA when they were on the brink of closure after death of ICFAI founder N J Yasaswi.

""Both our schools have only one philosophy-all the children should get the same opportunity. Our school provides all modern facilities including music lessons, dance classes, karate training, English speaking classes and all sports activities,"" IIMAAA member T Muralidharan told Education Times.

The student/teacher ratio at both the schools is 23, which Muralidharan says, is a very good average compared to other government and private schools of Hyderabad.

These findings come from a nationally representative sample of eighth, 10th and 12th graders in schools nationwide, funded by a government grant to the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. The annual results were announced today by the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), part of the National Institutes of Health, along with the scientists who lead the research team.

Reported use of vaping nicotine specifically in the 30 days prior to the survey nearly doubled among high school seniors from 11 percent in 2017 to 20.9 percent in 2018. More than 1 in 10 eighth graders (10.9 percent) say they vaped nicotine in the past year, and use is up significantly in virtually all vaping measures among eighth, 10th and 12th graders. Reports of past year marijuana vaping also increased this year, at 13.1 percent for 12th graders, up from 9.5 percent last year.

""Teens are clearly attracted to the marketable technology and flavorings seen in vaping devices; however, it is urgent that teens understand the possible effects of vaping on overall health; the development of the teen brain; and the potential for addiction,"" said Nora D. Volkow, M.D., director of NIDA. ""Research tells us that teens who vape may be at risk for transitioning to regular cigarettes, so while we have celebrated our success in lowering their rates of tobacco use in recent years, we must continue aggressive educational efforts on all products containing nicotine.""

The percent of 12th graders who say they vaped ""just flavoring"" in the past year also increased to 25.7 percent in 2018 from 20.6 percent in 2017. However, it is unclear if teens know what is in the vaping devices they are using since the most popular devices do not have nicotine-free options, and some labeling has been shown to be inaccurate. There was also a significant jump in perceived availability of vaping devices and liquids in eighth and 10th graders, with 45.7 percent and 66.6 percent, respectively, saying the devices are ""fairly easy"" or ""very easy"" to get.

There is more information on the survey's vaping findings in this week's issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. In a letter to the editor written by Dr. Richard Miech, the MTF study team lead. Dr. Miech points out that the one-year increases in the prevalence of nicotine vaping translate into approximately 1.3 million additional adolescents who vaped in 2018, as compared with 2017. The increase in vaping rates between 2017-2018 also aligns with the recently released CDC/FDA government-funded National Youth Tobacco Survey.

Tobacco

This year's survey shows regular tobacco is still at its lowest point in the survey since it began measuring it, with only 3.6 percent of high school seniors smoking daily, compared to 22.4 percent two decades ago. Smoking tobacco with a hookah is significantly lower than five years ago, at 7.8 percent in the past year among high school seniors, compared to 21.4 percent in 2013.

Opioids

The alarming news about vaping is in sharp contrast to the good news about teenage opioid use. The past year use of narcotics other than heroin (i.e., prescription opioids) is at 3.4 percent among 12th graders--a significant change from 4.2 percent in 2017. Only 1.7 percent of high school seniors report misuse of Vicodin in the past year, compared to a peak of 10.5 percent 15 years ago. It is also important to note that heroin use in all three grades remains very low with only 0.4 percent of 12th graders reporting past year use. ""With illicit opioid use at generally the lowest in the history of the survey, it is possible that being in high school offers a protective effect against opioid misuse and addiction,"" said Dr. Volkow. ""We will be focusing much of our new prevention research on the period of time when teens transition out of school into the adult world and become exposed to the dangerous use of these drugs.""

Marijuana and Other Drugs

Close to 1 in 4 high school seniors reported the use of an illicit drug in the past month, led by marijuana use. Rates of overall marijuana use are steady, with 5.8 percent of 12th graders reporting daily use. Daily use of marijuana has been reported by high school seniors for the past 20 years at somewhere between 5.0 and 6.6 percent. Past year rates of marijuana use are generally steady among sophomores and seniors, showing as 27.5 percent for 10th graders and 35.9 percent for 12th graders. However, there is a significant five-year drop among eighth graders--from 12.7 percent in 2013 to 10.5 percent in 2018. There continue to be more 12th graders who report using marijuana every day than smoking cigarettes (5.8 percent vs. 3.6 percent), and only 26.7 percent of 12th graders think regular marijuana use offers the great risk of harm.

Other illicit drugs, including cocaine, synthetic cannabinoids, and MDMA remain close to historic lows. Inhalants, the only drug category that is usually higher among younger teens, is reported at 4.6 among eighth graders, compared to a peak of 12.8 percent in 1995.

Alcohol

There is positive news related to teen drinking with just 17.5 percent of 12th graders saying they have been drunk in the past 30 days, down significantly from five years ago, when it was reported at 26 percent. Reports of binge drinking (five or more drinks in a row in the past two weeks) are down significantly among 12th graders, at 13.8 percent down from 16.6 percent in 2017, and compared to 31.5 percent when the rates peaked in 1998. These findings represent the lowest rates seen for these alcohol measures since the survey began asking the questions.

""We are encouraged to see continued declines in a variety of measures of underage alcohol use,"" said George F. Koob, Ph.D., director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. ""The new data, however, underscore that far too many young people continue to drink at a time in their lives when their brains and bodies are quite vulnerable to alcohol-related harms. We remain committed to developing and improving strategies to prevent the onset of drinking among youth so that more young people can be spared the consequences of alcohol misuse.""

The MTF survey releases findings the same year the data is collected. It has been conducted by researchers at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor since 1975.

Overall, 44,482 students from 392 public and private schools participated in this year's MTF survey. Since 1975, the survey has measured drug, alcohol, and cigarette use and related attitudes in 12th graders nationwide. Eighth and 10th graders were added to the survey in 1991. Survey participants generally report their drug use behaviors across three time periods: lifetime, past year, and past month. NIDA has provided grant funding for the survey since its inception.

When I was growing up, someone was always asking a member of our family, ""Where are you from?"" Usually, it was my mother. She has high cheekbones, deep, wide-set eyes and light brown skin with prominent freckles.

Since we grew up in an area with a small black population, her appearance drew more notice than I think it would have elsewhere. Whoever was asking usually wanted to claim her as their own.

Once, my sisters, our mother and I were in an epic, four-way fight in the car while holiday shopping. As our mother steered us out of the parking garage, the lot attendant waved her payment away. He was from Ethiopia and assumed she was too. He complimented her on what a great mother she must be -- our windows had been rolled up, so he hadn't heard the yelling.

I don't look like my mother. When I was younger and people asked, ""Where are you from?"" they usually wanted confirmation of my West Indian heritage. ""My dad is from Barbados,"" is how I usually answered the question of why I had the face I had.

""Where are you from?"" is a question we sometimes think we can find an answer to with DNA. One of my first jobs out of college was coordinating a community African-American genealogical class in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. It was run by a married couple from New Jersey, a former police officer and a former private investigator who dedicated their retirement to black genealogy. They had said in the class that DNA testing was a tricky thing for black people trying to trace their past.

Different DNA testing companies have different proprietary DNA databases. This means you can get a different result depending on which company you use. If the company you've chosen doesn't include information about your particular genetic background in its database, it may simply report that you don't have that ancestry.

If you have African ancestry, it becomes even trickier. The African slave trade to the United States ended, with some exceptions, more than 170 years ago. If you are matching your DNA to a database of African populations you are usually comparing yourself with present-day population samples, not the DNA of someone who may have lived in that area 170 or even 200 or 400 years before. Also, there is more genetic variation among African people than among Europeans, yet much of the information in the most popular commercial DNA databases contains only a fraction of the full African DNA spectrum.

But people still believe in DNA and want it to reveal some ""truth"" about the depth and reach of family history. The scholar Alondra Nelson, author of the book ""The Social Life of DNA,"" wrote about the ""democratization of DNA analysis"" and asked this important question: Why is DNA analysis deemed to proffer more valuable or reliable information about a person's familial history than their own words?

For my mother's family, like all African-American families, the question of ""Where are you from?"" is a complicated one. My great-grandfather on my mother's side was Lumbee. The Lumbee are a tribe from North Carolina that includes the descendants of free Africans who married Native Americans. They were not recognized by the federal government and by some other tribes because of this.

A DNA test would not reveal any of this history. It would not tell me anything about one of the enduring stories in my family, that my great-grandfather helped to found schools for his people at the turn of the last century and was forced to leave North Carolina when his entire town was burned to the ground, presumably by people who disliked the town's organizing.

He came north. He went to Dartmouth College. He studied there in the early 1900s, amid the rise of eugenics movements. He was with a handful of other black students. One of them, lighter-skinned, remembered him only as ""that little black man."" His skin was the darkest of all of them. When he graduated from Dartmouth, he was still listed in the New Hampshire census as a popcorn seller.

Many northern white universities would not hire a black English professor in 1910. He left his family to travel the South for decades, teaching at black colleges. He created my grandmother, one of the strongest, most-loving, smartest women I ever knew. I was terrified of her for most of my life.

She moved to an all-white suburb of Boston at the start of the 1950s to make sure that her children had access to a good education. She worked for years as an administrative assistant at Harvard University and opened her doors to international students in the Boston area every Thanksgiving. She, too, had a school -- an informal one she ran for my mother and her siblings during the summer so that they could be twice as good as everyone else once they got to school in the fall.

If I were to have a child now, its DNA would not contain any trace of any of this story and would certainly not act as evidence to support it. I would, perhaps, look to see whether it loved books and education as much as its maternal ancestors did. But DNA would not reveal whether a child I had now would have the fortitude to survive the world it would be born into.

If I had a child now, it would be a part-black, part-Jewish child in a country where white supremacist attacks do not look to be ending anytime soon. It would be a country that could lose much of its coastline to rising sea levels.

The morning after the 2016 election, overwhelmed with what felt like the inescapable pull of history and biology, I told my mother: ""I guess this means I'm never having children. I can't imagine giving birth to a child under Trump, and in four years it will be too late for me.""

She wrote me back to tell me she loved me with all her heart and to assure me that she never regretted having any of us. She reminded me that black and biracial babies will always be born, no matter who is president. ""Maybe the child would grow into someone who carries on this legacy of finding a way to make a difference in the world,"" she wrote.

My mother understood what I was grappling with, and said: ""I do not wish you had been born in another skin or body, as painful as being a person of color can be. There is also great pride, great joy and an inner strength that can feel the pain and rise through it."" She continued: ""We will survive this through our strength as a family and as a people. We each have to reconcile it for ourselves, but we will.""

I think about what people are looking for when they talk about ancestry. When they take a DNA test, is it this history they are hoping to find, or an alternative to what we know of the past?

Malinda Maynor Lowery is a historian of Lumbee tribal history. This fall, she wrote on Twitter about the concept of genograms. Originally, they were a resource for families -- you write down the diseases that occur in your family tree so that everyone can be aware of what you might inherit. But Professor Lowery argued for expanding what we include in a genogram, citing the work of Jessica Lambert Ward. What if we mapped the strengths passed down, for the things that helped our ancestors survive in a hostile world?

Isn't that an echo of what we are looking for when we try to determine which tribe in West Africa we may have come from, which kin group we might claim? Sometimes we're looking in our blood for a map from our ancestors, when it has always been here, in how we talk to and love one another."

""What is the name of the Chief Minister"", I asked a group of tribal women in Mahasamund. It was my first field trip to Chhattisgarh and I was a rookie with one year of experience in the development sector. With all the scepticism that new idealists could gather, I felt that women not knowing the name of the Chief Minister of the state would reflect on their agency, and hence would give me a starting point to discuss decentralised governance with them!

""I do not know his name, but 'chawal waale baba' is what we call him"". Mahasamund has always been a Congress dominated belt and the response came as a shock to me. For the next couple of hours, I went on to talk of a lot of things, but what dominated the discussion was how the women in the village zealously monitor the fair price shops and how this 'chawal waale baba' is doing some good work for them.

Few days back, Dr Raman Singh was about to face a defeat in his constituency of Rajnandgaon from which he has been contesting elections since the early 90s. He somehow managed to scrape through but the government and his party could not be saved. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been reduced to 15 seats in the state and has lost out across all demographies and geographies in the state. But, 15 years is not a small time and Dr Raman Singh has presided over the most significant period of change in the state. So what is his legacy and what is the way ahead for him, politically?

Before the arrival of the Gujarat success story by the fag end of 2014, Chhattisgarh was the state where the issue of development was front and centre in electoral terms. It was a state carved out of Madhya Pradesh to help the tribal and the Scheduled Caste communities and hence, the articulation of development here was also very different. Development in Chhattisgarh in the way Raman Singh articulated meant a turnaround in fortunes and not just a facelift.

As one of the states with the largest tribal population, abject poverty and violent Left wing extremism, Chhattisgarh needed that narrative of transition and Raman Singh was the one who provided it. And this was not the development of mega industries and four-lane highways and metros criss-crossing cities. This was the development of getting people adequate food to eat and putting the first generation of learners in schools and bringing the first pucca roads to a village. It was development from scratch.

If we look at the Chhattisgarh story since the past 15 years, there are two aspects of governance which would stand out as the legacy of Dr Raman Singh.

Social Development Legacy

The biggest success story in Chhattisgarh under Dr Singh was the efficiency of the public distribution system (PDS). Chhattisgarh took an unabashed Left route in approaching food security and increased the PDS coverage to 74 per cent. Moreover, when other states were experiencing major issues of pilferage and looting, the Chhattisgarh government undertook a slew of reforms to address the situation.

The first concern that Raman Singh identified after taking office was that more than 50 per cent of the below poverty line (BPL) population, were unable to access the food grains meant for them. The first reform he brought in was taking away the ownership of PDS shops from private businessmen and handing over control to the local community.

Then came other measures like issuing new ration cards with holograms which weeded out over 3 lakh fake beneficiaries, increased commission and even a seed fund to shop operators for making the business viable, increased monitoring and vigilance including community audits, doorstep delivery of food grains and raids and massive crackdown of corrupt rice millers. Raman Singh without any doubt made PDS the key to his re-election in 2008 and there was no other issue which worked, except 'chawal'.

The victory of 2008 was on the back of the almost transformational change in the supply chain of the PDS and sealed the tag of 'chawal waale baba'. The Chhattisgarh success story was so convincing that even some stalwarts in Sonia Gandhi-led National Advisory Council (NAC) had to use it as a template.

The success of PDS in Chhattisgarh had an expected ripple effect on the nutritional levels in the state. Food scarcity in tribal belts leads to malnutrition and stunting, and Chhattisgarh managed to address this issue thoroughly. The National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 4 data shows that the percentage of adult women with body mass index (BMI) less than normal has decreased from 43.4 per cent in 2005-06 to 26.7 in 2015-16. It is less than the figures for MP and Jharkhand and almost the same as Odisha, even though it recorded a higher incidence level than all three states in 2005-06.

Another important change has been the decrease in instances of anaemia in infants which has reduced from 71.2 per cent in 2005-06 to 41.6 per cent in 2015-16. It has now reached below the national average, while the states of MP, Jharkhand and Odisha still register more instances of infant anaemia. The final indicator which directly speaks about malnutrition is the incidences of stunting.

The following figure provides an idea of how Chhattisgarh has progressed on addressing stunting and underweight issues in children. The only state which has fared better than Chhattisgarh is Odisha but it also needs to be seen that Chhattisgarh had a much higher base in 2005-06.

This is no minor feat. With the PDS covering basic food-grains in villages, schools and anganwadi centres, the savings of the poor could be used to widen the basket of nutritious food, thus effectively tackling malnutrition. The single minded focus of Raman Singh on one issue paid off both socially and politically for him.

If Vasundhara Raje has been the most economic right wing chief minister from the BJP, Raman Singh has undoubtedly been the most towards the Left. He is known for a slew of populist welfare schemes in the state. His focus on health and nutrition extended to his CM Health Scheme whereby Rs 30,000 worth of free treatment was provided to citizens. Other welfare schemes ranged from the Saraswati Cycle Yojana for school girls to the Mukhyamantri Teerth Yatra Yojana for elderly citizens.

Combating Left Wing Extremism In The State

Since the day the new state of Chhattisgarh was born, the single biggest problem impeding the development initiatives was the 'red terrorism' plaguing multiple districts of the state.

Raman Singh has been at the centre of a lot of controversy when it comes to combating Left wing extremism and his government has been accused of custodial violence against tribals, harassment of activists like Binayak Sen and most importantly tacit support given to the Salwa Judum. Raman Singh in the past has openly defended the Salwa Judum as being the primary resistance force against the Maoists.

In 2009, just two years before the Salwa Judum was disbanded by the Supreme Court, Dr Singh had credited the members of the vigilante group as being the custodians of the republic. The formation of the Salwa Judum led to one of the bloodiest phases in the state and the tribal communities were divided and displaced like never before. It is a cross that both the Congress and the BJP have to bear. But, as the CM for 15 long years, it can never be dissociated from the legacy of Raman Singh.

While Chhattisgarh continues to be the state, most affected by Maoist violence, through the course of the past 15 years, the Raman Singh government had many big and small successes in addressing the alienation of the tribal communities and ushering in peace. From the construction of state highways to schemes like allowances for pregnant and lactating mothers, a mix of infrastructural and welfare measures had been implemented in tribal areas along with numerous awareness and sensitisation campaigns.

While the districts of Sarguja and Jashpur have now been removed from the list of Maoist affected districts, the most significant transformation has been seen in the district of Bastar. The Dandakaranya belt is the hotbed of Maoist activity in the country and has been the scene of the most dastardly acts of violence against the state. Carrying out development activities in this area and then seeing tangible returns of inclusion is no mean feat.

It is a three-pronged strategy where the security forces and the civic administration work in tandem to ensure that relative peace facilitates rapid infrastructural development and the cycle continues without further incidents. The third prong is ensuring that key entitlements to the local communities and their rights under PESA are respected. This has been a strategy that the Chhattisgarh government under Dr Singh has made moderate success in.

One of the most significant changes in the Maoist areas of the state has been the rapid construction of roads. These roads have not only ended the alienation of remote villages but have pushed the Maoists further into the jungles. Conversely, it has also been the cause behind much of the attacks in the state since 2014.

The two stretches which have seen the most attacks are the Dornapal-Jagargunda stretch and the Injeram-Bhejji stretch which are incidentally the two critical road construction stretches. Bastar, today, is being dotted with educational institutions and health care centres. There are three districts in the region which still can be counted as war zones and the Maoist threat is far from over. But, change has happened right under the barrel of the gun and for that Dr Raman Singh deserves a lot of credit.

My first trip to Mahasamund for a study was in 2013. The last one was in 2017 when I travelled to Ambikapur, Sarguja, another Congress belt. This time I was not working with women but with adolescent girls. Their concerns were different. They needed English classes and computer skills, and well-paying jobs. Some of them told me that the 'sattu' provided by the government under the SABLA scheme is used for feeding cattle, a far cry from conversations of adequate nutrition. Survival and chawal was not the topic of discussion. Aspiration and jobs were.

I again asked them about the CM. All of them knew his name, Dr Raman Singh. For the new generation with new hopes, he was not 'chawal waale baba' anymore. He was just another politician who needed to deliver on new demands. That, perhaps, sums up why the development agenda of Raman Singh did not work. There is a new generation holding the keys to power now and the old guard could not keep up with their aspirations.

While the legacy of Dr Raman Singh has been development, it has mostly been around subsistence. Food security, access to health, even footwear for tired feet! It is perhaps what the need was that point but subsistence will never be enough. With his share of successes and controversies and lost time, Dr Singh needs to be given the due credit he deserves.

It is to his credit to have governed one of the most difficult, conflict ridden states in India and gradually relieve parts of it from the backward status it had been stamped with. While a large number of districts in Chhattisgarh continue to be aspirational while the rest of the country surges forward, it is to his credit that the dreams of Naya Raipur and Naya Bastar have not been pushed to the background.

And importantly, his PDS success story has been the one which exhibits what true political will can achieve even in the face of immense odds. This could very well have been the end of his stint as the CM of the state, but the road from Raipur via Bastar may just lead to New Delhi."

The percentage of high school seniors who used e-cigarettes in the last 30 days nearly doubled to 20.9 percent from last year, results of a survey released by the National Institute on Drug Abuse showed on Monday. The increase in vaping by 10th and 12th graders was the largest year-over-year jump for any substance ever measured by the survey, which started 44 years ago. The annual survey, which also measures use of other substances including marijuana, alcohol and opioids, questioned more than 44,000 students from 8th, 10th and 12th grades in U.S. public and private schools.

The percentage of high school students who used nicotine-based vaping devices, known as e-cigarettes, has risen by a third over the past year, the survey showed. E-cigarettes have been a divisive topic in the public health community. Some focus on the potential benefit of shifting lifelong smokers to less harmful nicotine products, while others fear it will create a new generation addicted to nicotine.

Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, facing mounting pressure to act on the rising popularity of vaping devices, announced sweeping new restrictions on flavored tobacco products, including e-cigarettes. The one-year rise in vaping were mirrored by changes in the perception of availability of e-cigarretes, the institute said in its report, with more 8th and 10th graders reporting that vaping devices and e-liquids containing nicotine were easier to obtain in 2018 than in 2017. E-cigarette makers, including San Francisco-based Juul Labs Inc, have also faced scrutiny from the FDA amid the increase in teenage use of the devices, which look like a USB flash drive and vaporize a flavored liquid containing nicotine.

Juul said in November it would pull popular flavors such as mango, cucumber and fruit from many retail store shelves to reduce teenage use of its products."

On December 15, State Budget of Rs 88911 crore for the fiscal 2019-20 was approved by the State Administrative Council (SAC) headed by Governor Satya Pal Malik. It goes without saying that despite various constraints faced by the State administration, nearly more than after two decades, any Governor could present a complete Budget incorporating therein the desired allocations on priority areas like agriculture , education , health and medical care and above all, on infrastructural development.

The salient features of the Budget are that no new taxes have been proposed to be levied nor any changes made to the existing rate structure. Since majority of the projects which should have by now been completed , budgetary provisions have been kept for them so that they were now completed . The fiscal deficit which was put at Rs 19529 crore in the Revised Estimates is expected to come down to Rs 13996 crore in 2019-20. Whether the gap of nearly Rs6000 crores was proposed to be filled with reduced expenditures or imposing of some taxes later, has not been specified clearly in the Budget. On the other hand , however, additional resources required were projected at Rs 9876 crores in the Revised Estimates for the current fiscal and Rs4340 crore for 2019-20.

Since avenues of earning revenues by the Government are limited on account of not widening the tax base and revising the existing ones to keep pace with its ever increasing expenditure , proposing no new taxes has been a popular measure as the source of income is the massive grants from the Centre which constitute nearly 44% and an additional 18% as the State's share from the Central Taxes. On the other hand, as much as 27% of the revenues are spent on salaries and pensions, paid to Government employees and pensioneRs Agriculture gets an enhanced allocation of Rs 20 crore which appears to be too low but perhaps constraints of balancing the Budget without expanding revenue base demanded it. However 50% subsidy is proposed for vans which are refrigerated to transport perishable items like vegetables and fruits. In Education Rs 350 crore are proposed to be allocated for new colleges and Rs 100 crore there-from, to be spent on providing benches and desks in primary and middle schools.

A long demand of the people of Ladakh for setting up of a University in that part of the State has been conceded and Ladakh was going to have its first ever University with an initial grant of Rs 65 crore , of course by the next fiscal. The Budget is designed to give a major push to building infrastructure for which Rs 30469 crore stand earmarked for investment. An important aspect of infrastructural development is in the form of keeping budgetary provisions of Rs3631 crore for various projects languishing in the state. Besides, the Budget aims at laying the requisite thrust on Panchayats, Municipalities and sports. Governor appears to give sports a major boost in the State by allocating Rs 350 crore to it and allied activities. He has many times felt the dire need to promote sports to channelize the activities of the youth in the positive direction as there was enough potential available which needed to be chiselled and moulded properly with providing more facilities. Health and medical care gets Rs 350 crore mainly for completion of construction of buildings for Medical Colleges and District Hospitals while Rs 100 crore is proposed for purchasing new equipment in hospitals.

However, the Budget appears to be envisioned to bring about overall development especially ensuring languishing projects like drinking water, construction of bridges, roads and welfare measures to get completed as soon as possible . The State needs a lot of private investment to infuse new vigour on the economic front for which peace and tranquillity is required which is directly related to assured dividends to investors."

The corporate class in India is in a state of delirium and what medical experts call an ""acute confusional state"" of mind. The highfalutin and suited-booted executives are in this state of self-inflicted paranoia after the assembly election results in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.

Six years ago, soon after the results of the Gujarat assembly election, which brought Narendra Modi to power for a third time as the chief minister, this class was ecstatic. The corporate chorus cheering Modi was led by Ratan Tata, Anil Ambani, Gautam Adani and even N.R. Narayana Murthy, the icon of Silicon Valley intellectuals. Stock market studs like Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and self-declared economist and psephologist Surjit Bhalla were on cloud nine.

India's Silicon Valley in Bengaluru and tech hubs in Mumbai and Delhi, along with much of the NRI community and their cousins, joined the Narendra Modi chorus. India was, they said, on the cusp of radical, neo-liberal transformation. Some wrote that India's 'Thatcher Moment' has come. Others thought Modi could bring the 'Ronald Reagan Revolution' to India. This corporate class had huge support not just from the NRIs but also from the American business establishment.

Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel suited Modi's local idea of greatness and historical ignorance. The narrative that poor Patel had missed the opportunity to become the first Gujarati Prime Minister because of the alleged cunningness of Jawaharlal Nehru gained ground. So, Modi and his supporters made it a habit to attack Nehru as if he was still around and ridiculed his great-grandson Rahul Gandhi. So, it became a proxy war between Nehru and Modi. The WhatsApp warriors ferociously attacked the Nehru-Gandhi-led Congress - they excelled in the targeted and systematic maligning of personalities and communities like we have seen in German history.

The corporate brigade, including highly paid IITians and IIM-syllabus trained young soldiers from various business schools, joined the vast army of social media outfits. Thousands of them found jobs with these troll armies. The alleged job was simple and the remuneration high: invent stories, generate calumny, spread slander, circulate fake news and destroy Nehru's legacy.

Interestingly, those who got mesmerised by this media blitz were executives working with big, medium or even small business enterprises. They actually believed that there was an inspiring dawn after a long dark Nehruvian night. This is when the myth of invincibility of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah began to get entrenched. The BJP's majority in 2014 was attributed to Modi's aggressive, imaginative and oratorical campaign.

Also read: This election loss has 10 lessons. BJP can choose to learn them or kiss 2019 goodbye

Therefore, the 2019 election, they thought, would be a repeat of 2014. The so-called semi-finals of assembly polls did not worry them much. Modi's carpet bombing-style rallies would overcome the negative image of the state governments, they were sure. That is why the 3-0 performance of Congress shook them out of their complacency, and after four years, they have visibly lost confidence.

At private gatherings and cocktail parties, in closed-door conference rooms and hush-hush conversations, they have begun to express their frustrations, total disillusionment and their business crises, especially after the chaotic implementation of the GST and the 'mindless' demonetisation. They are even expressing their fears and apprehensions about possible Enforcement Directorate or Income Tax raids. They are seriously concerned about the RBI governor's resignation and the appointment of Shaktikanta Das, who is known neither as an economist, nor as a business-friendly officer.

But the defeat of the BJP was significant in other respects too. Amit Shah's alleged game of creating a fifth column in Chhattisgarh by encouraging Ajit Jogi-Mayawati alliance has miserably bombed. Jogi had already begun to behave as if he was the chief minister-elect. And Mayawati was threatening the grand old party as if she was the chosen candidate for prime ministership. 'Who Rahul and What Congress' was the refrain.

But 11 December proved to be a 'Black Day' for all the anti-Congress parties and Rahul Gandhi detractors. The headlines on TV that night and in next day's morning newspapers echoed: ""Rahul Gandhi halts Modi Vijay Rath"" or ""Rahul halts Shah Juggernaut"" or ""The Son has Finally Risen"". The media loves hyperbole, and the win in the two big states (Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh) was treated like it was a landslide.

There was no Congress face in Chhattisgarh, but there was a landslide. The Telangana and Mizoram losses did not make headlines, because they were not 'test matches' like the ones played in the Hindi Heartland. But for the Supreme Court judgment on the Rafale deal, the BJP had lost face and its spokespersons their speech. (The court, however, has not addressed a single question posed by the Opposition, mainly the Congress. The issue of price and allocation of the Rafale offset project to Anil Ambani's firm, allegedly sidelining the HAL, remains).

The corporate executives and their masters, meanwhile, are in a state of panic now. One can empathise with them or laugh at them. Their oversized egos and delusion have created this Black Comedy-like situation now.

Pics/Bipin Kokate

Taking one's child to and from school has become more about navigating the traffic nightmare outside education institutes these days. Thanks to the cramped nature of the city, its Metro and utility works and an ever-increasing number of vehicles, traffic woes are seeing parents and residents clashing almost every day. mid-day takes a closer look at this deep-rooted problem, kicking-off its series on parking woes outside schools with three South Mumbai institutions.

School buses have become targets of citizens' ire for their role in the congestion outside schools. In many parts of the city, local residents and schools are seen locked in argument over the congestion caused when schools begin or end for the day. That's when several school buses as well as private vehicles start collecting around the school.

mid-day presents a series of ground reports on situations outside select schools from across the city. A little digging and we find that other than the obvious space crunch, there is a need for schools to have a specific transport policy in order to avoid traffic chaos.

Indrani Malkani, who played a pivotal role in forming the School Bus transport safety policy, said, ""The regulations are very clear in the policy which states that the most important aspect is encouraging the use of school buses which will allow swift movement of vehicles on the road.

The transport committees, which are mandatory at all schools, should look at fast movement of school buses so that regular traffic flow is not disturbed on the road. It would also be great if locals work together with schools. Currently, due to metro construction work, there are diversions of regular traffic movement at multiple locations which is why the flow of school-buses is also restricted."""

On 29 November 2018 the Government made 12 announcements in relation to fire safety in high rise buildings over 18m high. The most important of the announcements was the publishing of the Building (Amendment) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/1230) (the ""Amendment Regulations"") which - when they come into force on 21 December 2018 - will introduce significant changes to the Building Regulations 2010, the most notable being the total ban of combustible materials in the external wall of buildings subject to some key exemptions. Updates to the familiar Approved Documents B and 7 have been published to take account of the Amendment Regulations. We explain the key changes below.

In accordance with section 14(3) of the Building Act 1984, these Amendment Regulations were made after consultation with the Building Regulations Advisory Committee for England and with other bodies representative of the interests concerned (including, for example, the recommendations of the Hackitt Report).

Regulation 7 of the Building Regulations 2010 requires that materials used in building work are appropriate for the circumstances in which they are used. New regulation 7(2) of the Amendment Regulations - being the most significant of the changes introduced - requires that all materials which become part of (what have now been defined within the Amendment Regulations as) an 'external wall' or 'specified attachment' achieve European Class A2-s1, d0 or Class A1. This means is that only limited combustibility (A2-s1, d0) or non-combustible (A1) materials will be permitted.

Certain limited components are exempted by regulation 7(3). This move towards a more prescriptive standard is a departure from the level of discretion that the previous building regulations regime permitted, albeit that it does not go as far as some industry groups wanted, and is a move towards eliminating the use of combustible materials in cladding systems.

Amended regulation 7(2) will apply to any building with a storey at least 18m above ground level and which contains one or more dwellings; an institution; or a room for residential purposes. This would include student accommodation, care homes, sheltered housing, hospitals and dormitories in boarding schools but would exclude any room in a hostel, hotel or a boarding house, and all commercial buildings.

The definitions of what constitutes an 'external wall' and 'specified attachments' are now included in regulation 2 of the Amendment Regulations. An external wall will include:

This therefore includes any boarding, insulation, cavity barrier and such like within the make-up of the external wall.

The regulations also apply to ""specified attachments"", which will include:

Approved Document B has been updated to provide guidance with regards to the requirements of regulation 7(2) set out above. In particular, paragraph 12.6 of the amendments states that ""...any insulation product, filler material (not including gaskets, sealants and similar) etc. used in the construction of an external wall should be of limited combustibility or better..."". This is then consistent with the requirements at regulation 7(2) for certain materials used to achieve European Class A2-s1, d0 or Class A1. The effect of this is that - with very limited exceptions - it is no longer permissible to encapsulate combustible insulation within masonry or concrete walls.

Additional minor changes have been made to Approved Document B Volume 2 to update some of the references as a consequence of the updated guidance.

Although the Amendment Regulations come into force on 21 December 2018, they will not apply where a building notice or an initial notice has been given to, or full plans deposited with, a local authority before 21 December 2018 and either the building work to which it relates has started before that day, or is started within two months from such date.

The Amendment Regulations will come into effect very soon, and it is advisable for steps to be taken now in relation to schemes that are being currently planned. Government guidance indicates that adequate commencement of works would likely be indicated by work such as:

Amended regulations 5 and 6 provide that, where the use of a building is changed such that the building becomes a building described in regulation 7(4)(a) (being any building with a storey at least 18m above ground level and which contains one or more dwellings; an institution; or a room for residential purposes), the construction of the external wall, and specified attachments, must be investigated and, where necessary, work must be carried out to ensure they only contain materials achieving European Class A2-s1, d0 or Class A1. The important change here is that a change of use is much more onerous than merely remediating. For remediation, only materials that become part of the wall are subject to regulation 7(2) whereas with a change of use, all materials in the wall will have to comply, whether new or existing. This will have particular implications for timber-framed buildings.

This is likely to be most significant for strip out and conversion works taking place after 21 December 2018.

The familiar Approved Document 7 relating to materials and workmanship has been updated to introduce the restriction on the use of combustible materials in external walls. The following text is introduced:

On 29 November 2018, the Government issued operating guidance in relation to the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS); the risk-based assessment evaluation tool that is used by local authorities to identify and protect against potential risks and hazards in private buildings. The new HHSRS guidance relates specifically to the potential for the hazard of fire in cladding systems on high rise residential buildings.

The HHSRS tool is used by local authorities to discharge their duties under the Housing Act 2004 where category 1 (general duty to take enforcement action) or category 2 (discretionary power to take enforcement action) hazards exist on residential premises or under the Building Act 1984.

The guidance suggests that subject to certain exceptions, the presence of ACM (category 2 or 3) cladding, or any other cladding and filler or core that is combustible, would be a deficiency that contributes to the hazard and would require rectification; either by the private landlord of the building or by intervention by the local authority.

The costs of local authorities taking any necessary emergency remedial action can be recovered from the private landlords. We note, however, that it is not the intention for the Amendment Regulations to be retrospectively applied through the Housing Act 2004 or the Building Act 1984. There have been no amendments to either of these pieces of legislation.

For starters, all new buildings which fall within the criteria will have to have their external walls constructed completely of non or limited-combustibility materials and any building which is required to be re-clad as a consequence of currently having ACM cladding or any other non-compliant cladding system will have to be re-clad in materials which are of limited combustibility or non-combustible; and unless the proposed system passes the large-scale BS 8184-1 and 2 tests, this could include any insulation or other boarding etc. which forms part of the external wall structure, also having to be replaced, although further guidance is being sought on this.

Secondly, any building which undergoes a change of use to become a building which falls within the regulation 7(4)(a) categories will also have to comply with the amended building regulations - so the office tower blocks being converted to apartments which have been popular over the last few years will fall within this criteria.

There are still questions being asked as to whether the scope of the guidance and the height of buildings to which the criteria applies is right and further consultation and lobbying is taking place in this regard, so there may yet be further changes which would help to simplify the position leaving everyone in the industry clear as to the requirements, but in the meantime, further guidance on best practice is expected imminently.

If you have any queries on these changes or other matters, please contact Sue Ryan or Tom George.

Even artificial ones have occupied the shelves of gift shops in Patna.

The price of a real Christmas tree depends upon its size. Even density adds to the cost, said Niyati Sharma, who owns a nursery at Patna City. Nursery owners procure these trees from Kolkata.

A nursery owner at Maurya Lok Complex, Ved Prakash cautioned the buyers against other tress with similar look available in the market. ""Cryptomeria plants are very much similar to Christmas trees. In fact, no one can differentiate the small ones though they have crooked growth and Christmas trees grow straight,"" he said.

He also said the cost of one foot high Christmas tree is Rs100 and that of five feet is Rs500. Ved said he sells around 400 trees during this festive season and the craze for Christmas trees has increased. ""Now, people of all castes and religions celebrate each other's festivals. In fact, many kids study in Convent schools and their guardians also get involved in celebrating Christmas with them,"" he said.

Apart from Christmas trees, demand for fresh flowers also increases thrice during this period. Anshumali Amit, who owns a franchise of major flower chain in Patna, said white flowers like lilies are mostly bought as they give positive ambience. Asiatic lilies cost Rs150 per stem and Oriental lilies cost Rs250 per stem at his shop.

Even the artificial trees are also in demand in the market. These are available from Rs100 to Rs1,500 depending upon the size and quality. Private school teacher Seema Seraphine said she always prefers artificial trees and flowers because they do not need to be maintained and can be kept anywhere in the house. Once bought, these can be used for at least four years. ""It is also a useful gift. I give my family members artificial Christmas trees as a gift on this festival,"" she said, adding she buys the artificial ones from Churi Market at Kadamkuan."

The survey was conducted by AddressHealth, a school health services provider, from June to August.

""As many as 16.7 per cent of primary, middle and high school students surveyed suffered difficulties that could lead to anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, conduct disorders, depression, etc. In this survey, 12 to 15 per cent high school students were found suffering from emotional and social skill issues, while eight to 10 per cent primary school kids suffered conduct and hyperactivity issues,"" said Dr Anand Lakshman, founder of AddressHealth.

Government and private schools following CBSE, ICSE and Karnataka state syllabus were part of this exercise. Teachers and parents filled out questionnaires about students' behaviour.

""Conduct issues such as bullying, not listening to the teacher, aloofness, were factors noticed more by teachers than parents. This is a screening tool and not a diagnostic one. It helped us identify who is more prone to risk. For instance, contemplation of suicide among adolescents warrants seeking treatment, which we provided later through group therapy,"" Lakshman added.

The causes included imbalance of neurochemicals in the brain, social and environmental stressors such as pressure to perform, hyper-competitive nature, overexposure to information on the internet (for example, blue whale challenge being seen as a solution to solve one's problems), nutritional aspects such as high sugar content in food eaten by hyperactive kids, need for instant gratification in terms of likes and approval on social media, etc.

""Most issues stem from childhood. It is a known fact that only 12 to 15 per cent adults seek help. Most do not take treatment due to stigma, so adults pass on their anxieties and stressors to their kids. Depression is used as a bad word. The brain is more susceptible to change when the child is young,"" a public health expert said, further adding, ""Late treatment cannot modify the way the brain works, but can only offer coping strategies to adults. We need to accept our children are at risk and intervene early."""

What thoughts does Iran provoke when you think of this West Asian country? A country run by mullahs (ayatollahs) who hold a grip on all spheres of life in the country. A compressed society that screams for azadi (freedom) from the clergy as is told by books like Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books, etc. A country portrayed as a jail for the minorities, especially Sunni Muslims and fun-loving moderate Iranians.

A country strangulated by international sanctions by world powers led by the United States. A country defying all these sanctions and vowing not to bow to any pressure. A country deeply entrenched in regional crises like those in Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. A country that remains constantly in the news. These were the assumptions with which one landed in Tehran last week and examined them.

ARRIVAL

We, a delegation of Indian journalists and academics, arrived in Tehran in the wee hours of November 24. A saccharine call to prayer (azaan) for fajr (early morning prayer) greeted us at Imam Khomeini airport. An overwhelming absence of heavy security (we expected high security in Iran given the presumption that it faces security threats) surprised all of us. Besides, there was hardly any evidence of commercial hoardings barring a big Samsung one under two large portraits of Imam Khomeini

and Imam Khamenei. Later, we found out via discreet chats with some locals and lower-level officials that security in Iran often remains invisible and officials discern threats from foreigners long before they arrive in Iran.

As we arrived at our hotel, the first thing my reporter friend and me noticed was a wooden box. It invited sadqa (charity) with a saying of Prophet Muhammed written on it: ""Sadqa makes heart happy."" The money, we were told, is largely spent on the marriage of poor girls. Our guide said that this box is neither ignored nor stolen by locals. ""Such boxes are put up either by the ministry of women welfare or by NGOs working for the government. Every year, they collect a huge chunk of money to distribute among the poor,"" said Hyder Reza Zabet, an Indian-Iranian and our guide on the tour. Mr Zabet added that these boxes have never been reported to be stolen. Contrast this with theft cases in India!

After keeping our bags at our hotel, as we moved to search cigarettes, an absence of the local currency failed all our efforts. No one agreed to exchange Indian rupees despite us offering a lucrative deal. They asked only US dollars and Euros. Suddenly, a student-like looking Iranian saw us craving for caffeine. He bought seven cigarettes from a kiosk and handed over five to us. We protested but he went away waving a bye of friendship.

RESTRICTIONS ON FACEBOOK, YOUTUBE

As we started operating our mobile phones in the hotel lobby, we found to our shock that sites like Facebook and YouTube are banned in Iran. It was no less a nightmare for social networking addicts like many of us. Anyway, the hotel receptionist came to our rescue. She whispered that we can access these sites through internet proxy apps like VPN, Bazar, etc. The Iranian government, we were told, had recently put restrictions on these sites as they helped foment a recent unrest against the Hassan Rouhani government and the hardline ruling clergy. However, Iranian spin-offs of these sites like Cloob and Aparat were active throughout, with millions of Iranians active on these platforms.

TRAFFIC AND VEHICLES

As we moved from Tehran airport into the city, Iranians were seen rushing to their offices in cars, buses and motorcycles. Offices in Iran start at eight in the morning and run up to three in the afternoon.

""Iranians are mostly punctual,"" said Mr Zabet. One more remarkable aspect of traffic in Tehran was despite a gigantic number of vehicles, not a single honking was heard by anyone in our group. In fact, our group members became alert to note whether any commuter lost patience and pressed the horn's button. But in our entire five days journey, it happened only once, and that too by our own driver. He was duly admonished by the fellow traveller whom he honked at.

Mr Zabet told us that almost half of all Iranian vehicles are in Tehran, and that 80 to 90 per cent of Iranian vehicles are self-manufactured. Conditions of many such vehicles suggest that they might belong to the pre-Islamic Revolution monarchy era. After the famed oil and gas industry, the automobile industry is the third largest industry in Iran. Industry stats inform that it makes for 10 per cent of country's GDP and around 4 per cent of its entire workforce. Today, Iran is the said to be the 18th-largest automaker in the world and one of the largest in Asia, with an annual production of more than 1.6 million vehicles.

IRAN SANCTIONS, POLITICS, MEDIA, RELATIONS WITH INDIA

After we settled down in our hotel, interactive sessions with Iranian academics, former diplomats, senior government officials and media personalities kick-started.

Dr Hussein Akbari from from Asr Institute, Tehran, was the first to address our delegation. He is a former diplomat and a current academic. He also edits a journal, The World of Islam. He described Iran as a classical case of victimisation by western media imperialism. He said that the US considers the whole world as a big Guantanamo Bay prison. ""All its allies are treated as inmates. They obey the jailor,"" he said, pointing towards US' allies in the Gulf region. He said that the picture of Iran as a patriarchal society and a pariah state is only because of biases in the western media.

""The Western media wants you to believe that human rights are suppressed in the Islamic Republic of Iran, but it doesn't show how Iranians have suffered because of direct war (the eight years long Iran-Iraq war) and indirect war (economic sanctions) imposed by the US and its allies,"" he said. He said that western and regional atrocities against the nation have left it weakened but it has also helped the nation to always stand on its feet. ""We may look weak but we are very determined to face any eventuality. The Holy Quran declares that those who resist against injustice, God illuminates their path with victory,"" he said.

On India-Iran relations, he said that both the countries share a common history, mythology, culture and trade. ""They share no hostility whatsoever. This is despite India voting against Iran in the UN on the nuclear issue in 2005. Actually, there has been no military conflict between India and Iran since the invasion of Nadir Shah in 1739. And after the opening of current avenues like joint gas and petrochemical projects, Chabahar sea port, bilateral relations between the two countries will embark on a fruitful voyage. InshaAllah!"" he concluded.

Like Dr Akbari, Professor Rahimpour of Tehran University dwelt on the importance of India-Iran relations in the changing equation of the new world order. He said that the testimony of heart-to-heart India-Iran relations is the plethora of Indo-Iranian architectural monuments in India. ""These monuments, especially the Taj Mahal, are like an Iranian soul in an Indian body,"" he emphasised. When this correspondent suggested that whether Iran will take a lead to help preserve these monuments in India, he promptly accepted the suggestion and promised to take it to the concerned authorities.

Later, we were taken to a tour and witnessed live proceedings of the Iranian Parliament. Despite a heated debate in the House, the Speaker rose from his chair to greet all of us. Then his advisor on international affairs, Dr Hossein Amirabdollahian, took us to high tea and an interactive session. He took almost all of our questions. On US sanctions on Iran, he said that 70 per cent of these curbs are psychological and only 30 per cent of them are biting them in Iran directly. He also said that US President Donald Trump personally wants to lift these sanctions as he is a businessman and wants to pursue his family trade interests in the Gulf region, including Iran. ""While his Republican predecessor George W. Bush had only oil on his mind when he invaded Iraq, Trump has other business calculations,"" he revealed.

When this correspondent asked about his opinion on the Kashmir issue, which was once addressed as a festering one by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, he said that both India and Pakistan must know that imperialist powers have their interest in sowing discord among developing nations. ""There are around 10 Kashmir-like disputes in the Gulf region, like the Oman-Saudi border issue, the Saudi-Kuwait border issue, and you know since 1917, Bahrain used to be a part of Iran. So, if we have to solve our problems, we must solve it ourselves. I believe Kashmir should be resolved bilaterally,"" he said.

WOMEN

Our first interaction with women in Tehran was with the receptionists at the hotel counter. They were smartly dressed as is expected of hotel staff, but when we strolled the streets later, we discovered that almost all of Iranian women dress similarly -- jeans with long overcoats and tidily wrapped headscarves. Headscarves are mandatory in Iran and if not worn properly, they may invite punishment. But dress doesn't stop Iranian women from dominating Iranian society. They overwhelm with their presence in almost all walks of life -- be it government jobs, private jobs, schools, colleges, markets, sports, and night hookah bars. They can be seen sharing some intimate moments with their beaus in public in some corner of the streets if you can spot them, though public displays of love are strictly forbidden in Iran.

Actually, curiosity about the conditions of women in Iran was on top of our minds when we interacted with almost everybody in Tehran. Questions about women were common ones. To answer some of these queries was invited to our hotel Dr Siddiqa Hijazi, chief of women's welfare in the Supreme Council for Cultural Relations, Iran.

Covered in chador (loose burqa) from top to toe, she presented a perfect picture of subjugated Iranian woman we would have imagined before we arrived in Iran as most of us outsiders believe. She jolted this myth. ""After the Islamic Revolution succeeded in Iran in 1979, the maximum propaganda against Iran has been centred around the conditions of its women,"" she started, adding that the Capitalist and Zionist media have always been afraid of portraying correct picture of women in Iran. ""They show as if women live in the dark ages in Iran. The reality is women were in dark ages during Reza. Shah Pehelvis's regime before 1979. The Shah is officially quoted as saying that women are only meant to provide enjoyment to men. His sister herself ran a drug smuggling racket. During his tenure, only a handful of powerful women enjoyed whatever we call human rights,"" she said.

She said that during the Shah's time, only 30 per cent of Iranian women were literate. ""Today more than 90 per cent of women are literate and their literacy rate is higher than that of men. Their life expectancy is 76 years as against 74 years for men. During the Shah's period, no record of women's health was maintained, today the health of almost every Iranian woman is taken care of. In fact, women are a majority among medical students in Iran,"" said Ms Hijazi.

She said that Iranian women lead in every walk of social and political life in the country. ""They are politicians, they are filmmakers, they are fashion designers, they are poets, they are writers, they are activists, and they are nuclear scientists. You name a field, we will name a woman expert there,"" said Ms Hijazi, with an air of utter pride.

She said that the Iranian-Islamic model of women's roles in society is centred around the importance of family. ""We are a family-oriented society. We put family values at the core of our social development. Our model is neither eastern nor western. It is a fine balance of both as the leader of the Islamic Revolution, Imam Khomeini, used to famously say 'neither West and nor East'. We follow this dictum,"" she said.

After Dr Hijazi's talk, as we took a post-dinner walk in an alley, we bumped into two young sisters running a cafeteria-cum-hookah (shisha) bar. As I told one of them that we just met a woman called Dr Hijazi and showed her Ms Hijazi's picture, she gave disdainful looks. ""See these women (like Dr Hijazi) are hypocrites. They may cover themselves from top to toe but they can't see the reality that they are as ambitious any other Iranian woman. The hijab or headscarves, which they have imposed on all Iranian girls and women, are treated as a punishment and not as a honourable choice,"" said the elder one. The younger one was more forthright and revealed that young Iranians do everything the clergy forbids them. ""Boys and girls hang out as you yourself can see here in this café. They go out dating. They sometimes even stay together in hotels and rented apartments. They have pre-marital sex. Many girls don't marry and prefer to stay single. Plus, even if they marry, couples usually end up separating after sometime. Divorce rates in urban Iran are quite high. Post-Islamic Revolution Iran is nothing but a charade. We probably were better off during the Shah's time,"" she said. But when this correspondent asked if women of Iran or Iranians were better during the Shah's time, why did they rise up in the revolution against the monarchy under the leadership of a theologian, she mumbled for an answer."

In its plea, DORE had challenged the Delhi government's July 27 circular in which it decided to fill all seats available under freeship quota and also the EWS category through computerised draw of lots after inviting online applications for admission to schools.

It had termed the decision as ""unjust and arbitrary"" and sought to restore manual or offline method of admission for students belonging to the EWS category.

'No Idling' campaign by the Lung Care Foundation, a not-for-profit organisation, aims at reducing air pollution around schools in Delhi-NCR and is likely to be launched this week.

The campaign is a part of the mandate of B.E.S.T. (Breathe Easy Stay Tough) Club school initiative and will target parents, drivers and others who idle their vehicles outside schools with engine on, said Abhishek Kumar, CEO of the Lung Care Foundation.

The duration of idling varies between 10-20 minutes and children are exposed to high levels of pollution right outside the school and in transit, Kumar said.

""Children are most susceptible to sudden spikes in the air pollution levels, which is over and above the high air pollution conditions that prevail in our city most parts of the year.

""When exposed to such spikes, children show temporary symptoms of phlegm and coughing, itchy eyes, headaches, allergy and sneezing. Prolonged exposure to such pollution spikes can lead to children developing asthma, bronchitis, poor mental and physical development,"" said Dr Arvind Kumar, chest surgeon and founder trustee of Lung Care Foundation.

Children volunteers will be roped in to form a human chain outside the pick-up and drop points of these schools along with a couple of major crossings around the area and give out key messages to parents, drivers and others to engage in responsible use of private vehicles. They will also promote use of school buses instead of own vehicles for commuting to school."

Though more than 100 sabhas are vying with each other to dish out a delectable fare for their rasikas with music, dance and drama, there are still murmurs that talented youngsters are not given a level playing field. We scan the Margazhi scene to understand what plagues the system, why the number of young rasikas is not increasing and more... While many sabhas prefer established and celebrity artistes, there are a few organisations that are trying their best to nurture youngsters. Deepu Mon of Giri Fine Arts says, ""We have been organising concerts and giving opportunities for youngsters for the past several years. It all started off in our showroom almost a decade ago and later, we took it to the temples. This year onwards, we have decided to conduct it as a 45-day festival in Mylapore, and 200 artistes will be performing at the fest."" Stating that their focus has been to promote uncelebrated professional youngsters, Deepu says that during the last several years, they were able to promote several budding artistes, including NRIs, through their programmes.

When talking about young talents, Mudhra's contribution cannot be ignored, say young artistes. Bhaskar, its secretary, says, ""With changing times, it's not easy to identify and promote real talent. In addition to the role of an organiser, we have a year-long programme to spot talent. With multiple auditions and strict merit-based scores, we ensure the best talents get opportunities to perform."" The selected artistes are given a chance to perform with established and veteran artistes, be as instrumentalists or singers. Bhaskar says that it gives them confidence and helps them learn from the veterans during a performance.

However, Lalitha Subramanian, an art critic, says that all is not well with the current system that's in place. She says, ""Music and dance flourished around temples. But with the advent of sabhas, except for Navarathri, no music concerts happen in temples. Due to this, a majority of ordinary people are deprived of an opportunity to listen to such concerts.""

Mentioning that it's the 'elite audience' who are making it to the concerts of celebrity musicians, she says, ""The tickets for such programmes are sold out months before the event, and the cost and availability of tickets make it a difficult proposition for the students to attend such concerts. Since the entire front rows and good seats are occupied by the patrons and elite, even if youngsters manage to attend concerts, they don't get to enjoy or understand the nuances from proximity. We can't blame them if they lose interest and stop attending these concerts under such circumstances.""

A cultural organiser, on condition of anonymity, says that money plays a major role in getting a performance slot these days. ""Everyone talks about lack of sponsorship, but most of the sabhas have big corporate names sponsoring them. Then, why should the organisers resort to taking money for giving opportunity?"" he asks. Another aspect he points out is that while the daytime slots, till 4.30pm, were set apart for youngsters earlier, the scenario has changed in the last couple of years. ""There is heavy competition for day slots and dancers have occupied most of them,"" he adds. Citing that it becomes monetarily viable for a troupe to buy slots and present group performances, it's not the case with musicians. ""A slot is now being sold for as high as '20,000. Considering the cost of hiring accompanists, a musician has to keep aside at least '1.5 lakh for a single performance,"" he adds, ""If not money, an artiste should be in a position to get the sabha a sponsor for the programme. This is true even for established artistes.""

However, sabha administrators rue that even if they allot slots to youngsters, there is no audience for such concerts. Saashwathi Prabhu, CEO of Sri Krishna Gana Sabha Trust, says, ""We want to encourage youngsters to come and enjoy the performances. Admission to our programmes, including those that happen in the main slots, is free for artistes and students. Students have to just show their school or college identity card and they will be allowed inside."" However, A Prabhu, secretary of the sabha, says that he is appalled to see that there is no growth in the number of youngsters attending the concerts. ""This is a worrying fact. Even after giving slots for youngsters at Kamakoti Hall and making all the performances there free, the number of young audiences attending these concerts is not increasing,"" he adds.

Lalitha says that today's students are torn between their regular studies and coaching classes. Also, there are several other forms of entertainment. Unless we invest time and effort to inculcate in them a taste for music, the young generation will never be interested in classical music, she says. She suggests, ""Instead of focusing on sabhas, musicians should reach out to students in schools and colleges and prepare them to enjoy classical music.""

Musician Anil Srinivasan, who has been propagating education through music, concurs, ""We have been doing exactly the same. We started our initiative Rhapsody Music Education in 2013. We have been associated with private, government and corporation schools and have been working with more than 2.5 lakhs students."" He says that they focus not only on Carnatic music, but all genres -- music for children. He says that they have been measuring the results in a data-driven way and the results have been very encouraging. ""I can see the transformation in students. It's like growing up with music; it's a part of the curriculum. Several hundreds of students are now interested to take up music as a profession and several youngsters are able to understand the nuances of becoming an artiste as well as a rasika,"" he adds. Highlighting that the present and future of music lies in collaboration, he says that he recently put up a performance in a city school with 220 students.

Ramanathan Iyer, founder of ARTery, says that they started Voice of Tomorrow in 2012 and the first concert series was held in Kalakshetra. ""We make sure that we put the effort to identify promising talents and offer them reputed venues,"" he says. Adding that the youngsters are carefully chosen, he says that sabhas and organisers have a responsibility towards youngsters. ""At present, most sabhas are outsourcing their talent selection. While having an artiste on the selection panel is welcome, outsourcing the artistes through them will pave the way for favouritism. They, for sure, would be having their own agendas, and in that way, the chances are very high that the real talents get sidelined,"" he points out. Stressing on the role sabhas and organisers should play, he says, ""They should go, listen to youngsters' kutcheris, and scout for talent from among promising disciples of artistes. There's no shortcut to it.""

Comparing the concerts of upcoming artistes to league matches in cricket, he says, ""League matches don't have much audience, but it's from those matches that talents are spotted and trained. Similarly, we should encourage youngsters and it's every sabha or organiser's responsibility."" Adding that sabhas should utilise the money they make from celebrity performances for promoting upcoming artistes, he says, ""It has become easy for talented youngsters to make a mark. Social media and online video streaming sites help them showcase their talent to a wide audience. The only flip side is that youngsters should not get carried away by the instant adulation they receive, and instead, work hard to increase their longevity to sustain in the scene."""

A Japanese medical school admitted rigging its entrance requirements in favor of men because ""women mentally mature faster.""

The private Juntendo University in Tokyo told a Monday press conference that it set lower pass marks for men in its entrance exams, which included an interview, the country's Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported.Women make up 21% of all Japan's doctors, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare

Juntendo University representatives said this was because female candidates tended to perform better in interviews, so the rigging was a ""measure to help"" their male counterparts.

Hiroyuki Daida, dean of Juntendo's medical school, said according to Asahi: ""Women mature faster mentally than men and their communication ability is also higher.""

""In some ways, this was a measure to help male applicants,"" he said.Juntendo officials also claimed that because there was limited space in the female dormitories, the school needed to limit the number of female students. The precise number of male and female dorms at the medical school is not clear.

Because of this policy, the university erroneously failed 165 people who sat its entrance exams in 2017 and 2018. This affected both men and women, but mostly women.

Officials on Monday said that it would accept 48 people from that batch - of which 47 were women - from 2019 onwards, and refund the entrance test fees for the remaining 117, the Japan Times reported.

Juntendo University President Hajime Arai said: ""At that time, we judged that the measure was reasonable at our university's discretion.""

""We won't do it from now on after being pointed out that our measure was inappropriate,"" he added.

Officials from Kitasato University, another medical school in Tokyo, also admitted to rigging entrance exam scores for men on Monday.They did not provide a reason, but admitted to prioritizing male applicants on its website, according to Asahi. They said they would set up a third-party committee to figure out next steps.

On Friday, Japan's education ministry also accused Juntendo and Kitasato, as well as eight other medical schools, of operating ""inappropriate entrance exams,"" Asahi reported.

This included allowing for a lower pass score for men, and discriminating against people based on their age and home address, Asahi said.

In August, investigators found that Tokyo Medical University, one of Japan's top medical schools, systematically altered admissions test scores to make sure women wouldn't get in.

The university marked down female applicants' scores to keep their numbers below 30% of the student body, the report found.

An unnamed source told the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper that the school invented the quota because it believed that women would ultimately use their training less because they would leave to become full-time mothers."

As Delhi fights pollution, a campaign seeks to make people aware about the harmful effects of keeping vehicles on ignition mode and encourage them to switch these off while waiting in and around schools.

'No Idling' campaign by the Lung Care Foundation, a not-for-profit organisation, aims at reducing air pollution around schools in Delhi-NCR and is likely to be launched this week.

The campaign is a part of the mandate of B.E.S.T. (Breathe Easy Stay Tough) Club school initiative and will target parents, drivers and others who idle their vehicles outside schools with engine on, said Abhishek Kumar, CEO of the Lung Care Foundation.

The duration of idling varies between 10-20 minutes and children are exposed to high levels of pollution right outside the school and in transit, Kumar said.

""Children are most susceptible to sudden spikes in the air pollution levels, which is over and above the high air pollution conditions that prevail in our city most parts of the year.

""When exposed to such spikes, children show temporary symptoms of phlegm and coughing, itchy eyes, headaches, allergy and sneezing. Prolonged exposure to such pollution spikes can lead to children developing asthma, bronchitis, poor mental and physical development,"" said Dr Arvind Kumar, chest surgeon and founder trustee of Lung Care Foundation.

The campaign will kick start with the first visual reach outbeing organised by B.E.S.T. Club of Bal Bharati Public School in Noida covering their own school and four other schools in their vicinity, said Matrushri P Shetty, director (programs & strategy) at the Lung Care Foundation.

Children volunteers will be roped in to form a human chain outside the pick-up and drop points of these schools along with a couple of major crossings around the area and give out key messages to parents, drivers and others to engage in responsible use of private vehicles. They will also promote use of school buses instead of own vehicles for commuting to school.

Chikara, a Class 12 student at Mother Khazani Convent School in Bawana -- from where the question paper was leaked -- rushed to her house and switched on the television.

""It was all over the news. It was my school. They were my teachers. How did this happen?"" recalled Chikara, adding that the incident took place on her first day of Class 12.

Though Chikara's batch has been allowed to appear for the Board exam to be held in 2019 along with the batch currently pursuing Class 10 from the school, the future of around 1,700 students studying in other classes is ""uncertain"". Reason: the school was de-affiliated by the CBSE after the paper leaked from its premises on March 26.

According to the police, the two teachers had opened the sealed question papers, took photos on their mobile phones and shared them with a tutor in a private coaching centre in Bawana. Later, the school principal was also arrested in connection with the case. The school had approached the Delhi high court against the board's decision. However, it has not received any relief from the court as of now and the matter is sub judice. The next hearing is scheduled on Monday.

Dalbeer Singh, the vice-chairperson of the school, said that as many as 660 students have left the school after the incident. ""The strength of our school has come down from 2,375 to 1,715 in the last seven months. There is a mass exodus from Class 11. Around 50% of students have left after Class 10 this year. There is a sense of uncertainty over the

existence of the school among parents of students studying up to Class 8 and those in Class 10 because they will have to shift to some other school if we do not get a stay from the high court,"" he said.

For Deepanshu Dahiya, a Class 10 student, even the idea of switching schools is ""terrifying"". ""I am studying here in since

Class 5. All my friends and teachers are here. My parents have started shortlisting schools for me but I don't think I will be able to adjust anywhere else easily,"" he said.

Similarly, 13-year-old Palak Rana, a class 8 student at the school, said, ""I have been studying in this school since nursery. Why do I need to suffer because of the deeds of two teachers who are no more a part of our school?"" she said.

Amid the paper leaks, the arrests, the de-affiliation and the court case, the students are the ones who have suffered the most, said Sanjay Singh, Economics teacher at the school. Police had said the two teachers had allegedly shared the leaked paper with their students as well. But Singh denied the claim.

""It's not that the result of our students was bad. The highest score in Economics in 2016-17 was 96% and the overall pass percentage was 90. None of our students had seen the paper before their exam. I don't understand who those teachers were trying to help,"" he said.

Officials said that the school is known for sports activities. ""Our Class 12 student Mohit Jhangra plays for the Under 19 India team which recently won the World Cup. Our students are known for contributions in football and kabbadi. The CBSE held its All India Kabaddi Tournament at our campus in 2016. We have grounds and space for every sport here. If the school loses the affiliation, all this would have been in vain,"" said Dalbeer Singh.

While officials of CBSE denied comment saying that the matter is ""sub judice"", those at the Delhi government's Directorate of Education (DoE) said that they are looking into the matter. ""The directorate had issued a show cause notice to which a reply has been received. An inquiry is underway,"" said a DoE official.

Meanwhile, Singh said that if the school gets a stay from the court, it will never apply for the board examination centre again. ""We can't revert whatever has already happened here. Because of two persons, the future of around 1,700 students and 100 teaching and non-teaching staff members are at stake. We, too, are apprehensive about being an examination centre again. I hope that those who did the crime are punished and the students spared,"" he said."

""DDA had committed to provide 4,000 sq metre land for the school, which has been operating out of Eidgah since 1976 in Ballimaran. But now, it is saying it will allot just 1,600 sq metre and reduce the number of classes instead. It is planning to give just a lane for the school, which is not acceptable,"" said Sisodia. The 4,000 sq metre land is minimum requisition of master plan 2021 for building a school.

Sisodia said there was a direction from the lieutenant governor that classes XI and XII be shut down, and the government was not consulted on the matter. DDA comes under LG Anil Baijal. Sisodia lashed out at DDA for being ""anti-education"".

At a DDA meeting held on Friday, the proposal to give 1,600 sq ft for the school was moved, which the AAP MLA Somnath Bharati had opposed.

""Again, BJP has proved its anti-education stand. They want our country to remain illiterate. Prime Minister Narendra Modi (ji) why is your party against education? BJP has a plan to give it to the parking mafia,"" asked Sisodia.

Those first days in Delhi were incredibly trying, as my parents negotiated with plumbers, electricians, maids, milkmen and every person you interface to set up a home. Each of these encounters was stressful, done in person, them speaking their rather atrocious Hindi, and broadly overpaying for almost every service. Fortunately for me, I soon left for my B-School, leaving Delhi behind but for the occasional home visit.

Two decades later, I moved back to Noida, which neighbours Delhi, with my family. It is four years since the move, and I still keep getting questions such as, whether I have adjusted, how easy it was to settle down, etc.

The fact is, settling in was largely a breeze. I keep thinking as to what changed in these two decades to make the transition and settling down smooth? Yes, higher incomes certainly helped, but it isn't that alone. There were two other factors at play. First, I shifted into a gated complex. And second I arrived at a city where the internet and mobile phone had created a large market for app-driven services such as Uber, UrbanClap, etc.

These two matter, for increasingly, we no longer interact with the city as we did before, by visiting markets and transacting directly with its denizens. Instead we now interact and interpret the city through apps or automated service requests in our gated communities. What gated communities and apps, and our relative affluence -- all of which are interlinked -- have done is to make most of these daily interactions and negotiations relatively friction-free.

Where my father interacted with plumbers and carpenters, I just needed to call up the society office of my gated community or use UrbanClap. Where earlier my father struggled with contract buses, I used Uber. Unlike earlier, we now interact with people and experience the city through an invisible tech layer which now intermediates our interactions with urban India.

Binu Karunakaran, a poet, who I was chatting with about this jokingly told me that I had become an 'Appizen' of Delhi, as opposed to a citizen. It is an apt description for a certain kind of Indo-Anglian, flitting relatively friction-free across Mumbai, Gurgaon, Bengaluru, Pune etc. We reside in but no longer truly live in these cities, shutting out the chaos, squalor and poverty of urban India. What these sanitised interactions mean is that we now are unable to interact with and experience the city as it truly is, or as our parents or past selves did before.

It is as if we have built for ourselves a perch above and across these cities in which to reside in. When we move across cities we effectively move in this upper layer and seamlessly settle down. It also helps that increasingly Indian cities look like clones of each other. The same common brands of shops and even restaurants, hospitals and schools operate across these cities, such as a Social or a Fortis or a DPS.

And as the number of Indo-Anglians increases, we are getting broadly similar across cities.

There are regional differences, but over time the urban elite is coalescing into a cosmopolitan pan-Indian pool. We happily reside in the city and use its services, without truly inhabiting it. We use technology and exclusion to create safe sanitised spaces far removed from the squalor and deprivation of urban India. If in the '90s only really affluent Indians could truly exclude themselves from the misery of India, today, technology allows more and more of us to exclude ourselves, or secede from the mess and chaos of India.

We thus become a group similar to NRIs, who secede themselves physically from the chaos of the Indian state but stay vested mentally in the country. They insert themselves in local politics, culture wars etc, even though they have no stake in it.

Recently, Manu Joseph published an interesting essay titled 'Escaping India within India'. Affluent Indians, he said, pursue islands of affluence, by creating private spaces where they can exclude other Indians, largely on the grounds of wealth, but also on the basis of caste.

This isn't unique to India. Extremely unequal societies such as Brazil and South Africa have this too, ostensibly on grounds of safety. What is interesting is how in India, a layer below the elite has used wealth, education, technology, all of it inter-related to exclude themselves from cities; to escape from India, to the Republic of Indo-Angliana. sp@sajithpai.comtweet @sajithpai"

This new formation, floated by combining the Marxist-Ambedkarite forces in Telangana with a new slogan ""Jai Bheem Lal Salam"", is likely to decide the fate of a significant number of candidates in the December 7 Assembly elections. The Bahujan Left Front is in the fray in 109 out of the state's 119 seats (after 10 nominations were rejected), and is likely to play the role the Bahujan Samaj Party did in Uttar Pradesh before 1994.

This attitude - that the children of the working class and agrarian farm labour must carry the flag of linguistic nationalism by studying in regional language schools while their own children gain an education in English - is no different from that of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's language nationalism.

In Telangana, however, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has agreed to the demand of people that English should be made the medium of instruction in all classes in all government schools. The people in villages know that education in English is the key to a better future for their children. The Bahujan Left Front is getting a lot of support from rural folk ahead of voting day because of their election promise.

During our discussion, I also asked Sarkar why there was not a single Dalit or Adivasi leader in his party's politburo? His casual answer shocked me. ""We do not believe in picking up leaders,"" he said. ""They should emerge with a merit of their own. We do not believe in caste-based identity leadership."" Other English-speaking intellectuals from West Bengal and Tripura also talk along the same lines.

Communist leaders who claim that they recognise class but not caste have already done considerable damage in India and continue to do so. Politically, the Bharatiya Janata Party has attempted to corner the communists on this issue several times, particularly after Narendra Modi took over as prime minister. For instance, the BJP keeps asking why there are no Dalit or Adivasi leaders in the Communist Party of India (Marxist)'s top policy-making body.

Communist leaders are supposed to be the most pro-poor. But they do not even seem to realise that their own names carry tags of their so-called higher castes. Sarkar (Manik), Bhattacharya (Buddhadeb), Basu (Jyothi), Mitra (Ashok) indicate caste background. I mentioned these names because they are well known communist leaders past and present. Does anyone find last names such as Sarkar, Bhattacharya, Basu, Mitra among the Shudras (Other Backward Classes), Namashudhras (Dalits) and Adivasis in West Bengal or Tripura?

The earliest English-educated Brahmins of Bengal like Raja Ram Mohan Roy (who initiated the Bengali renaissance), Manabendra Nath Roy (the founder of the Communist Party of India) have their caste tags too. But that was a different stage of history.

If the communists believed in de-classing themselves they should have also initiated a process of de-casting themselves. Caste and family names are inherited generation to generation as is property. In fact, caste inheritance is much more deep-rooted than property inheritance in India. Indian communists, who took the theory of class struggle from the writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels' to fight for for socio-economic change and transformation, could have evolved their own theory of caste struggle.

It is a fact that because of the caste system, most of the Shudras, Ati-Shudras and Adivasis in united Bengal embraced Islam. This led to an increase in the population of Muslims and the subsequent division of Bengal. Yet Bengali communist intellectuals still did not examine the caste system seriously. They refused to recognise Ambedkar's theory of caste for a long time. Even now they do not seem to engage with Ambedkar's annihilation of caste theory seriously. Their understanding of merit is no different from that of the non-communist upper caste leaders and intellectuals.

The casual attitude of communist leaders towards caste discrimination and the lack of leaders from the oppressed castes in their ranks is worrisome. For instance, the communists have ruled both West Bengal and Tripura for several years, but a middle class from the Shudras or Namasudras has not emerged in these two states. The educated middle class in these states have not thrown up even one communist leader worthy of being a member of the politburo.

All this helps the BJP and the RSS to attract Dalits, Adivasis and Shudras into their fold. They are consciously promoting Hinduised members of these communities to leadership positions in West Bengal and Tripura. At present, the BJP is focusing on capturing West Bengal as it is already ruling Tripura, having taken over in June, ending 25 years of Left rule.

In West Bengal, the communists should have realised their mistake at least after being voted out of power after 34 years in 2011. But they seem to be quite indifferent to it. The inability of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) to develop a single leader from the Dalit or Adivasi community is also a comment on the incapacity of its own leaders, and indicates that its leadership is not as meritorious as it claims to be. It is time that communist leaders see merit among the meritless and understand the role of caste in their own consciousness.

The Communist Party of India is free from this problem to some extent as D Raja, a Dalit leader, is part of the party's top leadership. However, members of the Dalit and Adivasi communities are unhappy with the approach of communist leaders towards caste discrimination overall."

The sad news shook the conscience of those in academia who resorted to social media to discuss the legal and ethical aspects of private educational institutions withholding certificates. It is learnt that a few of them even wrote to the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) highlighting the problems encountered by employees who struggle to get their certificates back when they need to move to a better job. The impact is that now the AICTE has issued a public notice stating that it is illegal and unethical to withhold employees' certificates. It has even issued a warning that it would withdraw the approval given to the colleges that flout the rule.

Violating rules

Most private educational institutions (schools, technical institutes, colleges, deemed-to-be universities, and so on.) retain their staff's academic certificates at the time of issuing employment contracts to them. Some institutions collect all the certificates including mark sheets and retain them, making it really hard for the staff to apply for any other job during the academic year. It is true employees have a tough time recovering their certificates from their employers in many educational institutions, when they decide to quit their jobs. Many have to forego their better prospects as they are not able to recover their documents in time.

Is this problem unique in India? Yes, it seems to be. I worked abroad for five years. At the time of recruitment, my certificates were verified by the Educational Consultants India Ltd (EdCIL), Noida and during my service at the Kigali Institute of Science, Technology and Management, Rwanda, my academic certificates were quite safe at home in India. There were over 50 expatriates at the Institute and there was not a single case of anyone quitting the job without proper notice.

Indians who run educational institutions in Gulf countries retain all the original documents including the passports of expatriate staff. I have heard numerous tragic stories of Indian expatriates working in Indian schools who could not visit India when their presence at home very much needed. Isn't withholding one's passport a human rights violation? Yes, it is.

Is it a good practice to withhold teachers' academic certificates and other original documents? Why do educational institutions indulge in such practices? I discussed this issue with some heads and administrators of some private educational institutions. A Principal of a well-known school said, ""We retain the certificates of our staff only for security reasons. We do face problems when a teacher quits our school in the middle of an academic year. To prevent them from quitting we have to keep their original documents with us."" When I countered her with the question whether it would be difficult to find a replacement for anyone who resigned if the institution paid a competitive and decent pay to the staff and created a good working environment for them, she just flashed a smile. Yes, finding a suitable replacement is not at all difficult as there are many well-qualified and good teachers waiting for well-paid jobs.

Make changes

Here is a different view. Another head of an educational institution said, ""Teachers should not be treated as bonded labourers. Instead of keeping possession of any teacher's original documents and certificates, educational institutions should issue employment contracts in which all terms and conditions are clearly specified. The contracts are signed by the employer and the employee and be honoured by both the parties.""

When teachers serving in government educational institutions and employees working in companies keep their original certificates with them, why shouldn't those who work in private educational institutions be allowed to keep their original documents with them? The fact that there are some rare cases of teachers absconding should not make employers distrust every teacher. Academic certificates are the intellectual property of those who have received specific education after years of study and hard work. Therefore, the certificates should be with the owner and not with anyone else.

Employers can always state that they retain the certificates of employees with the latter's consent. If there is a rule which specifies clearly that even with the consent of employees, employers should not keep possession of employees' academic certificates, then employees will be safer. In the absence of such enforcement of laws, employees will have to be at the mercy of their employers.

Employers need not keep possession of any employee's certificates for these reasons: i) Employees are at the receiving end because they have to get service certificates from the employer. At times, the employer serves as a referee when any employee quits the organisation and joins some other organisation. ii) If the employee has signed an employment contract s/he has to abide by the terms and conditions in the contract and legal action can be initiated by the employer against any employee who violates the contract. iii) No employee will dare to quit an organisation without proper notice because s/he has to get many other formalities completed before joining another organisation.

Retaining good teachers and not retaining the academic certificates of teachers should be the motto of educational institutions. Certificates are the intellectual property of those own them. Retaining the certificates of employees is akin to depriving them of their rights to own their property. It is true employees need jobs and at the same time employers need employees. Without employees, the word ""employer"" is meaningless. Both employers and employees are mutually dependent on each other. Employees need not be at the mercy of employers. Good employers make employees feel that they are co-workers and not servants. Therefore, they should have mutual trust and respect for each other.

Employers should be benevolent and happily bid farewell to any employee who decides to quit their job in order to move on to greener pastures. When will our educational institutions show such a gesture of goodwill?"

As mandated by the directorate of education, the schools have prescribed upper age limits this year. Children who have crossed four, five and six years will not be eligible for admission to nursery, KG and Class I, respectively.

The registration process that starts from Saturday is for the general category seats, which constitute 75% of the total available in each school. The remaining 25% are reserved for children belonging to the economically weaker sections/disadvantaged categories. Also, in the 75% itself, 20% of the seats are meant for the management quota and 5% for the wards of staffers. The last date for submitting the application is January 7.

DoE is yet to release the schedule for EWS seats, the admissions for which are carried out in a centralised manner by the state government. Like in the previous years, the maximum number of points have been allotted under the neighbourhood criterion, which means the distance between the school and the place of residence of the child. Sibling/alumni is another yardstick followed by most schools.

Some other schools have their own formula. The Indian School, for example, gives some points to the firstborn child, whereas Ahlcon International School gives weight to single parents.

In most schools, the forms are to be submitted online.

Nursery admission is a taxing process for most parents. This year, the upper age limit has put the parents who missed the bus last year under further pressure. ""This time, the admission process is starting on a Saturday. So, it gives me time to sit down and figure out rules of different schools. I will spend the weekend to figure out how to fill up these forms,"" Shiven Sharma, a parent, told TOI. Sharma lives in Saket and plans to apply to all schools nearby. Due to unequitable distribution of schools, a greater rush is seen in the bigger private schools.

""The closest options are Amity International and New Green Field School. But I will also apply in schools in Pushp Vihar,"" he said.

DoE had asked schools to submit their admission criteria by December 14. ""There are 1,696 schools where the admission process has to take place. There are a few schools that have not uploaded their details. We will sort this out on Saturday and take action accordingly,"" DoE director Sanjay Goel said."

Illustration: Uttam Ghosh/Rediff.com

For 27-year-old Chaman Singh, the business of milk and dairying runs in his blood.

His forefathers have been milk suppliers and cattle farmers. Now, Singh is thinking of quitting this inherited business.

""I took a loan of around Rs 200,000 to modernise the business. Once that is repaid next year, I am seriously considering leaving the dairy business,"" he said.

The reasons for his planned exit capture the pressures in one of India's stellar agri-businesses today.

Cheap milk prices, rising fodder cost and the difficulties in buying new cattle and selling old ones on account of cow vigilantism have cast a triple shadow on this sunshine sector in Indian agriculture.

As with other agri-commodities, falling milk prices are the result of sustained over-production.

Between 2008-09 and 2017-18, India's milk production rose a staggering 57 per cent.

So much so, that even during the drought years of 2009, 2014 and 2015, milk production didn't fall, unlike all other farm commodities.

This steady increase in output has not only made the country the world's largest milk producer but also a big player in the global dairy and milk products markets.

But the jump in production has not been matched by adequate avenues to absorb the surplus. As a result, wholesale milk prices have plunged.

Traditionally, surpluses could be disposed of in the export market. But the plunge in global commodity markets has impacted skimmed milk powder (SMP) exports, too.

According to Global Dairy Trade, global SMP prices have more than halved, from $4,868 per tonne in December 2013 to around $1,965 per tonne in November 2018.

The impact of this sharp price fall can be seen in India's SMP exports. India usually exported around 100,000 tonnes of SMP annually. This has fallen to a trickle of less than 15,000 tonnes.

At the start of the flush season in July, India's big private dairies and thousands of cooperatives, which transformed a once milk-deficit country, had unsold milk stocks of over 150,000 tonnes.

No surprise then that the milk purchases, which started in October, were lower, driving down prices even further.

In north India, Singh says, buffalo milk is selling at Rs 32-33 a litre and cow milk for Rs 20-22 a litre, 30 per cent and 40 per cent below 2016 prices, respectively (surprisingly, retail prices have fallen only Rs 1-2 per litre in select cities).

""Earlier, a cow, which has an average yield of, say, 4 litres of milk a day, could fetch us almost Rs 200. Today, those earnings are not even Rs 150, while fodder costs have doubled.

""That is why the entire business has turned unprofitable,"" says former army man Satpal Malik, a farmer who runs a small dairy business with 16 cows and seven buffaloes on the outskirts of Delhi.

One solution to this problem of plenty in the dairy industry is to create new demand, especially via the myriad public food distribution schemes.

""If the government buys 200,000 tonnes of SMP from companies and cooperatives and distributes it through mid-day meal scheme in government schools or sends it to Africa as aid, much of the surplus problem could be solved,"" said Pushpendra Singh, leader of Kisan Shakti Sangh, a farmers' organisation.

Such alternative distribution channels could solve the economic problem associated with dairying but not the social stigma associated with transporting, purchase and sale of cattle that is turning out to be a bigger evil.

The cow vigilante movement, which has been gathering pace since the 2015 lynching of a man in his home on the outskirts of the capital, is taking its toll.

Recently, two incidents of cow vigilantes attacking a truck carrying cows and buffaloes were reported from Kathua. A police inspector was among two people killed in violence over cow slaughter in Bulandshahr.

The fear of being attacked by cow vigilantes has raised the risks of transporting cattle and pushed up bovine prices across the country, Uttar Pradesh in particular.

""In north India, because of the menace of gau rakshaks, the cost of a good quality buffalo, which gives an average of 10 litres of milk a day, has gone up to Rs 60,000-70,000 from Rs 35,000-40,000 in 2011.

""For good quality cows, prices have risen from around Rs 20,000 to nearly Rs 70,000-100,000,"" says Mohan Singh Ahluwalia, a member of the Central Animal Welfare Board.

Ahluwalia, a former president of ""Gwala Gaddi"", a grouping of small milk farmers, added that bovine purchase prices have risen even as selling prices of old bovine have dropped sharply because nobody wants to take the risk of owning cattle, narrowing the scope for fresh investments for the dairy farmer.

Earlier, old, infirm, non-milch cattle would have been sold at Rs 10,000-20,000 in the market. Nowadays, old cattle wouldn't even fetch Rs 1,000, Ahluwalia said.

""We used to sell old cows and buffaloes to butchers and get some money in return, which was invested for buying new, healthy cattle.

""These days, no one is willing to buy old cows or buffaloes, so we are forced to leave them in jungles because we can't afford to carry on feeding them,"" Singh added.

The number of gaushalas or cowsheds where old and infirm cattle can be sent once they stop giving milk are inadequate and those that do exist have poor facilities.

In Madhya Pradesh, for instance, cows from a local gaushala are released into farmers' fields at night, destroying their crops.

The long-term prognosis, therefore, looks grim.

""If you keep adding factors that are cost-imposing, India's milk producers won't remain competitive in the global markets and if there isn't any growth in demand, your natural growth in milk production will suffer,"" said T Nandakumar, a former agriculture secretary and ex-chairman of National Dairy Development Board (NDDB).

In such a situation, he added, the bovine population may not fall but farmers will underfeed the animals, causing them to produce less milk, which will impact overall output.

Given that most cattle farming is done in India by small, landless farmers, the situation could get acute for them unless the Centre and state governments move quickly to shore up the business -- both in terms of its basic economics and the societal issues that are acting as an additional disincentive.

On current reckoning, India's most successful agriculture story in the last decade after BT Cotton is in danger of losing the plot."

While most schools are selling forms online, some will also sell forms at its premises for the convenience of parents. The last date for submission of the forms is January 7, 2019.

The first list of selected candidates will be uploaded by the schools on their websites on February 4, 2019. Between February 5 and February 12, parents can take up their queries pertaining to point allotment with the grievance redressal and monitoring cells set up by the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) in all districts. Similar process will be followed if a second list is released.

While most schools have given heavy priority to neighbourhood (distance), siblings and alumni while allotting points in their eligibility criteria, some have also considered first child, girl child, single parent and legally adopted child. For instance, GD Goenka School in Vasant Vihar is giving preference to single parents.

The schools have fixed these criteria for their 50% to 75% general category entry-level seats. The schedule for the 25% seats reserved for the economically weaker section (EWS) and disadvantaged (DG) categories will be announced in the coming weeks and the process will be conducted centrally by the DoE.

This year, the DoE has fixed an upper age limit of 4, 5 and 6 years as on March 31, 2019, for admission in nursery, kindergarten (KG) and class 1, respectively. The admission for KG and class 1 will be held simultaneously on the basis of vacancies in these classes in each school.

Most schools have also granted heavy weightage to distance, either in terms of kilometres or areas where the schools provide transport facilities. For instance, Bhal Bharti School in Pitampura has fixed 50 points for candidates residing within 0-3 km range. Similarly, Shri Ram School in Vasant Vihar and Delhi Public School in RK Puram have given 50 and 40 points, respectively, to the distance criteria.

The DoE had given the schools autonomy to decide their own criteria for admission, and upload them on DoE's website by December 14. But it had also warned schools not to include 50 listed criteria -- such as parents' education, profession, income, food habits, and written or oral interviews of both students and parents -- abolished by the Delhi government in 2016.

However, in complete disregard of the DoE guidelines, some schools have been found giving preference to parents eating habits, spoken language and children's adhaar cards. ""We are yet to compile the data on the criteria set by these schools. Strict action will be taken against those who are violating the norms,"" a DoE official said.

For the third time in a row, the Salwan School in Rajendra Nagar has barred parents with more than two children from seeking admission for their wards in nursery. ""We have been fixing this criterion for the last three years as our contribution to curb rising population in the country,"" said chairperson of the Salwan groups, Sushil Salwan."

She just wanted to know why.

She knew that her cancer, mesothelioma, arose in the delicate membrane surrounding her lungs and other organs. She knew it was as rare as it was deadly, a signature of exposure to asbestos. And she knew it afflicted mostly men who inhaled asbestos dust in mines and industries such as shipbuilding that used the carcinogen before its risks were understood.

Coker, 52 years old, had raised two daughters and was running a massage school in Lumberton, a small town in eastern Texas. How had she been exposed to asbestos? ""She wanted answers,"" her daughter Cady Evans said.

Fighting for every breath and in crippling pain, Coker hired Herschel Hobson, a personal-injury lawyer. He homed in on a suspect: the Johnson's Baby Powder that Coker had used on her infant children and sprinkled on herself all her life. Hobson knew that talc and asbestos often occurred together in the earth, and that mined talc could be contaminated with the carcinogen. Coker sued Johnson & Johnson <JNJ.N>, alleging that ""poisonous talc"" in the company's beloved product was her killer.

J&J denied the claim. Baby Powder was asbestos-free, it said. As the case proceeded, J&J was able to avoid handing over talc test results and other internal company records Hobson had requested to make the case against Baby Powder.

Coker had no choice but to drop her lawsuit, Hobson said. ""When you are the plaintiff, you have the burden of proof,"" he said. ""We didn't have it.""

That was in 1999. Two decades later, the material Coker and her lawyer sought is emerging as J&J has been compelled to share thousands of pages of company memos, internal reports and other confidential documents with lawyers for some of the 11,700 plaintiffs now claiming that the company's talc caused their cancers -- including thousands of women with ovarian cancer.

A Reuters examination of many of those documents, as well as deposition and trial testimony, shows that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, the company's raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos, and that company executives, mine managers, scientists, doctors and lawyers fretted over the problem and how to address it while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public.

The documents also depict successful efforts to influence U.S. regulators' plans to limit asbestos in cosmetic talc products and scientific research on the health effects of talc.

A small portion of the documents have been produced at trial and cited in media reports. Many were shielded from public view by court orders that allowed J&J to turn over thousands of documents it designated as confidential. Much of their contents is reported here for the first time.

""RATHER HIGH""

The earliest mentions of tainted J&J talc that Reuters found come from 1957 and 1958 reports by a consulting lab. They describe contaminants in talc from J&J's Italian supplier as fibrous and ""acicular,"" or needle-like, tremolite. That's one of the six minerals that in their naturally occurring fibrous form are classified as asbestos.

At various times from then into the early 2000s, reports by scientists at J&J, outside labs and J&J's supplier yielded similar findings. The reports identify contaminants in talc and finished powder products as asbestos or describe them in terms typically applied to asbestos, such as ""fiberform"" and ""rods.""

In 1976, as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was weighing limits on asbestos in cosmetic talc products, J&J assured the regulator that no asbestos was ""detected in any sample"" of talc produced between December 1972 and October 1973. It didn't tell the agency that at least three tests by three different labs from 1972 to 1975 had found asbestos in its talc - in one case at levels reported as ""rather high.""

Most internal J&J asbestos test reports Reuters reviewed do not find asbestos. However, while J&J's testing methods improved over time, they have always had limitations that allow trace contaminants to go undetected - and only a tiny fraction of the company's talc is tested.

The World Health Organization and other authorities recognise no safe level of exposure to asbestos. While most people exposed never develop cancer, for some, even small amounts of asbestos are enough to trigger the disease years later. Just how small hasn't been established. Many plaintiffs allege that the amounts they inhaled when they dusted themselves with tainted talcum powder were enough.

The evidence of what J&J knew has surfaced after people who suspected that talc caused their cancers hired lawyers experienced in the decades-long deluge of litigation involving workers exposed to asbestos. Some of the lawyers knew from those earlier cases that talc producers tested for asbestos, and they began demanding J&J's testing documentation.

What J&J produced in response to those demands has allowed plaintiffs' lawyers to refine their argument: The culprit wasn't necessarily talc itself, but also asbestos in the talc. That assertion, backed by decades of solid science showing that asbestos causes mesothelioma and is associated with ovarian and other cancers, has had mixed success in court.

In two cases earlier this year - in New Jersey and California - juries awarded big sums to plaintiffs who, like Coker, blamed asbestos-tainted J&J talc products for their mesothelioma.

A third verdict, in St. Louis, was a watershed, broadening J&J's potential liability: The 22 plaintiffs were the first to succeed with a claim that asbestos-tainted Baby Powder and Shower to Shower talc, a longtime brand the company sold in 2012, caused ovarian cancer, which is much more common than mesothelioma. The jury awarded them $4.69 billion in damages. Most of the talc cases have been brought by women with ovarian cancer who say they regularly used J&J talc products as a perineal antiperspirant and deodorant.

At the same time, at least three juries have rejected claims that Baby Powder was tainted with asbestos or caused plaintiffs' mesothelioma. Others have failed to reach verdicts, resulting in mistrials.

""JUNK"" SCIENCE

J&J has said it will appeal the recent verdicts against it. It has maintained in public statements that its talc is safe, as shown for years by the best tests available, and that the information it has been required to divulge in recent litigation shows the care the company takes to ensure its products are asbestos-free. It has blamed its losses on juror confusion, ""junk"" science, unfair court rules and overzealous lawyers looking for a fresh pool of asbestos plaintiffs.

""Plaintiffs' attorneys out for personal financial gain are distorting historical documents and intentionally creating confusion in the courtroom and in the media,"" Ernie Knewitz, J&J's vice president of global media relations, wrote in an emailed response to Reuters' findings. ""This is all a calculated attempt to distract from the fact that thousands of independent tests prove our talc does not contain asbestos or cause cancer. Any suggestion that Johnson & Johnson knew or hid information about the safety of talc is false.""

J&J declined to comment further for this article. For more than two months, it turned down repeated requests for an interview with J&J executives. On Dec. 8, the company offered to make an expert available. It had not done so as of Thursday evening.

The company referred all inquiries to its outside litigation counsel, Peter Bicks. In emailed responses, Bicks rejected Reuters' findings as ""false and misleading."" ""The scientific consensus is that the talc used in talc-based body powders does not cause cancer, regardless of what is in that talc,"" Bicks wrote. ""This is true even if - and it does not - Johnson & Johnson's cosmetic talc had ever contained minute, undetectable amounts of asbestos."" He dismissed tests cited in this article as ""outlier"" results.

In court, J&J lawyers have told jurors that company records showing that asbestos was detected in its talc referred to talc intended for industrial use. Other records, they have argued, referred to non-asbestos forms of the same minerals that their experts say are harmless. J&J has also argued that some tests picked up ""background"" asbestos - stray fibers that could have contaminated samples after floating into a mill or lab from a vehicle clutch or fraying insulation.

The company has made some of the same arguments about lab tests conducted by experts hired by plaintiffs. One of those labs found asbestos in Shower to Shower talc from the 1990s, according to an Aug. 11, 2017, court report. Another lab found asbestos in more than half of multiple samples of Baby Powder from past decades - in bottles from plaintiffs' cupboards and acquired from eBay, and even a 1978 bottle held in J&J's corporate museum. The concentrations were great enough that users ""would have, more likely than not, been exposed,"" the plaintiffs' lab report presented in several cases this year concluded.

Matthew Sanchez, a geologist with consultants RJ Lee Group Inc and a frequent expert witness for J&J, dismissed those findings in testimony in the St. Louis trial: ""I have not found asbestos in any of the current or modern, what I consider modern, Johnson & Johnson talc products,"" Sanchez told the jury.

Sanchez did not return calls seeking comment. RJ Lee said it does not comment on the work it does for clients.

Since 2003, talc in Baby Powder sold in the United States has come from China through supplier Imerys Talc America, a unit of Paris-based Imerys SA and a co-defendant in most of the talc litigation. Imerys and J&J said the Chinese talc is safe. An Imerys spokesman said the company's tests ""consistently show no asbestos. Talc's safe use has been confirmed by multiple regulatory and scientific bodies.""

J&J, based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, has dominated the talc powder market for more than 100 years, its sales outpacing those of all competitors combined, according to Euromonitor International data. And while talc products contributed just $420 million to J&J's $76.5 billion in revenue last year, Baby Powder is considered an essential facet of the healthcare-products maker's carefully tended image as a caring company - a ""sacred cow,"" as one 2003 internal email put it.

""When people really understand what's going on, I think it increases J&J's exposure a thousand-fold,"" said Mark Lanier, one of the lawyers for the women in the St. Louis case.

The mounting controversy surrounding J&J talc hasn't shaken investors. The share price is up about 6 percent so far this year. Talc cases make up fewer than 10 percent of all personal injury lawsuits pending against J&J, based on the company's Aug. 2 quarterly report, in which the company said it believed it had ""strong grounds on appeal.""

J&J Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky has pledged to fight on, telling analysts in July: ""We remain confident that our products do not contain asbestos.""

Gorsky's comment, echoed in countless J&J statements, misses a crucial point. Asbestos, like many environmental carcinogens, has a long latency period. Diagnosis usually comes years after initial exposure - 20 years or longer for mesothelioma. J&J talc products today may be safe, but the talc at issue in thousands of lawsuits was sold and used over the past 60 years.

""SAFETY FIRST""

In 1886, Robert Wood Johnson enlisted his younger brothers in an eponymous startup built around the ""Safety First"" motto. Johnson's Baby Powder grew out of a line of medicated plasters, sticky rubber strips loaded with mustard and other home remedies. When customers complained of skin irritation, the brothers sent packets of talc.

Soon, mothers began applying the talc to infants' diaper-chafed skin. The Johnsons took note. They added a fragrance that would become one of the most recognizable in the world, sifted the talc into tin boxes and, in 1893, began selling it as Johnson's Baby Powder.

In the late 1950s, J&J discovered that talc from its chief source mine for the U.S. market in the Italian Alps contained tremolite. That's one of six minerals - along with chrysotile, actinolite, amosite, anthophyllite and crocidolite - that occur in nature as crystalline fibers known as asbestos, a recognised carcinogen. Some of them, including tremolite, also occur as unremarkable ""non-asbestiform"" rocks. Both forms often occur together and in talc deposits.

J&J's worry at the time was that contaminants made the company's powder abrasive. It sent tons of its Italian talc to a private lab in Columbus, Ohio, to find ways to improve the appearance, feel and purity of the powder by removing as much ""grit"" as possible. In a pair of reports from 1957 and 1958, the lab said the talc contained ""from less than 1 percent to about 3 percent of contaminants,"" described as mostly fibrous and ""acicular"" tremolite.

Most of the authors of these and other J&J records cited in this article are dead. Sanchez, the RJ Lee geologist whose firm has agreed to provide him as a witness in up to 100 J&J talc trials, has testified that tremolite found decades ago in the company's talc, from Italy and later Vermont, was not tremolite asbestos at all. Rather, he has said, it was ""cleavage fragments"" from non-asbestiform tremolite.

J&J's original records don't always make that distinction. In terms of health risk, regulators since the early 1970s have treated small fiber-shaped particles of both forms the same.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, for example, ""makes no distinction between fibers and (comparable) cleavage fragments,"" agency officials wrote in a response to an RJ Lee report on an unrelated matter in 2006, the year before the firm hired Sanchez. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), though it dropped the non-fibrous forms of the minerals from its definition of asbestos in 1992, nonetheless recommends that fiber-shaped fragments indistinguishable from asbestos be counted in its exposure tests.

And as the product safety director for J&J's talc supplier acknowledged in a 2008 email to colleagues: ""(I)f a deposit contains 'non-asbestiform' tremolite, there is also asbestiform tremolite naturally present as well.""

""THE LUNGS OF BABIES""

In 1964, J&J's Windsor Minerals Inc subsidiary bought a cluster of talc mines in Vermont, with names like Argonaut, Rainbow, Frostbite and Black Bear. By 1966, it was blasting and bulldozing white rock out of the Green Mountain state. J&J used the milled powder in its cosmetic powders and sold a less-refined grade to roofing, flooring and tire companies for use in manufacturing.

Ten years after tremolite turned up in the Italian talc, it showed up in Vermont talc, too. In 1967, J&J found traces of tremolite and another mineral that can occur as asbestos, according to a table attached to a Nov. 1, 1967, memo by William Ashton, the executive in charge of J&J's talc supply for decades.

J&J continued to search for sources of clean talc. But in an April 9, 1969, memo to a company doctor, Ashton said it was ""normal"" to find tremolite in many U.S. talc deposits. He suggested J&J rethink its approach. ""Historically, in our Company, Tremolite has been bad,"" Ashton wrote. ""How bad is Tremolite medically, and how much of it can safely be in a talc base we might develop?""

Since pulmonary disease, including cancer, appeared to be on the rise, ""it would seem to be prudent to limit any possible content of Tremolite ... to an absolute minimum,"" came the reply from another physician executive days later.

The doctor told Ashton that J&J was receiving safety questions from pediatricians. Even Robert Wood Johnson II, the founder's son and then-retired CEO, had expressed ""concern over the possibility of the adverse effects on the lungs of babies or mothers,"" he wrote.

""We have replied,"" the doctor wrote, that ""we would not regard the usage of our powders as presenting any hazard."" Such assurances would be impossible, he added, ""if we do include Tremolite in more than unavoidable trace amounts.""

The memo is the earliest J&J document reviewed by Reuters that discusses tremolite as more than a scratchy nuisance. The doctor urged Ashton to consult with company lawyers because ""it is not inconceivable that we could become involved in litigation.""

NEVER ""100% CLEAN""

By the early 1970s, asbestos was widely recognised as the primary cause of mesothelioma among workers involved in producing it and in industries that used it in their products.

Regulation was in the air. In 1972, President Richard Nixon's newly created OSHA issued its first rule, setting limits on workplace exposure to asbestos dust.

By then, a team at Mount Sinai Medical Center led by pre-eminent asbestos researcher Irving Selikoff had started looking at talcum powders as a possible solution to a puzzle: Why were tests of lung tissue taken post mortem from New Yorkers who never worked with asbestos finding signs of the mineral? Since talc deposits are often laced with asbestos, the scientists reasoned, perhaps talcum powders played a role.

They shared their preliminary findings with New York City's environmental protection chief, Jerome Kretchmer. On June 29, 1971, Kretchmer informed the Nixon administration and called a press conference to announce that two unidentified brands of cosmetic talc appeared to contain asbestos.

The FDA opened an inquiry. J&J issued a statement: ""Our fifty years of research knowledge in this area indicates that there is no asbestos contained in the powder manufactured by Johnson & Johnson.""

Later that year, another Mount Sinai researcher, mineralogist Arthur Langer, told J&J in a letter that the team had found a ""relatively small"" amount of chrysotile asbestos in Baby Powder.

Langer, Selikoff and Kretchmer ended up on a J&J list of ""antagonistic personalities"" in a Nov. 29, 1972, memo, which described Selikoff as the leader of an ""attack on talc.""

""I suppose I was antagonistic,"" Langer told Reuters. Even so, in a subsequent test of J&J powders in 1976, he didn't find asbestos - a result that Mount Sinai announced.

Langer said he told J&J lawyers who visited him last year that he stood by all of his findings. J&J has not called him as a witness.

Selikoff died in 1992. Kretchmer said he recently read that a jury had concluded that Baby Powder was contaminated with asbestos. ""I said to myself, 'How come it took so long?' "" he said.

In July 1971, meanwhile, J&J sent a delegation of scientists to Washington to talk to the FDA officials looking into asbestos in talcum powders. According to an FDA account of the meeting, J&J shared ""evidence that their talc contains less than 1%, if any, asbestos.""

Later that month, Wilson Nashed, one of the J&J scientists who visited the FDA, said in a memo to the company's public relations department that J&J's talc contained trace amounts of ""fibrous minerals (tremolite/actinolite).""

""INCONTROVERTIBLE ASBESTOS""

As the FDA continued to investigate asbestos in talc, J&J sent powder samples to be tested at private and university labs. Though a private lab in Chicago found trace amounts of tremolite, it declared the amount ""insignificant"" and the samples ""substantially free of asbestiform material."" J&J reported that finding to the FDA under a cover letter that said the ""results clearly show"" the samples tested ""contain no chrysotile asbestos."" J&J's lawyer told Reuters the tremolite found in the samples was not asbestos.

But J&J's FDA submission left out University of Minnesota professor Thomas E. Hutchinson's finding of chrysotile in a Shower to Shower sample - ""incontrovertible asbestos,"" as he described it in a lab note.

The FDA's own examinations found no asbestos in J&J powder samples in the 1f970s. Those tests, however, did not use the most sensitive detection methods. An early test, for example, was incapable of detecting chrysotile fibers, as an FDA official recognised in a J&J account of an Aug. 11, 1972, meeting with the agency: ""I understand that some samples will be passed even though they contain such fibers, but we are willing to live with it.""

By 1973, Tom Shelley, director of J&J's Central Research Laboratories in New Jersey, was looking into acquiring patents on a process that a British mineralogist and J&J consultant was developing to separate talc from tremolite.

""It is quite possible that eventually tremolite will be prohibited in all talc,"" Shelley wrote on Feb. 20, 1973, to a British colleague. Therefore, he added, the ""process may well be valuable property to us.""

At the end of March, Shelley recognised the sensitivity of the plan in a memo sent to a J&J lawyer in New Jersey: ""We will want to carefully consider the ... patents re asbestos in talc. It's quite possible that we may wish to keep the whole thing confidential rather than allow it to be published in patent form and thus let the whole world know.""

J&J did not obtain the patents.

While Shelley was looking into the patents, J&J research director DeWitt Petterson visited the company's Vermont mining operation. ""Occasionally, sub-trace quantities of tremolite or actinolite are identifiable,"" he wrote in an April 1973 report on the visit. ""And these might be classified as asbestos fiber.""

J&J should ""protect our powder franchise"" by eliminating as many tiny fibers that can be inhaled in airborn talc dust as possible, Petterson wrote. He warned, however, that ""no final product will ever be made which will be totally free from respirable particles."" Introducing a cornstarch version of Baby Powder, he noted, ""is obviously another answer.""

Bicks told Reuters that J&J believes that the tremolite and actinolite Petterson cited were not asbestos.

Cornstarch came up again in a March 5, 1974, report in which Ashton, the J&J talc supply chief, recommended that the company research that alternative ""for defensive reasons"" because ""the thrust against talc has centred primarily on biological problems alleged to result from the inhalation of talc and related mineral particles.""

""WE MAY HAVE PROBLEMS""

A few months after Petterson's recognition that talc purity was a pipe dream, the FDA proposed a rule that talc used in drugs contain no more than 0.1 percent asbestos. While the agency's cosmetics division was considering similar action on talcum powders, it asked companies to suggest testing methods.

At the time, J&J's Baby Powder franchise was consuming 20,000 tons of Vermont talc a year. J&J pressed the FDA to approve an X-ray scanning technique that a company scientist said in an April 1973 memo allowed for ""an automatic 1% tolerance for asbestos."" That would mean talc with up to 10 times the FDA's proposed limit for asbestos in drugs could pass muster.

The same scientist confided in an Oct. 23, 1973, note to a colleague that, depending on what test the FDA adopted for detecting asbestos in cosmetic talc, ""we may have problems.""

The best way to detect asbestos in talc was to concentrate the sample and then examine it through microscopes, the Colorado School of Mines Research Institute told J&J in a Dec. 27, 1973, report. In a memo, a J&J lab supervisor said the concentration technique, which the company's own researchers had earlier used to identify a ""tremolite-type"" asbestos in Vermont talc, had one limitation: ""It may be too sensitive.""

In his email to Reuters, J&J's lawyer said the lab supervisor's concern was that the test would result in ""false positives,"" showing asbestos where there was none.

J&J also launched research to find out how much powder a baby was exposed to during a diapering and how much asbestos could be in that powder and remain within OSHA's new workplace exposure limits. Its researchers had strapped an air sampling device to a doll to take measurements while it was powdered, according to J&J memos and the minutes of a Feb. 19, 1974, meeting of the Cosmetic Toiletry and Fragrance Association (CTFA), an industry group.

""It was calculated that even if talc were pure asbestos the levels of exposure of a baby during a normal powdering are far below the accepted tolerance limits,"" the minutes state.

In a Sept. 6, 1974, letter, J&J told the FDA that since ""a substantial safety factor can be expected"" with talc that contains 1 percent asbestos, ""methods capable of determining less than 1% asbestos in talc are not necessary to assure the safety of cosmetic talc.""

Not everyone at the FDA thought that basing a detection method on such a calculation was a good idea. One official called it ""foolish,"" adding, according to a J&J account of a February 1975 meeting: ""No mother was going to powder her baby with 1% of a known carcinogen irregardless of the large safety factor.""

PUSH FOR SELF-REGULATION

Having failed to persuade the FDA that up to 1 percent asbestos contamination was tolerable, J&J began promoting self-policing as an alternative to regulation. The centrepiece of this approach was a March 15, 1976, package of letters from J&J and other manufacturers that the CTFA gave to the agency to show that they had succeeded at eliminating asbestos from cosmetic talc.

""The attached letters demonstrate responsibility of industry in monitoring its talcs,"" the cover letter said. ""We are certain that the summary will give you assurance as to the freedom from contamination by asbestos for materials of cosmetic talc products.""

In its letter, J&J said samples of talc produced between December 1972 and October 1973 were tested for asbestos, and none was detected ""in any sample.""

J&J didn't tell the FDA about a 1974 test by a professor at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire that turned up asbestos in talc from J&J - ""fiberform"" actinolite, as he put it. Nor did the company tell the FDA about a 1975 report from its longtime lab that found particles identified as ""asbestos fibers"" in five of 17 samples of talc from the chief source mine for Baby Powder. ""Some of them seem rather high,"" the private lab wrote in its cover letter.

Bicks, the J&J lawyer, said the contract lab's results were irrelevant because the talc was intended for industrial use. He said the company now believes that the actinolite the Dartmouth professor found ""was not asbestiform,"" based on its interpretation of a photo in the original lab report.

Just two months after the Dartmouth professor reported his findings, Windsor Minerals Research and Development Manager Vernon Zeitz wrote that chrysotile, ""fibrous anthophyllite"" and other types of asbestos had been ""found in association with the Hammondsville ore body"" - the Vermont deposit that supplied Baby Powder talc for more than two decades.

Zeitz's May 1974 report on efforts to minimize asbestos in Vermont talc ""strongly urged"" the adoption of ways to protect ""against what are currently considered to be materials presenting a severe health hazard and are potentially present in all talc ores in use at this time.""

Bicks said that Zeitz was not reporting on actual test results.

The following year, Zeitz reported that based on weekly tests of talc samples over six months, ""it can be stated with a greater than 99.9% certainty that the ores and materials produced from the ores at all Windsor Mineral locations are free from asbestos or asbestiform minerals.""

""MISREPRESENTATION BY OMISSION""

J&J's selective use of test results figured in a New Jersey judge's decision this year to affirm the first verdict against the company in a case claiming asbestos in J&J products caused cancer. ""Providing the FDA favourable results showing no asbestos and withholding or failing to provide unfavourable results, which show asbestos, is a form of a misrepresentation by omission,"" Middlesex County Superior Court Judge Ana Viscomi said in her June ruling.

""J&J respectfully disagrees with the Judge's comments,"" Bicks said. ""J&J did not withhold any relevant testing from FDA.""

The FDA declined to comment on the ruling.

Lacking consensus on testing methods, the FDA postponed action to limit asbestos in talc. Years later, it did set limits on asbestos in talc used in drugs. It has never limited asbestos in cosmetic talc or established a preferred method for detecting it.

Instead, in 1976, a CTFA committee chaired by a J&J executive drafted voluntary guidelines, establishing a form of X-ray scanning with a 0.5 percent detection limit as the primary test, the method J&J preferred. The method is not designed to detect the most commonly used type of asbestos, chrysotile, at all. The group said the more sensitive electron microscopy was impractical.

The CTFA, which now does business as the Personal Care Products Council, declined to comment.

X-ray scanning is the primary method J&J has used for decades. The company also periodically requires the more sensitive checks with electron microscopes. J&J's lawyer said the company's tests exceed the trade association standard, and they do. He also said that today, J&J's X-ray scans can detect suspect minerals at levels as low as 0.1 percent of a sample.

But the company never adopted the Colorado lab's 1973 recommendation that samples be concentrated before examination under a microscope. And the talc samples that were subjected to the most sensitive electron microscopy test were a tiny fraction of what was sold. For those and other reasons, J&J couldn't guarantee its Baby Powder was asbestos-free when plaintiffs used it, according to experts, including some who testified for plaintiffs.

As early as 1976, Ashton, J&J's longtime talc overseer, recognised as much in a memo to colleagues. He wrote that talc in general, if subjected to the most sensitive testing method, using concentrated samples, ""will be hard pressed in supporting purity claims."" He described this sort of testing as both ""sophisticated"" and ""disturbing.""

""FREE OF HAZARD""

By 1977, J&J appeared to have tamped down concerns about the safety of talc. An internal August report on J&J's ""Defense of Talc Safety"" campaign noted that independent authorities had deemed cosmetic talc products to be ""free of hazard."" It attributed ""this growing opinion"" to the dissemination to scientific and medical communities in the United States and Britain of ""favourable data from the various J&J sponsored studies.""

In 1984, FDA cosmetics chief and former J&J employee Heinz Eiermann reiterated that view. He told the New York Times that the agency's investigation a decade earlier had prompted the industry to ensure that talc was asbestos-free. ""So in subsequent analyses,"" he told the paper, ""we really could not identify asbestos or only on very rare occasions.""

Two years later, the FDA rejected a citizen request that cosmetic talc carry an asbestos warning label, saying that even if there were trace contamination, the use of talc powder during two years of normal diapering would not increase the risk of cancer.

In 1980, J&J began offering a cornstarch version of Baby Powder - to expand its customer base to people who prefer cornstarch, the company says.

The persistence of the industry's view that cosmetic talc is asbestos-free is why no studies have been conducted on the incidence of mesothelioma among users of the products. It's also partly why regulations that protect people in mines, mills, factories and schools from asbestos-laden talc don't apply to babies and others exposed to cosmetic talc - even though Baby Powder talc has at times come from the same mines as talc sold for industrial use. J&J says cosmetic talc is more thoroughly processed and thus purer than industrial talc.

Until recently, the American Cancer Society (ACS) accepted the industry's position, saying on its website: ""All talcum products used in homes have been asbestos-free since the 1970s.""

After receiving inquiries from Reuters, the ACS in early December revised its website to remove the assurance that cosmetic talcs are free of asbestos. Now, it says, quoting the industry's standards, that all cosmetic talc products in the United States ""should be free from detectable amounts of asbestos.""

The revised ACS web page also notes that the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies talc that contains asbestos as ""carcinogenic to humans.""

Despite the success of J&J's efforts to promote the safety of its talc, the company's test lab found asbestos fibers in samples taken from the Vermont operation in 1984, 1985 and 1986. Bicks said: ""The samples that we know of during this time period that contained a fiber or two of asbestos were not cosmetic talc samples.""

Then, in 1992, three years after J&J sold its Vermont mines, the new owner, Cyprus Minerals, said in an internal report on ""important environmental issues"" in its talc reserves that there was ""past tremolite"" in the Hammondsville deposit. Hammondsville was the primary source of Baby Powder talc from 1966 until its shutdown in 1990.

Bicks rejected the Cyprus report as hearsay, saying there is no original documentation to confirm it. Hammondsville mine records, according to a 1993 J&J memo, ""were destroyed by the mine management staff just prior to the J&J divestiture.""

Bicks said the destroyed documents did not include talc testing records.

In 2002 and 2003, Vermont mine operators found chrysotile asbestos fibers on several occasions in talc produced for Baby Powder sold in Canada. In each case, a single fiber was recorded - a finding deemed ""BDL"" - below detection limit. Bicks described the finding as ""background asbestos"" that did not come from any talc source.

In 2009, the FDA, responding to growing public concern about talc, commissioned tests on 34 samples, including a bottle of J&J Baby Powder and samples of Imerys talc from China. No asbestos was detected.

FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the agency continues to receive a lot of questions about talc cosmetics. ""I recognise the concern,"" he told Reuters. He said the agency's policing of cosmetics in general - fewer than 30 people regulating a ""vast"" industry - was ""a place where we think we can be doing more.""

Gottlieb said the FDA planned to host a public forum in early 2019 to ""look at how we would develop standards for evaluating any potential risk."" An agency spokeswoman said that would include examining ""scientific test methods for assessment of asbestos.""

""FISHING EXPEDITION""

Before law school, Herschel Hobson worked at a rubber plant. There, his job included ensuring that asbestos in talc the workers were exposed to didn't exceed OSHA limits.

That's why he zeroed in on Johnson's Baby Powder after he took on Darlene Coker as a client in 1997. The lawsuit Coker and her husband, Roy, filed that year against J&J in Jefferson County District Court in Beaumont, Texas, is the earliest Reuters found alleging Baby Powder caused cancer.

Hobson asked J&J for any research it had into the health of its mine workers; talc production records from the mid-1940s through the 1980s; depositions from managers of three labs that tested talc for J&J; and any documents related to testing for fibrous or asbestiform materials.

J&J objected. Hobson's ""fishing expedition"" would not turn up any relevant evidence, it asserted in a May 6, 1998, motion. In fact, among the thousands of documents Hobson's request could have turned up was a letter J&J lawyers had received only weeks earlier from a Rutgers University geologist confirming that she had found asbestos in the company's Baby Powder, identified in her 1991 published study as tremolite ""asbestos"" needles.

Hobson agreed to postpone his discovery demands until he got the pathology report on Coker's lung tissue. Before it came in, J&J asked the judge to dismiss the case, arguing that Coker had ""no evidence"" Baby Powder caused mesothelioma.

Ten days later, the pathology report landed: Coker's lung tissue contained tens of thousands of ""long fibers"" of four different types of asbestos. The findings were ""consistent with exposure to talc containing chrysotile and tremolite contamination,"" the report concluded.

""The asbestos fibers found raise a new issue of fact,"" Hobson told the judge in a request for more time to file an opposition to J&J's dismissal motion. The judge gave him more time but turned down his request to resume discovery.

Without evidence from J&J and no hope of ever getting any, Hobson advised Coker to drop the suit.

Hobson is still practicing law in Nederland, Texas. When Reuters told him about the evidence that had emerged in recent litigation, he said: ""They knew what the problems were, and they hid it."" J&J's records would have made a ""100% difference"" in Coker's case.

Had the information about asbestos in J&J's talc come out earlier, he said, ""maybe there would have been 20 years less exposure"" for other people.

Bicks, the J&J lawyer, said Coker dropped her case because ""the discovery established that J&J talc had nothing to do with Plaintiff's disease, and that asbestos exposure from a commercial or occupational setting was the likely cause.""

Coker never learned why she had mesothelioma. She did beat the odds, though. Most patients die within a year of diagnosis. Coker held on long enough to see her two grandchildren. She died in 2009, 12 years after her diagnosis, at age 63.

Coker's daughter Crystal Deckard was 5 when her sister, Cady, was born in 1971. Deckard remembers seeing the white bottle of Johnson's Baby Powder on the changing table where her mother diapered her new sister.

""When Mom was given this death sentence, she was the same age as I am right now,"" Deckard said. ""I have it in the back of my mind all the time. Could it happen to us? Me? My sister?"""
