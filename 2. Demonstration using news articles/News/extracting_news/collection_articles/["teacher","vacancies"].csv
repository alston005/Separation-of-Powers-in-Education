Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday ordered filling up of 1.2 lakh vacant posts in various government departments in a phased but focused manner, an official spokesperson said. The critical requirements of departments of health, education and medical education and research will be addressed in the first phase, he said. The directive came during a high-level meeting to review the progress of the state government's flagship 'Ghar Ghar Rozgar and Karobar Mission' scheme.

During the meeting, Mr Singh asked Chief Secretary Karan Avtar Singh to work out the modalities for filling up the vacancies in government departments, the spokesperson said.

The chief minister also directed the top bureaucrat to hold a meeting of administrative secretaries to work out the number of vacancies to be filled in various departments, he said.

Amarinder Singh underscored the need for better coordination and synergy between the state's skill development mission and the department of employment generation and training (DEGT) to bridge the gap between skill training and the required job profile, the spokesperson said.

He further called for more technical training and vocational guidance programmes to help the local youth acquire skills needed to be gainfully employed in the domestic industry.

Addressing the meeting, Technical Education and Employment Generation Minister Charanjit Singh Channi said 30,000 youth had applied for placements in foreign companies at the 'Overseas Employment Camp' organised by the DEGT.

Several foreign companies participated in the camp to select aspirants for 5,000 job openings, but only around 500 were selected, which showed that there was a gap between the skill training and the job qualification of the candidates, the minister pointed out.

Acceding to a demand raised by Mr Channi, the chief minister directed the finance department to immediately release funds to the tune of Rs 5 crore for execution of various schemes and projects under 'Ghar Ghar Rozgar and Karobar Mission', the spokesperson said.

He added that Amarinder Singh also asked the finance department to make a budgetary provision of Rs 23 crore in the next fiscal.

Amarinder Singh was informed that 4.53 lakh youths had been provided jobs under the government's ambitious scheme, the spokesperson said.

Of these, 37,000 youths had got jobs with the government, 1.30 lakh with the private sector and 2.86 lakh were employed under various self-employment schemes, he said.

Amarinder Singh also gave the nod to holding a state-level mega job fair in February.

They are eagerly awaiting announcement of the implementation of the revised UGC pay scales as all the formalities of consultations with the stakeholders have been completed. The revised pay scales, which have been implemented in all the central and several state universities with effect from January 2016, are most likely to be implemented in the universities of Bihar in January. The pay scales of teachers and non-teaching staff were last revised in 2006.

Hard-pressed teachers of universities and colleges, who have been working overtime to complete their academic assignments for the past several years, are likely to heave a sigh of relief as the constitution of a new university service panel is likely to materialise soon. A gazette notification for separating the university appointments from the Bihar Public Service Commission and constitution of an independent university service panel has already been notified by the state government. The said commission will see the light of the day as soon as the ongoing appointment of assistant professors by the BPSC is completed.

It is expected that the new commission will be constituted by mid-2019 and at least 9,000 posts of assistant professors in different subjects will be advertised subsequently. Meanwhile, the universities have started the process of making ad hoc appointment of teachers against existing vacancies on payment of honorarium at the rate of Rs 1,000 per class subject to a maximum of Rs 1,000 a month.

The chancellor's secretariat has started an exercise for modernisation of libraries and laboratories in all the colleges and universities of the state. Both undergraduate and postgraduate students can hope for better amenities in their libraries and laboratories this year if the state government provides the required funds to the universities for the purpose.

If everything goes right, all the universities and colleges of the state will be accredited by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) by the end of this year. Patna University is almost ready to upload its self study report to the NAAC's website and several of its colleges are also gearing up for their assessment and accreditation. The chancellor has directed all the universities to get their institutions accredited without further delay failing which government grants to these institutions will be stopped.

For the first time, with a view to promoting healthy competition among the academics, the best performers will be given chancellor's awards in different categories. ""Applications have already been invited from eligible candidates for the best student (separately in academics, sports and cultural activities), teacher, college, girls' college, principal and vice-chancellor. Such incentives will go a long way in creating a healthy academic atmosphere in the state,"" said Federation of University Teachers Associations of Bihar working president K B Sinha."

GST refund glitches, refusal of the state to refund 42 per cent share of the Central incentives pertaining to the pre-GST period, stalemate in the land acquisition for major infrastructure development projects like four-laning of the Baddi-Nalagarh highway and rail connectivity has left the investors disappointed.

The only silver-lining is that the state gets top ranking nationally in the ease of doing business initiative in the fast-moving category. Its overall ranking has improved to 16th as against 17th attained last year. No new industrial unit has been set up due to the locational disadvantage and little has been done to break the monopoly of transport unions whose freight is among the highest in the country. The Pandoga industrial area in Una district has found no takers and little could be done to revive the case of seeking environmental clearance of 515 bigha land at Dhabota in Nalagarh where new industrial area is proposed.

The much-awaited bulk drug park, announced by the Union Chemical and Fertilisers Minister in April 2016, is yet to receive funds for developing the 663.11 bigha site at Aduwal village in Nalagarh. Efforts to set up a cement plant at Churah subdivision of Chamba district have failed to yield results. The government has again announced an investor meet, albeit with a difference, where the Chief Minister is slated to lead a host of senior officials within the country and abroad to attract investment.

The Mukhya Mantri Swavlamban Yojana, which fetches 25 per cent investment subsidy with a ceiling of Rs 40 lakh in plant and machinery and an interest subsidy of 5 per cent for three years, was introduced in May to promote employment. As many as 793 proposals were forwarded to the banks but barely 36 were sanctioned and funds worth Rs 7.88 crore were disbursed which speak volumes about its lack of popularity. Limited success is received under the ambitious 'Start-Up Himachal' scheme with barely 40 start-ups having received financial assistance.

The state was,however, rated as ""Hill State leader and an aspiring leader in developing an enabling start-up ecosystem"" nationally. The 5-year Central Capital Investment Incentive for access to credit at 30 per cent for plant and machinery announced for the micro, small and medium enterprises is the lone new Central scheme which brought some cheer to the existing units.

Students without uniform, scholarship

It was a challenging year for the government in the education sector as it grappled with downtrend in enrollment and filling of vacancies while facing stiff resistance from teacher unions in its bid to bring qualitative improvement in education.

The scholarship scam of Rs 250 crore was unearthed in the Education Department and preliminary investigations revealed that the tentacles of the scam spread to other states also. The government has now handed over the investigations to the CBI. The department remained under the scanner of the High Court which monitored the measures taken by government to fill vacant posts.

The regularisation of teacher has not been done since 2008 and resentment was brewing among teachers as a large number of teachers retired without getting promotion. The government closed 100 elementary schools with less than 10 students and proposed the merger or closure of more than 400 elementary schools.

Efforts were made to get the best from teachers as annual increment of 38 PGTs were stopped for less than 25 per cent results in Class XII board examinations. To arrest the flight of students to private schools, the government introduced pre-primary (Nursery) classes in 3,391 schools on a pilot basis from the coming session and so far, 30,000 students have been registered. The enrollment in government schools has dropped by 23.7 per cent in past 10 years.

Under pressure from student unions, the government took a retrograde step to revert to annual system from semester system under RUSA while the cluster university, which was set up at Mandi, is yet to be functional.

The government failed to provide free uniforms to students of government schools from Class I to Class XII under the Atal Vardi Yojana.

The government tried to lure power producers by offering sops like deferring 12 free power royalty and other measures. Yet the exit of power producers continued as there was no takers for most of the projects in the Chandra basin in Lahaul-Spiti.

Even as there was marginal increase in revenue from power to Rs 1,100 crore as compared to Rs 950 crore last year, yet the state failed to add even a single megawatt to its existing capacity. The government tried to lure power producers by offering sops like deferring 12 free power royalty and other measures. Yet the exit of power producers continued as there was no takers for most of the projects in the Chandra basin in Lahaul-Spiti. There was complete lack of interest in the 1000 MW solar energy projects in Spiti as the HP State Transmission Corporation failed to lay the transmission line to evacuate power from the region.

The Directorate of Energy allotted just two projects - the jinxed 780 MW Jangi Thopan to the SJVNL and the 447 MW Dugar in 2018.

No effort was made to store over rain water in the monsoon on the Giri, Dharampur khud, both tributaries of the Yamuna, that goes waste every year as Shimla and Solan continue to face water shortage.

Private power producers cited high cost of power generation and lack of infrastructure like roads and transmission lines as the main reasons for not showing interest in the projects.The existing power companies had to resort to shutdown of powerhouses owing to the high level of silt. As a result, power companies and state suffered losses due to the frequent shutdown, while the consumers faced power cuts and water problems for hours during the shutdown.

Caught in debt trap

With the debt mounting to almost Rs 50,000 crore, the poor financial health of the state remained the biggest challenge before the BJP regime in its first year in office.

The absence of major revenue generation and limited Central funding under various schemes prevented the Jai Ram government from undertaking any major schemes. Most big projects and schemes are being implemented through Central funding.

Even as the Congress cried hoarse about the poor fiscal management, the BJP regime raised loans to the tune of Rs 2,500 crore against a limit of Rs 7,600 crore. The salary component of almost 2 lakh government employees is Rs 11,000 crore while the pensionary burden is to the tune of Rs 6,000 crore annually. A sum of Rs 4,300 crore will have to be paid as interest on loans during the financial year 2018-19.

The biggest area of concern is the extra spending on recruitment, besides upgrade and opening of new health and educational institutions. The only silver-lining is the hike in revenue from the power sector from Rs 750 crore in 2017-18 to Rs 10,500 crore.

The biggest challenge before the CM, who holds the Finance Department, is generating resources for which the government is eying power, tourism, industry and mining."

The hindu

Why this question

The government has recently brought out a notification which authorizes several government agencies to intercept, monitor, and decrypt online communications and data. Besides, there have been several instances like the facebook fiasco which point out the importance of privacy in the modern times. In this context it is essential to analyze the surveillance framework in India and deliberate upon it in detail.

Directive word

Body-

Conclusion- based on your discussion, form a fair and a balanced conclusion on the given issue. E.g Any impingement upon the right to privacy must be proportionate. One of the factors of the proportionality standard is that the government's action must be the least restrictive method by which a state goal is to be realised.

Topic - Government policies and interventions for development in various sectors and issues arising out of their design and implementation.

2) The proposed amendment to section 79 of IT Act would amount to serious curbing of free speech. Critically discuss.(250 words)

Reference

Why this question

The article analyses the proposed amendment to IT Act and discusses the implications of the amendments on privacy and national security. This is a developing news and needs to be prepared to understand the nuances of the debate.

Key demand of the question

The question expects us to bring out the proposed amendments to IT act and debate the amendment by bringing out its pros and cons. Finally we need to provide our fair and balanced opinion and discuss the way forward.

Directive word

Critically discuss - This is an all-encompassing directive - you have to debate on paper by going through the details of the issues concerned by examining each one of them. You have to give reasons for both for and against arguments. When 'critically' is suffixed or prefixed to a directive, all you need to do is look at the good and bad of something and give a fair judgement.

3) A centralised judicial recruitment process will help in solving the problems in the lower judiciary. Comment.(250 words)

The hindu

Why this question

The NITI aayog has recently put forward the idea of a centralised recruitment for judicial posts under the aegis of UPSC. The idea has been mooted as a solution to several problems faced by the lower judiciary in India. It is therefore important to look into the issue and bring out its credibility.

Directive word

Comment- here we have to express our knowledge and understanding of the issue and form an overall opinion thereupon.

Key demand of the question.

The question wants us to express our knowledge and understanding of the issue and form an opinion as to how/ how not the centralised judicial recruitment process will help in solving the problems in the lower judiciary. Your opinion has to be based on a proper discussion and presentation of valid arguments and facts.

Structure of the answer

Introduction- Write a few introductory lines about the problems faced by lower judiciary. E.g delayed justice, high number of vacancies, less use of technology and mention that a central judicial recruitment process under the UPSC is aimed at solving the vacancy problem and that it will lead to a better represented lower judiciary etc.

Body-

DIscuss about the issue in detail so as to form an opinion thereupon. E.g The argument that the creation of the AIJS and a centralised recruitment process will help the lower judicial services is based on the assumption that the current federal structure, that vests the recruitment and appointment for the lower judiciary in the hands of State Governors, High Courts and State Public Service Commissions, is broken and inefficient. On facts, however, this assumption does not hold up; Going by the latest figures published by the Supreme Court in its publication Court News, many States like Maharashtra and West Bengal are doing a very efficient job when it comes to recruiting lower court judges; the problem of vacancies is not uniform across different States. The solution is to pressure poorly performing States into performing more efficiently; several States already provide for reservations in their lower judicial service etc.

Conclusion- based on your discussion, form a fair and a balanced conclusion on the given issue.

Topic - mechanisms, laws, institutions and Bodies constituted for the protection and betterment of these vulnerable sections

4) The passage of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2016 has been criticized by the very community it seeks to protect. Examine.(250 words)

Reference

8) An undergraduate course required for graduation has a reputation for being extremely hard to pass, much harder than similar courses. When posting materials to the class website, the teacher accidentally posts a test with answers indicated at the end. The teacher notices the error immediately and deletes the test, but before she does so a student downloads the test. The website does not allow the teacher to see whether the test was downloaded, and because she deleted the test with the answers so quickly, the teacher later uploaded the same test without the answers and required students to take the test. The Student Code of Ethics prohibits students from taking a test when there is reason for them to believe they have confidential information regarding the answers to a test they are not supposed to have. Violations of the Student Code of Ethics are punishable.

Currently, the varsity has only vice-chancellor S Japhet, registrar Ramchandra Gowda and registrar of evaluation as permanent teaching staff. However, they have the responsibility of handling official work as well.

During the trifurcation of BU, faculty members were asked to choose one of the three universities. Seventeen of them picked BCU, but the proposal to transfer them to the varsity is still pending with the government and higher education department. ""As a result, the staff is still juggling between BU and BCU. We are completing the courses with the help of guest faculty when required,"" said Japhet.

T hese faculty members are still working under the BU payroll and following the same syllabus. According to BCU office-bearers, the university requires 37 teaching and 100 non-teaching staff to cater to students' needs.

We will propose a one-time grant of Rs 100 crore so that all needs of the institution can be met,"" said Japhet.

As much as 36 per cent of sanctioned posts of faculty members are vacant across eight prominent Indian Institutes of Technology, a reply under the Right to Information has revealed.

IITs Bombay, Delhi, Guwahati, Kanpur, Kharagpur, Madras, Roorkee and Varanasi currently have 65,824 students, but only 4,049 teachers against 6,318 approved posts.

The information was probided by the human resource development ministry in response to a query by Neemuch-based RTI activist Chandrashekhar Gaur.

Thus, with 2,269 vacancies, these IITs currently have one teacher for every 16 students.

IIT Varanasi, where 5,485 students are enrolled, has the worst shortfall, the reply revealed.

Against 548 sanctioned posts of teachers, it has 265 faculty members, which means 52 per cent of posts are vacant.

""The number of IITs in the country has reached 23 now.

The call for promotions tops their list of demands.

Sujitha M, who has completed MA and BEd in Malayalam, had dreamt of a job as a language teacher or college lecturer when she completed her studies in 2015. She never imagined that she would have to one day get down on her knees, blow holes into a railway track with flecks of faeces hardly a few feet away and screw a large bolt mechanically.

Like any postgraduate, who is interested in a government job, Sujitha took up the exam conducted by the railway recruitment board and the railway recruitment cell. She got a call in 2016, stating she was being put into the engineering department because of her high marks. ""Now, my job includes carrying almost 12kg tool kit on my shoulders and walking more than 1km braving hot sun or downpour to ensure the track is alright and if not repair the same,"" she said, adding, ""I don't mind doing this, but I need to grow and reach a senior position.""

Track maintainers, who come under the engineering department, said they had scored good marks in the recruitment exam. ""Engineering and track maintenance are known to be the backbone of the railways. And they recruit the good scorers, as it is hard, manual work on the main line. But they don't let us get promoted or grow in our career,"" said Sarath Kumar, a track maintainer from Madurai division and a committee member of Track Maintainers Unity, a forum formed by them to put forth their demands. ""We are not allowed to take the internal exams for promotions to ticket examiners, station managers, and clerks, etc.""

Sujitha also expressed a similar view. ""Even if we are allowed to take the exam, like I did recently, very few of us are selected from the engineering department. They select more people from the traffic department.""

Another senior track maintainer said it was because they don't fill vacancies. ""Recruiting good people to do track maintenance is a challenge. So, they can't afford to let the good recruits get promoted.""

Pointing out that almost 90% of the recruits in the past decade were graduates or at least diploma holders, track maintainers said they were made to work in harsh, unhygienic conditions. The salary is a meagre Rs 25,000. ""Our graduation to grades also take longer period than in departments like traffic and ticket examining, where they move up grades every two years,"" said another track maintainer in Coimbatore.

Safety is another issue. ""A 32-year-old track maintainer had lost his life on Wednesday when a train ran over him while he was repairing the track at Govindapatti in Andhra Pradesh. We have lost seven people in the past two years in South India,"" Sarath said, adding, ""Only track supervisors have walkie talkies, but it is usually we who walk down the track when there is a suspected problem. If we have a walkie talkie, we can inform the supervisors, control rooms and finally the loco pilots. Now, we have only detonators, which are primitive."""

The Federation of Central Universities Teachers Association (FEDCUTA) has alleged that the Modi government is sitting on quota roster decision for the fear of upper caste votes. Appointments of academic staff in institutes is on hold since July following an order by the Allahabad High Court.

FEDCUTA President Prof Rajib Ray told India Today TV that the Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar had assured an ordinance to restore the previous reservation roster but now since Parliament is in session the government should bring in a bill. The HC verdict in March had struck down 200-point roster treating college/university as unit following which UGC had announced that an individual department should be considered as the base unit to calculate the number of teaching posts to be reserved for Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) candidates leaving them at a disadvantage. The stalemate has resulted in colleges/universities forced to run classes with ad hoc teachers.

""Immediately after the HC verdict on March 5, FEDCUTA, DUTA and several other Universities Teachers Associations protested it, after our representations to HRD Minister, we were promised that the Government will file an appeal in the Supreme Court,"" said Prof Ray. ""We had been repeatedly telling the government to bring an ordinance to restore the old roster, but it has so far done nothing except for filing an appeal due to which appointments have come to a standstill,"" he further said.

Prof Ray claimed that since all the political parties, including Congress, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, CPM and CPI have supported the Teachers Association on the issue, so the government should have no problem if it introduces bill to restore the 200-point roster. ""They should have done this in April itself,"" he said.

Prof Ray said that it was shocking to see that immediately after the HC order came, 7 to 10 universities came up with advertisements according to the new anti-reservation roster, clearly indicating that in the academics the anti-reservation position is a major position. ""The indecisiveness of the government has resulted in vacancies rising to 50 per cent in Delhi University Colleges alone and both reserved as well as the general category candidates seeking jobs are suffering,"" he added.

There is no urgency to fill vacant Teachers Associations of the state and central universities have formed a Joint Forum for Movement (JFME) to carry out a march on February 19 next year to protest against the Modi Government's education policy. ""There will teachers from KG to PG protesting in the capital against the policy attack that has happened against publicly funded institutions,"" said Prof Ray. ""The graded autonomy bills, attempt to dismantle UGC, replacing 'grants' from the UGC, with 'loans' from Higher Education Financing Agency (HEFA) for infrastructure, this is all an attempt towards privatisation and commercialisation of the education sector,"" he added.

While as per official data only 100 of the 388 odd posts are said to be filled, the letter sent to a set of candidates on December 5 said all vacancies were filled.

This created confusion among thousands of aspirants who sat for the test in 2017. General candidates who scored 75 or above of a total 150 (50%) in the test were eligible for recruitment with a 40% to 45% cutoff for reserved community candidates. Accordingly, 92 candidates, who scored above the cutoff scores, were shortlisted and appointed chemistry teachers after verification of certificates.

Following this, six candidates approached the Madurai bench of the Madras high court stating that some answers in the key released by the TRB were incorrect.

The court later directed the TRB to include the six candidates to the selection process but clarified that its direction could not be treated as precedent to other candidates. But aspirants have continued to approach the court challenging the answer key released earlier.

One such candidate, M Lakshmi of Tiruvannamalai, who fell short of the cutoff score by one mark, approached the court in July. The court dismissed her plea, saying the TRB was at liberty to consider her representation if she was denied marks despite giving the right answer and provided there were vacancies.

Referring to both directions, the TRB sent a letter to Lakshmi in December stating that they finalised the selection for 2016-17 and all vacancies were filled. ""Only 100 odd seats were filled. There was no clarity on how TRB filled the remaining seats,"" said Prabu, Lakshmi's husband who had gone to inquire with the TRB.

On the other hand, candidates who could not meet the cutoff score despite being awarded marks after approaching the court received a letter from the TRB about being excluded in the selection procedure as they did not meet the cutoff. There was no mention about vacancies being filled in these letters.

When questioned about the discrepancy, S Jayanthi, chairperson, TRB, said, ""This (vacancies filled) was a typographical error by the clerical staff. The vacancies continue to exist and backlogs will be cleared after a fresh notification is issued."""

The success of any task or activity depends upon the quality of preplanning and whether accomplish or not the objective must be attempted to solidify. To start with a strong monitoring mechanism is imminent in the School level and a rational commitment is needed from all the stakeholders. In my 20 years of continuous selfless attachment in Service Association work like ANSTA & NSEAOA what I personally observed is a logical working system is in the offing particularly management policies at all level and emphatically requires more inputs on academic interest. And to achieve its goal a tangible policy is impending to formulate through the blessing of political will to improvise its traditional tag. In this regard I would like to lay down the following humble suggestions as a measures for improvement of academic acceleration towards qualitative education in the department.

1. Teachers Registry may be installed digitally so as to maintain the actual position of the required Teachers in the GPS, GMS, GHS across the State to balance the staffing pattern and also to check the excess and shortage Teachers in the School. While it can also help in reckoning the actual vacancies caused to be filled up without any discrepancies.

2. Teachers Code with a Working Gown or Working Identity Card may be introduced to Teachers for public recognition in honoring as Professionals. And by doing so it will incline to prevent from manipulative practices of keeping proxy Teacher in the School.

3. Teachers recruitment policy may be taken up on regular basis or conduct at least twice in a year to avoid all sorts of frequent agitation/strikes for want of backlog service regularization which is endless that hampers the daily classroom routine time and again.

4. Primary Education is the backbone of a child's foundation and this basic education must be prioritized by evolving an academic viable policy more of creativity and play way methods of child centered approach to bring about quality education. And it requires a major amalgamation in this sector to carry forward an effective and sustainable teaching learning process which can enable the child to pursue higher education at all level because that is the gate way of building the child's educational future career.

5. An Academic Cell for Primary and Elementary Education may be separately function in the Directorate and promote supervision and monitoring the academic performance of the GPS and GMS in particular. As it is the fundamental basis which can excel in Secondary and Higher Secondary Education ie, HSLC/HSSLC results and therefore more weightage can be given at this stage of primary and elementary targeting to minimize or eliminate the nil result Schools in public exams instead of blaming one another.

6. Regular School inspection with a feed back by the Inspecting Officer may be taken up as a tool for immediate measures towards academic improvement besides cleaning up all

Kinds of unwanted prevalent practices like sharing salaries, Teachers absenteeism, false enrolment of the School etc. While that may lead to minimize the worries and burden of Unions/ NGOs to do the checking indeed this responsibility is being vested to the department officers to carry out periodically.

7. Regular DPC may be held for timely promotion to fill up all the resultant vacancies of Asst. Headmaster, Headmaster at the School level and JEO, SDEO, DEO, the field officers in the Sub. Divisional / District level to upkeep the continuity of coordinating in managing their establishment courteously because these are correlated functionaries as far as administrative aspects are concerned.

8. Teachers Award may be streamlined by giving responsibility to the Heads of the School to identify only deserving genuine Teachers and not by the individual Teachers concerned to initiate by himself/ herself to be awarded. The number of State Teachers Award may be fixed and distributed to all the District on quota wise to do justice to all teaching community in the State. Besides due facilities be accorded and their services can be fully utilized as an outstanding meritorious Teachers in the department.

9. As far as possible Teachers training can be of an oriented motivational teaching learning skill and preferably during vacation so as not to disturb the regular classes.

10. The different formats related to State School Employees bio data/ particulars may be limited to only one and formulate as Unified School Education Format (USEF) inclusive of all expected requirements to fill in such as Staff position, Students enrolment and other physical related matters like building, classrooms, offices, furniture's, fencing, toilets, safe drinking water etc enabling for accessibility use by DoSE, NBSE, SCERT through data base to do away filling of numerous School formats.

11. Instead of opening new Schools the existing Schools may be standardized both in the academic performance and infrastructural facilities to really experience the quality education in the state with the available resources.

12. The Government may plan for observance of Year of Academic Excellence for School Education Department."
