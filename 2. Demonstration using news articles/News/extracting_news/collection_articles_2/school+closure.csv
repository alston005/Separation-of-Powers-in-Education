Passing interim orders, Justice S Vaidayanathan noted that toilets in the school were open to sky and did not even have doors and said since high-rise buildings were close-by, miscreants may take photographs of girl students using the toilets and circulate them on the internet.

The judge said he was not inclined to grant permission for continued functioning of the 'Sri Saravana Vidhyalaya Nursery and Primary School' at suburban Puzhal for a period of one academic year to carry out the rectifications.

He ordered that all the students studying in the school be accommodated in the nearby schools.

Accepting the direction, the special government pleader submitted a list of eight schools located in the vicinity.

The matter relates to a petition from S Sasikumar, who submitted that the management of the school functioning in his property, had obtained approval and renewals from educational authorities by fraudulently misrepresenting the actual safety and infrastructure and sanitary conditions.

He sought a direction to authorities for inspection of the school.

Following an earlier direction, Director of Elementary Education A Karuppuswamy and other officials were present before the court today.

The judge said there were also other deficiencies like asbestos sheet roof and thatched huts and asked the government pleader as to how permission was granted to such a school.

He wondered if authorities will act only if an incident like the 2004 Kumbakonam school fire, in which several children died, occurred.

Pulling up the educational officials for not taking steps, the court said though a show cause notice was issued in 2015, no further action was initiated.

""It is very unfortunate that the authorities are careless and they have proceeded on the basis that the work comes to an end after the issuance of show cause notice. Prevention is better than cure,"" the judge said.

He directed the government to initiate departmental action against the officials who were in service at the time of issuance of show cause notice.

The petitioner, whose attempts to terminate the tenancy agreement with the school had failed, submitted he had already made representations on March 2 this year to the educational authorities to inspect the premises in view of violations of regulations."

Thousands of people have signed a petition to prevent the closure of one of the UK's largest independent Hindu faith schools, the Swaminarayan School in London. The Akshar Educational Trust, which runs the school set up in 1992, had announced its closure last month as part of plans to exit the education sector completely by July 2020. Parents of students associated with the school have now organised a campaign to save the ""school of excellence"" from closure.

""In a letter to parents, a spokesperson for the school blamed 'increasing regulatory requirements, difficulties in recruitment and retention of teachers, ready availability of free state-funded Hindu schools, and declining pupil numbers' for the move. This is simply not true,"" notes the Change.org petition, which has attracted nearly 3,500 signatures since last week. ""Sensitivity analysis of accounts by experts suggests that with restructuring it is possible for school to run for the foreseeable future,"" it notes.

The parents, who have coordinated into a save-the-school campaign, say that many Indian-origin families have moved, relocated and changed their way of life to enable their children to get an education within the ethos and culture of Hinduism at the respected Swaminarayan School in Neasden, north-west London. ""Parents are more than happy to consider taking over the running of the school by appointing new teams who will give due consideration to the communities and families that are being disrupted by this announcement,"" the parents said in a statement.

The school has been very popular within the large Indian-origin community based in the borough of Brent, many of whom are happy to pay the GBP 4,310 per-term fees to enrol their children. But the trust running it said that mounting pressures in recent years had hampered its ability to invest in the resources required to sustain the improvements needed in the school, both educationally and for its infrastructure.

The institution, opened by Pramukh Swami Maharaj alongside the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir to ""promote Hindu and British culture and values and way of life"", has around 400 pupils between the ages of three and 18 currently on its rolls.

The trustees had unveiled plans for closure in two phases in order to allow parents time to apply to other schools. However, parents are furious at the lack of consultation before the announcement was made. ""The school is not a business, where a decision like this can just be made and announced... the team of governors and trustees just seem to have had enough and this is now the easiest option for them,"" the parents said.

They have received the backing of Indian-origin Labour party MP, Seema Malhotra, who said she is ""saddened"" by the news of the closure. ""The Swaminarayan School has a strong reputation and has been highly valued by parents and the community. I hope that through discussions between parents, teachers, governors and trustees that a solution can be found and the school is able to stay open and continue to flourish,"" she said.

Donning their uniform and clutching schoolbags, 43 students, including a fair sprinkling of girls, arrived near the CM's residence in JP Nagar around 5am. After meeting the students around 10.45am and giving them a patient hearing, Kumaraswamy ordered officials to ensure that the school is not shut down.

The students said they were told by the authorities on June 16 that their 24-year-old school would be closed and they would be shifted to a school in Bharamasagara, which is 15km away. According to the children, classes for this academic year have already begun. While admissions for class 8 were under way, lessons for classes 9 and 10 were being imparted.

Officials cited the poor strength of students -- the Alaghatta school has about 50 of them -- as a reason for closing the institution and relocating the students to Bharamasagara.

Accompanied by villagers, the distraught students left their village around 11.30pm on Sunday night. Around 8.45am, the CM's officials collected details from them. When the CM was about to leave in his car around 10.45am, the students called out to him. Drawn by their 'CM Saar"" cries, Kumaraswamy stopped, met the kids and assured them that their demand would be met.

He also asked villagers why they had brought the children to the city. The villagers replied that they didn't have an option as no one paid heed to their grievances.

The CM has sought a report from officials on the number of students in the school.

Box: 'Dept helping pvt school lobby'

Gram Panchayat member of Alaghatta, E Nagaraj, said education department officials were helping the private school lobby by shutting down the decades-old school. ""We protested against the department's decision for a couple of days but no one bothered to listen to us. This pushed us to meet the CM to seek justice,"" he said."

The school that was started in 1992, had students from surrounding areas studying there. However, when a private school was started nearby, admissions dropped. When the current academic year started, only two students were pursuing studies.

Officials from the Department of Elementary Education were planning to close the school and admit the two students to nearby schools.

The NGO made a representation to the Department of Elementary Education, based on which a meeting was organised at the school. Villagers said that if English was introduced as medium of instruction, they would admit their children in the school.

Resolution passed

Later, the School Management Committee (SMC) passed a resolution for starting English medium and the same was forwarded to the department. It was announced that classes would be conducted in English from the current academic year.

Following this, people campaigned in the village asking parents to admit their wards in the school. A total of 19 students were admitted, taking the total strength to 21."

The committee was constituted in June 2017 to ""identify the problems and prepare guidelines to simplify the process/procedure for grant of Essentiality Certificate/Scheme of Management /Recognition/ Up-gradation to Private Unaided Schools in Delhi.""

The committee's decision is vital as in February 2018, the Delhi Government had ordered private schools functioning without DoE recognition to discontinue all educational activities from the next academic session beginning from April 1, 2018.

In a response to two RTIs filed separately by Chandrakant Singh and Gaurav Tyagi, General Secretary and Joint Secretary, respectively, Private Land Public Schools Association, inquiring about the committee's decision, the DoE replied with ""no such recommendations were submitted till date.""

The purpose of the committee was also to ""examine the provision of Delhi School Education Act & Rules, 1973, RTE Act 2009 and the suggestions received from school management/societies/trusts running Private Unaided Schools in Delhi.""

""The committee was constituted to simplify the existing procedure, not to amend the Act. The committee is still in existence and examining the provision. Probably in a month or two, it may finalise a decision and announce it,"" said a spokesperson from the DoE.

Singh and Tyagi argue that in the wake of closure threats issued by the Delhi government to unrecognised schools in the city, where lakhs of students are studying, the committee's say in the decision-making process could save thousands of schools from closing before the start of the new academic session.

Chandrakant Singh, had also sent a letter to Delhi Education Minister and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia requesting him not to close any of the unrecognised schools until a decision was taken by the committee.

The request was then forwarded by Sisodia's office to the DoE, asking Director Saumya Gupta to ""look into the matter for taking appropriate action"". ""No one has the right to put the future of lakhs of students at stake,"" said Singh."

P.M.A. Salam, Indian Union Muslim League leader, and one of the functionaries of the association, told the media here on Tuesday that around 3,000 schools across the State had been served closure notices by the Education Department. Though the department was claiming that the schools were not providing the facilities as mandated by the Right to Education Act, Mr. Salam alleged that the schools were not given enough time to act on the requirements.

""When the Act came into force in 2013, the United Democratic Front (UDF) government had asked unrecognised schools to either fulfil the obligations or close down. Around 1,000 schools managed to get recognition after officials examined the facilities. This government, however, is arbitrarily asking us to shut down without giving us a chance,"" he alleged.

The schools facing closure included those approved by the Central Board of Secondary Education and functioning for over two decades. Education Minister C. Ravindranath had claimed on the floor of the House that 1,585 schools had been served notice, of which a majority were run by minority groups, Mr. Salam added.

Nisar Olavanna, president of the association, accused Education Department officials of adopting a hostile attitude towards the managements, affecting the future of lakhs of students, teachers and non-teaching staff. Asked about the allegation that the teachers and other staff were being paid a meagre amount as salaries, he said that only a few schools were resorting to such tactics. ""There is a proposal to have a joint fight against the government move by roping in organisations such as the Nair Service Society (NSS), Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam, and Christian managements,"" he said."

The report has also not been made public, triggering concern among retired educationists and activists. In fact, activists are of the opinion that the report should be made public at the soonest so that it is made open to scrutiny.

Mukund Kirdat, an education activist working against the decision to close schools in remote areas, pointed out that any document affecting the education of such a considerable number of children should be made public.

""It looks like there is a vested interest in not sharing the name of the NGO and making the report public. Secondly, there are also rumours that certain corporate entities will be allowed to run these schools a their corporate social responsibility (CSR) activity,"" said Kirdat.

Kirdat further went on to mention that for a government trashing reports of NGOs such as Pratham, taking such a big decision without any review process on its own also seems rather fishy.

""When the report came out, the government should have formed a committee comprising a civil society member or an activist, a retired judge and a government official in order to review the report and take samples to ascertain if the report is, in fact, true or not,"" said Kirdat.

Matin Mujawar, another education activist, explained that the top-down decision will only hurt rural Maharashtra in the long run. ""The problem with this model is that someone sitting in Mumbai has come to a decision whether the schools in these villages should be shut or not, without even knowing what is happening in villages. These decisions should be taken with utmost care and field officers must ensure that they recommend the name of the schools where an alternative is available to the seniors rather than vice versa,"" said Mujawar.

According to a zilla parishad teacher, the entire issue has created a fear among tutors as well as parents whose children attend these schools.

""Once the name of your school is on the list, we don't know what will happen next. Parents continue to ask us and we don't have an answer to their questions. Some schools were being spruced up and the process had to be stopped midway because what is the point of the renovation if the school is being shut down"" the teacher sought to know."
