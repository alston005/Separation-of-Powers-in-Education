This article is part of Inc42's special year-end series -- 2018 In Review -- in which we will refresh your memory on the major developments in the Indian startup ecosystem and their impact on various stakeholders -- from entrepreneurs to investors. Find more stories from this series here.

""The value of an idea lies in the using of it."" -- Thomas Edison

The cup of ideas runneth over in the Indian startup ecosystem. A good idea is the genesis for any successful startup, but sometimes just having a good idea is not enough.

According to the findings of a survey by the Institute for Business Value and Oxford Economics, 90% of India's startups fail within the first five years. It added that the lack of pioneering innovation is the major reason for the failure of Indian startups -- in essence, they are copycats of startup ideas of the West, the study said.

Turns out, almost half of the Indian startups are actually not needed at all.

It is the absence of scalable ideas that makes 9 out of 10 Indian startups sink like lead balloons, despite the best intentions of founders and investors. The lack of originality is clear from this caveat -- Despite being the third largest startup ecosystem after US and China, the number of international patents India has applied for in 2015-16 was only 1,423 whereas Japan's count stood at 44,235, China at 29,846 and South Korea at 14,626.

This shows the clear mismatch between the number of startups mushrooming and the extent of innovation in the country compared to others.

As per Inc42's The State of The Indian Startup Ecosystem 2018 report, more than 10K Indian startups have shut their operations so far.

While failure is a hard pill to swallow, it is also a great teacher. For a startup founder, there is no bigger disappointment than seeing the product of their efforts come to nought. However there is also the flipside -- if you've never failed, you'll never know what works.

With 2019 just a couple of days away, we at Inc42 have compiled a list of the biggest failed Indian startups of the year. As late-night talk show host, Conan O'Brien said, ""Through disappointment one gains clarity and with clarity comes conviction and true originality""

Just Buy Live connected retailers to buy goods directly from brands across multiple categories such as food, drinks, personal care, auto, smartphones, fashion, stationery, etc. The startup also offered an unsecured credit lending to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to facilitate the transaction on its portal and provide working capital to small retailers. In August 2017, the startup raised $100 Mn (INR 699.25 Cr) Series B funding from a Dubai-based investment firm, Ali Cloud Investments.

Why it failed

Various reports claim that Just Buy Live may have shutdown due to an unscalable business model and negative cash flow. As per Entrackr's report in March this year, Just Buy Live's cofounder said that the company has temporarily been shut down and would resume operation after raising fresh funding. Its website is currently down.

Shotang was a business-to-business (B2B) online marketplace that connected retailers, distributors and manufacturers to discover, transact and manage their business online using their platform. Its main products were mobiles and apparel. It earned revenue through commissions paid by distributors per transaction.

Why it failed

At its peak Shotang had a $40 Mn (INR 279.7 Cr) market valuation. It had last raised $864K (INR 6.8 Cr) from Patamar Capital in February this year, and $5 Mn (INR 35.94 Cr) from Exfinity Venture Partners in December 2015. Techcircle cited an anonymous person saying that the money it last raised was ""primarily meant to pay off creditors, employees, partners. It tried but failed.""

It is likely that the business was forced to scale down its operation amid fierce competition from the likes of Flipkart, Amazon and Paytm Mall.

PortDesk provided an e-procurement software solution for logistics management for port-related operations such as accounting, cash management, ports DA estimate and voyage, layout and contract management.

Why it failed

In June this year, it was reported that PortDesk has shutdown its business, however, the reason is still unknown. Only a year earlier, the startup had raised $2 Mn (INR 13.98 Cr) in a seed funding round from a Singapore-based maritime services company, Alphard Maritime Group. The startup's founder Pushpit Pallav was not reachable for comments.

Undoubtedly India's largest crypto exchange, Zebpay (till its closure) enabled users to buy and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Ethereum, and Litecoin, or to purchase airtime and gift cards. According to its website, it had over 3 Mn users.

Why it failed

Zebpay decided to down its shutters in the aftermath of the circular issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on 6 April 2018, restricting banks and regulated payments companies from extending any services to crypto exchanges and wallets.

Many Indian cryptocurrency exchanges, as well as crypto groups, soon knocked the doors of the Supreme Court which, after multiple hearings, has listed the matter for further hearing in January next year.

However, amid the lack of crypto rules and regulations in India, Zebpay, on September 28, 2018 announced its closure. In a statement, it said, ""At this point, we are unable to find a reasonable way to conduct the cryptocurrency exchange business."" The crypto exchange, however, continues to allow users to deposit and withdraw coins/tokens into their wallet.

Since then, the situation has only worsened -- the founders of Unocoin, another leading crypto exchange, were arrested on October 23 by Bengaluru Police over a Bitcoin ATM installation.

Not only Zebpay, a slew of exchanges including Coinsecure, BTCXIndia, MoneyTrade, Bitconnect and more shut down for various reasons this past year.

Online parenting app Babyberry helped parents of a newborn baby to provide the best possible care for their child's holistic growth and development from physical, cognitive, social to emotional growth. The app included features such as digital vaccination chart and reminders, health records management and access to the nearest doctors based on geolocation.

Why it failed

It is uncertain as to what lead BabyBerry to shutdown its operations. Its website is pulled down, it hasn't posted any feeds on its social media since October last year, nor any queries to the founders could elicit any response. In August this year, a report had cited its founder saying that the startup is currently looking to solve technical errors on the platform after many of its customers reported the glitches. Notwithstanding, the startup had raised $1 Mn (INR 6.99 Cr) in 2016 meant for product development and marketing.

MrNeeds offered consumers an online subscription-based service for the delivery of products such as milk, bread, eggs, and other grocery items. In June 2017, ET had cited Wadhwa saying that its ""per delivery costs are 50% to 70% lower than the industry standard,"" and was serving 36K monthly orders for 9K families across Noida.

Why it Failed

The startup has pulled down its website, and is mobile application is not found anymore on Google's play store. It is, however, not clear as to what lead the startup to shut its operations. It is likely that the startup closed down its shutters amid fierce competition from the likes of BigBasket, DailyNinja, and others. Inc42's efforts to reach out to the founders have gone unanswered.

Bike rental startup Tazzo was focussed on point-to-point commuting service and charged INR 5 per km. Its mobile application was integrated using GPS technology and tracked every movement of its entire fleet in real-time, including overspeeding, theft, etc.

Why it failed

TheDearth of the follow-on funding was the main reason for Tazzo to shut down its operation. In October 2016, the startup had raised about $225K (INR 1.5 Cr) seed funding from DSG Consumer Partners, but the capital-intensive nature of the sector it catered too, and the lack of funding, forced the startup to halt its operation in September this year.

Trucks and logistics platform Ezytruk connected carriers, shippers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), to enable systematic transportation of goods. It offered services such as price comparison between carriers, real-time information of the goods, warehouse space management, etc.

Why it failed

Ezytruk had raised a seed funding of $147K (INR 1.02 Cr) from Dubai-based investors Ajith Nair and Anish K in January 2017. However, the startup could not scale and grow further as it was unable to raise further rounds of funding, reported Techcircle, which ultimately led the founders to shutdown the operation this year.

B2B wholesale marketplace Wydr offered a range of products across categories like fashion, home, automotive and electronics to manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. The platform allowed sellers to customise their requirements, negotiate prices, and instantly close deals. As at February 2018, the startup claimed to have added over 10K manufacturers and distributors across cities in India.

Why it failed

A report by Entrackr on November 3 cited ShopClues cofounder Sandeep Aggarwal and an early investor in Wydr as confirming the shutdown. The report said that ""the company (Wydr) was scaling down for the past three months and finally pulled the plug a couple of days ago."" An email query sent to Wydr did not elicit any response. Its official website (www.wydr.in) is currently pulled down.

Monkeybox provided Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) - approved vegetarian meals for kids in the age group of 3-18 at school. As on July 2017, the company claimed to be supplying over 1,500 meals per day to more than 85 schools in Bengaluru, with over 2K subscribers on its platform.

Why it failed

The Blume Ventures-backed foodtech startup shut down its operations amid much surprise and speculation. On one hand, the startup had been making quite a few acquisitions -- such as food delivery company 75 In A Box, juice delivery startup RawKing -- and, on the other, there was speculation that it was shutting down as it had failed to garner the required revenue to stay afloat amid fierce competition. On March 23, Monkeybox published a statement saying that ""the operation will be temporarily terminated.""

However, the termination was final. Its official website (www.monkeybox.in) was pulled down.

Apart from Indian startups that shut shop, there are some companies that ceased their operations in India after facing stiff competition and declining revenue. Here are the top top international companies whose India operations were shut down this year.

Walmart-owned ecommerce company Flipkart acquired the Indian arm of global retail company eBay in March 2017 for an undisclosed amount. Like any other ecommerce platform, eBay facilitates consumer-to-consumer and business-to-consumer sales through its website.

However, the big difference between eBay and the others is it enables trading on its platforms both in an auction or a fixed price sale. In a buyer's auction, buyers bid for a specific product and in a seller auction, different sellers bid their fixed price for a single product and the buyer chooses the best offer.

Why it failed

In May this year, eBay announced that it was ending its partnership with Flipkart and also forbade the latter to use the eBay.in brand. As the partnership ended, Flipkart migrated eBay India sellers and customers to its platform. Although being among the first players in India's ecommerce space, eBay couldn't actually rake in much revenue and faced fierce competition from Flipkart and Amazon.

As the company slowed down, and before Flipkart took over, eBay India had fired more than 350 employees from its Indian arm.

The reasons for eBay's failure in India have been many: the marketplace model was ahead of its time (eBay launched in 2005); there was no guarantee of product quality for either the buyer or the seller, and Indians never really warmed up to the idea of online auctions.

The company CEO, Devin Wenig, has announced eBay will be relaunched with a new business model in India.

The Alibaba-backed Chinese dockless bike rental company, Ofo, offered bicycles for rent on campuses and gated communities across New Delhi, Indore, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, Pune, Coimbatore, and Chennai. At the time of announcing its India operations, the company claimed to have completed 1 Mn rides across seven countries.

Why it failed

Ofo's move to shut down its dockless bike renting service in India is part of company's strategy to scale down its operations in international markets, including countries such as Australia, Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, and Israel.

Ofo maintains that the move is aimed at remaining profitable. Techcrunch cited Ofo France general manager Laurent Kennel as saying that the company would focus on ""mature and promising markets"" such as Singapore, the US, the UK, France, and Italy. Moving forward, it is believed to be communicating with local markets about its plans.

Tapzo was an ""all-in-one"" app that used to aggregate more than 35 different apps in one place, across categories such as cabs, food, recharge, bill payment, news, cricket, horoscopes, and more. Tapzo's numbers were definitely impressive: 14,000 daily user base, 55K daily transactions, and an annual run rate (ARR) of INR 210 Cr in GMV/bookings.

Why It Failed

Tapzo's reduced valuation at its last funding round can be considered as a trigger towards its shutdown. Tapzo raised $1.9 Mn (INR 13.28 Cr) in December 2017 from existing investors RB Investments Pte Ltd and Ru-Net South Asia at a post-money valuation of $47.3 Mn (INR 308 Cr) -- nearly 50% less than its valuation in the previous round -- $85.54 Mn (INR 600 Cr).

Around mid of 2018, in August, the startup got finally acquired by Amazon. After the acquisition, Amazon has merged the entire Tapzo team with Amazon Pay, and it was working in the backend. Media reports said that Tapzo's founders are likely to get on board Amazon Pay's team in India.

HolaChef was a food aggregator that connected customers with chefs across the city, offering a new menu selection every day as per its website. Before shutting its operations three months back, the company was managing packaging, storage and delivery of the food.

Why It Failed

The startup was shut down around May 2018 amid a cash crunch. A media report in August has suggested that Kalaari Capital and India Quotient had already resigned from the board of directors of HolaChef earlier in the year.

With the increased dominance of players like Foodpanda, Zomato and Swiggy in the online food delivery market, investors lost interest in the startup. This was coupled with a market correction to make things worse. The last funding raised by Holachef was in February this year when it raised $28,602 (INR 20 Lakhs) in Series B round.

Foodpanda pounced on the chance, acquiring the startup for cheap -- the deal was said to fetch minimal returns HolaChef investors. For Foodpanda, the acquisition was an attempt to test waters in the cloud kitchen space, which its bigger rivals Swiggy and Zomato were already exploring.

A cursory glance at the startup shutdowns reported by Inc42 in the past three years shows that of the 32 startups that ceased their operations, most of them were from sectors such as consumer services, ecommerce, and fintech sectors. However, these sectors were among the top trending sectors in 2018, attracting investment, mergers, acquisitions, and new ventures. In fact, these are sectors that are expected to do better than all other sectors as well.

Goes to prove that it's not all about the idea, doesn't it?

What startups can learn from these stories is to buckle up their business strategy, take stock and identify even the most minuscule problems, and start rectifying them, immediately. They can also sleep on the fact that an idea -- or even market demand -- doesn't alone make a brilliant startup. It's also about execution and the right time, right place. As Edison also said, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.""

Update: Holachef and Tapzo have been acquired and not shutdown as was wrongly stated in an earlier version of this article."
"2","1030436732","2019-01-01","https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/editing-genes-and-ethics-the-downsides-of-tinkering-with-biology","Editing Genes And Ethics: The Downsides Of Tinkering With Biology","swarajyamag.com",FALSE,"A scientist working in the Broward County crime lab handles processed DNA extractions that were taken from blood samples of convicted criminals 13 July 2000 in Fort Lauderdale, FL. (Robert King/Newsmakers) Snapshot

Gene editing is likely to have unintended but adverse consequences. An ethical framework is the best guarantor against a worst-case scenario.

We tend to think about innovation in terms of technological prowess; but it turns out culture plays a crucial role. Similarly, we tend to think that technology per se is benign; but it turns out that ethical issues play an increasingly important role in the impact of technology on society. Technology is value-neutral, but its uses are anything but; innovators should, but don't, worry about the downsides as much as they hype the promised upside.

This issue has come into sharp focus with the announcement of the first allegedly genetically modified babies (GMBs). Chinese researcher He Jiankui announced in late November that he had used CRISPR-Cas9 to edit the foetal DNA of twin baby girls, Lulu and Nana. He said that he did this to make one twin immune to HIV, as their father is HIV+. He also claimed another woman is carrying a foetus that was also gene-edited in his lab. It's instructive to compare this to other ethical issues.

There have been many concerns expressed about algorithms that 'go rogue' and produce ethically deficient results. One classic case is the 'trolley problem' where a machine intelligence has to decide on a course of action that results in the death or injury of one set of individuals while saving another set of individuals. In the March 2017 issue of Swarajya, I reviewed Cathy O'Neill's Weapons of Math Destruction, about opaque big data algorithms deciding on things as diverse as sentences for crimes and teacher promotions based on criteria that may be unfair, racist, or inappropriate for the societal good.

Similarly, we have seen social media, which has its positives, being used to circulate fake news (leading to riots, murders, etc) or to allegedly affect election results (Cambridge Analytica and Facebook got into trouble for this). The era of 'deep fakes' is upon us: photos and videos doctored to appear authentic, so that for instance a famous leader may be seen saying things he never did say.

The Chinese Communist Party is using facial recognition and artificial intelligence (AI) to create a 'social credit' system, which is in effect a Big-Brother-like panopticon, watching everything an individual does: it may condemn you to gulags, as they are now doing to Uighurs.

But these ill-effects of technology pale in comparison to the can of worms that may be unleashed by tinkering with biology. There is a good reason why the entire world community has come together to ban biological weapons: the horrors that line of research can lead to are absolutely mind-blowing.

Among other things, biology is far more complex than we think, as argued by Robert Sapolsky in Behave: we are creatures not only of nature and nurture, but of even the dimly-understood effects of stress, experiences in childhood, trauma undergone by our Stone Age ancestors, and so forth. Besides, a few centuries of allopathy and Cartesian science have demonstrated that our understanding of cause and effect regarding the human body is less than perfect, much less.

A Pandora's Box may well open if we tinker with the human body (the precise gene-editing tool CRISPR-Cas9 can be used both with adults and foetuses). The very first concern is that of natural selection and evolution. If a particular gene has made it through millennia of natural selection, it stands to reason that it has some value and confers some benefit. By snipping it out, are we causing unintended consequences elsewhere? For instance, the CRISPR removal of the gene CCR5 that allows HIV to infect human cells in Jiankui's gene-edited baby girl: what is its side-effect? Does its absence make you more likely to become obese? Or die early? Nobody knows.

Besides, there have been some studies that show that CRISPR is not as clean a 'surgical knife' as has been believed: it may cause anomalies in the rest of the individual's genetic code (CRISPR DNA editing may cause serious genetic damage, researchers warn, Techcrunch, 16 July 2019). Thus it may well be a risk to mess with it: science fiction is full of stories of the kinds of chimeras that may emerge, with grave consequences not only to individuals, but indeed even the human race.

The general concerns about genetically modified organisms (GMOs) that have bedevilled agribusiness apply even more strongly to genetically modified babies, because, in a literal sense, people are 'playing god'. If some of the modified genes can be passed on to a person's offspring, then there is the possibility of that modification becoming a 'gene drive' affecting entire populations. ""In 2015, scientists proposed a moratorium on inheritable human genome edits that would affect the germline,"" according to Wikipedia, but that doesn't apply to non-human species.

There are proposals to attempt gene drives to force desirable characteristics through populations, for instance, a plan to release genetically modified mosquitoes to drive them to extinction in Florida. The gene modification would cause offspring to die before they reach reproductive age. The plan was abandoned because of risks, including the possibility that mutations would change the edit further. But substantial funding for gene drive technology ($75 million from the Bill Gates Foundation, and $100 million from the US DARPA) suggests that we haven't seen the last of it.

Ethical considerations about public health and the impact on individuals must take priority when policy-makers consider such uses of biotechnology and even pharmaceuticals. It is worth repeating that the risk of unintended consequences looms large. Some may remember the infamous drug thalidomide that was administered to pregnant women to reduce nausea and morning sickness. It turned out that the drug caused many malformed babies to be born, including those without limbs or deformed hearts or eyes.

We keep coming across ethics issues when it comes to medicine. For instance, there is the finding recently (in Too much care? Private health care sector and surgical interventions during childbirth in India, an IIM Ahmedabad working paper by Ambrish Dongre and Mitul Surana) that 900,000 unnecessary Caesarean sections were performed in the private sector in 2016 alone. The motive is quite likely to be money, as a C-section costs Rs 23,978 versus Rs 10,814 for a normal delivery. It may be defensive medicine in fear of lawsuits, too; and some women may want kids on certain nakshatras.

There is also the salutary story of cholesterol. It was vilified for 30 years as the villain in all sorts of heart diseases based on apparently dubious experiments. After urging us all to control our intake of fats, demonising coconut oil, and making an absolute fortune for pharma companies pushing statins, the US medical establishment quietly reversed itself in 2015, and admitted that they had not been able to identify a causal relationship between cholesterol and heart disease. It speaks volumes for the ethics of research scientists, especially at a famous East Coast university in the US.

Then there was the sensational book Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup by John Carreyrou. It is a thriller; it lays bare the shenanigans at Theranos, a blood-testing company, which promised to run an entire battery of tests efficiently and cheaply (not to mention painlessly) on just a couple of drops of blood from a fingertip jab, rather than a big needle being stuck into a vein.

It was the perfect Silicon Valley story, until it wasn't. Its rock-star chief executive officer (CEO) Elizabeth Holmes, a beautiful young woman who dropped out of Stanford at 19, and her chief operating officer, Ramesh 'Sunny' Balwani, an older veteran of tech companies, have been accused in civil and criminal cases of lying, cheating and outright fraud. They face many years in jail if convicted.

The company, once valued at $10 billion, ceased operations in September 2018. They had raised a billion dollars, had an all-star board with the likes of Henry Kissinger, George Schulz and Jim Mattis as members, and inked agreements with major pharma and grocery chains to create testing labs in their stories with Theranos machines. The media doted on them.

And then it all went horribly wrong. Theranos seems to be a Titanic that sank on hitting an ethical iceberg. It failed primarily because its technology couldn't cut it; but the hype had become so all-consuming that instead of owning up to their deficiencies, Holmes and Balwani kept building an edifice of lies that finally came crashing down. Their story is a case study in ethics (or the lack thereof): when their proprietary machines proved unable to run the tests, they simply ran them on commercial blood-testing, equipped and pretended the answers came from their own devices.

John Carreyrou, who broke the first sceptical story for The Wall Street Journal, and then persevered for three years as the company bullied and threatened him, the paper and his sources, wonders whether Holmes, the CEO, ""is a sociopath"", one utterly without morals.

These fiascos raise questions about a worldwide epidemic of lack of ethics. In India, we are inured to the fact that politicians, businesspeople, bankers, journalists, bureaucrats, and alas, judges, are not exactly the paragons of ethics we'd like them to be. The vast apparatus of corruption, rent-seeking and patronage-vending have ensured that India is one of the least ethical places to do business in, with only China being worse. The contrast with Japan, where there is a certain sanctity to contracts signed, is telling. There is also a difference with China: they will do unethical things for the glory of the Chinese nation; Indians will betray the nation for a pittance.

Not to accuse Americans of being overly ethical themselves, but they have a point when they claim that the Chinese have been brutally unethical in their practices such as commercial espionage, theft of intellectual property, cyber intrusions/theft, forced technology transfer and non-tariff barriers. They are fighting a total war.

The recent incident of an American fundamentalist Christian stealthily arriving in a prohibited island in the Andamans is also a cautionary tale. The Sentinelese, who inhabit this island, are known to be hostile to outsiders, and there are Indian laws that strictly prohibit contact, in particular because the islanders have no immunity to outside diseases. (One is reminded of how nineteenth century American colonists committed genocide on Native Americans by deliberately infecting them with malaria and other diseases.)

The American intruder, named John Allen Chau, was a medical technician, and so he knew that even minimal contact with the bacteria in his guts would probably be fatal to the entire small community of 60-100 Sentinelese. That didn't deter him: he'd rather convert them to Christianity even if that meant they'd all die;

that didn't matter to him. That man was probably a certifiable sociopath, if not a psychopath.

Plainly, in a world where greed and blind faith are tolerated, we need to create viable ethical frameworks. This is especially true for artificial intelligence, which does not come with a built-in set of ethics or morals or a conscience. Surprisingly, in a STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) obsessed world, it turns out that one of the most important issues today is that of a pure humanities subject. Traditional dharmic principles of ahimsa (non-violence), dama (self-restraint), asteya (non-covetousness), saucha (inner purity), and satyam (truth) suddenly don't look so bad. Indian innovators may need to take crash courses in Indian philosophy."

Although the water level is low, their trousers get drenched.

MORE THAN two months have passed since Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar laid the foundation stone of the bridge so that villagers in Morni, especially school students, may not have to crawl across a water pipeline to cross over the Ghaggar river, but the work has still not started because according to the PWD officials, ""the contractor was busy completing the work of a government rest house meant for VIPs"".

Harpal Singh, executive engineer of the Haryana public works department, which has to execute the work, said, ""In fact, the contractor was busy with the work of the construction of government rest house which is in front of the DC camp office in Sector 1. He is almost done with it and the next task is this bridge.""

The rest house has suites for the Governor and the Chief Minister, six VIP suites and 59 rooms for officers. It is apart from meeting hall, conference rooms, gymnasiums. Disappointed villagers of the area said that each day counts for them as they still have to wade through the river. Although the water level is low, their trousers get drenched.

""Students who have to cross the river literally shiver when they reach the school. It is already so cold. After their trousers get drenched in water, we make them sit out in the sun and take classes with others,"" Brij Kishore Gautam, a local teacher of the school, said. He added, ""I personally took the number of the contractor and he told me that he was busy in the construction of some rest house."" The villagers stated that the situation will deteriorate in the monsoons and the government won't be able to complete the work in just five months.

Bhola Nand, a local villager, said, ""Barely five months after the monsoons are going to start, they won't be able to construct the basic foundation as well. We will suffer the same way we did last monsoons.""

Residents of 59 villages of Morni have to risk their lives and use a four-inch-wide water pipeline over the Ghaggar river to reach their destinations. After Chandigarh Newsline, in a series of stories had highlighted the plight as to how, in the absence of a bridge, these villagers, especially students of Government Senior Secondary School Koti (located across), had to cross using a 20-foot-high water pipeline over the Ghaggar -- the only way to access their school or other destinations daily -- Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar had laid the foundation stone on October 23. It was promised that the work will start in one week but all in vain.

Haryana Education Minister Ram Bilas Sharma had visited the school last month and announced that the work would start soon.

Talking to Chandigarh Newsline, Sharma through his spokesperson said, ""I will inquire as to why the work has not yet been started. I will get it expedited.""

The bridge is being constructed at a cost of Rs 5 crore. It will be a two-lane 110-metre-long bridge. The height will be around 60 feet from the ground and it would help access the Government Senior Secondary School, Koti. The residents had been waiting for the bridge for decades.

This time in August, many students missed their half-yearly exams as the water level in the Ghaggar increased and students could not access their school. There are around 263 students in this school. Over 100 students have to cross the river every day to reach the school. About 60 other young men have to cross the river to reach Raipurrani, Bitna, Kalka, Pinjore or Panchkula for work or to study in colleges or pursue vocational courses."

Bangladesh's Election Commission is investigating allegations of vote rigging coming from across the country on Sunday, a spokesman told Reuters, as polling for a general election marred by violence ended and counting began.

Clashes between supporters of the ruling Awami League and its opponents killed at least 10 and wounded more than 20, police said, amid reports that more than three dozen opposition candidates complaining of alleged vote rigging had pulled out of the first competitive poll in the country in a decade.

The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said one of its candidates from Dhaka was stabbed while he was moving around in his constituency.

Police said the circumstances of the attack on Salahuddin Ahmed were not yet clear.

The Election Commission said it would act if rigging was confirmed, even as at least three voters in southeast Bangladesh, including a journalist, said they were barred from entering polling booths or were told their ballot papers had already been filled in.

""Allegations are coming from across the country and those are under investigation,"" commission spokesman S.M. Asaduzzaman said. ""If we get any confirmation from our own channels then measures will be taken as per rules.""

Reuters reporters across the country of 165 million people saw sparse turnout at polling booths during the election, widely expected to be won by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, giving her a third straight term in office.

Mobile internet was blocked and the streets of the capital were largely deserted as many had left to vote in their home towns.

Mahbub Talukdar, one of the five election commissioners who stirred a controversy last week by saying there was no level-playing field for the parties, told Reuters he did not see any opposition polling agents near the Dhaka booth where he voted, suggesting they had been kept away.

The clashes in the Muslim-majority country broke out between workers of the Awami League and its opponents, led by the BNP of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia. At least one of the victims was attacked by a machete-carrying group, police said, adding a man from a paramilitary auxiliary force also died.

Alleging vote manipulation, at least six candidates fighting against the Awami League withdrew from the contest in Khulna, a divisional headquarters 300 km (186 miles) southwest of Dhaka.

Media reports said across the country more than 40 out of 287 opposition candidates in fray pulled out alleging vote rigging.

There are 300 parliamentary constituencies in the country.

Rasel, a 34-year-old voter in the southeastern district of Chittagong, said he saw police and some Awami League workers he knew stopping people from entering one polling centre.

""They told me that 'voting is going on nicely, you donâ€™t need to go inside'. If you try to enter, you will be in trouble',"" Rasel, who declined to give his second name fearing reprisals, told Reuters by phone.

The local electoral officer said he had investigated the incident and ""found long queue in these centres and people were casting votes with a festive mood"".

The Awami League said opposition supporters were wrongly accusing the party.

Khaleda Zia

Soon after voting finished at 4 pm (1000 GMT), Reuters saw polling officials unsealing see-through ballot boxes and pouring the contents onto a blue plastic sheet on the floor of an election booth in Dhaka. TV channels have already started showing election trends and final results will be clear early on Monday.

The BNP boycotted the last election in 2014 claiming it wouldn't be free and fair. The party has been hobbled by the absence of its chairperson Khaleda, 74, who has been in jail since February on corruption charges which she says are politically motivated.

Hasina and Khaleda have alternated in power for most of the last three decades and this is the first election the BNP has contested without its leader.

It stitched together the National Unity Front alliance with smaller parties, but has alleged its supporters and candidates faced attacks and intimidation, including shootings and arrests, at the hands of ruling party activists during campaigning. Some BNP leaders and a European diplomat said they feared the election would be rigged.

Hasina's party dismissed the opposition charges, citing ""one false allegation after another for months prior to election as polls show a landslide victory"" for the ruling party.

""I believe that people will cast their votes in favour of Awami League to continue the pace of development,"" Hasina told reporters in Dhaka. ""The 'boat' will surely win. I believe in democracy and I have confidence in the people of my country."" But opposition leader Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said a win for his side was ""inevitable if the election is free and fair"".

Hasina has already invited foreign journalists and poll observers to her official residence on Monday.

Under Hasina, the country's $280 billion economy grew 7.8 percent in the 2017/18 financial year that ended on June 30, compared with 5.1 percent when Hasina took over in 2008/09.

Over the same period, annual sales of its economic mainstay, the garment industry, nearly tripled, with garment exports worth $30.6 billion in 2017/18, making up 83.5 percent of total exports. One of Hasina's top jobs if she retains power will be to address demands by garment workers for a higher minimum wage.

At a polling booth in old Dhaka on Sunday, some were afraid to comment on the polls, describing an atmosphere of fear.

A middle-aged businessman who declined to be named said: ""I am here to vote, but my family says, 'what's the point?' The ruling party will come back in power in any case."" Hasina has been praised internationally for providing refuge to Rohingya Muslims fleeing Myanmar, but her government is accused of suppressing dissent and jailing critics.

Hasina has faced accusations in the West of increasing authoritarianism. Her son, Wazed, told Reuters Hasina regarded such accusations as a ""badge of honour"".

""This is an important election, but the condition is not peaceful in the country,"" said Monir, a teacher at a madrassa.

""The opposition has not been able to exercise its responsibilities properly. They are afraid."""

The 23 December tsunami killed around 430 people along the coastlines of the Sunda Strait, capping a year of earthquakes and tsunamis in the vast archipelago, which straddles the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire.

No sirens were heard in those towns and beaches to alert people before the deadly series of waves hit shore.

Seismologists and authorities say a perfect storm of factors caused the tsunami and made early detection near impossible given the equipment in place.

But the disaster should be a wake-up call to step up research on tsunami triggers and preparedness, said several of the experts, some of whom have traveled to the Southeast Asian nation to investigate what happened.

A man walks in a neighborhood which was flattened by Friday's earthquake in Palu. AP

""Indonesia has demonstrated to the rest of the world the huge variety of sources that have the potential to cause tsunamis. More research is needed to understand those less-expected events,"" said Stephen Hicks, a seismologist at the University of Southampton.

Most tsunamis on record have been triggered by earthquakes. But this time it was an eruption of Anak Krakatau volcano that caused its crater to partially collapse into the sea at high tide, sending waves up to 5 metres (16 feet) high smashing into densely populated coastal areas on Java and Sumatra islands.

During the eruption, an estimated 180 million cubic metres, or around two-thirds of the less-than-100-year-old volcanic island, collapsed into the sea.

But the eruption didn't rattle seismic monitors significantly, and the absence of seismic signals normally associated with tsunamis led Indonesia's geophysics agency (BMKG) initially to tweet there was no tsunami.

Muhamad Sadly, head of geophysics at BMKG, later said its tidal monitors were not set up to trigger tsunami warnings from non-seismic events.

The head of Japan's International Research Institute of Disaster, Fumihiko Imamura, told Reuters he did not believe Japan's current warning system would have detected a tsunami like the one in the Sunda Strait.

""We still have some risks of this in Japan...because there's 111 active volcanoes and low capacity to monitor eruptions generating a tsunami,"" he said in Jakarta.

Scientists have long flagged the collapse of Anak Krakatau, around 155 kilometres west of the capital, as a concern. A 2012 study published by the Geological Society of London deemed it a ""tsunami hazard.""

Anak Krakatau has emerged from the Krakatoa volcano, which in 1883 erupted in one of the biggest explosions in recorded history, killing more than 36,000 people in a series of tsunamis and lowering the global surface temperature by one degree Celsius with its ash.

Broken warning system

Some experts believe there was enough time for at least a partial detection of last week's tsunami in the 24 minutes it took waves to hit land after the landslide on Anak Krakatau.

But a country-wide tsunami warning system of buoys connected to seabed sensors has been out of order since 2012 due to vandalism, neglect and a lack of public funds, authorities say.

""The lack of an early warning system is why Saturday's tsunami was not detected,"" said disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Nugroho, adding that of 1,000 tsunami sirens needed across Indonesia, only 56 are in place.

""Signs that a tsunami was coming weren't detected and so people did not have time to evacuate.""

President Joko Widodo this week ordered BMKG to purchase new early warning systems, and the agency later said it planned to install three tsunami buoys on the islands surrounding Anak Krakatau.

The cost of covering the country is estimated at 7 trillion rupiah ($481.10 million). That is roughly equivalent to Indonesia's total disaster response budget of 7.19 trillion rupiah for 2018, according to Nugroho.

But other experts say even if this network had been working, averting disaster would have been difficult.

""The tsunami was very much a worst-case scenario for any hope of a clear tsunami warning: a lack of an obvious earthquake to trigger a warning, shallow water, rough seabed, and the close proximity to nearby coastlines,"" said seismologist Hicks.

In the Philippines, Renato Solidum, undersecretary for disaster risk reduction, said eruptions from the country's Taal volcano had caused tsunami waves before in the surrounding Taal Lake.

He told Reuters that what happened in Indonesia showed the need to ""re-emphasize awareness and preparedness"" regarding volcanic activity and its potential to trigger tsunamis in the Philippines.

The United States has also suffered several tsunamis caused by volcanic activity, including in Alaska, Hawaii, and Washington, according to the national weather service.

More education

In Indonesia earlier this year, a double quake-and-tsunami disaster killed over 2,000 people on Sulawesi island, while at least 500 died when an earthquake flattened much of the northern coastline of the holiday island of Lombok.

In a country where, according to government data, 62.4 percent of the population is at risk of being struck by earthquakes and 1.6 percent by tsunamis, attention is now focused on a continued lack of preparedness.

""Given the potential for disasters in the country, it's time to have disaster education be part of the national curriculum,"" Widodo told reporters after the latest tsunami.

For Ramdi Tualfredi, a high school teacher who survived last week's waves, these improvements cannot come soon enough.

He told Reuters that people in his village of Cigondong on the west coast of Java and close to Krakatau had never received any safety drills or evacuation training.

""I've never received education on safety steps,"" he said. ""The system...totally failed.""

"9","1029111061","2018-12-29","http://www.theshillongtimes.com/2018/12/30/undaunted/","UNDAUNTED","theshillongtimes.com",FALSE,"She is only 44 and a mother of seven. If you think that is enough to make a woman vulnerable and break down under responsibility, then consider the fact that she is Amita Sangma, the woman who was crucial in exposing the attacking mob in East Jaintia Hills and saving the life of CSWO president Agnes Kharshiing.

Dressed in traditional Garo dakmanda and a yellow top and a gamosa wrapped around her head to hide the marks of brutality, Sangma looks much older than her age. But the eyes set on the plump cheerful face burns every time she talks about the dreadful experience on November 8.

After coming out of the hospital, Sangma has been extremely busy looking after her children and talking to the media. She met Sunday Shillong in a small dim-lit Khasi eatery in Mawblei despite her busy schedule. ""I know this shop and the kong who runs it. I know all the people here,"" she said as she entered the shop followed by a bodyguard from police.

As she settled down for the interview she exchanged a few niceties with the lady in the shop and ordered milk tea and jingbam. ""Puchhiye, hum sab batayega (Ask me what you want to know and I will tell you everything),"" she said.

Sangma speaks broken English but she is fluent in Hindi, Garo, Khasi and Assamese. She also understands Bengali and speaks too, albeit not fluently.

Sangma is originally from Tripura's Dalai district. Her father had a temporary job as home guard there. Coming from a financially backward family, Sangma never had the privilege to complete school education. Later, she came to Shillong in 1991 and got married to NB Sangma, who worked in civil defence and home guard. But her life changed after her husband died in 2008. ""It was a struggle to run the family of eight. On top of that the pension that I was entitled to was also being delayed. I was at the end of my wits when I came to know about Agnes Kharshiing and knocked on her door for help,"" she narrated.

Kharshiing helped her get the pension and Sangma pledged her allegiance to her as a sign of gratitude. ""I do not remember in which year I started accompanying her. Maybe 2009. But since then I have been with her and accompanied her in every case,"" Sangma smiled and asked the lady in the shop for kwai.

It was a beginning of a journey for Sangma who, along with Kharshiing, saw the deception in the system and the despondency of those in need of help.

The two gritty women not only dealt with rape cases but regularly followed up illegal coal mining that continued even after the National Green Tribunal's ban order.

It was one such case that the duo went to follow up on November 8. But during their investigation, a mob of around 40 people attacked them and beat them up brutally. The attackers left the two inside a forest to bleed to death. However, it was Sangma's presence of mind that saved the duo and uncovered a bitter truth that was hitherto being denied by the government.

A grievously injured Sangma pretended that she was unconscious while the attackers were still hitting Kharshiing with logs. As soon as the mob found the two women unconscious they left them. When everyone left, Sangma, still writhing in pain, crawled out of the forest and cried for help. She managed to draw the attention of a police van and they were taken to a nearby hospital.

The story after this is known thanks to the numerous reports in the media, including at the national level. But how had Sangma felt at that moment when death seemed imminent?

""The driver of our vehicle pleaded with the attackers saying it was only a tourist car and he had no inclination of what was happening. I was inside the car when Agnes was speaking to Chullet (Nidamon Chullet, the prime accused in the assault case). Chullet wanted to speak to her but she refused and then came the blows. They kicked her. I came out and asked them not to hit her but I was attacked too. I could have fled. I could have requested them to leave me. But tell me why would I do that? Why would I leave her and run away,"" Sangma said, her voice now hardened.

Sangma sipped the remaining tea and showed the wounds on her hands. The scars were still fresh and two of her fingers have stiches and wrapped with pieces of cloth. ""The pain was excruciating. The hand still pains. Kong Agnes is recuperating but it will take time,"" she said and added that they had asked for security on the fateful day but police had refused saying there were only a few personnel on duty.

Though the attackers managed to cripple the activists temporarily, they could not dent their resilience, especially that of Sangma, who has been through many troughs in life. Despite the responsibility of the seven children, Sangma said she is not afraid anymore.

""God saved us and I thank Him every day for that. There is a purpose for which He saved us and that is to fight the wrong, to defeat the demons and to expose all those politicians who are ruining lives for money and vote,"" she said. ""I am ready to die but not before getting justice. My daughters would cry when they visited me in the hospital but I told them that I am still alive and stronger than before,"" she added.

The words of conviction flowed out of her mouth and for a moment one would think she was possessed by a supernatural power. But that is how she is. Loyalty comes as naturally to her as courage in the face of adversity.

Her expression changed when asked about her children and what do they feel about the incident. ""They are proud of their mother. They know I am fighting for the right cause. You know what my sons say? When they watch a Hindi movie, they say mother would have fought the villains and killed them. I would have indeed fought had there been one or two on that day but there were so many people,"" she said and smiled again. By now, her lips were red from the betel leaf juice and her cheeks blushing from the cold. Her youngest daughter Anisha, who is in Class III, is also proud of her brave mother. ""Her teacher told her that she would come and visit me. Her friends say they saw my photo in newspapers,"" the embarrassed mother now bursts out laughing.

Sangma's eldest son is 21 but he could not complete college due to financial problems and works as a mason. All her children are supportive.While the sons help her financially and guard her as much as possible, the three daughters help her with household chores. The penury does not make them weak but like their mother, they have learned to fight for their rights in society.

It was getting dark outside the shop and Sangma asked the bodyguard to leave but the young man insisted on staying, probably apprehensive about leaving his responsibility in the company of a stranger.

Sangma reluctantly started talking about her rented house in Mawblei. It is a tin-roofed old structure with four small rooms and surrounded by forests. ""I would have taken you to my house but you have to walk uphill for quite some time.""

The conversation again shifted to illegal coal mining, the tragedy at the mine, the surrender of Chullet and the slow police investigation. Sangma said she and Kharshiing had visited almost all the coal mines, mostly inside forests, in different places in Jaintia Hills like Lumthari, Saipung and Ladrymbai.

The small-time contract workers start work early, around 5am, and come out of the rat holes by noon. ""We can show every illegal mine there. How can the police and district authorities say they do not know anything when it is going on right under their nose,"" she said.

When asked about people struggling to earn their livelihood in absence of coal mining, Sangma said it was only a political gimmick and a lie that politicians were trying to sell.

""We have got complaints from poor locals who do not want illegal mining because it is ruining water quality and the environment. The entire Jaintia Hills will cave in if this continues. Who will die? Not the rich politicians and mine owners but poor villagers. The locals know the truth but are too scared to speak out. Rich miners threaten the poor and mine in their land,"" she informed.

She wondered why the police have not yet arrested the tea shop owner from whose shop the attackers took slices of wood to beat the women up. She also suspects that a particular NGO is conniving with the perpetrators. Though no threat calls have come so far, but Sangma gets unknown calls. ""Chullet was leading the mob. He was there and he knows everything. Police should get all details from him and arrest the remaining people, even those who are absconding,"" she beat the table to prove her point.

The bellicose woman is determined to fight for the rights of the poor because ""law cannot be only for the rich"". ""I might be illiterate but I can think and judge and differentiate between the right and the wrong. Working with Kong Agnes has opened my eyes and made me even more determined. If those in power think the poor do not have brains then they are wrong. Test our endurance and our capability and you will see what is there inside the skull and deep inside the heart,"" she said.

The fight has only begun and with a new year beckoning, both Sangma and Kharshiing are resolute to resume the long battle. ""I don't know how long it will take but we cannot trust a government whose leaders blatantly lie to people. If I die fighting, the government should take responsibility of my children because it is the one who failed its constituents,"" said Sangma.

It was the end of conversation as she had to rush home after buying groceries. It was time to be a caring mother of the seven lucky angels.

BK Nandanoor: DDPI with a golden heart

A defunct government school at the remote Mallapur village in Raichur district in north Karnataka is now abuzz with activity, thanks to the efforts made by Deputy Director of Public Instruction (DDPI) B K Nandanoor. The school, which had shut its doors in August this year, started operating from December 18, and at least four children have resumed studies.Setting an example of a grassroots initiative, Nandanoor got the government school reopened after residents approached him.The school was shut after a teacher was suspended and the students dropped out, even though a new teacher was deputed. Nandanoor swung into action at once on December 17. Nandanoor says,""I read the admission list of the school and then set a target for visiting the students' houses. I visited all the houses.""

Karnataka High Court: Makeover moves for B'luru

Bengaluru's aesthetic beauty has been restored, city roads are free from potholes, and cleanliness has improved -- all thanks to the Karnataka High Court, which woke up BBMP from slumber. Acting on a batch of PILs, a division bench headed by Chief Justice Dinesh Maheshwari directed BBMP to preserve the city's visual appeal by removing illegal hoardings, flexes and banners. Due to this, new bye-laws are being evolved to regulate hoardings. BBMP officials even registered an FIR against Minister D K Shivakumar for not removing an unauthorised ad, despite being given time. Citizens also got relief from pothole-riddled roads and garbage piles in public areas. The court availed the assistance of Army engineers to check the quality of work done by BBMP.

Nanditha: The power of one student

Nanditha (11) gets the undivided attention of her teacher every day. The resident of Obenahalli in Kolar is the sole student in the Government Primary School. The school, which was shut down at the start of the year 2016-17 after most students left it for private institutions, was reopened on the insistence of Nanditha, her parents and well-wishers. Komala GK, Nanditha's teacher, recalled how her parents, who work as daily wage workers, came looking for her all the way to the new school where she was posted. ""I could see anger, fear and sadness in them. They asked me what their daughter should do with the school closed."" The government was forced to reopen the school at the start of the 2017-18 year and admit Nanditha. Now even when her teacher takes leave, another one is deputed.

Namma Thambis: Green warriors of Ulsoor Lake

On October 10 this year, over 1,000 Thambis of the Madras Sappers waded into the waters of Bengaluru's Ulsoor lake and fought a war against an invasion, and won it. The battle was against water hyacinth, a weed. Ulsoor lake, situated in the heart of the IT City,is also used by the Sappers for training. Tired of seeing their lifeline being suffocated owing to pollution, the Sappers took matter into their own hands. The soldiers,on boats, pulled out the waste using their bare hands. They also removed plastic waste, household rubbish and other garbage. At the end of the day, the Army also issued a wake-up call in their signature fashion, blunt and to the point: ""People should understand that it is not the business of the Army to become garbage cleaners.""

Ananya:Hero in the hills

Ananya Vasudev RM saved 15 families of Karike village in Kodagu district during this year's floods and subsequent landslides. Ananya Vasudev,an assistant lecturer of Geology at the National Institute of Technology, received a WhatsApp video from a friend which showed loud sound emanating from the ground. Ananya Vasudev asked his friend to send another video. After seeing the fresh video, he was sure the sound was due to soil piping and the area could see a landslide. Soil piping is a formation of voids within soil which causes internal erosion and seepage. He immediately spoke to Kodagu Deputy Commissioner Sreevidya who sent a team to the village and evacuated the families. As predicted by Ananya, the area saw a huge landslide a few hours later.

S B Vastradmath: Speedy justice his goal

Chitradurga district court judge S B Vastradmath has done his bit to ensure that the public reposes its faith in the judiciary by delivery of quick judgments. Recently, he was in new for sentencing a man who killed his wife to life imprisonment within 13 days of the crime. He pronounced another judgment within 11 days of the crime. In September, the judge delivered 153 judgments in 22 days without taking a day's leave. He has broken his own record of achieving 70 points in a single calender month, which was earlier set by him during his tenure as the Civil Judge (Jr division) at Molakalmuru. In the system to evaluate judges, a point is awarded for each judgment where the maximum is 70 points irrespective of the number of cases. Vastramath says awarding death penalty to 3 men accused of rape and torture of a woman in Kolar was his most memorable judgment.

Anita R:Lighting up cells

Inmates of Dharwad Central Jail have smiles on their faces now -- thanks to Jail Superintendent Anita R.Reason: She ensures that they, especially women, don't waste their time feeling guilty or unworthy. She has ensured that the inmates exhibit their talent and also earn some money when confined within the four walls of the jail. Each month, Anita comes up with unique programmes. From making diyas to undertaking a beautician's course to knitting winter wear, her ideas keep the inmates occupied. Men are sent to work in fields and run a vegetable shop within the Dharwad jail premises. They are taught baking too. Anita's measures have yielded results, with many inmates confessing that they have shown behavioural changes. Anita has more things planned for the inmates in 2019.

Ayub Ahmed: Dignified farewell mission

Meet Ayub Ahmed, who uses his own resources to shift unidentified and unclaimed bodies, and performs their last rites. This 38-year-old Mysuru resident has been carrying out this job for the past two decades. As soon as members of the public, hospitals or even the police inform him about unclaimed bodies, Ahmed reaches the spot in his old Ambassador car and takes the body. He works as a loader at the Mandi Mohalla Market in Mysuru. Though Ahmed has not kept an official count of the bodies that he has buried or cremated so far, Ahmed puts the figure at about 10,000. Ahmed posts photos of the bodies on his Facebook page in the hope of reaching out to the kin of the deceased. In absence of claims, he gets the paperwork done, after which he takes the unclaimed bodies to the graveyard and performs the last rites as per their religion.

Krishna Byregowda:Crusade against plastic

At a time when plastic water bottles were the norm in government offices, Rural Development Minister Krishna Byregowda decided to do away with them at his offices and meetings. He replaced the plastic bottles with glass tumblers and reusable water bottles. Byregowda even carries a personal water bottle to the Assembly and Council to avoid using plastic or paper cups. Each person who visits the minister's office is served water in a glass tumbler, unlike the popular practice in most government offices where water is given in plastic or paper cups. Such was the impact of his approach to the matter that the CM asked officials to refrain from distributing water in plastic bottles at all government events.

Randeep D: Official in public demand

That good work seldom goes unnoticed was proved in the case of IAS officer Randeep D, who was brought back as the Additional Commissioner of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) owing to public pressure after being shunted from the position. Randeep was transferred by an order signed by Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy as the Commissioner of Social Welfare Department. However, he had earned the confidence of waste management activists for his attempts to reform the ill-managed system in the city. Randeep was credited with setting up the Solid Waste Management control room, bringing proposals of GPS tracking of auto-tippers and compactors, and updating the microplan. Activists pointed out his role in implementation of standard operating with regarding BBMP's Animal Husbandry Department. This led citizens to launch an online campaign to demand his reinstatement. After the campaign got the support of about 1,000 people, Kumaraswamy had to take a relook at his decision.

Kempaiah: BEO answers the call

An inspiring act by the Block Education Officer of Bangarpet Taluk went a long way to show how personal involvement can improve the learning ambience for children. Kempaiah shocked the school administration authorities, as well as teachers and students during a visit to a Kannada Higher Primary School in the district -- he cleaned a blocked toilet. Kempaiah had decided to visit the school to see the conditions for himself after he received several complaints from parents about the unhygienic conditions in the classrooms and toilet. While checking the toilets, when he saw it blocked, he got to his knees and started cleaning it with a brush. He had expressed to TNIE that it was unfortunate that the teachers and anganwadi workers had not kept the school clean. The girls in the school were forced to walk to their homes in the village for toilet breaks during class hours.

Inscription Stones of Bangalore: Documenting city's history

A civic activism project, ""Inscription Stones of Bangalore"" aims at creating awareness about and protecting ancient stone inscriptions (shila shaasanas) found in the Bengaluru region. The group has discovered several new inscription stones and restored the neglected ones by relocating them to a respectful place. They have educated citizens through postcards, public talks, school visits, poster presentations and other group- funding initiatives. With the help of latest technology, they have created 3D models of critically-endangered stone inscriptions. This project follows in the footsteps of B L Rice, who between 1894 and 1905, documented the stones in his 12-volume book, Epigraphia Carnatica. The project also acts as a platform for interested Bengaluru residents to work towards conservation of these ancient stones, which speak a lot about the Garden City's rich cultural past."

But, he is right now the tallest leader among BNP leaders, who is leading the party's election campaign.

With Bangladesh Nationalist Party's chairperson Khaleda Zia in jail since February and her son and political heir, Tarique, living in London, a bespectacled 70-year-old man enters the party office in Gulshan neighbourhood, Dhaka's most posh locality as everyone stands in attention.

Dressed in a maroon sweater, stylish checked muffler and black coat, the man has a hoarse voice since he has given more than 200 speeches in the last two months of campaign. He asks for a warm water and settles down in one of the sofas.

""There is no campaign, it's a reign of terror, that too State terror,"" says Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, secretary general of the BNP, the main opposition party, in an exclusive conversation with The Indian Express. He is the man running the party, in the absence of the Zia family, and will play a leadership role -- if they win the elections.

A few months ago, he stitched up the Opposition alliance as he approached veteran secular icon, Kamal Hossain, and is challenging the Awami League-led ruling alliance under incumbent Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in the upcoming parliamentary elections on December 30.

A self-confessed spartan eater and of medium built, he is not a tall man. But, he is right now the tallest leader among BNP leaders, who is leading the party's election campaign.

His first complaint are about how the police is being used by the ruling party. ""bhoyaboho obostha (it's a dangerous situation),"" he says, with an air of resignation, as he narrates how his wife and daughter, a 32-year-old teacher, were also stopped by the police while campaigning. ""I can't conceive that such a situation can happen,"" he says.

Lodged in a 19th century rundown jail in old Dhaka, Zia is allowed to meet her family and party leaders once in 15 days. While her sister Selina Islam, brother Shamim Iskander and sister-in-law Kaniz meet her and give her fresh set of clothes, Fakhrul has been able to meet her three times since February.

""We took her permission before announcing our entry into elections,"" he says. He confers with Tarique, who also faces corruption charges and lives in London for a decade now, over encrypted apps. Tarique interviewed the candidates being given tickets for the polls from London over Skype.

So, in the absence of the Zia family, he is the face of the party. Zia is apparently suffering from multiple ailments, including joint pain, diabetes, and has been allowed an attendant in the jail.

""I represent people of Bangladesh, We are a liberal democratic political party."" ""We look forward to economic development, and social and economic progress,"" he says.

But, most importantly, he says, ""We believe in democracy"". He adds that the BNP re-introduced multiparty democracy in 1991, when Gen H M Ershad's regime ended.

""We tried to meet Indian leaders outside the country. We sought appointment from the Indian High Commissioner, sought and met three times, it's not the other way around,"" he says, but feels that Indian diplomats are not keen to meet and engage with the BNP leaders since they don't want to upset the incumbent government led by Hasina.

""We seek friendship with India. And contrary to the perception in India, we don't believe in communalism, fundamentalism,"" he says emphatically. ""That's a totally a false perception that we are anti-India, this is part of Awami League's concerted propaganda,"" he says.

But, many in Bangladesh remember the last BNP regime led by Khaleda Zia, from 2001 to 2006, when there were attacks against minorities in 2001 and subsequent anti-India activities.

Indian diplomats in Dhaka feel that BNP has lot to ""atone"" for what they did, when they were in power. But, Fakhrul is a pragmatic leader. ""We have been reaching out to India, including our Chairperson Begum Zia's visit to Delhi in 2012. We thought with BJP in power in 2014, things will improve. She had a very good meeting with Modi, but nothing happened after that. There was no follow up.""

""We were disappointed. We tried to fix up a meeting with BJP's general secretary Ram Madhav in Bangkok in August this year, but the Indian side chickened out,"" he told The Indian Express.

The BNP-Jamaat-e-Islami alliance between 2001 and 2006 has been a baggage for him, and he is trying hard to shed that image. ""When we are questioned about Jamaat, I tell you, See BNP is not Jamaat. BNP doesn't believe in Islamic laws, it doesn't believe in fundamentalism. We have no fascination for Jamaat,"" he says, but he realises that he has to walk the talk when they come to power.

While Jamaat-e-Islami is de-registered as a political outfit by the Bangladesh election commission, 22 leaders -- who were with Jamaat -- are contesting the elections on BNP's ticket.

""The tie-up with Jamaat is a strategic tie up. With them, we have an advantage in 50 seats where the margin is thin and the fight is tough. Without us, they are reduced to just three seats,"" he says, with complete real politik in his mind. But, will they be part of a future government. ""No way"", he says. During the 2001-2006 regime, the Jamaat-e-Islami, as a party, had been extremely vitriolic towards India, which Delhi is mindful of.

""BJP is a right-wing political party, RSS is also there. But we don't have a problem engaging with them,"" he says, without bringing in equivalence. ""Unfortunately, I don't know why India ignores the misdeeds of the Awami League government which includes torture, disappearances etc. India is being blamed by the common people, there is a perception that India is helping Awami League. Awami League is a hated political party. But, just because of India, it has survived, it's India which has strengthened Awami League,"" he said. He goes on to say that Bangladesh's police and bureaucracy have ""good connections"" with the Indian High Commission.

Fakhrul says that his main agenda is the ""right to vote"" and ""live freely"", so that no one is picked up by the police. Hailing from a political family, he entered student politics, and was part of progressive, left leaning East Pakistan students' Union, which played a role in the liberation war.

After studying economics in college, he said that during the liberation war, he crossed over and went to India to mobilise people. After liberation, he joined the education service in government and taught economics in college. After 18 years of teaching, he quit and joined politics. ""It is impossible to imagine BNP without the Zia family,"" he says, swearing his allegiance, and attributes it to the family's ""belief in Bangladeshi nationalism"".

""She is a real charismatic leader,"" he gushes, as his colleagues nod. He says that one of the first things will be to get her out of jail, if the BNP comes to power. So, will there be same treatment meted out to the Hasina family. He says, ""There won't be a politics of vengeance.""

In his free time, the septuagenarian loves to watch movies, especially Bangla classics starring Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen. Filmmaker Satyajit Ray's movies are his favourites, and he picks ""Apur Sansar"" as his most favourite, as well as Ritwik Ghatak's Meghey Dhaka Tara. He also likes Govind Nihalani's movies, ""I loved Tamas."" He also lists

Gautam Ghosh and Nandita Das, as some of his favourites.

As he sits in office, with a painting of a paddy field behind him, the BNP's topmost leader in Bangladesh, says, "" I never aspire to be PM. I will do whatever my party's leaders asked me to do.""A roadside bomb hit a tourist bus on Friday in an area near the Giza Pyramids, killing two Vietnamese tourists and wounding 12 others, Egypt's Interior Ministry said in a statement.

It said the bus was traveling in the Marioutiyah area near the pyramids when the crude roadside bomb, concealed by a wall, went off. The wounded included 10 Vietnamese tourists. The other two wounded were the Egyptian bus driver and the guide. The bus was carrying a total of 14 Vietnamese tourists, it added, saying only two of them escaped unharmed. Egypt has battled Islamic militants for years in the Sinai Peninsula in an insurgency that has occasionally spilled over to the mainland, hitting minority Christians or tourists. However, this is the first attack to target foreign tourists in almost two years.

The attack takes place as Egypt's vital tourism industry is showing signs of recovery after years in the doldrums because of the political turmoil and violence that followed a 2011 uprising that toppled former leader Hosni Mubarak. It will likely prompt authorities to further tighten security around churches and associated facilities ahead of the New year's Eve celebrations and next month's Christmas celebrations of the Coptic Orthodox Church, the dominant denomination among Egypt's estimated 10 million Christians.

Over the past two years, militant attacks against Christians in Egypt _ usually targeting churches or buses carrying pilgrims to remote desert monasteries _ have killed over a hundred people."

GST refund glitches, refusal of the state to refund 42 per cent share of the Central incentives pertaining to the pre-GST period, stalemate in the land acquisition for major infrastructure development projects like four-laning of the Baddi-Nalagarh highway and rail connectivity has left the investors disappointed.

The only silver-lining is that the state gets top ranking nationally in the ease of doing business initiative in the fast-moving category. Its overall ranking has improved to 16th as against 17th attained last year. No new industrial unit has been set up due to the locational disadvantage and little has been done to break the monopoly of transport unions whose freight is among the highest in the country. The Pandoga industrial area in Una district has found no takers and little could be done to revive the case of seeking environmental clearance of 515 bigha land at Dhabota in Nalagarh where new industrial area is proposed.

The much-awaited bulk drug park, announced by the Union Chemical and Fertilisers Minister in April 2016, is yet to receive funds for developing the 663.11 bigha site at Aduwal village in Nalagarh. Efforts to set up a cement plant at Churah subdivision of Chamba district have failed to yield results. The government has again announced an investor meet, albeit with a difference, where the Chief Minister is slated to lead a host of senior officials within the country and abroad to attract investment.

The Mukhya Mantri Swavlamban Yojana, which fetches 25 per cent investment subsidy with a ceiling of Rs 40 lakh in plant and machinery and an interest subsidy of 5 per cent for three years, was introduced in May to promote employment. As many as 793 proposals were forwarded to the banks but barely 36 were sanctioned and funds worth Rs 7.88 crore were disbursed which speak volumes about its lack of popularity. Limited success is received under the ambitious 'Start-Up Himachal' scheme with barely 40 start-ups having received financial assistance.

The state was,however, rated as ""Hill State leader and an aspiring leader in developing an enabling start-up ecosystem"" nationally. The 5-year Central Capital Investment Incentive for access to credit at 30 per cent for plant and machinery announced for the micro, small and medium enterprises is the lone new Central scheme which brought some cheer to the existing units.

Students without uniform, scholarship

It was a challenging year for the government in the education sector as it grappled with downtrend in enrollment and filling of vacancies while facing stiff resistance from teacher unions in its bid to bring qualitative improvement in education.

The scholarship scam of Rs 250 crore was unearthed in the Education Department and preliminary investigations revealed that the tentacles of the scam spread to other states also. The government has now handed over the investigations to the CBI. The department remained under the scanner of the High Court which monitored the measures taken by government to fill vacant posts.

The regularisation of teacher has not been done since 2008 and resentment was brewing among teachers as a large number of teachers retired without getting promotion. The government closed 100 elementary schools with less than 10 students and proposed the merger or closure of more than 400 elementary schools.

Efforts were made to get the best from teachers as annual increment of 38 PGTs were stopped for less than 25 per cent results in Class XII board examinations. To arrest the flight of students to private schools, the government introduced pre-primary (Nursery) classes in 3,391 schools on a pilot basis from the coming session and so far, 30,000 students have been registered. The enrollment in government schools has dropped by 23.7 per cent in past 10 years.

Under pressure from student unions, the government took a retrograde step to revert to annual system from semester system under RUSA while the cluster university, which was set up at Mandi, is yet to be functional.

The government failed to provide free uniforms to students of government schools from Class I to Class XII under the Atal Vardi Yojana.

The government tried to lure power producers by offering sops like deferring 12 free power royalty and other measures. Yet the exit of power producers continued as there was no takers for most of the projects in the Chandra basin in Lahaul-Spiti.

Even as there was marginal increase in revenue from power to Rs 1,100 crore as compared to Rs 950 crore last year, yet the state failed to add even a single megawatt to its existing capacity. The government tried to lure power producers by offering sops like deferring 12 free power royalty and other measures. Yet the exit of power producers continued as there was no takers for most of the projects in the Chandra basin in Lahaul-Spiti. There was complete lack of interest in the 1000 MW solar energy projects in Spiti as the HP State Transmission Corporation failed to lay the transmission line to evacuate power from the region.

The Directorate of Energy allotted just two projects - the jinxed 780 MW Jangi Thopan to the SJVNL and the 447 MW Dugar in 2018.

No effort was made to store over rain water in the monsoon on the Giri, Dharampur khud, both tributaries of the Yamuna, that goes waste every year as Shimla and Solan continue to face water shortage.

Private power producers cited high cost of power generation and lack of infrastructure like roads and transmission lines as the main reasons for not showing interest in the projects.The existing power companies had to resort to shutdown of powerhouses owing to the high level of silt. As a result, power companies and state suffered losses due to the frequent shutdown, while the consumers faced power cuts and water problems for hours during the shutdown.

Caught in debt trap

With the debt mounting to almost Rs 50,000 crore, the poor financial health of the state remained the biggest challenge before the BJP regime in its first year in office.

The absence of major revenue generation and limited Central funding under various schemes prevented the Jai Ram government from undertaking any major schemes. Most big projects and schemes are being implemented through Central funding.

Even as the Congress cried hoarse about the poor fiscal management, the BJP regime raised loans to the tune of Rs 2,500 crore against a limit of Rs 7,600 crore. The salary component of almost 2 lakh government employees is Rs 11,000 crore while the pensionary burden is to the tune of Rs 6,000 crore annually. A sum of Rs 4,300 crore will have to be paid as interest on loans during the financial year 2018-19.

The biggest area of concern is the extra spending on recruitment, besides upgrade and opening of new health and educational institutions. The only silver-lining is the hike in revenue from the power sector from Rs 750 crore in 2017-18 to Rs 10,500 crore.

The biggest challenge before the CM, who holds the Finance Department, is generating resources for which the government is eying power, tourism, industry and mining."

Banned Australian player Cameron Bancroft on Wednesday confirmed David Warner asked him to alter the ball during the tampering scandal in South Africa and said he went along with it ""to fit in"".

Bancroft was seen using sandpaper to try and rough up the ball in the Cape Town Test in March, receiving a nine-month ban from international and domestic cricket for his part in an incident that rocked the sport.

Warner and then captain Steve Smith were exiled for a year after all three were found to be involved.

A Cricket Australia investigation pointed to Warner as the mastermind and Bancroft revealed more details in an interview with Fox Sports.

""Dave suggested to me to carry the action out on the ball given the situation we were in the game and I didn't know any better,"" said Bancroft, whose ban runs out this coming weekend.

""I didn't know any better because I just wanted to fit in and feel valued really. As simple as that.

""The decision was based around my values, what I valued at the time, and I valued fitting in ... you hope that fitting in earns you respect and with that, I guess, there came a pretty big cost for the mistake.""

At the time, Bancroft had been forging a new Australian Test opening partnership with the more experienced Warner. But he made he clear he takes responsibility for his actions and did not consider himself a victim.

""I had a choice and I made a massive mistake and that is what is in my control,"" said Bancroft.

Last week Smith also opened up, admitting he failed as a captain by turning a blind eye to what went on.

Asked what happened in the changing rooms at Cape Town before Bancroft attempted to cheat, Smith had said: ""For me in the room, I walked past something and had the opportunity to stop it and I didn't do it and that was my leadership failure.

""It was the potential for something to happen and it went on and happened out in the field,"" he added.

""I had the opportunity to stop it at that point rather than say, 'I don't want to know anything about it'.

""And that was my failure of leadership. And, you know, I've taken responsibility for that.""

Smith made no mention of Warner, who has previously apologised and accepted responsibility for his part in the scandal.

Bancroft last week admitted he nearly walked away from the game to become a yoga teacher in the wake of the vitriol that met the tampering scandal.

He is expected to make his return for the Perth Scorchers in the Big Bash League on Sunday.

A day after Smith re-emerged into public life with a press conference in Sydney, Bancroft had also broken his silence a week ahead of his ban running out in the form of a long letter addressed to his former self. In it, Bancroft describes the major influence Australian coach Justin Langer has had on him, along with West Australian mentor Adam Voges.

He said a crucial moment was Voges asking him to justify why he should be on a pre-season trip to Brisbane by the Western Warriors Sheffield Shield team. Yoga became an important part of his life in exile while dealing with an absence of cricket, to the extent that he considered quitting the game to become of a teacher of the discipline.

""Maybe cricket isn't for you, you'll ask yourself ... will you return? Yoga will be such a fulfilling experience,"" he wrote.

""While you do not look that different, on the inside you are a vastly different man to the bloke who made that mistake in South Africa,"" he added in the letter.

""You know you cannot say sorry enough, but actually it is time you allow your cricket to be about what you have learnt and use this opportunity to make a great impact."""

Firstly, it was a shock to hear about the news of untimely demise of Dr. Syed ShujaatBukhari who was martyred by some unknown gunmen around evening on 14 June 2018. My heartfelt condolences to his bereaved family and whole team of Rising Kashmir. His loss is irreparable. May Allah bless his soul!

Shujaat's killing has given birth to Shaheed-e-Sahafat or ""martyr to the cause of courageous journalism"". Kashmir has lost a very professional journalist. An institution has lost its iconic leader. A family has lost its core member.

I personally have lost my guru, my adorable friend, mentor, guide and a great human being.I fall short of words to express my grief on the sad demise of beloved Syed ShujaatBukhari sir.

He was a fearless iconic figure, very good researcher and a nicest human being I have ever come across. He was an institution of journalism in himself. He was very sympathetic, generous and cordial to even an unknown person.

Though I never had the fortune of sitting with him in person, but I could read about him and hear much about him from my journalist friends, that I could easily imagine him as one of the best journalists and researchers of our era.

In January this year, he called upon a meeting for regular contributors to Rising Kashmir. I also got an email regarding invitation. As he always believed in teamwork, love, harmony and brotherhood, the purpose of the meeting was to get known each other well,to deepen the bond of relationship with Rising Kashmir and above all to discuss the issues of common interest.

Though I couldn't attend that meeting, but soon after the conclusion of meeting, around evening I got a friend request on Facebook with profile name Syed ShujaatBukhari. I got so much excited and happy to have friend request from such a great and adorable personality.

Since then, I used to talk with the sir on many occasions. The tweets that he used to share on fb were immensely showing his active presence on social media.

ShujaatBukhari sir is always in our hearts. His worth legacy is roaming all around every corner of the world that he left behind.

In ending week of September this year, the Editorial Board of Rising Kashmir called for another get-together of regular writers to Rising Kashmir. Absence of ShujaatBukhari sir was felt with deep emotions. I remember ab-initio, a writer got down with emotional weeping though he had never met ShujaatBukhari sir in-person. It was the get-together, day after a question about ShujaatBukhari sir was asked in the famous TV show ""KounBanegaCrorepati"" anchored by famous TV Star, Amitabh Bachchan.

Few people in the world of journalism managed to rise above the sky, and have managed to distinguish themselves as exemplary human beings.He was one of those rare journalists.

An excellent journalist, teacher, mentor and the nice soul to scores of people at state,national and international level. He is being sorely missed by everyone whose lives he touched in so many different ways. He would believe that Kashmiri youth are blessed with extra- ordinary talent that they need to explore at world level but there is a crucial need of some unique exploration machinery.

Being Editor-in -Chief of leading local English Daily Rising Kashmir, his writings on politics part of Jammu and Kashmir have been always practical and have a very mesmerizing impact on my thinking towards strong politics associated with Jammu and Kashmir.

His writings reflected belief in political solution to Kashmir conflict. A look into the last few writings gives an idea of his stand over several issues -- be it condemning the social sanctioning of youth turning to violence in the Valley, asking the State to re-think on its methods or urging the Kashmiri society to reflect on the growing violence in the Valley.

Besides, that in one of the last tweets, he was actually defending his journalism, makes his last articles important to understand just what that might be that he was eager to defend.

Describing how worrying the societal sanction for violence in Kashmir is becoming the new normal in the Valley, especially for the youth, and the State's response to it.

From his writings, debates and discussions, we could easily imbibe the idea that he believed in encouraging dialogue as a key to Jammu and Kashmir conflict.

He shuns the ideology of violence of any sort and believed that resolution to Kashmir conflict is only possible through a peaceful dialogue process. He has always been putting his word of truth with honesty, un-biasness, fearlessness and diligence.

I used to read his well - researched articles in Rising Kashmir and could feel a sense of peace of mind, prosperity and positivity. Besides this I could gain in depth knowledge about many issues.

His contributions to Kashmiri art, culture and language has been phenomenal and promising. Being founder of local daily in Kashmiri language Sangarmal and weekly Kashmiri Parcham, his contribution in promoting the cultural,linguistic and ethnic values of Kashmir has been revolutionary.

He used to promote Kashmiri art, culture and diasporic heritage whereever he visited at national or international level. Besides he was also the founder of an Urdu daily Buland Kashmir by which his contributions in Urdu literature has been phenomenal.

His selfless service in saving the lives in 2014 Kashmir floods has been very promising and phenomenal. He was day and night engaged in humanitarian works. His voluntary approach during the floods itself reflects how humanitarian,humble, generous and kind he was. He was a brave heart and best leader.

He had previously spent most part of his 30 years of professional career as the J&K bureau chief of The Hindu. A thorough professional, he was an equally prominent organiser of peace conferences and was also part of the Track II dialogue with Pakistan. A committed peacenik, he finally gave his blood hoping for peace.

The legacy that ShujaatBukhari sir left behind has to be carry forward with passion,zeal and enthusiasm and that is the responsibility of every intellectual or journalist in Kashmir. He was the voice of voiceless. He was the voice of a common Kashmiri.

Now we should believe that his noble voice is alive and we have to inherit that. His left legacy need to be given a real voice to carry forward his message of peace, prosperity, happiness, love, bravery, courage and above all his marvellous journalism."

As we approach another general election and look back, perhaps the biggest contribution, and disappointment, was the introduction of vikasvaad into our lexicon, and its incomplete articulation and poor implementation. It is also the frittering away of a historic opportunity to correct the structural problems which pin us down. The question remains: What is vikasvaad and why do we need it?

India is a land of great diversity and inequality. Add to this a massive vikas deficit, that is, the poor provisioning of sadak, bijli, paani and health, a large informal sector, struggling enterprises and a poverty of good jobs. All this was true at the birth of independent India and continues today. What is worse, we have lost our environment and a way of life more aligned with nature and the seasons. Yet, let alone modernity, even a modicum of certainty and dignity eludes us.

At Independence, in spite of the massive mobilisation of people, there were but a few imaginations of how India should be governed. The primary concerns then were, how will we stay together and what will pull our people out of abject poverty. The three broad options were: First, Ram Rajya. That is the politico-cultural stewardship of a popular and benevolent despot; second, a variation of Mahatma Gandhi's decentralised Hind Swaraj; and, finally, Nehruvian modernity, a paradigm of elite stewardship, which won the day and the approval of Gandhi.

Elite-vaad was the shoe-horning into existing colonial frameworks, a highly centralised and institutional meritocracy led by elite ""national"" bureaucrats and scientists. It was a concentration of knowledge and power, insulated from provincial politics, and a belief that this would rapidly take India and its people to a secular modernity. It is this vision that gave us the elite IAS, institutions like the IITs, CSIR laboratories, UGC, centralised regulatory and funding agencies. The motto was scientific temper -- unfortunately, a false binary between an apolitical and elite-supervised laboratory science and residual regressive practices of the ancients. This theme continues to this day as centrally employed scientists march to protect science from a backward people, but not to analyse their hardships.

Advertising

Predictably, the Nehruvian model has failed the common vernacular people, that is, Bharat. They remain poor, lumpen and jobless. Some states, especially from the South, tuned out of this imagination of the nation, instead preferring social comprehension and vernacular mobilisation, and they have generally done better. However, the model did lead to the flowering of English-speaking India as a successful satellite of the branded global economy and its business models. India is served by an army of delivery boys, janitors, watchmen, waiters, drivers, maids and cashiers from migrant Bharat. It may live in gated townships but the environmental collapse in Bharat is catching up. And yet, the hold of India over Bharat is almost complete. India eats what Bharat produces, drinks its water, extracts rents for most services, destroys its language, defines curricula and holds competitive exams, coaches its students, controls the media and decides what Bharat consumes and aspires for, materially and intellectually. Indian science refuses to measure and document the lived reality of the people of Bharat, of the long treks to fetch firewood, the empty wells and broken public transport. This consolidates the hold of the bureaucracy and shraddha over the destiny of the people of Bharat.

While politicians at the Centre may weigh in on defence, the railways and GST, it is in the provinces that the Nehruvian model tilts the balance of power in favour of the elite bureaucracy. In states with poor social awareness, this has led to cultural and developmental stagnation.

One would think that as social awareness improves, allegiance to the Nehruvian model would reduce. This is indeed happening in several states. However, a curious alignment of events and ideas has led to a revival of elite stewardship, and Indian intellectuals have played an important role. The first was the release of the Mandal report, which reopened a horizontal division of the people of Bharat along caste lines. This was reinforced through many centrally-sponsored rights-based schemes and a jargon of the disadvantaged and the oppressed, and, a delivery through key NGOs and people of good intentions, bypassing so-called local vested interests. Next was the emergence of big science and a theory of cosmopolitan and liberal humanism in the West, steered by its elite universities, professors and multilateral agencies. This was used to justify elite stewardship and to rejuvenate a narrative of historical continuity of Hindu orthodoxy, caste oppression, guilt and reparation. This is of course risky business, since there are several pasts but only one present in which to settle accounts. All the same, elite stewardship now presents itself not as the provider of vikas but as the saviour of science, humanism and the oppressed.

The result is that the typical community is now effectively divided into various overlapping and contesting classes of beneficiaries and interests -- SC/ST, APL/BPL, landless peasants, woman-headed households, OBC non-creamy-layer, large farmers, that is, a community without citizens. The sarpanch and the petty government servant are the key contractors. The rights-based discourse also ignores the decades of community work by hundreds of vernacular social reformers, the Baba Amtes of the provinces. The narrative of historical grievance has become more shrill, polarising and self-fulfilling as positions harden on both sides of the caste equation. Finally, it has converted the government job itself as a distributional social good, and deflected attention from the poor service that the typical government servant provides. The job definitions of most government employees, like the collector, the secretary, the teacher, the junior engineer or the gram sevak, are completely outdated and have stopped delivering value long ago. This is the crux of the development delivery problem, and harms the weakest sections of society the most, and yet it is the least analysed by Indian science.

So this is how Bharat is now -- divided, angry, thirsty and parched. Indeed, what unites Bharat is the cultural deprivation, the absence of role models and trust, and the brutishness of a people kept stupid. If there needs to be redistribution, it is not only of wealth and opportunity, but of knowledge and power, and it is not only within Bharat, but across India and Bharat. This must begin by reform at the top, of bringing elite science to serve the common man, of enforcing accountability and discipline on the elite bureaucrat, and a programme of social comprehension at the bottom. The takht of Delhi must gently descend for a new paradigm of the Centre-state relationship to emerge. That is the route to vikas and that should be the manifesto of vikasvaad."
"16","1025888260","2018-12-24","http://risingkashmir.com/news/what-is-wrong-with-semester-system","What is wrong with semester system?","RisingKashmir",FALSE,"Semester system has proved just an examination system with lack of in-depth teaching learning activities

Kashmir valley is quite unique in terms of its land locked nature, climatic conditions and existing political scenario. Our education system is in transition and quite vulnerable to the changing political and climatic trends. We are living in the era when technology has revolutionised the education system worldwide.

Further, we have witnessed technological revolution from black boards to digital boards with elaborate measures for teaching and evaluation.

However, we must admit the fact that we might have adopted new teaching learning processes and technologies but truly our examination system is age old and is in shambles.

We have completely failed in restoring the glory of examinations and have not been able to reform our question asking styles and evaluation system which is due to be overhauled and revised.

Various measures have been adopted to improve the college education system in our valley. The most recent one being the introduction of semester and choice based credit system in 2015.

The semester system being a flexible and proactive system with scope of continuous learning was adopted in our degree colleges as a broad major of educational reform over the old annual system.

Simultaneously, Choice Based Credit System as the new model of the academic curriculum was also introduced to enhance the college level education by flexible accumulation of credits across the subjects both for the teachers and the students.

It was perhaps introduced with the target to engage both the teachers and the students throughout the year in academic activities and back to back end semester examinations.

However, failures in its effective implementation, lack of adequate teaching hours and delay in conducting semester examinations and declaring results is evident due to multiple reasons, climate being a significant one.

Teachers too are facing a lot of problems like the overburden of teaching, evaluations, conducting research and corporate responsibilities in the institutions.

Infrastructure to support the class work for two semesters and two examinations in a year is either missing or is inadequate in Kashmir valley.

Majority of colleges particularly rural are deficit in various infrastructural facilities. Beyond November, it is very difficult to conduct classes in absence of adequate heating and lighting arrangements in the classrooms of our ailing degree colleges barring few. It is equally very tough for the students to listen their teacher under cold and crippled conditions.

Perhaps they remain under cold stress throughout the duration of the class and hampers the whole process of learning. Now who is to be blamed for this mess of the education system? It has been always felt that education is perhaps not among the priority areas of the government.

Why we don't have the classrooms with proper windows, lighting arrangement, heating facilities besides the normal aids of teaching-learning process.

We took no time to adopt the European models of education but we lag behind completely to raise the standards of our classroom infrastructure for effective teaching and learning in our institutions.

Can't our government invest much to improve the classrooms in the patterns of central heating system to enable them for post autumn and winter learning?

Such a gesture can be quite helpful in continuing with the odd-even semesterised classes beyond or during cold months.

Instead government is boosting more and more creation of colleges with less scope for the infrastructural setup in tune with the local socio-cultural setup and climate needs.

Therefore, we can surely pose question to ourselves that what has the semester system given to the students besides loss of a precious time of their academic carrier?

Overall, we can say that institutions, teachers and students failed to co-evolve themselves with the changing paradigm shift in education within this new semesterised system. It has ailed our education system which has taken the shape of a syndrome and factors and reasons are multiple and known to us.

For example, the cold climate conditions, inadequate heating arrangements in the class rooms and examination halls, effects of present socio-political turmoil, discontinuous nature of classwork due to frequent off days, and above all the delay in conducting examinations and declaring results at its proper time due to one or the other reason.

This has subsequently resulted in the unrest and psychological distress among the students who have knocked the doors of authorities on many occasions to press for their genuine demands either to roll back it or asking for concessions.

The only one affiliating university (University of Kashmir) having around a cent colleges sunder the banner of its affiliation proved quite defunct to facilitate and help in running the semester system effectively in colleges.

The University failed to manage the affairs vis-à-vis its affiliated colleges due to overburden of conducting examinations and declaring fool proof results timely.

The need is the establishment of autonomous institutions from the existing lot of colleges at least one or two from each district of the valley with decentralisation of examination burden vested with University of Kashmir.

The concerned university can act as a watch dog to monitor the various aspects of examination from paper setting through conducting to evaluation.

A college with its able leadership and qualified faculty for all practical purposes is quite competent and trustworthy to conduct the examination for its students and declare the results in stipulated time to run the odd and even semesters smoothly.

An example can be taken of the Islamia College of Science and Commerce (ICSC), Srinagar which has shown a remarkable progress in conducting examinations and declaring results well in time. Recently, the college was able to declare the results of semester 4th in just 13 odd days, which is quite rewarding.

Pertinently, ICSC is functioning as an academic autonomous institution since 2015 granted and endorsed by UGC and State Government respectively.

To conclude, it seems that semester system has not suited to our college education system and has proved just an examination system with lack of in-depth teaching learning activities.

Further, we have failed to sensitise ourselves with the needs to run the semester system and it has created problems both for the teachers and students.

No doubt a semester system provides a greater scope and freedom to enhance the quality of learning, the utmost need is to streamline the semesterised education system in accordance with our climatic and environmental conditions."

REPORTABLE

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

CRIMINAL APPEAL No(s). 2229 OF 2011

STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH Vs PREETAM

R. BANUMATHI, J.:

Citation: AIR 2018 SC 4212 : 2018 (4) JLJR 24 : 2018 (4) PLJR 62 : 2018 (11) Scale 120

(1) This appeal arises out of judgment and order dated 6th

January, 2010 passed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at

Jabalpur in Criminal Appeal NO.228 of 1995 in which the High

Court reversed the verdict of the conviction under Section 376

I.P.C. and also the sentence of imprisonment of seven years and

acquitted the respondent-accused.

(2) Despite service of notice, the respondent has not chosen

to appear and contest this appeal. Accordingly Ms. Nidhi,

Advocate, has been appointed by the Supreme Court Legal

Services Committee as amicus to contest the appeal on behalf of

the respondent.

(3) We have heard Ms. Swarupama Chaturvedi, learned counsel

appearing for the appellant-State and Ms. Nidhi, learned

amicus, and also perused the impugned judgment and the

evidence/materials on record.

(4) The facts of the case in a nutshell are as follows. On 6th

March, 1993 at about 9.00 p.m. the prosecutrix (PW-1) along

2

with her two sisters i.e. Hirkanbai (PW-3) and Anitabai had

gone outside the village to a field to attend nature's call and

while returning back the respondent-accused is alleged to have

forcibly taken the prosecutrix to the field and committed rape

on her.

(5) Since the Moti Ram (PW-2) who is father of Hirkanbai (PW-

3) and also uncle (chacha) of the prosecutrix was not in the

village, on his return a complaint was lodged on 8th March,

1993. The prosecutrix was medically examined on 9th March, 1993

by Dr. U.S. Vasnik (PW-6), who has noted that the hymen of

prosecutrix was torn; swelling was present on the edges of torn

hymen. Dr. U.S. Vasnik (PW-6) has opined that though vagina of

the prosecutrix was admitted two fingers easily, the

prosecutrix felt pain and the doctor (PW-6) has opined that the

prosecutrix was subjected to sexual intercourse within 2-3 days

of examination.

(6) Based upon the evidence of prosecutrix (PW-1) and

Mangrulal (PW-4) who went to the place of occurrence after

having been told by Anita and saw the accused running from

there and also on the evidence of Dr. U.S. Vasnik (PW-6), the

trial court convicted the respondent-accused under Section 376

I.P.C. and sentenced him to undergo imprisonment for a period

of seven years.

(7) On appeal, the High Court has reversed the verdict of

conviction on the grounds:- (i) There was no external injury on

3

the person of prosecutrix (PW-1) which is indicative of her

consent for the sexual intercourse and, therefore, the story of

forcible rape does not find support from the medical evidence;

(ii) There was delay in registration of the FIR.

(8) As pointed out earlier as per PW-6-Dr. Vasnik's evidence

the hymen of the prosecutrix (PW-1) was torn and swelling was

present in the vagina having redness. Doctor has noticed that

even though vagina admitted of two fingers, the prosecutrix

felt pain which is suggestive that the prosecutrix was

subjected to sexual intercourse only in the occurrence.

(9) It is fairly well-settled that in the absence of external

injury on the person of the prosecutrix, it cannot be concluded

that the incident had taken place with the consent of the

prosecutrix. It depends upon the facts and circumstances of

each case. In B.C. Deva alias Dyava v. State of Karnataka,

(2007) 12 SCC 122, this Court has held that absence of injury

on the person of the victim of rape does not lead to an

inference that the accused did not commit forcible sexual

intercourse. It was further held that even in the absence of

external injury, the oral testimony of the prosecutrix that she

was subjected to rape, cannot be ignored.

(10) In the present case evidence of prosecutrix (PW-1) is

supported by the medical evidence and also by the evidence of

Mangrulal (PW-4) who saw the accused running away from the

scene of occurrence. Insofar as the consent of the prosecutrix

4

(PW-1) pointed out by the High Court is concerned, we find it

difficult to agree with the view taken by the High Court. In

her chief examination, Dr. U.S. Vasnik (PW-6) has stated that

the age of the victim could be between 13 and 17 years. Of

course in her cross-examination, Dr. Vasnik has agreed to the

suggestion that the age of the victim could be 17 years.

(11) In our considered view, the answer elucidated in the

cross-examination of Dr. Vasnik (PW-6) cannot be taken as a

final opinion on the age of the prosecutrix (PW-1). It is to

be relevant to note that before the trial court the prosecution

has examined Bhaulal (PW-8), Head master/Head teacher of

Primary School Chor Pind Ke Par, District Balaghat. In his

evidence, Bhaulal (PW-8) has stated that the date of birth of

the prosecutrix (PW-1) was 16th May, 1981 which means that on

the date of the occurrence i.e. 6th March, 1993, the prosecutrix

(PW-1) was only aged about 12 years. The trial court has

neither acted upon the evidence of Bhaulal (PW-8) nor on the

school certificate on the ground that the person who has

admitted the prosecutrix in the school was not examined.

(12) In our considered view, the approach of the trial court

was not correct. In each and every case the prosecution cannot

be expected to examine the person who has admitted a student in

the school. The school registers are the authentic documents

being maintained in the official course, entitled to credence

of much weight unless proved otherwise. In our view,

considering the evidence of head master, Bhaulal (PW-8), and

the school certificate produced by him i.e. Ex.P/13-A, age of

the victim has to be taken as 12 years at the time of

occurrence.

(13) Of course, Dr. U.S. Vasnik (PW-6) in her chief examination

has stated that the age of the prosecutrix would be between 13

and 17 years. At the most, adopting the doctor's evidence, age

of the prosecutrix at the relevant point of time can only be

around 15 years. As per Section 375 I.P.C. a man is said to

commit rape, Sixthly - ""With or without her consent, when she

is under sixteen years of age"". The prosecutrix being aged 12

years at the time of the occurrence, her consent or otherwise

was of no relevance to bring the offence within the meaning of

Section 375 I.P.C. In our considered view the High Court

ignored the material evidence adduced by the prosecution and

erred in reversing the conviction of the respondent-accused.

(14) So far as the other ground of acquittal - delay in

registration of the F.I.R. is concerned, it has come on the

record that the uncle of the prosecutrix, Moti Ram (PW-2), was

not in the village and returned back to the village only on 8th

March, 1993 and on his return his daughter-Hirkanbai (PW-3),

has narrated the whole incident to him as to what happened to

the prosecutrix (PW-1) and a complaint was lodged on the same

day i.e. 8th March, 1993. After medical examination of the

prosecutrix (PW-1) on 9th March, 1993, F.I.R. was registered on

10th March, 1993 and the delay in registration of the F.I.R. has

been properly explained, which has not been considered by the

High Court.

(15) The impugned judgment of the High Court reversing the

conviction of the respondent to acquittal, cannot be sustained

and the same is liable to be set aside and the judgment of the

trial court convicting the respondent under Section 376 I.P.C.

is to be restored. The trial court has sentenced the

respondent-accused to undergo imprisonment for a period of

seven years.

(16) Prior to the Amendment Act 13 of 2013 (w.e.f. 3rd

February, 2013) under Section 376(1) I.P.C. the sentence of

imprisonment for a term shall not be less than 7 years

extending for life. However, as per the proviso to 376(1)

I.P.C. (prior to amendment) discretion is vested with the Court

to impose imprisonment for a term of less than seven years for

adequate and special reasons to be recorded in the judgment.

In this case, the occurrence was of the year 1993 i.e. about 25

years ago. Having regard to the passage of time and other

facts and circumstances of the case, the sentence of

imprisonment of seven years imposed on the respondent-accused

is reduced to a period of four years.

(17) Accordingly the appeal preferred by the State is allowed

and the conviction of the respondent-accused under Section 376

I.P.C. as passed by the trial court is restored. However, the

period of sentence of seven years, as noted above, is reduced

to four years.

(18) In case the respondent has not already undergone the

sentence of imprisonment of four years, he is to surrender to

custody within a period of fours weeks from today to serve the

remaining sentence failing which he shall be taken to custody.

(19) A copy of this order be sent to the concerned trial court

for necessary action.

A day after Smith re-emerged into public life with a press conference in Sydney, Bancroft has also broken his silence a week ahead of his ban running out.

He did so in the form of a long letter addressed to his former self, published in the West Australian newspaper, describing his emotional journey since.

In it, Bancroft describes the major influence Australian coach Justin Langer has had on him, along with West Australian mentor Adam Voges.

He said a crucial moment was Voges asking him to justify why he should be on a pre-season trip to Brisbane by the Western Warriors Sheffield Shield team.

""On your way to present your case to your coach you realise this is the moment when you begin to become OK with the thought of never having cricket as part of your life again,"" he wrote in the self-addressed letter.

But where to find them? Deal, no deal or even another referendum?

While #Brexit has dominated much of public debate and Government time, #Metoo and #gigeconomy have also featured prominently in public debate though they are assigned to the Government's growing list of ""future legislative reform needed if we just had time"" pile - shame JK Rowling couldn't make Hermione's time turner a reality.

The Government has repeatedly stated that it intends to maintain current UK employment laws so that existing workers' rights are unchanged following exit day, this could of course change, as political fortunes change ('Fantastic [Brexit] Beasts: the [G]rimes of Grindel[gov]'). The reality is that it is unlikely the Government will change its mind and repeal all EU-derived employment law or make large-scale changes to employment law in the aftermath of Brexit. There may be scope to tweak some provisions within the current legislation, but political considerations make it relatively unlikely that core employee rights would be reduced significantly following Brexit.

John Whiting, now CBE, is the writer's personal favourite taxman for this simple and honest statement, which continues to be true. Like last year, determining worker status in modern workplaces has once again been a hot topic in 2018.

Back in February we finally saw the delayed Government Response to the recommendations of the Taylor review of modern working practices; and the answer to the tricky employment status issue is...more consultation and thinking!

The Government has rejected Matthew Taylor's recommendation for introducing a 'worker status by default' presumption and is instead revisiting the possibility of a new statutory test to determine employment status. As acknowledged in the latest consultation which closed on 1 June, codification of the test for employment status would involve trade-offs. On the one hand, a simple and clear formula will give more certainty. On the other hand, the current case law based framework provides the nuance and flexibility often needed when applying the test to different circumstances which are inevitable in the labour market.

Ultimately, employment status is a complicated subject because employment relationships are just that - complicated. A status test set down in legislation rather than case law doesn't change that fact. Trying to encapsulate the nuanced factors developed over years of case law into legislation will be no easy feat. But have the courts been any more helpful this year?

Since the 2016 landmark tribunal decision (and 2017 Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) judgment) that Uber drivers are workers (despite Uber's best efforts at drafting bamboozling contractual clauses) there has been a seemingly endless supply of successful new claims predominantly concerning couriers [Insert your choice of courier company name and you will most likely find a case].

In June, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment in Pimlico Plumbers Limited & Anr v Smith on whether a plumber who was self-employed for tax purposes was nonetheless a worker for employment law purposes. In relation to the personal service requirement for establishing 'worker' status, the Supreme Court confirmed that a limited or occasional power of delegation could still be consistent with personal performance. The 'dominant purpose' of the contract remained one of personal service.

The Supreme Court's judgment significantly decreases the importance of the right of substitution as a determining factor. A substitution clause in and of itself does not magically prevent worker status. On the other hand, integration in the business appears to be a factor of increasing importance in the current wave of worker status cases.

The Supreme Court has tweaked the judicial test by succinctly articulating the 'dominant purpose' factor. But this is more judicial test evolution rather than revolution. Unfortunately, for hopes of world peace, arguments over the required elements of worker status are far from over. Whether and to what extent 'mutuality of obligation' between assignments is relevant to a person's status during assignments is still up for grabs. 'Mutuality of obligation' is a crucial factor to establish 'employee' status, but is it required and if so, to what extent, for establishing 'worker' status? As the Supreme Court said there is no easy answer to this question and it will have to await appraisal on another occasion.

The further appeal in the Uber case was heard by the Court of Appeal on 30 and 31 October. Will the judgment, when handed down, provide an answer? No doubt whichever way the judgment goes, the losing party will further appeal.

Unfortunately, we are not much closer to tackling world peace!

Last year in Jones v Birds Eye, the employment tribunal reminded us that following the 2013 EAT decision in Moran v Ideal Cleaning, the number of agency workers potentially falling within the provisions of the Agency Workers Regulations 2010 was significantly lower than originally anticipated. Following Moran, not all agency workers are protected; it is only those supplied to work temporarily. Those placed indefinitely (meaning open-ended in duration) are not placed 'temporarily' and are therefore outside the scope of the Agency Workers Regulations (AWR).

In both Moran and Jones the agency workers were found not to be temporary and so not covered by the AWR. Conversely this year in Brooknight Guarding Ltd v Matei we have an example of an agency worker placed temporarily. The EAT agreed with the tribunal, that while a relief security guard mainly worked at one site, it was as a 'cover security guard'. Each 'as required' assignment was on a temporary rather than on a permanent or indefinite basis.

In Kocur v Angard Staffing Solutions Ltd, an employer breached the AWR in providing an agency worker with fewer enhanced contractual days' holiday and shorter paid rest breaks than comparable permanent employees, despite the agency worker receiving a higher hourly wage. The EAT rejected the defence that the agency worker's higher rate of pay offset his inferior holiday entitlement and rest breaks - the AWR require a term-by-term comparison not a package approach.

For a part-time worker to establish less favourable treatment under the Part-Time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 (PTW) they need to identify an actual full-time worker comparator who is: employed by the same employer under the same type of contract and engaged in the same or broadly similar work having regard to level of qualification, skills and experience.

In Roddis v Sheffield Hallam University, the EAT considered what constitutes the 'same type of contract' for PTW purposes in the context of a claim by an employee working under a zero hours contract. The University argued that a lecturer's zero-hours contract was not the 'same type of contract' so he could not compare himself with a full-time lecturer on a permanent contract of employment.

A good academic try? Well no. The EAT had no trouble in rejecting this argument. It cannot be that a zero-hours contract of itself constitutes a different type of contract for the purposes of the PTW, since the consequence would be that an employee on a zero-hours contract would never be able to compare themselves to a full-time worker. As the EAT points out, if a contract of employment containing a zero-hours clause was a distinct type of contract under the PTW, the PTW would be self-defeating.

Back in June 2013, the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 was revamped. Significant new provisions were introduced. The changes included introducing co-workers' liability for victimisation with corresponding employer statutory vicarious liability.

In November, the Court of Appeal in Timis and Sage v Osipov confirmed that an individual's personal liability for detriment which they cause to a whistleblower colleague can extend to liability for that colleague's dismissal. Where a distinct prior detrimental act done by a co-worker results in the whistleblower's dismissal, the whistleblower can still recover compensation for losses flowing from the dismissal - a so-called 'dismissal consequent on detriment' claim. In this case, it leaves two wrongdoer directors on the hook for just over £2 million of losses, the employer company being insolvent.

For there to be a qualifying disclosure under the whistleblowing legislation, there must be a disclosure of information, not a matter of opinion or an allegation. In practice, information and allegations are often intertwined. In June, the Court of Appeal clarified that the question is whether the disclosure has ""sufficient factual content and specificity"" (Kilraine v London Borough of Wandsworth).

This year we have also learnt on the whistleblowing front:

Common law vicarious liability is a principle of strict, no-fault liability for wrongs committed by another person. In an employment relationship, an employer may be liable for the wrongs committed by an employee where there is a sufficient connection between those wrongs and the employee's employment. This is a very long-standing legal principle with the foundation of the 'modern' principle going back to 1912 (Lloyd and Grace, Smith and Co). But have 21st century developments expanded its scope?

Following a number of appellate level 21st century judgments, when considering whether an incident has sufficient connection with the employer, it is not merely a question of whether the employee was 'at work' in a strict sense. Instead it is whether the employee was otherwise 'clothed in the employer's authority' or ''acting within the field of activities assigned to them'.

For example, an employer was liable for a Managing Director's violent assault of a colleague at an impromptu post-Christmas work party after-party as the MD 'chose to wear his metaphorical managing director's hat' at the time of the incident. Another employer was vicariously liable for a data breach by a rogue employee as access to the data was within the field of activities assigned to him. The fact that the rogue employee's actions were designed to harm the employer was irrelevant.

July saw the Court of Appeal hand down one of the most significant judgments of the year - a combined judgment in Royal Mencap Society v Tomlinson-Blake and Shannon v Rampersad t/a Clifton House Residential Home. In a single judgment, the Court of Appeal has effectively overturned the precedent value of numerous EAT judgments concerning the treatment of 'sleep-in' shifts for national minimum wage (NMW) purposes.

Where a worker is required to work a number of 'sleep-in' night shifts at the employer's premises (to be available in case of an occasional emergency but otherwise expected to sleep all or most of the shift), does the full night shift constitute 'working' for the purposes of the NMW? The Court of Appeal has now answered this question ruling: ""the only time that counts for NMW purposes [during sleep-in-shifts] is the time when the worker is required to be awake for the purpose of working"".

Quite simply the only time that counts for NMW purposes is the time when the worker is required to be awake and actually carrying out work. Time spent sleeping/relaxing does not count. Factors previously found to point towards NMW being payable for the entire sleep-in shift are now irrelevant. The sleep-in exception in the NMW Regulations applies to cases where ""the essence of the arrangement is that the worker is expected to sleep"".

Turning to on-call time for Working Time Directive purposes, until this year Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) case-law has tended to focus on the worker's location during stand-by periods and whether it is at a place determined by the employer. Early this year, in Ville de Nivelles v Matzak, the CJEU considered whether on-call time is 'working time' for fire-fighters on-call at home but with a duty to respond within eight minutes. The CJEU has held that such time is 'working time'.

Perhaps a bit counterintuitively, this judgment still reaffirms the importance of proximity to the workplace. In this case, the obligation for the firefighters to remain physically present at the place determined by the employer (their homes) and the 'geographical and temporal constraints' resulting from the requirement to reach their place of work within eight minutes, limited the opportunities which the firefighters had to devote themselves to their personal and social interests. The situation of the firefighters in this case could therefore be distinguished from that of a worker who, during his stand-by duty, must simply be at his employer's disposal inasmuch as it must be possible to contact him. While being on employer premises during on-call time is not required, the proximity of the worker to the workplace at a place determined by the employer (even if it is the worker's home) is still a key factor.

In what is now a perennial favourite, holiday leave accrual, carry-over and pay calculations have once again featured heavily over the year.

Working out holiday entitlement for term time only workers, casual and zero hour workers can often prove to be an administrative headache. The Working Time Regulations (WTR) require holiday pay to be calculated on the basis of the average hours worked in the preceding 12 weeks immediately before payment is made. However, many employers have instead worked out holiday pay by using a 12.07% of annualised hours shortcut as set out in ACAS guidance (5.6 weeks is equivalent to 12.07% of hours worked over a year for a full time worker).

While the 12.07% method is accurate in many cases, it isn't always. In March, the EAT in Brazel v The Harpur Trust confirmed that calculating holiday pay for variable hour, term-time workers based on 12.07% of annualised hours is incorrect. The express provisions contained in the WTR cannot be overridden for ease of calculation. As shown in Mrs Brazel's case, the shortcut did not work accurately for part-time term time workers. Employers using a 12.07% of annualised hours calculation as a shortcut need to review their holiday pay calculation practices or face potential claims.

In Gomes v Higher Level Care Ltd, the Court of Appeal was asked whether compensation for failing to provide rest breaks can include an injury to feelings award. If yes, this would significantly increase the value of rest break breach claims.

The Court of Appeal has confirmed that compensation for claims for failing to provide rest breaks does not extend to injury to feelings, being akin to a breach of contract claim.

While compensation for failure to provide rest breaks and annual leave does not extend to awards for injury to feelings, not all WTR claims are excluded. In contrast, compensation for injury to feelings may be awarded in working time detriment claims since they are more akin to a statutory tort (South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service v Mansell & ors).

We have also had yet another EAT judgment on overtime and holiday pay calculations. The EAT in Flowers and others v East of England Ambulance Trust, once again confirmed that for a WTR claim ""normal pay"" is that which is ""normally received"". Focusing on whether overtime is or isn't ""voluntary"" is irrelevant. The key is regular receipt. But also check the contractual provisions. If there is a contractual right to have overtime included, there may not be a need to establish a regular pattern. In Flowers, regardless of the WTR claim, the claimants were entitled under a contractual clause to have any overtime pay received in the preceding three months included in their annual leave calculation whether or not the overtime worked was part of a regular and settled pattern.

In two German references, Kreuziger v Land Berlin and Max-Planck v Shimizu, the CJEU held that a worker who does not apply for paid annual leave during employment does not automatically lose the right to an allowance in lieu of untaken leave on termination. The worker must have been given an opportunity to take that leave. While employers are not required to force workers to actually exercise their right to take paid annual leave, a bit of nagging may be needed. It is for the employer to show that it encouraged the worker to do so, while informing them, accurately and in good time, of the risk of losing that leave at the end of the applicable reference period.

The CJEU has confirmed that the Working Time Directive (WTD) does not require holiday leave accrual during the taking of parental leave (Tribunalul Botoşani v Dicu). Parental leave (in the UK 18 weeks' unpaid leave to care for a child) is distinguishable from sickness absence and maternity leave. If national law suspends the employment contract during parental leave, then annual leave entitlement does not accrue during the taking of that parental leave. Parental leave is not equivalent to a period of actual work for determining the duration of paid annual leave.

In the UK, legislative provisions which apply to maternity, paternity, adoption and shared parental leave expressly state that during the leave period the employee is entitled to the benefit of all the terms and conditions of employment except remuneration - so holiday leave accrual continues during these leave periods. However, there is no corresponding legislative provision in relation to EU law derived parental leave.

If an employer unilaterally imposes a contractual change, it is possible for employees' agreement to be implied if they continue to work without protesting after the change has been imposed. But this is risky. Careful analysis of all communication from employees (both verbal and written) is necessary to ensure nothing has been communicated that suggests or evidences objection to the changes. Where the change imposed does not have immediate effect, silence would not be considered to be agreement simply as a result of the passage of time.

In April, the Court of Appeal in Abrahall and ors v Nottingham City Council reminded employers just what risky business it is to assume agreement. In this case, the Court held that a group of employees who continued to work following their employer's imposition of a pay freeze did not agree to a variation of contract. Although the employees did not bring tribunal claims until two years later and did not individually communicate protest, they had protested through their trade unions at the time. The employees continuing to work could not be taken as unequivocal acceptance of a change that was wholly to their disadvantage. A decision by the union not to take industrial action over the imposed change did not equate to accepting the variation.

Also in April, we received Supreme Court clarification on when contractual notice of termination served by post takes effect (Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust v Haywood). In the absence of any specific contractual provision, contractual notice takes effect only when the employee personally takes delivery of the letter containing the notice (so not date recorded delivery signed for by a family member). In this case, the date of termination was crucial because it determined whether the notice period expired on or before the employee's 50th birthday, which affected her pension entitlement by some £200,000.

This judgment now aligns the contractual law position with the statutory position in respect of the effective date of termination (EDT) under the Employment Rights Act 1996.

Lesson: when dismissing an employee, it is usually best to inform the employee in person (written confirmation being simply that, confirmation, and not the mode of first communication of the actual decision). This will remove any ambiguity about the date of dismissal.

From this year's crop of unfair dismissal judgments we have learned:

A head teacher's failure to disclose to school governors a close personal relationship she had with a registered sex offender was misconduct justifying dismissal (Reilly v Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council - Supreme Court). This judgment is of particular note as Lord Wilson questions how useful is the long-standing Burchell v BHS reasonableness test, but without reaching a conclusion. The Supreme Court has, in effect, invited argument in a future case.

Misconduct does need to necessarily amount to gross misconduct for a fair dismissal. There is no magic in labelling something as gross misconduct rather than as serious misconduct for unfair dismissal purposes. As ever, each case will be fact specific to determine whether the employer acted reasonably in treating that reason for dismissal as sufficient to justify dismissal (Quintiles Commercial UK Ltd v Barongo - EAT).

The deemed extension of the effective date of termination by statutory minimum notice does not apply where the employer is entitled to immediately dismiss (summary dismissal) by reason of the employee's conduct (Lancaster and Duke Ltd v Wileman - EAT)

An employee's letter giving 'notice' was not an unambiguous resignation. The context for the letter was that the employee was expecting to take up a different role in another department (although that role was subsequently withdrawn) and the tribunal was entitled to read it as giving notice of intention to leave a particular role rather than to terminate employment (East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust v Levy - EAT).

Where an employee is contractually entitled to receipt of Permanent Health Insurance (PHI) payments, absent any over-riding express terms, the courts will imply a term preventing an employee being dismissed where this would deprive them of the benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled under the PHI scheme. While an employee may use the implied term in a breach of contract wrongful dismissal claim, tribunals must not allow that breach to automatically dictate its conclusions on unfair dismissal. Having said that, breach of the implied term will still be a very important relevant factor when assessing fairness (Awan v ICTS UK Ltd - EAT).

It is automatically unfair to dismiss an employee for taking part in the activities of an independent trade union. Union officials who are also employees will lose this protection where they are found to have acted wholly unreasonably or maliciously in carrying out their functions. But where is the line drawn?

The Court of Appeal confirmed a trade union official was automatically unfairly dismissed despite misuse of confidential information. In the Court's view, it is not uncommon for a union representative to be given, without soliciting it, information that he or she realises has been obtained without the owner's consent. Although it might be said that the only correct course in such circumstances would be to decline the information or destroy it, the court was 'not here concerned with an ethics seminar'. Instead the key question was whether the very limited way in which Mr Morris made use of the obviously illegally obtained information (forwarding it to HR and insisting on a meeting to discuss the contents) was a 'sufficient departure from good industrial relations practice to take his conduct outside the scope of 'trade union activities' .

The Court held the line had not been crossed. At most, some sort of warning for storing and not deleting the information might have been appropriate. The official's conduct was not outside the scope of 'trade union activities' and he was therefore entitled to the statutory automatic unfair dismissal protection (Morris v Metrolink RATP Dev Ltd).

On the tax front, since 6 April the way that termination payments are taxed has changed. All payments in lieu of notice are now treated as earnings subject to tax and class 1 NICs. Effectively, employers are required to subject to tax an amount equivalent to the employee's basic pay (as defined in the new rules) if notice is not worked. However, planned changes making termination payments above £30,000 subject to class 1A NICs (employer liability only) have been postponed even further to April 2020, which is good news for employers.

While case law on transfers of undertakings has been relatively quiet this year we have had some interesting cases and some rare examples:

A renewed warning that if a parent company takes over the day-to-day running of the business of a subsidiary, this may result in a TUPE transfer of the subsidiary's employees to the parent. Significant care should be taken when a parent company decides to show more of an interest in the business of its subsidiary (whether following a share acquisition or otherwise). If the parent starts making decisions and issuing directions in a manner which suggests that it has assumed control of the subsidiary, it could inadvertently become the employer. In Guvera Ltd v Butler a parent company learned that lesson at some considerable cost, with awards for failing to inform and consult on the intra-group transfer amounting to £3.5 million having been made to the numerous claimants in this case.

European case-law in line with existing UK case-law that a temporary cessation of activities prior a transfer does not necessarily prevent the existence of a transfer of undertaking (Colino Sigüenza - CJEU).

A reminder that in assessing whether there has been a service provision change (SPC) to multiple new providers, the effect of fragmentation must be considered when identifying the relevant activity. In some cases, the way a service is carried out post-transfer will be a relevant consideration in determining whether the activities are fundamentally the same as those carried out by the outgoing contractor. It is important to assess the issue of fragmentation early on in the analysis, because in some cases the fragmentation will be so acute that it will no longer be possible to say that there has been a service provision change (London Care Ltd v Henry and others - EAT).

EAT guidance on the meaning of 'undertaking', 'economic entity' and 'administrative function', which is rarely seen in domestic cases. A useful round-up of case law (both domestic and European) in relation to services or entities performing functions within the public sector (Nicholls and others v London Borough of Croydon).

A rare example of a permitted change to terms and conditions following a TUPE transfer. A transferor was not prevented from withdrawing a travel time allowance. The genuine reason for its withdrawal was that it was outdated and unjustified, not for a reason related to the transfer (Tabberer v Mears Ltd - EAT).

It was hard to miss that on 25 May, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) together with the new Data Protection Act 2018 came into force introducing a raft of important changes to the data protection regime. Key changes include:

In July we received Court of Appeal guidance on the balancing test needed when dealing with a ""mixed data"" Subject Access Request and when a third party objects to their data being disclosed (B v General Medical Council):

Although the decision concerns the DPA 1998, it will continue to have relevance under the DPA 2018 and GDPR regime.

This year employers are reminded that checking references given by applicants is an important part of any recruitment process. Especially where experience equates to safety, doing so is critical.

In Francis-McGann v West Atlantic UK Ltd, a pilot applied for a captain position with a freight airline. He falsely claimed to have previously worked as a captain and gave as a referee Mr Desilijic Tiure - in hope that the reference would never be checked. The pilot was appointed as a captain before his references were checked and provided with training based on him already being an experienced captain.

The person who initially decided to hire Mr Francis-McGann was clearly not an obsessive Star Wars fan. When his references were checked, it became obvious that Mr Desilijic Tiure was fictitious, being Jabba Desilijic Tiure, better known as Jabba the Hutt of Star Wars fame! However that was merely the first Episode.

After being summarily dismissed, Mr Francis-McGann brought a tribunal claim for three months' unpaid notice pay! The tribunal had no qualms in dismissing his claim and allowing the employer's cross claim for recovery of training costs in accordance with a contractual clause in the sum of £4,725. The force was clearly not with Mr Francis-McGann.

In July, the EAT gave a warning to prospective employers considering withdrawing a job offer following the receipt of an unsatisfactory reference criticising an applicant's levels of absence in their previous job without first considering whether there was an underlying disability.

In South Warwickshire NHS Foundation Trust v Lee a prospective employer was liable for discrimination arising from disability when it withdrew a job offer after receiving and relying upon two unsatisfactory references. One of the references was unduly negative and inaccurate because it heavily relied on disability-related absences. The tribunal found the discriminatory reference had more than a minor influence on the new hirer's decision-maker. As such, it did not matter that the non-discriminatory reference may in and of itself have been sufficient cause to withdraw the job offer (although this may be relevant when awarding compensation). Lesson - consider references critically to assess whether any adverse comments in references may relate to disability necessitating follow-up enquiry.

Do employers need to match enhanced maternity pay for fathers taking Shared Parental Leave (ShPL)?

Early in April, the EAT in Ali v Capita Customer Management confirmed that it is not direct sex discrimination for employers to offer 14 weeks' enhanced maternity pay but only statutory ShPL pay.

While this case is in line with Government guidance and the traditional view, it is notable that Mr Ali's case concerned an enhanced maternity pay period of only 14 weeks which happens to be the minimum maternity leave period required under the EU Pregnant Workers Directive. As such, a question mark remains where enhanced contractual maternity pay period exceeds 14 weeks.

While we received at least a limited answer on the question of direct sex discrimination (subject to a pending appeal), the question of indirect sex discrimination is still very much up for grabs. Three weeks after the EAT handed down the Ali judgment, the EAT handed down its related judgment in Hextall v Chief Constable of Leicestershire Police.

In Hextall, the same question was considered through the prism of an indirect discrimination claim. In this case the EAT held the original tribunal incorrectly analysed the question of comparators and also failed to correctly identify the particular disadvantage. The case was therefore sent back to the tribunal. The question of indirect discrimination continues to be unresolved and we wait a further tribunal decision (determined on the correct legal basis). Like Ali, Hextall too is subject to a pending appeal.

While large private sector equal pay claims against several large supermarkets are making their way through the tribunal system and the usual endless preliminary issues, this year we have learned:

'Discrimination arising from a disability' is still a relatively new concept first introduced by section 15 of the Equality Act 2010. Over recent years we are gathering a body of case-law on the intricacies of this concept which involves the employer treating the employee ""unfavourably because of something arising in consequence"" of the employee's disability. Section 15 entails two distinct causative issues: The first involves examining the employer's state of mind: did the unfavourable treatment occur because of the employer's attitude to the relevant 'something'? The second is objective: is there a causal link between the disability and the 'something'?

This year we have learned:

In Donelien v Liberata UK, the Court of Appeal reassures employers that they can rely on the advice of occupational health advisers in determining whether an employee is disabled, so long as appropriate questions are raised and further clarification is sought where necessary.

An employer does not necessarily need to take every step possible to establish whether an employee is disabled in order to avoid having constructive knowledge of disability. The test is what an employer could reasonably be expected to know. In this case, the employer had not relied solely on an occupational health report stating that the employee was not disabled. It had also taken into account 'return to work' meetings and letters from the employee's GP. An employer's efforts need not be perfect and, in the circumstances, the employer had taken reasonable steps to ascertain the nature of the employee's illness and could not reasonably have been expected to do more particularly when dealing with an uncooperative employee.

To establish an indirect discrimination claim, the employee will need to show that the employer applied a ""provision, criterion or practice"" (PCP) that puts, or would put, those of the employee's protected group at a particular disadvantage compared to other groups. In Carreras v United First Partners Research, the Court of Appeal held that an expectation that an employee would work late does not have to be presented as an instruction to cause a disadvantage. If the disabled employee can establish the existence of a long-hours culture, this may be enough to amount to a 'practice' under the Equality Act 2010.

In Colt Technology Services Ltd v Brown, the EAT decided an important point regarding the effect of PHI on discrimination compensation, where the employee has had the opportunity to choose different levels of PHI cover through a workplace flexible benefits scheme.

The EAT considered the 'insurance exception' to the general rule that claimants should only be compensated for actual loss. The policy behind the exception is that an employer should not be able to benefit from an employee's prudence in taking out insurance, and so insurance pay outs are not set off against the employee's financial losses in those circumstances. In the context of a flexible benefits package - where an employee can choose the level of their insurance benefits in exchange for foregoing extra salary - this principle must be apportioned. The portion paid for by the employer without the employee foregoing extra salary will be offset (in this case 50%) and the portion for which the employee had foregone extra salary will not (in this case an additional 25%).

In relation to a claim for unlawful victimisation under the Equality Act 2010, ""giving false evidence or information, or making a false allegation, is not a protected act if the evidence or information is given, or the allegation is made in bad faith."" But does an ulterior motive for making a victimisation claim show bad faith?

In Saad v Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust, the EAT confirmed that honesty not motivation is key. The primary question for victimisation purposes is whether the employee has acted honestly in giving the evidence or information, or in making the allegation, that is relied on as a protected act. The existence of a predominant ulterior motive, while potentially relevant, is not the focus of the enquiry. In this case, just because the allegation was raised as a means to deflect criticism during a performance process did not automatically mean it was done in bad faith.

In Unite the Union v Nailard, the Court of Appeal reminds employers that harassment can be committed by inaction was well as action. Failure to act in relation to third party harassment which is brought to the employer's attention, may itself amount to harassment. If the reason for the failure to act was influenced, consciously or unconsciously, by the relevant protected characteristic, then that failure to act may itself amount to harassment. Employers should ensure that they train staff on dealing with harassment issues, make it clear that harassment from suppliers, clients and customers is not tolerated and keep clear records of issues arising.

In Bakkali v Greater Manchester Buses, the EAT point out that in harassment claims, context is a crucial element. Conduct ""related to"" a protected characteristic (in the test for harassment) is wider in scope than conduct ""because of"" a protected characteristic (in the test for direct discrimination). It requires a broader enquiry, involving ""a more intense focus"" on the context of the offending words or behaviour.

The Holy Grail: financially sustainable access to justice.

Following last year's abolition of tribunal fees by the Supreme Court, the number of claims has been steadily increasing. While the number of individual tribunal claims overall has not yet returned to the pre- 2013 introduction of the fees regime level, we have reached an important statistical milestone. September's quarterly statistics revealed that single-claim receipts are, for the first time, at a higher level than when fees were first introduced.

While the number of claims is set to rise over the near future, the Ministry of Justice in November announced that a new fee regime ""balancing tribunal funding and access to justice"" was ""in development"".

Four years after the introduction of mandatory ACAS early conciliation (EC) we finally have appellate level confirmation on how to apply the 'stop the clock' provisions. In April, the EAT confirmed the widely accepted view that the time limit to present a claim should always be extended by the number of days it takes to complete the EC procedure (Luton Borough Council v Haque).

The conviction of Sajjan Kumar 34 years after the mass murders of Sikhs he led in Delhi has generated a predominantly political debate. With Rajiv Gandhi having dismissed the riots as no more than the earth shaking after a big tree falls, it is difficult for the Congress to shake off its association with that mass crime.

In the process a critical question will once again be brushed under the carpet: What is it about Indian cities that make them so vulnerable to political violence?

The extent of this vulnerability is not in doubt. Political violence has quietly emerged as the most important form of mass violence in urban India. The violence is not confined to cities with a reputation for aggressive behaviour. A city like Mumbai has all the demonstrations of culture. It has one of the more vibrant theatre traditions in India. Its citizens even line up in queues when needed. It is a city where women can usually travel alone quite late at night. Yet it is also a city where political violence around the Babri Masjid issue generated mass murders.

The rise of political violence will no doubt raise all kinds of issues about politicians. Fingers can be pointed at the rise of the lumpen element among them. Figures can be, and have been, found about the high levels of criminality in this class. This has in fact become so much the norm that candidates in elections do not appear to be particularly bothered by the Election Commission's requirement that they declare the criminal cases against them.

Identifying mass political violence in our cities with the criminality of politicians would, however, be a case of putting the cart before the horse. Criminals would not be in politics if politics did not offer them the space to demonstrate their criminality. The uncomfortable fact is that this space for criminality has been generated by the political class in order to meet a demand of voters. Indians, particularly urban Indians, have become increasingly self-righteous. We do not need to put on our televisions for more than five minutes, or glance at tweets from more than a few eminent personalities, to notice the complete absence of introspection in public debate.

Each side in the debate promotes a very narrow self-interest usually gravitating towards one or the other political party. This approach completely removes the possibility of participants in a debate influencing each other. With rational debate being taken out of the equation politics begins to rely more on more muscular methods; methods that criminals are rather good at.

What makes matters worse is the ability of politicians to convert local acts of criminality into mass violence. And they have an unexpected teacher here. In the Salt Satyagraha, Gandhiji demonstrated that Indians can be mobilised around symbols as much as by specific demands. He was quite aware that such a form of mobilisation of large numbers without organisational control placed a great moral responsibility on the leadership to ensure things did not go out of hand. His insistence on non-violence was thus an essential condition to ensure his mass mobilisations retained their moral authority.

For modern Indian politicians the first part of the lesson is attractive while the latter is not. They try to identify symbols that bring together diverse groups of people. Arguably, the most successful of these efforts in recent times has been the Ram temple issue with its ability to reach out to diverse sets of Hindus. At more local levels of caste mobilisation, a general demand for reservations often plays a similar role. In neither case is there always sufficient commitment to ensure the mass mobilisation does not turn violent. Indeed, the competition for leadership of these mobilisations often prompts leaders to incite mass violence.

The intensity of the violence may make it seem that there is nothing to be done other than beat our breasts about the decline in the standards of politics. But we need to step back and recognise that this space for criminality has been created by reason and morality giving way to predetermined commitment to a political position.

Reclaiming the space for reason and morality is no doubt a long and arduous task, but it is important to start somewhere. It would be useful to begin by setting up a museum for the victims of mass violence in India on the lines of the Holocaust museum. It is by reminding ourselves, and future generations, of just how terrible the Sikh riots, the Gujarat riots, the riots in Mumbai and elsewhere have been that we begin to make it more difficult for them to happen again."

While the bypoll in Jasdan was necessitated as the sitting MLA, Kunvarji Bavaliya, parted ways with the Congress party to join the BJP, the Kolebira seat was vacated after Enos Ekka, a Jharkhand Party MLA, lost his membership following his conviction in a murder case.

Counting of votes on both seats will be conducted on December 23.

Kolibera assembly bypoll

In total five candidates are in the fray for the Kolibera assembly bypoll in Jharkhand on Thursday, officials said.

BJP's Basant Soreng, Menan Ekka of the Jharkhand Party, Congress's Naman Vixcel Kongadi, Anil Kandulna of Sengel Party and an Independent candidate, Basant Dungdung, are in the fray, they said.

Enos Ekka lost his membership after he was convicted by a trial court in a 2014 case of kidnapping and murder. The case pertained to the kidnapping of a teacher, Manoj Kumar, on November 26, 2014. Kumar's body was recovered from a spot near a school the next day.

Ekka was a minister in three governments, led by Arjun Munda, Madhu Koda and Shibu Soren respectively between 2005 and 2008.

Now his wife Menan Ekka is contesting from the seat on Jharkhand Party party ticket. She also has the backing of the JMM.

Jasdan assembly bypoll

The seat was vacated by Kunvarji Bavaliya, who won the 2017 assembly polls on a Congress ticket, but switched to the BJP in July this year. Both the Congress and the BJP sounding confident of winning the seat held by Bavaliya.

Bavaliya had quit the Congress, resigned from the assembly, and joined the ruling BJP, which immediately made him a Cabinet minister.

Bavaliya's resignation necessitated the bypoll in Jasdan, located in Rajkot district, around 200km from Ahmedabad, and he is now in the fray as the BJP candidate.

The Congress has fielded Avsar Nakiya, a district panchayat member, from the seat where result will be announced on December 23.

A total of 19 candidates are in the fray in Jasdan, but the main contest is likely to be between Bavaliya and Nakiya.

The BJP organised a 36km-long motorbike rally, led by its state president Jitu Vaghani, on the last day of canvassing. Bavaliya is a prominent Koli leader and is banking on support from his community, which has a large presence in the constituency, to get re-elected. The ruling party organised rallies and door-to-door campaigns in support of Bavaliya with Vaghani leading from the front in canvassing.

While Chief Minister Vijay Rupani was conspicuous by his absence on the campaign trail, his wife Anjali Rupani sought votes for Bavaliya.

Senior state Congress leaders and party's Gujarat in- charge Rajeev Satav besides a host of MLAs campaigned for Nakiya. The opposition party also brought in Punjab Cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu as its star campaigner to address a gathering moments before the campaign ended at 5 pm on Tuesday.

From what appeared as a sop ahead of the bypoll, the state government on Tuesday announced a complete waiver of Rs 625 crore in unpaid electricity bills under its one-time settlement scheme for over 6 lakh people living in Gujarat's rural areas. Jasdan is largely a rural constituency.

The Congress, however, continued to demand a loan waiver for distressed farmers in the state.

A report was sought from the state government on its announcement to waive rural electricity bills as it came two days before an Assembly by-election, the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) of Gujarat said Wednesday."

After a year's absence, the black-necked crane or 'Trung-Trung Karmo' as local Monpa Buddhists call it is back at its winter retreat in the valley. The bird is revered by the 1 lakh-strong community as an embodiment of the sixth Dalai Lama, but is at the centre of unrest brewing over a hydroelectric project nearby.

""The moment I spotted the cranes I prayed: let our village host the harbingers of peace and good harvest forever,"" Chotta said.

The life of Tsangyang Gyatso, the sixth Dalai Lama, never fit neatly into the framework of a religious leader. Born in 1683 at the Urgelling monastery, 5 km from Tawang, he was declared as the Dalai when he was 15 at a time when Mongol and Manchu rulers were vying for control of Tibet. By the time Tsangyang took over in 1697, the situation had turned extremely volatile. The unwilling head of the monastic order renounced his vows - the first and only Dalai Lama to do so - and took to alcohol, archery, young women and love poetry.

White crane!

Lend me your wings.

I shall not fly far;

From Lithang, I shall

return

The sixth Dalai Lama wrote hundreds of such poems before 1706, when he was put under house arrest. He died the same year. The ""crane"" became an enduring symbol of the sixth Dalai Lama. Every winter, black-necked cranes migrate from Tibet and China's Xinjiang province in small flocks. Sangti Valley in West Kameng district and Zemithang are the only wintering sites of the bird in India. The crane also breeds in Ladakh and Bhutan.

A Schedule I species under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 - the highest legal protection given to birds and wildlife - the black-necked crane has been classified as 'vulnerable' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in its Red List of Threatened Species. In Arunachal Pradesh, thelocal communities never harm it. But greater disruptions could be in store.

In 2012, the ministry of environment gave environmental clearance to the Rs 6,400-crore 780-MW Nyamjang Chhu hydroelectric project. A 3km stretch of the Nyamjang Chhu ('chhu' means river in Monpa) between Brokenthang and Zemithang that comes under the project area is also a wintering site for the black-necked crane. Officers in charge of the hydroelectric project had said there are few, if any, black-necked cranes to be seen in the valley.

The clearance was challenged by Save Mon Region Federation, a conservation group led by Buddhist lamas, at the National Green Tribunal, successfully. The Nyamjang Chhu project is one of 13 mega power proposed in Tawang. ""The population of Tawang is about 49,000. We don't need so many projects. These are meant to generate electricity to be sold outside, at the cost of our livelihoods and ecology,"" Lobsang Gyatso, a lama and general secretary of SMRF, had told TOI in 2013.

In 2016, NGT suspended the environmental clearance given to the project and asked the environment ministry to conduct a study on its environmental impact. And it is this report on which the Monpas are counting on.

""The survival of the wintering site depends on the WII report,"" says Degin Dorjee, a teacher in Zemithang. ""We don't know what is in the WII report, we don't know if it is complete or when it will be. We don't know when the public hearing on the report will be held,"" Dorjee added.

In 2016, Lobsang Gyatso was arrested after he said the Guru Tulku Rinpoche should not interfere with ""hydropower politics"" in Tawang. The Tulku Rinpoche is the spiritual head of the Mon region and abbot of the Tawang Monastery, the second largest Tibetan Buddhist monastery. Locally, it was perceived that he was in favour of the dam. Days later, several anti-dam protesters stormed the Tawang police station and demanded Gyatso's release. Police opened fire and a monk and a civilian were killed.

Hydel projects have begun disrupting local culture and ecology, said protesters. Two hydropower projects on the Tawang river - the 600-MW Tawang I project and the 800-MW Tawang II project - have been proposed on areas considered sacred by the Buddhists. ""The barrage of Tawang I project will affect a site where Guru Padmasambhava's meditation chair was carved out of a rock,"" said an SMRF activist. Padmasambhava was an 8th century spiritual leader who is believed to have visited and consecrated a site about 45 km from Tawang town. ""Besides, there is a sacred site, Tongsheng, which we fear will be hit by the Tawang-I. Similarly, the Tawang-II project will affect a sacred site called Shangkya,"" the activist added.

Both Tawang I and II projects got environmental clearance in 2011, but the final forest clearance is pending. The Tawang-II project is also an important habitat for the red panda, categorised as 'endangered' in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The hill state has a hydropower generation potential of 46,806 MW. Government-backed discussions often refer to cultural and environmental concerns as ""roadblocks"". In September, the Standing Committee of the National Board of Wildlife (NBWL) cleared the 1,750-sMW Demwe hydropower project over the Lohit river.

""The NBWL did not take into account the threat posed by the project to the sacred Parashuram Kund, located close the dam site,"" said Biman Gogoi, an environment activist who moved the NGT in 2017 against the project, following which the forest clearance was suspended.

Parashuram Kund, which about 2 lakh Hindu pilgrims visit annually during Makar Sankranti, is barely 800m from the proposed project site. In addition to the religious significance, the area is very close to the Kamlang Sanctuary in Arunachal Pradesh while the Dibru-Saikhowa National Park and Biosphere Reserve in Assam is located in the downstream area."

The Kerala High Court has ordered the reinstatement of a professor at the Central University of Kerala in Kasaragod who was suspended for criticising on Facebook the institution's action against a Dalit scholar, Live Law reported.

The university has been in turmoil in recent months with students and teachers protesting against a series of ""disciplinary actions"" against leftist and Dalit activists that was seen as attempts to crush dissent.

The court, in a judgement on December 5, criticised the university for suspending Associate Professor Prasad Pannian, who had questioned the institution's move to file a police complaint against PhD scholar Ganthoti Nagaraju for breaking the glass pane of a fire alarm. Nagaraju was arrested on the basis of the complaint. Pannian, who was removed as the head of the department of English and Comparative Literature on September 7, had said the administration should not have involved the police in the matter.

""One cannot be prevented from expressing his views merely because he is an employee,"" Justice Muhamed Mustaque said in his judgement. ""In a democratic society, every institution is governed by democratic norms. Healthy criticism is a better way to govern a public institution.""

The university argued in court that it was the vice chancellor's prerogative to appoint heads of departments. However, Mustaque said the decision needed to be examined as it would be seen as a stain on Pannian's career and reputation.

The CUK submitted HoD appointment was a prerogative posting made by the Vice Chancellor and the petitioner could not, as a matter of right, claim he should be permitted to continue as HoD.

The court noted posting on Facebook or other social media platforms had became a matter of concern for public authorities. ""It is a matter of formulation of an opinion of others.

The suspension order had stated he criticised CUK's decisions and published his comments on social media over the legal action the varsity took against Ganthoti Nagaraju, a PhD student of the varsity.

The petitioner submitted he had sympathised with the student who was arrested. He was of the view the matter should have been settled on the campus itself and should not have resulted in the criminalization of such student, he submitted.
