"1","","About 14 private-aided Marathi language schools had requested the municipal corporation to give the premises on rent, as their own buildings were in a dilapidated state.

Citing a Bombay High Court order, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) refused to provide buildings of shutdown municipal schools to private-aided schools for holding classes.

About 14 private-aided Marathi language schools had requested the municipal corporation to give the premises on rent, as their own buildings were in a dilapidated state.

In the last five years, more than 100 BMC schools have been shut down owing to dwindling student numbers.

""We got applications from 14 such aided schools, seeking municipal schools' premises on rent. Their own buildings are in ruins. However, there is a Bombay High Court order barring to rent out any municipal school building. Hence, we have refused their plea,"" said a senior official in the Education Department.

He added, ""Earlier, BMC had given some of the schools' rooms to non-government organisations and political organisations for educational purposes. But they started using them as offices and for non- educational activities. Due to these irregularities, somebody filed a petition in court. The court ordered the civic body to remove all such offices and keep the schools only for educational purposes.""

""The request from aided schools is genuine. Students in these schools are risking their lives. I will bring this proposal in group leaders meeting and come up with a solution,"" said Education Committee Chairman Mangesh Satamkar.

"3","","Narayanasamy accuses Bedi of returning the file for grant-in-aid suggesting scrapping of the scheme

Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy has charged Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi with putting the government in an ""embarrassing and critical position"" by declining to approve release of funds for aided schools.

Mr. Narayanasamy told presspersons here on Thursday that the government had sent a file to Ms. Bedi seeking her approval for releasing funds to 35 aided schools in the Union Territory. But Ms. Bedi returned the file recommending the government to scrap the release of funds to the schools in a phased manner.

This was highly unacceptable, he said.

Stating that detailed guidelines had been framed by the government for release of grants-in-aid and the present rate of grants was fixed in 1957 in the Union Territory, Mr. Narayanasamy said the Lt. Governor did not have any right to interfere in the policy decision of the government.

A sum of ₹44 crore had been earmarked and approved in the budget tabled in the Assembly for aided schools. This included ₹2.92 crore as subsidy towards salaries to teachers and ₹58 lakh as pension for retired staff.

The Chief Minister said the aided private minority schools were providing quality education and catered to the needs of children from economically disadvantaged and middle class families.

The halting of grants-in-aid in a phased manner would affect over 26,000 children studying in these schools, he said.

On one hand, Ms. Bedi had been visiting aided schools and making assurances that salaries to teachers would be released immediately and on the other she has made recommendations to scrap the grants-in aid.

Alleging that the Lt. Governor had been misusing her official position and intervening without authority in the routine administration of an elected government, the Chief Minister said that he had drawn the attention of Ms. Bedi on several occasions to her overstepping the statutory limits. But Ms. Bedi had been going in her own way.

Mr. Narayanasamy said a committee constituted to go into the issues prevailing in the Anglo French Textiles (AFT) mills, Swadeshi and Bharathi mills had submitted its report with recommendations to the government. The Cabinet will soon take a decision on this report.

The government had sought the permission of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs to sell land belonging to the mill at Pattanur to carry out measures for smooth functioning of the mill.

Niti Aayog has planned an Investors' Meet in Puducherry in December. The government has a land bank at Sedurapet in Puducherry and Karaikal and will work to woo investors to the Union Territory, he said.

"12","","Educational institutes The educational institutes were claiming benefits under the exemption -- For representation

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has revoked its decision of property tax exemption for several educational institutions. The decision comes following the failure of these institutions to meet certain criteria set up by the civic administration last year. The institutions, that fell under charitable organisations, were claiming benefits under property tax waiver scheme.

In the last two weeks, the BMC's assessment and collection administration has issued notice to several well-known aided educational institutions ordering them to pay their property tax. The issued cropped-up during the standing committee meeting wherein the civic body's decision was criticised.

In January 2017, the BMC had issued a circular demanding for aided education institutions to submit documents to support criteria -- from concession in fee for economically backward students to holding special programmes for needy students. However, around 80 per cent aided schools failed to submit required documents following which the civic body decided to revoke the tax exemption.

Asif Zakaria, Congress corporator from Bandra and standing committee member said the BMC's action is against the law. ""These institutions are registered with Charity Commissioner as charitable organisations and they are entitled to get exemption from property tax under section 143 (1) (a) of the Mumbai Municipal Act 1966. The circular raises various questions on the ambit of the corporation and the charity commissioner.""

Zakaria was backed by Rais Shaikh, SP leader, who said it is unacceptable to cancel the exemption. Father Frazer Masceranhas, manager of St Stanislaus High School, said, ""There is already an economic burden on the school that we are struggling with.

A principal of an aided school told TOI on condition of anonymity that the idea of outsourcing was not a bad one considering the hassles schools have to deal with.

The current set up for aided schools is such that schools get rice directly from the government. The rice sacks are delivered every month straight to the campus from Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns, with no monetary exchange happening between schools and FCI. The quantity of rice sacks to be delivered is conveyed by the school to the education department, which then informs FCI about it. This is the only part of the purchasing process that is common for both urban and rural schools.

Vegetables, pulses and other cooking materials have to be purchased by urban schools which then get reimbursed within two or three months. In rural areas, schools have to simply pick up the ingredients from designated shops and the education department takes care of the payment.

A single-judge bench of Justice Suresh Gupte said, ""Merely because the BMC performs certain duties and exercises certain powers under a regulatory framework of law vis-a-vis private primary aided schools and provides grant in aid to such schools, it cannot be said that it has ultimate control over the affairs of these schools.""

""The civic body does not qualify as an employer vis-a-vis any employee of such school including both teaching and non-teaching staff. No employee of such schools may have a claim against the BMC, under the Payment of Gratuity Act,"" Justice Gupte ruled. In other words, to have a successful claim against MCGM, the claimant teacher on the staff of a private primary aided school must show that the school, in which he or she was working, was under the ultimate control of MCGM over its affairs, the judge observed.

The bench further said that such an employee may have a claim only against the school, i.e. his or her employer and not the corporation. The significant ruling comes in response to an appeal filed by the BMC challenging the ex-parte orders of an Industrial Court asking the civic body to pay Rs 10 lakh to Vrunda Kulkarni, a retired teacher of a private primary aided school.

While quashing the orders of the Industrial court, Justice Gupte said, ""Though these orders are set aside in the present order, it will have to be clarified that Kulkarni will be entitled to make a claim for payment of gratuity against the school, who was in real term her employer.""","Employees of private-aided schools cannot seek gratuity from BMC, says Bombay High Court | Free Press Journal","925998656","2018-08-16","http://www.freepressjournal.in/mumbai/employees-of-private-aided-schools-cannot-seek-gratuity-from-bmc-says-bombay-high-court/1336370","Free Press Journal",FALSE

"23","","MUMBAI: After almost 40 years, the education department is likely to review the fee structure of aided schools and junior colleges in the state. Following complaints from a Pune-based parents' organization, the education commissioner has written to the department recommending the structure be updated.

System Correction Movement (SYSCOM) had complained to the education department that aided schools and junior colleges were overcharging students on the pretext that their fee structure was outdated and they were unable to make ends meet. ""Many institutes, especially junior colleges, charge students very high fees in spite of being aided. Students have to pay between Rs 2,000 and Rs 10,000,"" said Vaishali Bafna, director, SYSCOM.

According to responses sought under the Right to Information Act by SYSCOM, the fee structure was last determined in 1978. While fees per annum for classes V to X in the Mumbai region are between Rs 75 and Rs 140, for junior college, they are in the range of Rs 150 and Rs 375.

Education commissioner Vishal Solanki told TOI, ""We understand that the fees haven't been revised in a long time. We felt the complaints from parents were genuine and hence, recommended to state officials to review the fee structure and take into account inflation as well."" He has recently written a letter in this reagrd to the joint secretary of the education department.

SYSCOM has proposed that the fees could be set at Rs 600 per annum for students in the arts and commerce stream and Rs 900 for science students. ""There needs to be uniformity in the fees. Once the government revises the fees, junior colleges will not be able to overcharge,"" said Bafna.

School and junior college authorities in the city are on the same page as well. ""Fees certainly need to be reviewed every five years at least,"" said the viceprincipal of a junior college.

"24","","The move by the Department of Public Instruction (DPI) to reserve seats under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act (RTE) quota in aided schools has not quite had the desired response.

This year, the percentage of vacant seats under the RTE quota in both aided and unaided schools has increased compared to the previous year.

Seats up

Officials attribute this to an increase in the number of seats, and the fact that very few parents choose to admit their children under RTE quota in aided schools as the medium of instruction in primary classes is in Kannada.

This year, 21.32% of the total 1.52 lakh seats are vacant, a marked increase from the 2017-18 academic year where only 15.2% of the total 1.28 lakh seats were vacant.

The number of vacant seats has increased from 19,647 last year to 32,440 this year. Statistics provided by the department show that 73% of the total 14,281 seats under the RTE quota in aided schools were vacant, while for unaided schools 15% of the 1.37 lakh seats were not filled.

Earlier only unaided schools had to reserve at least 25% of their seats to students belonging to weaker and disadvantaged sections in the neighbourhood. According Section 12 (1) (b) of the RTE Act, aided schools have to provide free and compulsory elementary education to the children admitted based on the annual recurring aid or grants, subject to a minimum of 25%.

""All parents want their children to study in English medium. So even if they do not have to pay for education in an aided school, they prefer to pay by taking a loan and admit their child in an unaided school that imparts English-medium education,"" an official said.

Sources in the department also pointed out that although 1.43 lakh seats were allotted in three rounds under the RTE quota, there were no takers for 24,599 seats that were allotted.

Parents more aware

Nagasimha G. Rao, convener of the RTE task force, said the awareness among parents had increased prompting them to avoid admitting their children in schools that do not have adequate infrastructure or good teachers.

""As a result, although they have been allotted seats, they do not admit their children in these schools,"" he said.","Poor response to RTE quota in aided schools","915826870","2018-07-30","https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/poor-response-to-rte-quota-in-aided-schools/article24556372.ece","The Hindu",FALSE
"25","","CHENNAI: The state government has issued orders allowing government-aided schools to begin English medium sections.

Tamil Nadu in 1990-91 allowed government aided schools, administered by private management, to open English medium sections only for high and higher secondary students studying under the self-financing stream. Their counterparts studying in aided sections were not provided with this option.

In 2008-09, the method of collecting special fees from English medium students was abolished and schools were allowed to collect only a tuition fee of Rs.250-500 per year.

Against this backdrop, the state government in 2012-13 announced that English medium sections would be started in selected government schools located at rural areas. Accordingly, 22,400 students from 320 schools were enrolled in these sections in the particular year.

From then on, more and more students opted for English medium and at present more than 6.6 lakh government school students in Tamil Nadu study in English medium classes.

Against this backdrop, the state school education department has decided to extend this benefit to aided schools as well in order to reduce the migration to private matriculation schools.

The government, in its order dated July 20, has framed admission guidelines thereby restricting aided schools from creating new English medium sections. Instead they are allowed to divide the existing Tamil medium sections into two.

After division, the ratio between number of English and Tamil medium students in a school should be 50:50 and no additional fees should be collected from English medium students.

Experts say that this order would have a positive impact on aided schools which are managed by the government itself.

On the other hand, most aided schools, administered by private managements, already have English medium classes functional in their own institutions. These are administered either by using money from their own pockets or funds allocated towards Tamil medium sections, said Annamalai, a retired aided school teacher.

The government in its recent order has categorically said that funds will not be allocated for existing English medium sections under the self-financing stream and it will bear the cost incurred towards sections separated from Tamil medium.

Pradeep Yadav, state school education secretary, has directed all the District Elementary Education Officers (DEEOs) to inspect aided schools and verify whether they have adequate number of teachers to handle English medium sections and other necessary facilities before according permission to admit students.","Tamil Nadu govt allows aided schools to begin English medium sections - Times of India","912959721","2018-07-26","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/govt-allows-aided-schools-to-begin-english-medium-sections/articleshow/65140621.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

As many as 3,753 teaching staff have been found excess, which is 206 less than teachers who were rendered excess by the end of staff fixation last year. Teachers who were found excess last year have also been considered for staff fixation this year and hence the latest numbers represent the total number of excess staff.

""The number of excess staff, teaching and non-teaching together, was 4,059 last year. And the number of teaching staff who lose their post would come down further as the government has revised the teacher-student ratio in Class IX and X to 1:40 from 1:45. This process would be complete by July 18,"" director of public instructions K V Mohankumar said. He said the number might be below 3,500.

Meanwhile, education department has completed the redeployment of all the excess teachers against various vacancies, on a temporary basis. Of the close to 4,000 teachers found excess, only 102 were given postings outside their native district.

The number of excess teachers did not match with the impressive increase in the number of students at public schools. The reason, according to officials, is that the spike in student enrolment was mostly limited to schools with impressive track records. ""If the number of students increases in a well-established school, the number of teaching posts wouldn't increase correspondingly. Also, of the 1.8 lakh of increased students' strength, most admissions happened in primary classes. While the schools have 5,926 less students in Class X, there was a marginal increase of 189 students in Class VIII,"" sources said.

"29","","MANGALURU: In a few weeks from now, children of government and aided schools in Dakshina Kannada district will eat vegetables and fruits which they have raised with their own hands.

With sufficient vacant land available in more than 95 per cent of the 1,423 Akshara Dasoha schools in the district, Dakshina Kannada Zilla Panchayat has planned to put the hitherto unused patches of land into better use by creating 'Akshara Kaithota' (kitchen gardens) in all schools that in turn will not only make mid-day meals more nutritious but will also help students connect with nature through education on farming.

At present, Akshara Kaithotas exist in 407 schools of the district, most of which was raised last year. This year, they have planted them in 1,000 schools, which means almost all Akshara Dasoha schools have been covered. The initiative has got a shot in the arm as it will be implemented under MGNREGA scheme by converging some programmes of the horticulture department.

ZP CEO M R Ravi said under MGNREGA, pits will be dug up and saplings of fruits and vegetables will be planted. Then the students and teachers will take care of them. A model is being worked out on the saplings to be planted. ""There is provision for papaya, mango, lemon and other plants under MNREGA. Apart from this, vegetables like drumstick, ladies finger, bottle guard, ridge gourd and so on will be planted,"" said the CEO.

Out of 1,000 schools where Akshara Kaithota has been planned this year, there is a vacant land of minimum one acre each in 730 schools. Some of the schools that are already growing vegetables and fruits are not only self-sufficient but are also generating income out of it. Schools in Madhya, Keddalike in Bantwal taluk and Devarakanna and Thodikanna in Sullia taluk among others are doing well.

"30","","BENGALURU: The teachers working with aided high schools in the state are relieved as state department of primary and secondary education has withdrawn the decision to hold their salaries if the performance of SSLC students was lower than their district average in last five years.Recently, department issued a circular asking Deputy Director of Public Instructions (DDPI) to submit a report on such schools along with names of teachers to withhold their salaries. This decision by the department faced objection from many quarters.

Finally, the department issued a revised circular saying that instead of holding teachers' salaries, a disciplinary measure will be taken as per Karnataka Cadre and Service Recruitment Rules.

The issue was raised in the Legislative Council on Friday where it has decided to withdraw a government order that imposed several conditions on aided schools, on the grounds that the order was issued hastily without consultation with educational experts.

The decision was made following a calling for attention motion by MLCs Puttanna and S V Sankanura, where they noted that for aided schools to receive funds there was a condition that their performance in SSLC should be better than the district average over the past five years. According to Sankanura, this would result in an unfair evaluation of schools. A school getting 79 per cent results in Dakshina Kannada district, which has an average of more than 80 per cent, may be denied aid but a school in Yadgir district, with an average of 50 per cent, has to score only 51 per cent to receive aid from the State.

Ivan D'Souza of Congress and Srikantegowda of JD(S) also condemned the order. While Ivan D'Souza said that the order was 'unscientific', Srikantegowda questioned how the government was expecting results from unaided schools without giving them adequate facilities. ""The order has affected the appointment of teachers,"" he said. Responding to motion, Legislative Council speaker Basavaraj Horatti suggested that Primary and Secondary Education Minister N Mahesh consult educational experts regarding the order, and said that the order should be withdrawn.

Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy announced in his budget speech that the schools will be ""merged"" with 8,530 nearby schools. Merger is the technical word used in the primary and secondary education department to mean closure.

Though the Chief Minister said the measure is being taken considering inadequate admissions, experts in the education field call it a ""disastrous decision"".

Dr V P Niranjanaradhya, an expert at school education, said the Chief Minister will be known in the history for ""destroying public education"" by shutting down schools.

Another expert said, ""Instead of announcing this move, the Chief Minister should have announced a ban on permitting new private schools or disallowing private schools within a 5-6 km radius of government schools"".

MLC Arun Shahapura was equally caustic in his reaction, saying the fund earmarked for repairing state-run schools is too meagre. ""It looks like a budget to close down government schools. The CM thinks he can repair buildings of state government schools and PU colleges with '150 crore. I request him to visit over 78,000 government schools which are in pathetic conditions and later calculate the amount needed to repair them"".

Educationists working to strengthen government schools and improve the quality of education, have decided to launch a protest against the chief minister's announcement.

However, the department of primary and secondary education plans to provide transport facility to affected students after ""merger"" schools to help them reach the nearest functioning schools. ""There will be common points to pick up kids and drop them to schools and back,"" said a senior official. But there is now word about what will happen to the infrastructure of the schools which are going to be closed down.

The allocation to the education sector has gone down by a percentage point compared to the last budget presented by CM Siddaramaiah. Kumaraswamy has allocated 11 of the total budget outlay to the sector as against 12 per cent by Siddaramaiah. As most of the allocation goes to salaries of teachers, the department needs more funds for various schemes and projects.

"35","","CHENNAI: NOT even one student from Scheduled Tribe (ST) communities who studied at government or government-aided schools in the State is likely to get an MBBS seat this year. Among Scheduled Caste (SC) communities, just nine students from government and government-aided schools seem to have a chance to get an MBBS seat, either in a government college or in government-quota seats in private colleges.

The analysis has been made with data Express obtained from sources in the School Education Department and by considering 2017 cut-off marks. In 2017, five students from government schools could secure MBBS seats. Government schools cater mainly to students in rural, financially and socially backward families. The main reason attributed is lack of access to resources to prepare for the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET), which is largely based on Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) syllabus. Specialised coaching, crucial to prepare for any competitive exam, is also beyond the geographical and economic reach of most students in rural areas, say educationists.

Data released by the State shows 1,344 students from government and government-aided schools qualified by scoring more than the minimum eligible marks. But only 10 scored over 300 and only 42 scored over 200, reliable School Education department sources said. Among the 42 who scored above 200, nine belong to SC communities. In 2017 medical admissions, the cut-off mark in SC category was 210. So, these nine students may stand a chance to get a seat in either government colleges or government quota seats in private colleges. However, given that most of them hail from poor families, affordability of private college fees may be a barried. In the ST category also, last year's cut-off was 210 marks.

Not a single student from ST communities who studied in a government or government-aided school scored over 200.Overall caste-wise data on NEET-qualified students in TN could not be accessed as officials said they did not prepare such data. But, CBSE data paints a similar picture nation-wide.

Classes hold the key as coaching centres make NEET profit

Mehrunisa Ahmed (name changed) is not very different from Anitha or Pradeepa - the two Dalit students from villages of Tamil Nadu who committed suicide after not getting a medical seat since the introduction of National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET).

All three are medical aspirants who are considered meritorious by their schools, but hail from poor families from marginalised communities. Mehrunisa was selected to be the cream of students from government schools and sent for a free month-long residential coaching before she attempted NEET. This was her only formal training for the exam.

Mehrunisa, finds herself in the cross-roads, just like how Pradeepa was last year. She scored 1,128 in her Class 12 State Board exam, and 175 in NEET, which puts her eligible for an MBBS seat. But with this marks she can get a management quota seat in a private college. ""But my parents will never be able to pay the fees,"" she rues. She has decided to take a gap of one year and attempt NEET again in 2019.

K Keerthana, the Tamil Nadu topper in NEET 2018, scored an All India Rank of 12, the highest for a student from Tamil Nadu till now. However, she comes from a socio-economic background that has given her a huge advantage when compared with her contemporaries like Mehrunisa in government schools.

Keerthana's parents could easily afford her a leading CBSE school in the heart of Chennai and special coaching classes since she was in Class IX. ""My coaching centre did all the planning, I just followed the schedule,"" she told Express. In JIPMER entrance too, she secured 5th rank. Even before NEET was introduced, students who went to private schools had an advantage in securing MBBS seats. But the numbers suggests that NEET is making an MBBS seat almost at unreachable levels for students from rural areas.

For example, in 2016 (the last year when admissions were made using Class XII board exam marks), 30 students from government schools could get a seat in government medical colleges. This is besides those who may get seats in government quota in private colleges. But in 2017, when the admissions were made based on NEET score, just two students from government schools could get a seat in government medical colleges.But this did not mean that academic excellence was overlooked when the admissions were made based on Class XII board exam marks. To get into any top government medical college, students had to meet the rough cut-off of at least 198 out of 200. Even students from marginalised communities will have to score over 98 per cent marks in Maths and Science subjects to secure a government seat.

""I scored 198 in biology, 199 in physics and centum in chemistry. I couldn't get into any government college in Chennai, but I found a seat in Tiruchy Government Medical College,"" said Naveen Kumaresan, a third-year medical student who was from the last batch of students who used board exam scores to get into medical courses.

Naveen's teachers saw a promising student in him when he scored 470 in Standard X State Board exam. He claimed that his school in Dharmapuri even funded half his higher secondary education, which came much to the relief of his family. His father is a cable operator and his mother does not work.""About 10 students from my school got into various medical colleges across the State. We were ambitious and we knew we had a fair chance at it. We had to compete with students in the syllabus we'd studied all our lives,"" he said. He added that many students in his batch were from districts across the State. ""Now, we have to search for village students among our juniors (who were admitted based on NEET score),"" he says adding that he could visibly see his junior class more dominated by students from affluent families, mainly from Chennai.

Educationalists too opine that introduction of NEET has mandated the need for coaching classes and destroys the social justice built in the Tamil Nadu education system.""A rich student who scored 190 has more chance of getting into a medical college over a poor one who scored 230,"" said educationalist Prince Gajendrababu, adding that NEET is boosting mediocrity in the name of bringing uniformity. Both schools and students will undermine the value of school education and give importance to clearing NEET or other exams alone, he said.

""This would mean that students will no longer find it relevant to question fundamentals in class if it's not going to feature in their competitive exam,"" he said.An exam like this which centres around urban students with access to NCERT text books would cut off access to Dalits in particular said D Ravikumar, from VCK.

""At least two-thirds of Dalit population lives in the rural areas and an exam that deprives rural students will affect Dalit students twice as much,"" he said. Most of these students cannot afford go to coaching classes to prepare for NEET, he claimed. Poor students from marginalised backgrounds will have to prove their merit over and over again, only to not succeed, he said.

While NEET on one side seems to exclude students who don't have access to coaching centres, it has also generated a massive commercial network that profits from it. About 1.4 lakh students from Tamil Nadu qualified in the exam. Even if half of them took coaching that cost them Rs 10,000, the industry is worth Rs 70 crore.

However, the calculation used here is far simplified as leading coaching centres charge even up to a lakh per student per year and students have started taking training from Class IX.""A few popular leading CBSE school in Chennai have increased their fees from Rs 1.1 lakh to nearly Rs two lakh promising parents that their children will be trained for NEET,"" said GR Ravindranath from Doctor's Association for Social Equality.

A Riaz, a NEET aspirant from a government school in North Chennai is adamant about pursuing MBBS. He too, like Mehrunisa was selected for government residential NEET coaching. While he scored 1155 in Class XII, his two-digit score in NEET has destabilised his confidence.""I don't know what I'll do. I came to take a year off to study as my parents can't afford it. I need to finish my education quick to start earning and I don't see myself becoming a doctor through any other way except NEET,"" he said.

When numbers speak volumes

Even before NEET was introduced, students who went to private schools had an advantage in securing MBBS seats. But the numbers suggests that NEET is making an MBBS seat almost at unreachable levels for students from rural areas. For example, in 2016 (the last year when admissions were made using Class XII board exam marks), 30 students from government schools could get a seat in government medical colleges. This is besides those who may get seats in government quota in private colleges. But in 2017, when the admissions were made based on NEET score, just two students from government schools could get a seat in government medical colleges. However, this did not mean that academic excellence was overlooked during admissions. To get into any top government medical college, students had to meet the rough cut-off of at least 198 out of 200","Not a single ST student from government or aided schools likely to get MBBS seat this year","884776284","2018-06-10","http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2018/jun/11/not-a-single-st-student-from-government-or-aided-schools-likely-to-get-mbbs-seat-this-year-1826457.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE
"36","","CHENNAI:NOT even one student from Scheduled Tribe (ST) communities who studied at government or government-aided schools in the State is likely to get an MBBS seat this year. Among Scheduled Caste (SC) communities, just nine students from government and government-aided schools seem to have a chance to get an MBBS seat, either in a government college or in government-quota seats in private colleges.

The analysis has been made with data Express obtained from sources in the School Education Department and by considering 2017 cut-off marks. In 2017, five students from government schools could secure MBBS seats. Government schools cater mainly to students in rural, financially and socially backward families. The main reason attributed is lack of access to resources to prepare for the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET), which is largely based on Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) syllabus. Specialised coaching, crucial to prepare for any competitive exam, is also beyond the geograhical and economic reach of most students in rural areas, say educationists.

Data released by the State shows 1,344 students from government and government-aided schools qualified by scoring more than the minimum eligible marks. But only 10 scored over 300 and only 42 scored over 200, reliable School Education department sources said. Among the 42 who scored above 200, nine belong to SC communities. In 2017 medical admissions, the cut-off mark in SC category was 210. So, these nine students may stand a chance to get a seat in either government colleges or government quota seats in private colleges. However, given that most of them hail from poor families, affordability of private college fees may be a barried.In the ST category also, last year's cut-off was 210 marks.

Not a single student from ST communities who studied in a government or government-aided school scored over 200.Overall caste-wise data on NEET-qualified students in TN could not be accessed as officials said they did not prepare such data. But, CBSE data paints a similar picture nation-wide.

Classes hold the key as coaching centres make NEET profit

Mehrunisa Ahmed (name changed) is not very different from Anitha or Pradeepa - the two Dalit students from villages of Tamil Nadu who committed suicide after not getting a medical seat since the introduction of National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET).

All three are medical aspirants who are considered meritorious by their schools, but hail from poor families from marginalised communities. Mehrunisa was selected to be the cream of students from government schools and sent for a free month-long residential coaching before she attempted NEET. This was her only formal training for the exam.

Mehrunisa, finds herself in the cross-roads, just like how Pradeepa was last year. She scored 1,128 in her Class 12 State Board exam, and 175 in NEET, which puts her eligible for an MBBS seat. But with this marks she can get a management quota seat in a private college. ""But my parents will never be able to pay the fees,"" she rues. She has decided to take a gap of one year and attempt NEET again in 2019.

K Keerthana, the Tamil Nadu topper in NEET 2018, scored an All India Rank of 12, the highest for a student from Tamil Nadu till now. However, she comes from a socio-economic background that has given her a huge advantage when compared with her contemporaries like Mehrunisa in government schools.

Keerthana's parents could easily afford her a leading CBSE school in the heart of Chennai and special coaching classes since she was in Class IX. ""My coaching centre did all the planning, I just followed the schedule,"" she told Express. In JIPMER entrance too, she secured 5th rank.Even before NEET was introduced, students who went to private schools had an advantage in securing MBBS seats.

"37","","Thiruvananthapuram: The general education protection campaign by the state government seems to have hit the bullseye. Even as the enrolment figures at three major districts are still awaited, the number of students who newly joined the government and aided schools in the rest of the state has touched 1. 6 lakh.

The number of new admissions at government and aided schools are decided by considering the classroom attendance on the sixth working day after the school reopening. The sixth working day of the year was on Friday. Schools in Malappuram, Kozhikode and Wayanad districts and Thalassery education district in Kannur are yet to be reopened following Nipah virus threat. Once schools in these districts also open on June 12, the number of students who have freshly joined the government and aided schools would further increase. Last year, the total number of students turned up for fresh admission in government/aided schools was 1.46 lakh.

Meanwhile, the campaign to set up 45,000 smart classrooms is also nearing completion. Kerala infrastructure and technology for education (KITE) vice-chairman and executive director K Anvar Sadath said the smart classroom project has almost completed. As many as 39,000 smart classrooms have already been set up and the work of the rest would also be completed in two months, he said.

Each smart classroom is equipped with laptop, multimedia projector, white board and sound system. Each hi-tech IT lab in the schools will feature multifunction printers LCD TV, webcam and an HD camera. Specific security features are installed in schools. The IT labs and classrooms would be connected via a network. High speed fibre-based broadband internet would be made available in all classrooms.

Malappuram district tops in terms of the number of hi-tech classrooms. The district has got 3,782 classrooms. Kozhikode and Thrissur are in the second and third positions with 3,446 and 3,085 hi-tech classrooms, respectively.

""Around 10% of schools are facing infrastructure issues, with regard to the setting up of hi-tech classrooms. We are about to address such issues separately,"" Sadath said.

"38","","CHENNAI: Less than 3 per cent of all students from Tamil Nadu, who qualified in the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) 2018, come from government or government-aided schools, according to the data released by School Education Minister KA Sengottaiyan on Tuesday.

Of the 45,336 students from Tamil Nadu who qualified in the exam, only 1,337 students are from government or government aided schools.

According to sources in the School Education department, 9,154 students from various government and government-aided schools appeared for the exam. This means that only 14.60 per cent of students from these schools cleared the exam as opposed to 41.72 per cent (45,336 students of 1,05,448 students) from private schools including CBSE schools. Less than 25 students cleared the exam, from almost half the districts. The highest number of students who cleared the exam came from Tirunelveli (195 students) and Kanniyakumari (173) and the least number of students came from Villupuram (9) and Thanjavur (3).

However last year, only five students from government schools in the State secured medical seats. Out of the 83,359 people who took the exam in 2017, 32,368 people qualified (38.83 per cent). About 1.14 lakh students from the State took the exam this year and 39.56 per cent were qualified.

Were the coaching classes run by government not useful at all then? Students disagree. A Riaz, a student, who took up the residential course given by the government, scored 153 in NEET-2018. He claimed that coaching was the only reason why he qualified in the exam. ""We were made to write at least 10 mock tests and they simulated the exam environment so well that we didn't panic during the exam,"" he said.

While he is uncertain if he will get a medical seat, he said that if he had had extra training, he would have been able to score more. For example, K Keerthana, the NEET topper from Tamil Nadu, told Express that it was a sustained coaching from the beginning of class 11 which helped her score well in the test. ""The coaching centre set out a schedule that I promptly followed for two years,"" she said adding that last-minute preparations would barely help score well in competitive exams.

The free weekend coaching by the government became fully functional only by February 2018 and even the residential programme was held only for a month. Riaz opined that if the coaching had started from class 11, he would have been able to score much better. However it is unclear at this point if coaching classes would start earlier this year.

"39","","Mumbai: More than Over 300 teachers of all state-run government aided schools protested on Wednesday at Azad Maidan over various demands to be fulfilled by the state government. Teachers claimed they will continue to protest unless their demands are catered to before the start of this academic year as they have been suffering due to increasing corruption done by state education officers.

Teachers under Mumbai Teacher's Democratic Front (TDF), Shikshak Sangh and other Teachers' Union of Maharashtra raised several demands and issues faced since last 10 years. Teachers claimed the appointment and assignment of surplus teachers is one of the major issue which is leading to corruption.

Teachers revealed around Rs 200 crore is being caught up due to surplus teachers. Rajesh Pandya, a teacher said, ""There are surplus teachers who have not been assigned any school but are still getting their monthly salary. The state appointed new teachers in various schools though there were already surplus teachers there. Now both the newly appointed teachers and surplus teachers are getting their salaries while there are schools where there is an urgent need of teachers but the government is least bothered to assign these surplus teachers in those schools.""

Appointment of teachers is another issue faced since last several years. A teacher said, ""The state has not appointed teachers since 2005 on permanent basis. Due to this, we have to travel to far off schools as there has not been a streamlined adequate process of appointment."" In addition, teachers have also demanded for the old pension scheme to be applicable for all and 100 per cent aid to be given to all teachers who are serving in government aided schools.

This negligence by the state government has forced teachers to shift to private unaided schools, international schools or move to other states. Akansha Japtap, a teacher said, ""We are compelled to try other opportunities like working for private schools or other international schools due to this reluctant attitude of the state. In private schools we can at least get our due salaries, benefits and financial help on time. Some of us have even shifted abroad or to other states as the facilities provided for teachers are better and lucrative.""

Also, they have demanded an inquiry of all education officers, management, schools and educational institutes involved in corrupt activities. Pandya added, ""A strict inquiry should be done of all officers and personnel involved in halting the processes of appointment of teachers, issuing salaries and pension plans. We cannot be victims of corruption any more."" Teachers claimed they want their demands to be fulfilled before this academic year begins in June as corruption needs to be wiped out.","Mumbai: 300 teachers of state-run govt-aided schools protest over unfulfilled demands by state | Free Press Journal","861237409","2018-05-03","http://www.freepressjournal.in/mumbai/mumbai-300-teachers-of-state-run-govt-aided-schools-protest-over-unfulfilled-demands-by-state/1269569","Free Press Journal",FALSE

The aim is to ensure that all students in rural areas join only government or aided schools in the neighbourhood.

The help of elected representatives, socio-cultural activists, and voluntary organisations will be sought for the purpose. Admissions are to be conducted to pre-school, Class 1, Class 5 and Plus Two classes.

The campaign will have three phases. In the first phase, from April 25 to May 5, MLAs and elected representatives of local bodies will visit houses and hand over admission forms to parents. Education activists, Kudumbasree volunteers, local clubs, and representatives of parent-teacher associations too will be roped in. Exhibitions and cultural programmes will be organised, and children will be given crayons and drawing materials.

Local cultural practices should be incorporated in jathas and flash mobs in the second phase from May 5 to May 10, the statement said. The third phase, from May 10 to May 20, will be to welcome new students and parents to schools.

"44","","Snapshot

This is the second article of a multi-part series on state versus private school enrolment across the country.

The union Ministry of Human Resource Development conducted a National Achievement Survey (NAS) across the nation in November 2017. Focussing on four subjects which included Language, Mathematics (for classes 3, 5 and 8), Environmental Sciences (for classes 3 and 5), Science and Social Sciences (for class 8), the survey was carried out in government-aided schools. Text booklets with 45 questions for classes 3 and 5, and 60 questions for class 8 were prepared. The questions developed for these booklets were curated taking into consideration the learning outcomes incorporated in the central rules for Right To Education Act by the Government of India.

Touted as one of the largest surveys to be conducted across the world, it inculcated over 2.2 million students from over 100,000 schools across 700 districts. In all states and Union Territories.

Currently, the states of Assam, Bihar, Odisha, Maharashtra, West Bengal, and Gujarat have the highest percentage of students enrolled in government schools. On the other end of the scale, we have Haryana, Rajasthan, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, and Punjab with lowest percentage of enrolments in government schools.

Assam: With over 85 per cent of its students enrolled in government schools, the state of Assam had the participation of 27 districts with over 4,000 schools and 80,000 students. As per the data derived from the website of NAS, the performance from class 3 to 8 presents a visible decline. For instance, students of class 3 were able to answer 72 per cent of the language questions correctly. However, the number declined to 60 per cent for class 5 and 54 per cent for class 8. However, the state has fared well against the national average, even though the performance of students in class 8 must be looked at with concern. Compared to over 50 per cent students of class 3, merely 16.4 per cent students of class 8 were able to secure over 75 per cent in the language questions.

Assam in Numbers: National Achievement Survey 2017 (Data Sourced from http://mhrd.gov.in/NAS/) Assam in Numbers: National Achievement Survey 2017 (Data Sourced from http://mhrd.gov.in/NAS/)

Bihar: With over 75 per cent of its students enrolled in government schools, Bihar makes for an interesting case study, given the social factors in play. Given the state's obsession with the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) and other public service exams, the performance in mathematics must be deliberated. Students of class 3 were able to answer 63 per cent of the questions. The percentage fell to 52 and 45 for class 5 and 8 respectively. In the language section, a decline was seen from 67 to 57 and eventually, 58 per cent for class 8. While 41.1 per cent students in class 3 secured in excess of 75 per cent in language, the number fell to 23 per cent for class 8. Sadly, merely 8.6 per cent of the students of class 8 were able to secure more than 75 per cent for questions in science with one-third not being able to secure even 33 per cent for the questions asked. Compared to the national average, the story of Bihar is more or less the story of India.

Gujarat: The catalyst in the ascent of Narendra Modi, Gujarat, with over 75 per cent enrolments in government schools fares better than the national average when it comes to learning outcomes. However, it finds itself in the same declining performance trap as Assam and Bihar. The students of class 8, as the data shows, were only able to answer 47 per cent questions pertaining to mathematics, 52 per cent pertaining to science, and 54 per cent pertaining to social science. With a majority of students from classes 3, 5, and 8 being able to secure 50-75 per cent for the questions asked, the state has a low percentage of students securing less than 30 per cent in the performance slab, signifying the healthy state of government schools across the state. However, a lot of critical ends are still required to be fixed.

Maharashtra: The financial mitochondria of India, Maharashtra, had almost 80 per cent students enrolled in government schools during 2014-15. While the students of class 3 and 5 fared better than the national average, a sharp slump was witnessed in the performance of class 8 students. Students of class 8 were able to answer only 40 per cent questions in mathematics and science, and 42 in social science. The situation grows even more deplorable if one looks at the distribution of students achievements. Over 37 per cent of the class 8 students could not secure 33 per cent in maths and science. Merely 7 and 6.5 per cent students of the same class could secure over 75 per cent for questions in maths and science respectively. For a state that has a huge dependency on government schools, the situation of its senior students is alarming indeed.

West Bengal and Odisha, the two other states with government school enrolments exceeding 84 per cent, the situation is no better. Over 42 per cent students of class 8 in West Bengal were not able to secure 33 per cent in maths and science. The situation reverses for the worse from class 3 to 8, as the data from NAS shows, in West Bengal. Merely 5 per cent of the students were able to secure over 75 per cent in the social science exam. The numbers for Odisha are also on the same lines.

Clearly, Punjab and Haryana, with their increased urbanisation and enhanced standards of living have lesser number of students in government schools. However, the assessment results from Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh offer some more insights.

Punjab: The state of Punjab falters against the national average. While this could be attributed to the lack of infrastructure in the rural areas and other social factors in play, it does warrant urgent attention. Class 8 students were only able to answer 31 per cent of the questions pertaining to mathematics, 37 for science, and 35 for social science. The situation is a little better for students for class 3 and 5, yet far below what the national average is. With over 55 per cent of the students still enrolled in government schools, the state must rethinking its education strategy or risk falling behind. A shocking 56.7 per cent of class 8 students were not able to secure one-third of the marks in maths. Merely 2 per cent of class 8 students examined could secure more than 75 per cent in the same subject.

Haryana: A state that should have its own Olympics team, Haryana has seen government school enrolments drop in recent years with the current percentage at 48.8. Quite like Punjab, the state falters against the national average with a visible performance decline from class 3 to class 8. With merely 4.2 per cent of class 8 students securing over 75 per cent in mathematics, 6.4 per cent in social science, and 7.1 per cent in science, the state, like its neighbour, warrants urgent rethinking of education. Located in the vicinity of the national capital, the state must look to benefit from the resources available. Interestingly, Chandigarh, the capital of both Punjab and Haryana, fared well against the national average. The variation within this region alone depicts the education quality gap that must be bridged between the rural and urban areas.

Rajasthan: With government school enrolments less than 50 per cent, the state, surprisingly, fares far better than the national outcome. The performance decline from class 3 to 8 is present, but not as significant as it is in other states. For all tests and classes, the students were able to answer more than 55 per cent of the questions asked in any subject. For students of class and securing over 75 per cent in the subjects, the numbers look quite strong. Clearly, the state presents an interesting case study for its contemporaries to replicate if they intend to fix their houses.

Uttar Pradesh: The state with the highest population, it warrants a thriving educational setup under government control for it ensures accessibility, affordability, and to some extent, accountability. However, the numbers from the state do not fare well against the national average, as the data shows. The performance decline from class 3 to 8 is again visible. For class 8, the percentage of students securing over 75 per cent in maths, science, and social science, is in a single digit. On the other side, close to 40 per cent of the students from the same class could not secure 33 per cent in maths, science, and social science.

Uttar Pradesh in Numbers: National Achievement Survey 2017 Uttar Pradesh in numbers: National Achievement Survey 2017

The survey presents some observations. One of them is that the RTE Act is a failure of mammoth proportions. Given that the government schools follow the syllabus prescribed by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and have NCERT books, one cannot attribute the performance decline from class 3 to 8 to tougher syllabus. Also, it is not possible for states to have better teachers in class 3 or 5 alone.

Given that the RTE mandates not failing a student till class 8, the performance decline has to be attributed to this practice of not holding students back. Clearly, the pressure keeps on piling up, and adds to the weakening numbers in senior classes. This also adds to the dropout numbers, as students, unable to cope up after class 8, give up on their education. The national average further proves this point, as there is a visible performance decline from class 3 to 8. In an essential subject like mathematics alone, the percentage of questions answered decreases from 64 per cent in class 3 to 42 per cent in class 8.

The affordability of private schools continues to remain a distant dream for many, even in urban areas, and therefore, for years to come, the health of our government schools will reflect the learning potential of our nation. A student can definitely do more by repeating a class in his early years than by dropping out of school at the age of 14. And getting rid of the RTE can prove to be the essential giant leap in order to fix this problem.","National Achievement Survey: The Sorry State Of Learning Outcomes In Government Aided Schools","856626764","2018-04-25","https://swarajyamag.com/ideas/national-achievement-survey-the-sorry-state-of-learning-outcomes-in-government-aided-schools","swarajyamag.com",FALSE

"46","","KOCHI: Santhi is a pre-primary teacher at an aided school. However, her salary is nowhere near the one paid to those teaching at government schools. While a teacher with a government pre-primary draws a salary of '19,000, the amount that a teacher at an aided school gets varies from '1,000 to '4,500. Santhi finds this disparity a gross injustice. Even the ayahs at these schools are a deprived lot.

According to All Kerala Pre-primary Teachers and Helpers Organisation secretary Vijaya Shoma, the government is yet to recognise the pre-primary sections in aided schools as part of the institutions. ""Because of this, no pay scale exists for pre-primary teachers in aided schools. This is a huge injustice,"" she said.

Shoma said when the division fall began to affect schools, both government and aided, the authorities decided to begin pre-primary sections. ""The government even gave funds to carry out mid-day meal schemes at these schools,"" she said.

Hence, it becomes very evident that the government is well aware of the existence of these pre-primary sections, she said.

""The pre-primary sections that came into being before 2012 have been recognised by the government and they are provided with funds for the mid-day meal scheme. But the unlucky ones are those that were set up after 2012. Teachers at these schools have to share funds allotted for the primary section in order to feed students,"" she said.

The teachers are ruing their plight.

""Many of us don't even get the honorarium that we used to receive earlier. The paltry amount that ranges from Rs 1,000 to Rs 4,000 nowhere covers our expenses. The plight of the ayahs or helpers is even worse. In many schools, there are no ayahs at all. The teachers have to do that job too,"" she said.

According to Shoma, these pre-primary teachers who have qualifications at par with those who have been appointed through PSC are worthy of and eligible to draw the salary stipulated by the government.

""But alas, nobody hears our plea. We had time and again petitioned the government. We even went before the commission that was formed to study the problems faced by the pre-primary section. But all have come to nought,"" she said.

According to the teachers, when they filed an RTI query seeking the report filed by the commission, they were told it is not ready. ""The entire thing is confusing. The commission was to file the report in June last year. But they filed it only in February this year. When we tried to gain access to the report via RTI, we were told it was yet to be filed. So, we approached the Education Minister, who said the report has been filed but can't be published since the government has to study it in detail,"" she said.

Training is also becoming a problem for them. ""Recently, the SCERT had issued a circular that a textbook published by them has be taught at pre-primary classes in government schools.

They had even organised a training camp for the teachers at these schools. But now they have issued another circular saying the book has to be used by pre-primary sections in aided schools too.

We don't know anything about the book nor have been given any training. The entire thing is a big jolt for us. Hence, we want the government to organise a training camp for us too. We don't want to be kept in the dark,"" she said.

Shoma and her colleagues are at a loss as to whom they should turn to, and are planning to go on a strike after May 20. Meanwhile, repeated attempts to contact the authorities concerned didn't bear fruit.","Pre-primary teachers in aided schools on the warpath","845974798","2018-04-07","http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2018/apr/08/pre-primary-teachers-in-aided-schools-on-the-warpath-1798537.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE
"47","","The State government has asked single management aided schools in the State to cough up 50% of their modernisation cost under the Challenge Fund established for this purpose.

The saving grace for these management schools is that they can source the government share from the Asset Management Fund of the local legislator if the budget allocation is not available under the Challenge Fund.

The Challenge Fund was originally mooted by the Finance Minister in his 2017 budget speech promising to earmark ₹50 crore as its corpus. According to the guidelines, the Challenge Fund will be available for the construction or repair of school buildings, renovating or establishing library or laboratory, smart classrooms, renovation of school stadiums, toilet construction, noon meal kitchen and dining hall and drinking water facilities as per an approved master plan.

Single-management schools from lower primary to higher secondary schools are eligible for funding subject to a limit of ₹1 core, including the government and management share, depending on the school category. The government has also fixed the minimum number of students needed for each of these categories in the rural and urban areas to be eligible for assistance.

The Challenge Fund will be available for schools in the coastal and tribal belts, welfare schools, but single management schools will get the first priority. Schools which had been selected for funding under the Public Education Rejuvenation Campaign (PERC), another scheme aimed at upgrading 1,000 schools as Centres of Excellence, will not be eligible for the Challenge Fund. Around 100 schools have already been selected under the PERC.

The State is in the midst of a controversy over closure of uneconomic schools, including aided. There is no data available on the number of aided schools under single management, but it is common knowledge that a large number of single management institutions are reeling under drop in enrolment of students owing to poor facilities and competition from indiscriminate sanctioning of schools in the unaided sector. Owners of single management schools say many of them did not have the ability to mobilise their share and had expressed their reservations about the operation of the Challenge Fund.","Aided schools told to bear50% of modernisation cost","842189274","2018-04-01","http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/aided-schools-told-to-bear50-of-modernisation-cost/article23408064.ece","The Hindu",FALSE

"51","","Coimbatore: The district is famed as an education hub, but there appears to be a gap, albeit marginal, in learning that needs to be fixed when it comes to education in government and government-aided schools.

The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) survey-2017 released on Friday revealed that school students in the district were below state average in learning outcomes.

However, there is a reason to rejoice as Coimbatore students have scored way above their counterparts in several other districts.

According to the survey, the average performance of Class III students in Mathematics was 55% against the state average of 61 %. Class V students too lag a little behind the state average. In the case of Class VIII students, the downward fall in learning outcomes was more stark as they fared even bad at 33 %, two percentage points lower than the state average.

This trend of fall in learning outcomes as the students progressed from Class III to VIII was seen across the state in Mathematics. But there was reversal of this trend when it came to language studies as the students showed significant increase in learning outcomes as they grew up the ladder. While Class III students of Coimbatore was below the state average of 61.48 %, they seemed to improve as they reached Class VIII, up by almost five percentage points from the state average of 57.66%.

The National Achievement Survey, as NCERT calls it, was conducted for Class III, V and VIII of government and aided schools in November last for language, maths, environmental studies and social science.

Education department authorities, however, pointed out that Coimbatore, along with Erode and Dharmapuri in the western region, had scored more than other districts in several aspects.

""There is no need to sulk at the fact that Coimbatore has recorded scores lesser than state average. The difference is only minuscule.

The move was aimed at checking corruption in the appointments to schools, he said while replying to a submission moved by M. Swaraj. The proposed online system would be introduced for appointments to aided schools from pre-primary to higher-secondary level.

Rules to be amended

Applications for appointment would be accepted and processed online, he said, adding that the Kerala Education Rules would be suitably amended for the new system. Earlier, raising the issue, Mr. Swaraj said the appointment of teachers and non teaching staff to aided schools was mired in corruption.

Mr. Ravindranath told the House that 141 schools across the State would be equipped with hi-tech classrooms by June this year. The tendering process for the government-funded project was expected to be completed soon, he said, replying to a submission moved by Mons Joseph.

"53","","For the first time since the Right to Education (RTE) Act was enforced, the State government has mandated that government-aided schools, apart from private schools, should reserve seats for students from socio-economic disadvantaged sections of society. This will see nearly 3,000 aided schools and over 18,000 additional seats coming within the ambit of the RTE Act, said officials of the Department of Public Instruction (DPI). There are currently over 1.28 lakh seats available in over 11,900 unaided schools.

Until now, only unaided schools were reserving 25% of their seats for students from weaker sections and disadvantaged groups. These schools receive reimbursement based on the students they admit under the quota.

According to Section 12 (1)(b) of the RTE Act, aided schools would have to provide free and compulsory elementary education to the children admitted based on the annual recurring aid or grants, subject to a minimum of 25%. However, aided schools will not receive any reimbursement for admitting the students.

There is mixed response to this move. Some schools feel waiving fees for students under the quota may not work out for them financially as they charge nominal fees from other students. ""By reserving some seats without reimbursement, we may not be able to meet infrastructural requirements,"" said a management representative.

However, for others there is a sense that at least through RTE quota, currently empty classrooms may get a fresh lease of life. ""We are all Kannada-medium schools and are struggling to survive. We will admit students if they opt for seats through the RTE quota,"" said a school representative.

The DPI has announced the calender of events for RTE events, and parents can file online applications for their wards between February 20 and March 21. The first round of seats will be allotted on April 6.

Private school have been asked to fill the remaining 75% of seats only after the three-rounds of RTE admissions are completed by May 30.

However, private schools are unhappy with the move, and said they will defy the order. D.

A total of 75.6% of class III students from Karnataka fared well in the test.

Class V students, too, beat their counterparts from across the country. As many as 69% of the class V students from Karnataka showed a satisfactory level of performance in the test.

At the national level, the percentage of students who performed well came at 65.7%, 56.5% and 46.8% for classes III, V and VIII, respectively.

The NCERT conducted the test on November 13 to assess the learning outcome of the students in four subjects - Language, Mathematics, Science and Social Science.

About 25 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools across 700 districts in all 29 states and 7 Union Territories took the 120-minute examination.

This move by the state government is part of a framework of new guidelines for admissions to schools. The admission criteria drawn up is nearly identical to the earlier one issued almost a decade ago, except that students living within a five kilometer radius of a school will now get upto 60% weightage in the admission process. Also, unlike the old guidelines, students of school staff and management, children of single parents and of transferrable employees will no longer get preference in the admission process.

For the Panaji-based schools that recently shifted to the Cujira school complex, the radius will be calculated as per the original location of the school.

School managements have been told that they can allot 20% of the total seats in the school as per their discretion, but cannot collect excess fees for these seats. This is as per the earlier guidelines.

DoE has also worked out different distance criteria for students at the primary, middle and secondary school levels for admissions. At the primary school level, students who live within a kilometer radius of the institute will earn 60% marks in the admission process right away. At the middle school level, children living within three kilometers and, at the secondary school level, those living within five kilometers of the school will get 60% marks in the admission process.

A child will earn an additional 10 marks if his or her sibling is already studying in the same school and if parents are ex-students of the school, this will add another 10 marks to the child's score. Both these criteria were existing as per the old admission guidelines. School managements have also been given the discretion to frame their own specific criteria, which will get upto 20% weightage. This provision was also available as per the old guidelines.

The preference for students who have excelled in sports and at extra-curricular activities and who are children of ex-servicemen will also continue.

'The headmaster of the school has to identify the habitation/localities around the school jurisdiction, of their distance, and announce on the school notice board in advance. A provisional list should be announced calling objections from parents/guardiance before finalising the admission list,' the circular by the director of education, GP Bhat, states.

Parents will have to produce a residence certificate, election card, ration card, telephone bill, property tax receipt of their residence and aadhar card for admissions.

the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). A private-aided school Amarnath high school in Govandi has not received any grants since last ten years.

The school's primary section, which has around 500 students, is facing financial crunch resulting in lack of good quality teachers and poor facilities for its students.

Technically, the grants given by the government are used to pay the salaries of teaching and non-teaching staff. Another type of grant provided to the school is the non-salary grant which is used to maintain infrastructure and pay electricity bill of the school building. However, the school has not been given either of the grants.

""The fees we get from our students are not enough for us to maintain the school's infrastructure, extra activities and the salaries of our teachers. We are somehow managing, but the important thing is the students' education which is now at stake as the teachers' quality is affected because of less salary,"" said Jyoti Patil, the school principal.

"58","","A study on seasonal migrant palmyra workers' families in Ramanathapuram district in the State has exposed deplorable conditions such as child labour and denial of school education to 69% of children.

According to the study, children in the age group of 3-6 travel a distance of 3-5 km to avail ICDS services.

The distance to ICDS for 13% children is more than 20 km and for 17% children the distance is 6-10 km.

""The poor and marginalised palmyra labourers are landless. They migrate to palmgroves with the children. Of the 396 migrant settlements covered in the study, 88% of the families migrated with children,"" said A.R. Muniyasamy, president of State Palmyrah Workers and Handicrafts Society.

The labourers are forced to sell the produce to particular merchants who lend money in advance.

The government has not been able to provide water supply, PDS services, public health services, neighbourhood schools and public transport facilities in migrant settlements. Almost half the year, the families spend their lives in palmyra groves without access to any basic services.

""It is extremely unacceptable that a generation of children continue to live and work in inhuman conditions,"" said Mr. Muniyasamy.

""There are various national and international laws and policies recognising the rights of children, but those are meaningless in the lives of palmyra tapping families,"" said Mr. Muniyasamy.

Participants at the meeting stressed on the need for initiatives on bridge schools in the palmyra groves during the migrant season to prevent children from dropping out of school.","'Children forced to skip school'","1025310612","2018-12-23","https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/children-forced-to-skip-school/article25815548.ece","The Hindu",FALSE

According to the report, none of the schools had female security guards, many students are yet to receive stationery money. Only 62 schools, of total 344, have CCTV cameras installed in them.

In almost 14 schools, more than 5,000 students are forced to sit on floors, as there are no desks and benches, and around 44 schools do not have Jal Board's water connections.

As per the report, a press statement released by SDMC in June stated that within four months, 4,348 CCTV cameras will be installed in 344 primary schools.

AAP councilor from Sitapur, Praveen Kumar Praveen Kumar, raised questions about the predicament of the schools in the meeting and accused the ruling BJP of making tall promises but failing to execute them.

Nandini Sharma, the South Corporation Education committee chairperson, said, ""The files have been moved. Tenders are being invited, and work orders will be issued. We are expecting to get things moving by February.""

She cited lack of funding as the reason for the woes of school and said, ""We received Rs 46 crore instead of Rs 89 crore in funds.

"64","","KOLKATA: Children from families of BJP workers, arrested for targeting a school bus carrying kids on bandh day, have themselves not been able to go to school for the past two days and are now living in constant fear of their names being struck off their school registers.

Five BJP supporters -- Krishna Sardar, Shyam Babu Roy, Sanjay Goldar, Gopal Mahato and Rana Saha -- were arrested on Thursday for targeting a school bus, belonging to DPS Megacity, near B T College in the city's northeastern suburbs on Wednesday. The BJP workers, according to police, were ""trying to enforce the bandh"".

Now, in a turn of events that no one had foreseen, children from these families find themselves in a sticky situation for no fault of their own. No one has been able to attend school for a variety of reasons and all of them are now worried that they may not be able to return to school at all.

""My mother has been making the rounds of the court and the police station since my father's arrest and I have been staying at home. Some of my friends have told me that my name may be struck off the school register as my father has been arrested in a criminal case,"" the son of one of the five arrested BJP supporters, a student of Class IV in a local school, said.

'How could my son target schoolchildren?'

The situation is the same at the home of a 19-year-old youth, who was the first to be arrested. ""My mother and grandmother spent Thursday at court and spent most of Friday at the police station to see my uncle. So there is no one to take me to school,"" the Class-II student told TOI, playing in the courtyard of a ghetto in Ganganagar.

All five arrested stay in the same neighbourhood, which is known as a ""BJPsupporting neighbourhood"". Many young supporters of the party fled their home on Thursday, fearing arrest, as news of the police action spread.

My uncle is the head of the family,"" a Class XII student, niece of one of the arrested, said on Friday. ""We are now looking after the household while our parents are trying to get my uncle out of jail. I don't know whether we will be able to resume school any time soon,"" the elder of the two sisters said while cooking on the verandah of their home.

But all the families said the attack on aschool bus was ""reprehensible and shameful"". ""I support the BJP,"" Krishna Sardar's mom, Anima Sardar, said. ""But the BJP bandh was to protest against the death of two students. How could my son and other BJP supporters target schoolkids? It is shameful and they should have never done so,"" she said. Others in the neighbourhood, too, criticised the attack but said the attack was by ""outsiders"".

"65","","Amidst ongoing Saudi-led aggression on Yemen, a photo of a father from Sa'ada province sitting next to the dead bodies of his two children, killed in the air raids became viral through social media platforms. The heart rendering scene showing helpless father who probably become immune to the daily killings around him has raised a great public interaction.

Meantime, Associated Press reports of the immense hunger among the Yemeni civilians. Many Yemeni families have nothing to eat but leaves as a humanitarian crisis reaches a critical stage.

Journalists of the agency visited Aslam district situated in Yemen's north-western Hajjah province where they witnessed the worsening hunger. Families with starving children have nothing to eat but the leaves of local vine, known as Halas in Arabic or Arabian Waz Leaf in English, boiled into a sour and made acidic green paste.

The agency reports that the main health centre was flooded with dozens of emaciated children. It said, ""Excruciatingly thin toddlers, eyes bulging, sat in a plastic washtub used in a make-shift scale as nurses weighed each one. Their papery skin was stretched tight over pencil-like limbs and knobby knees. Nurses measured their forearms, just a few centimetres in diameter, marking the worst stages of malnutrition"".

Aslam district recorded one of Hajjah's highest jumps in the number of malnourished children, from 384 cases being treated in January- an additional 1,319 more came in over the next six months.

Adding to the woes for the victims of Saudi-led coalition, Aslam's main health centre has no paediatricians, electricity, oxygen cylinders and fuel for generators.

Saleh al-Faqih, a worker in a mobile Health Ministry clinic has told that ""Aslam is just another picture of Somalia.""

A malnourished mother in al-Mashrada village, having a seven-month old girl in her lap said, ""Since the day she was born, I have not had the money to buy her milk or buy her medicine."" The mother feeds her whole family with Halas mush.

In January this year, London based The Guardian reported that war in Yemen has killed or injured more than 5000mchildren and left another four lakh severely malnourished and fighting for their lives.

UNICEF report unveiled that nearly 2 million Yemeni children were out of school, a quarter of them since the conflict escalated with Saudi-led coalition intervention in March 2015.

The Saudi Arabia led coalition launched a brutal war, known as ""Operation Decisive Storm"" against Yemen in March 2015. The move was aimed to reinstall ousted pro-Saudi former president Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi and crush the Ansarullah movement of Houthis, branded as pro-Iranian group.

The offensive initially consisted of a bombing campaign, but was later coupled with a naval blockade and the deployment of ground forces in the country. The blockade has halted humanitarian deliveries of food and medicine.","Yemen; Children Face Death, Malnutrition, forced to eat wax leaves - APN Live","948381945","2018-09-17","http://www.apnlive.com/world-news/yemen-children-face-death-malnutrition-forced-eat-wax-leaves-49554","APNLive",FALSE
"66","","Ludhiana: Appalling developments have come to light since a team of the Jharkhand police raided an illegal children's home in Punjab's Ludhiana city yesterday. The raid was prompted by complaints the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) in Chaibasa received from parents in Jharkhand who suspected their children of being trafficked.

A preliminary investigation into the matter revealed that the Paksin Mary Cross Child Shelter Home in Phullanwal was operating without it being registered under the Juvenile Justice Act. This led law enforcement agencies to arrest the shelter home's owner, 58-year-old Satyendra Prakash Musa. Police have also seized records from the home that is in its twelfth running year.

Musa is currently being interrogated for information about 30 children who were reportedly inmates at the shelter home but were not found by police at the time of the raids. Records accessed by the police suggest that 38 children sourced from Bihar and Jharkhand were living at the shelter home in question when it was raided on August 20. However, only eight were rescued from the shelter home before it was raided and the rescued inmates shifted to another care home in Doraha.

The child trafficking cell of Jharkhand police has arrested Musa on charges of illegal human trafficking. He has also been charged with sections corresponding to forced illegal conversion after probing authorities suspected him of forcibly converting the children under his care to Christianity and giving them Christian names. The children were also being taught Christian texts at the home in Phullanwal, Sub-Inspector Banarasi Ram told The Indian Express.

A complaint against Musa has been registered at the Chaibasa Sadar police station under Section 42 of the Juvenile Justice Act, Section 5 of the Immoral Traffic Prevention Act, Section 4 of the Jharkhand Religious Freedom Act 2017 and Section 370 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) that corresponds to charges of human trafficking.

During the course of the interrogation, the accused told officials that he had handed over the missing children to their parents in Bihar and Jharkhand. However, in the absence of any evidence to support his claim, police officials are racing against time to verify his statements.","Ludhiana Shelter Home: 30 children still missing, owner arrested on charges of forced religious conversion","935183446","2018-08-30","http://www.timesnownews.com/mirror-now/in-focus/article/ludhiana-phullanwal-chaibasa-jharkhand-30-children-missing-paksin-mary-cross-child-shelter-home-musa-religious-conversion-human-trafficking/277212","timesnownews.com",FALSE
"67","","NEW DELHI: The sight of girls engaged in daily chores is generally not an alarming one but similar scenes becoming commonplace in a shelter home are sure to set alarm bells ringing. To make matters worse, the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) inspection team, led by chairperson Swati Maliwal, found that at one centre, a lone cook caters to the hunger pangs of the girls, who are often made to cook for themselves.

The case may be no different in the 13 NGOs in the city which maintain open shelter homes for children. Most of them complain of paucity of funds. Each home, which houses 25 children, has an annual budget of Rs 19,99,200 released by the WCD Ministry. An additional Rs 5 lakh is granted to the non-profit organisations once in five years for nonrecurring expenses, as per an RTI reply provided to the Centre for Holistic Development. However, Maliwal said that insufficient budget cannot be an excuse for the erratic running of the homes as most of them get donations from external sources.

""The budget which comes from the ministry is not sufficient to run an open shelter homes. Which qualified person would work for a mere Rs 8,000 per month as staff? It's impossible for an organisation to maintain homes solely depending on government funds. The funds are also released to us once an annual budget is invested completely,"" an NGO coordinator said.

In their annual budgets, child care institutions receive a monthly grant of Rs 2,000 per child. The staff salary is distributed per month is as following: Rs 17,500 for a project coordinator, Rs 14,000 for a social worker, Rs 9,000 each to both care givers, Rs 8,000 each to three outreach workers and Rs 6,000 each to a cleaner and cook. To meet any further expenses, the organisations rely on donations.

""The financial support is provided for 25 children utilising the services at night as well. During the day, there would be more children utilising services for intermittent periods. For children availing services only during the day, a monthly maintenance of Rs 1,000 per child is provided. Apart from above, the NGOs are encouraged to enrol support of volunteers and raise funds from other sources to run the open shelters,"" the RTI reply stated.

A social activist, however, hinted on the misuse of government funds by NGOs and urged the ministry to conduct a strict scrutiny of utilisation of funds.

Psychologists stress on the need for love and warmth for the holistic development of the children. ""It is essential that warmth, love and sense of belonging are provided to the children staying in shelter homes. If, for some reason, they are forced to engage in regular chores then a feeling of helplessness takes over them,"" said Aarti, a psychologist at Shri Ganga Ram Hospital.","Children forced to cook, do chores","927763456","2018-08-19","http://www.newindianexpress.com/thesundaystandard/2018/aug/19/children-forced-to-cook-do-chores-1859543.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

Police said these girls were being raised by the accused, to be eventually pushed into commercial flesh trade.

The minors were allegedly administered hormonal injections so they would attain puberty much faster. Rachakonda Commissioner Mahesh Bhagwat said the traffickers bought the children from two agents Krishna Shankar and Kamsani Yadagiri, for amounts ranging up to Rs 2 lakh each.

Some of them were picked up from railway stations, bus stations and other public places also. He said the traffickers got the hormonal injections administered to the children by one Dr Swamy, for early puberty. For this, Dr Swamy charged '25,000 per injection from the organisers.

The youngest of them is four-year-old and the eldest is 11-year-old and all of them had Aadhaar cards also. While the traffickers claimed that the children were their own and of their relatives, police on thorough questioning of the kids found that the traffickers often abused them physically and tortured them without giving proper food, if they refused to do what they said.

Key amenities and infrastructure are found missing or in a shoddy condition in many government and private schools across the city. Many of the schools have unusable toilets or the facilities are in poor condition, many others have no playgrounds or boundary walls.

File Image of US Democrat Vicente Gonzalez. Reuters

Against a notable silence on the part of many Republicans, the Democratic lawmakers on Sunday visited a detention centre outside New York City and headed to Texas to inspect facilities where children have been detained, reported The Washington Post.

In McAllen, Texas, where several Democratic lawmakers toured a facility, state representative Vicente Gonzalez estimated that he saw about 100 children younger than six. ""It was orderly, but it was far from what I would call humane,"" he said.

Seven Democratic members of Congress spent Sunday morning at the Elizabeth Contract Detention Facility in New Jersey, waiting for nearly 90 minutes to view the facilities and visit five detained immigrants.

""This is unfair and unconstitutional,"" said New York representative Adriano Espaillat.

Trump has falsely blamed the separations on a law he said was written by Democrats, The Washington Post reported. But the separations instead largely stem from a ""zero-tolerance"" policy announced last month by Attorney General.

The White House has also interpreted a 1997 legal agreement and a 2008 bipartisan human trafficking bill as requiring the separation of families, a posture not taken by the previous two administrations.

Trump remained silent on the issue before tweeting on Sunday evening that Democrats should work with Republicans on an immigration solution before the midterm elections ""because you are going to lose!""

US officials have said that the number of families who could be broken up might double and that the number of children who have already been taken from their parents -- 2,000 over a six-week period from April to May -- may be higher than what the administration has reported.

"73","","19 million children aged between 5-11 involved in hazardous labour: ILO.

Today, on World Day Against Child Labour, while we adults sit in our air-conditioned offices and crib about our paychecks, some 152 million children between the ages of five and 17 are being forced into labour under unspeakable conditions.

There are more horrifying statistics where that comes from, with International Labour Organization (ILO). The ILO, which launched World Day Against Child Labour in 2002 to grab global attention to the terrifying figures of child labour, shared some of these figures in their World Day Against Child Labour program this year.

Check out these figures by the ILO on child labour:

The horror doesn't end there...

According to 2015 National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data:

While it is not clear if the children died in these circumstances while working working here, multiple investigative reports have shown a tendency of child labour in such cases.

India's worst case of child labour-related deaths in mica mines

In 2016, an investigative report by Reuters claimed that India's illegal mica mines had covered up the deaths of at least seven children killed in just two months.

""Investigations over three months in the major mica producing states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh found child labor rife, with small hands ideal to pick and sort the valued mineral that puts the sparkle in cosmetics and car paint,"" said the report.

""Interviews with workers and local communities discovered children were not only risking their health in abandoned 'ghost' mines off official radars, but they were dying in the unregulated, crumbling mines, with seven killed since June.""

ILO's agenda

""Children are more vulnerable to risk than adults. Urgent action is needed to ensure no child under the age of 18 is in hazardous child labour,"" said ILO Director-General Guy Ryder.

On this World Day Against Child Labour, a joint campaign has been launched with World Day for Safety and Health at Work (SafeDay) to improve the safety and health of young workers and end child labour.

The campaign also aims to ""accelerate action to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 8.8 of safe and secure working environments for all workers by 2030 and SDG target 8.7 of ending all forms of child labour by 2025,"".

"75","","Kolhapur: It's the last week in the six-month cycle of seasonal migration and Damini Jadhav, 13, is anxious to return to her village Dahiphal in Maharashtra's Beed district. Her parents are migrant agricultural labourers, who spend October to March each year traveling between villages in western Maharashtra and Karnataka cutting sugarcane.

""Now, I've decided not to leave the village till I give my class X board exams,"" she says. Her school teacher had called her parents twice to get her to sit for the year-end exams, but she couldn't make it. ""The teacher will make someone else write my paper and will promote me to the next class,"" she says. She says she can't comprehend written Marathi because of missing regular classes.

""I couldn't leave my daughter alone in the village where you can't even see a dog for six months,"" says her mother, Sapna Jadhav, who is in her early 30s. Sapna's son Rohan, 9, and daughter Mohini, 4, also travel with them.

""There's a lot of anguish, but what can be done about it?"" she asks. Her parent also work as agricultural labourers in Beed taluk and are away from the village the entire day. ""It was not possible for me to leave behind my children,"" says Jadhav.

Sapna and Damini also talk about the lack of proper healthcare facilities for the migrants. Sapna says, ""The smoke caused while preparing food leads to continuous coughing."" Sanket Jain/101 Reporters

Every morning she leaves for the fields at 9 and returns only by 9 at night. Damini, who's in grade VIII, prepares food for the family and takes it to the fields. ""When I came here I brought my school bag, but my dad took it back to the village two months ago when he had to return to the village for medical treatment,"" she says.

Dahiphal, with a population of 758, has a primary school [till grade IV]. The nearest secondary school is in Nalwandi village 3 km away and Damini walks the distance to and fro every day. ""In the evening, it's not safe to walk so my dad promised to buy me a cycle once he has enough money,"" says Damini.

Her father took an advance payment of Rs 50,000 from the contractor and is afraid that they won't be able to cut enough sugarcane to repay it. For every ton of sugarcane, they are paid Rs 248.

Ten families from Dahiphal stay in rickety sheds in an open field on the outskirts of Shirdhon village in Maharashtra's Kolhapur district. In the harsh summer, Damini stays back with her siblings and a few other children. ""I look after younger children. At times, I also go to the sugarcane fields. There is no one here to help me with my studies,"" she says.

Access to the sakhar shala (or sugar-factory school for migrants' children) is a problem as the nearest factory is 14 km away. Moreover, every few weeks the families have to move with the sugarcane harvest. In the six-months season, the Dahiphal families have migrated to Karadaga and Galatga in Karnataka, and Hupri, Shirol, Pattan Kodoli and Shirdhon villages in Maharashtra.

According to the 2011 census, 51 million people in India migrated for economic reasons. The National Sample Survey says 55.4 percent of rural migrants are illiterate. Over 48,000 students in Maharashtra were out of school, reports the 2017-18 state economic survey.

Manisha Sonawane, 35, from Kesapuri village in Manjlegaon taluk of Beed district has been migrating for more than a decade. Two years ago, Manisha's husband Anil worked as a watchman at a construction site in Pune. They were unable to support themselves on the Rs. 7,000 pay and they decided to cut sugarcane. ""In Pune, the school ma'am used to take my eight year old son, Shubham to the school daily. I can't keep him back in the village,"" says Manisha.

Shubham who is in class II wants to go back to the school. His 13-year-old brother and 11-year-old sister stay with their maternal grandmother in Devgaon village of Wadwani taluka in Beed. ""They had to stay with my mother because we keep migrating for six months a year. We can't afford to bring them with us at the cost of their education,"" says Manisha.

Every day the couple manages to cut three tonnes of cane. ""Today, I am suffering from acidity, but I can't stop working because we took an advance payment of Rs. 80,000,"" she says. Manisha, who was married at 14, has never seen the inside of a school. She believes that education can break the cycle of poverty and migration. ""I will educate all my children so that they never have to cut sugarcane,"" she vows.

Sania Tadvi, 13, is in grade VIII and belongs to the Tadvi Bhil tribe. Her day is no different from other migrant children. She collects fuel for the fire, cleans utensils, stores water and takes care of her siblings and cousins. ""By the time we return to the village, the summer break will start."" Her uncle teaches her when he gets time in the summer holidays. Sania says that it becomes difficult for them to catch up with their classmates, and that breeds a feeling of inferiority and insecurity.

She's one of 18 children from nine families who have migrated 570 kilometre with their parents from Godri village in Jamner block of Maharashtra's Jalgaon district to Kolhapur's Nandani village. Sania's mother, Roomshad, who is in her early 30s, couldn't study beyond grade IX once married. Her 15-year-old daughter Naina, who is in grade IX stays with her aunt in Godri.

Sania's father, Pintu Tadvi, never went to the school. ""My parents couldn't afford to enroll me in a school. I've been working as an agricultural labourer from my childhood days,"" he says.

""I want to fulfill my father's dream of becoming a collector,"" smiles Sania.

"79","","""No lesbians please, we are Bengali,"" seems to be the message coming from all quarters as a ""lesbian scandal"" engulfs a south Kolkata school.

The basic facts are these: On 8 March, 10 students of the Kamala Girls School said they were forced to sign a ""confession letter"" admitting they were lesbians. The angry parents claimed the girls were arm-twisted into signing the letter. They said that if two persons hold hands or put their arms around each other, it does not mean they are lesbians. The acting headmistress Sikha Sarkar said some students had complained about other students engaging in ""such behaviour"". So she called them in and considering ""the sensitive nature of the issue"", she asked them to admit it in writing and then called in their guardians to discuss the matter, ""so we can bring these girls on the right course"".

Whatever might have been demonstrated in this whole sorry episode, it's certainly not sensitivity. ""Sadly our teachers are being trained to teach different subjects,"" says Paro Anand, award-winning author of books for young adults. ""But they are not taught to handle issues that confront young people.""

Stigmatising sexuality or the suggestion of it is treading into dangerous territory. Representational image from Reuters

First off, why does anyone have to ""confess"", and that too in writing, to being a lesbian? In an official statement, the Indian Psychiatric Society has declared there is ""no evidence to substantiate the belief that homosexuality is a mental illness or a disease."" ""Are students in co-ed schools asked to write a confession about their heterosexuality when they are seen spending time together?"" wonders Malobika, co-founder of Sappho for Equality -- The Activist Forum for Lesbian, Bisexual Woman and Transman Rights, in a report by Indian Express.

And what is the ""right course"" anyway? It's one thing for a school not to promote homosexuality, or even approve of it, it's another thing to extract letters of confession.

The parents are right in saying two girls holding hands does not mean they are lesbians. But even if they are, does it mean the school can make them sign a ""confession""? ""In this kind of public name-and-shame game, what space do we leave for honesty?"" wonders Anand.

The issue is not whether some girls in Kamala Girls School are lesbians or have romantic crushes on each other, or play pranks. The issue is that schools and authorities seem to have no idea about how to deal with the sexuality of young people. ""Adolescent sexuality is a problem for schools and parents,"" says YA author Himanjali Sankar. She points to the Delhi Public School scandal from some years ago where two students recorded a sexual act which someone tried to sell on baazee.com (now acquired by eBay). ""The discourse is particularly skewed when it comes to homosexuality. One doesn't need video recordings. Just the suggestion of homosexuality is condemnation enough,"" she says.

Sankar is the author of Talking of Muskaan, a book which deals with a 15-year-old girl and homosexuality, among other things. Talking of Muskaan, along with Payal Dhar's Slightly Burnt where a teenaged girl grapples with the knowledge that her friend is gay, is one of the few YA books that deals with the subject in an Indian context. Sankar says her previous books about the Superdog Rousseau resulted in many interactions at schools. But when Talking of Muskaan came out, her publisher found that schools were reluctant to invite her. ""Some got back saying they liked the book but are afraid parents will complain if they have a session around it,"" she says.

""Through my work with over 3 lakh young people and their guardians, I have discovered that we as a people are less queasy about violence than about sex and sexualities,"" says Anand. ""So we can watch, read and witness violent acts, but an act of affection, between opposite, or worse, same-sex people, is too 'hot to handle'.""

But not wanting to talk about it can backfire, as the incident at Kamala Girls School shows. The state's education minister Partha Chatterjee says the government does not approve of the fact that the school extracted ""the statement under duress"" and has not handled the matter with maturity. But Chatterjee also tells The Quint he does not approve of inculcating the idea of lesbianism in schools because it ""can influence others"" and that this ""is not the culture of Bengal"".

Adolescent sexuality can be confusing and complicated enough, without dragging the ""culture of Bengal"" into it. Schools obviously have to maintain discipline and they are well within their rights to reprimand, rebuke and even punish students who violate their rules. But stigmatising sexuality or the suggestion of it is treading into dangerous territory.

The students say they were told to write they had put their hands in their friend's blouses and tickled them under their skirts. They were asked why they held hands. Whether minister Chatterjee or the school headmistress likes it or not, teenagers are curious about sex and sexuality. But the very idea of homosexuality lays bare an ""underlying outrage"" says Sankar. An overt exhibition of heterosexual romance could also draw rebukes, but in that case, the more likely outcome is of a student being counseled about how this is not the ""right age"" and that their studies must not suffer. But even a mention of lesbianism brings forward threats of transfer certificates and signed statements.

What is tragic is that in its effort to bring girls on the ""right course"", school authorities miss how vulnerable homosexual children are in a school. A school is a place where fitting in is all-important and a child who seems different from her peers risks bullying, or worse. They are called names, teased, and ostracised. A survey by Mental Health America says LGBT youth are four times more likely to commit suicide and two-and-half times more likely to harm themselves with each instance of verbal or physical harassment. The fact that we do not conduct such studies in India does not mean we do not face these issues.

In Talking of Muskaan, Muskaan is comfortable with her sexuality but some of those around her are not, and she attempts to kill herself. That's fiction. But in real life, by stigmatising even the suggestion of lesbianism, a school sends out a terrible message. Students will often bully a student who seems different, who seems gay. That is sad, but not unusual. It is much more disheartening when the school itself comes across as the bully.

"80","","MEWAT: While Gurugram is becoming increasingly popular as work destination for corporates, just 75 kms ahead in the adjoining district Mewat, workers at a brick kiln were bullied by a contractor. The accused even locked in a pregnant who was rescued after an NGO got the whiff of the situation. The district administration rescued 32 labours and their 31 children from a brick kiln on February 9. They have now been given letters stating them to be a free from any bond and sent back home.

Around 22 brick kilns are located in Mewat's Punhana sub-division, where these labourers were harassed by their contractor. Around 63 people, including a few couples and their children were brought here by contractors - Ram Mohan and Rajkumar three months ago. The workers hail from Chitrakoot, Panhar and Banda districts in Uttar Pradesh Many brick kilns in Uttar Pradesh have been closed down in order to protect Taj Mahal. Such workers, have now migrated to other states in search of livelihood.

The 46 labourers were paid an advance of Rs 5,000 to 10,000 each. In due course, with their promised wages, they were to be paid between Rs 25,000 to 50,000 on the basis of the number of the bricks made by the each worker.

""Each of us has made around 50,000 to 70,000 bricks. But we were not paid for our hardwork. Whenever we spoke to manager at the brickworks, Ram Mohan would interrupt and said that we will not be paid till June,"" said Jamahir, another rescued worker.

""How can we stay in another state and not have any money for 6 to 7 months. Many times, the workers we were assaulted by Ram Mohan's men for demanding our wages. They wouldn't let us leave either and forced us to work,"" said Arjun, one of the rescued labourer.

Not just financially, the brickworks didn't offer any basic facility like drinking water or washroom either. Situation got worse when he started harassing the women too, including a pregnant woman. The workers alleged that the contractor even harassed their wives and daughters.

""The woman was pregnant but he wouldn't even allow to go out even to see a doctor. Ram Mohan was worried that she would tell people about his misbehaviour with workers. One day he locked her in and stopped all labour from going out too,"" said Rajmani, a worker.

The matter came to light when a worker managed to contact a Delhi based NGO- Bonded Labour Liberation Front. The workers called the NGO on February 6 and informed them about the situation.

The NGO then reported the matter to district administration. It filed a complaint stating violation of Bonded Labor System (Abolition) Act, 1976,Interstate Migrant Workmen Act and juvenile justice act.

""The workers told us that accused would pass lewd comments towards the women, the children too were made to work. Basic facilities were missing there. When we asked why did you go to Mewat, the caller said 'sahib there is no work there else who wants to leave their home',"" said Swami Agnivesh, founder-president of Bonded Labour Liberation Front.

A team headed by SDM Jitender Garg along with Mewat police raided the brickworks and rescued the workers. All have now returned home.

Jitender Garg, SDM, Punhana told TOI that ""the workers didn't file any complaint against the employer or anyone else. We have initiated an action against the contractor and have taken an undertaking from him that if he ever misbehaves again, a police complaint will be filed against him"".","Pregnant woman, children among 63 rescued from forced labour by administration in Mewat - Times of India","814432530","2018-02-16","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/pregnant-woman-children-among-63-rescued-from-forced-labour-by-administration-in-mewat/articleshow/62952643.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

When the teacher checked the student's bag, he found an iron rod and scolded the boy for not carrying textbooks, the officer said.

During the investigation, other students told the police that after taking the iron rod from the student, the teacher kept it on his table, the officer said.

However, when the teacher got busy, the student picked up the rod from the table and kept it back inside his bag, he said.

When this came to the teacher's notice, he tried to take away the student's bag and that is when the boy took out the rod and attacked him with it, the officer said.

The student immediately fled from the spot. The victim was rushed to the AIIMS trauma centre where he was being treated for his injuries, the officer added.

"87","","AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) recently notified fresh rules governing the attendance of students at schools. According to the new rules, 80% attendance is compulsory for students of class X and XII during the academic year from June 15 to February 15. The new rules have raised eyebrows among students.

According to the old rules, if students did not fulfil the attendance criteria, they could take the board exams as private students. However, the new rules mandate that students must have at least 65% attendance to take the board exams as private students.

In a small relief measure for students, the GSHSEB chairman has been empowered to relax the attendance requirement by 15% for students in individual cases under circumstances such as prolonged illness, the death of a parent or participation in NCC/NSS camps. Apart from these, if a student needs leeway on the attendance front, the parents make a representation to the school principal who will in turn forward it to GSHSEB officials.

According to data from the state education board, about 1 lakh students take the class X and XII board exams as private students every year.

The board's decision to make 80% attendance mandatory is its second major decision this academic year. In June, the board notified major changes to the rules for promoting students to higher classes.","Gujarat board makes 80% attendance compulsory for class X, XII students - Times of India","961002814","2018-10-04","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/board-makes-80-attendance-compulsory-for-class-x-xii-students/articleshow/66060434.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

A decision to this effect was taken by the university after an experiment with such a move proved successful in J R S College at Jamalpur recently.

Sources said VC Ranjit Kumar Verma was on a visit to the Jamalpur college when a Chemistry teacher complained to him that hardly three to four BSc (Hons) students used to attend his classes.

Appointed last year on the recommendation of Bihar Public Service Commission, the teacher sounded frustrated and wanted the VC to transfer him to any other college where his pedagogical skills could be put to better use.

The VC, however, advised the teacher to form a WhatApp group of his students and their guardians and post on it the attendance details of students every day.

""The teacher followed the advice, and it worked wonders: The attendance increased from 3-4 to 35 within a fortnight,"" VC Verma told this correspondent on Thursday.

He said principals and teachers of other colleges in the university would also be directed to form such WhatsApp groups.

In yet another case of teacher's tyranny against students, a school in Andhra Pradesh is making headlines after a video revealed five students standing naked under the scorching Sun.

The horrifying incident took place on Wednesday after the class 3 students of Chaitanya Bharati English Medium School at Punganur in Chittoor district came late to the class.

The students were forced to strip naked by teacher Bhuvaneshwari as an act of punishment.

The angry parents have staged a protest along with Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) party workers and demanded the authorities to cancel the registration of the school for such abusive acts.

Child rights activists have also taken the case to the local authorities to take strict action against the school. A complaint has also been filed by Mandal Educational Officer (MEO) against the school management with Punganur police station.

The District Educational Officer (DEO) of Chittoor, Dr K Panduranga Swamy, told International Business Times, India: ""An investigation is underway and as the school management has violated the child rights, the registration of the school will be cancelled from the year 2019-2020.""

""The district collector has also been informed about the seriousness of the issue and stringent actions will be taken against the management and principal of the school, Nagaraju,"" he added.

In order to favour a girl student, an Una-based teacher allegedly leaked the CBSE Class XII economics paper in March this year, stated the chargesheet filed by the Delhi Police in the paper leak case, a senior police officer said on Friday.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) G. Ram Gopal Naik confirmed that a chargesheet was filed on December 20 in a city court. The police has filed a chargesheet of 482 pages against 10 persons in the paper leak case.

The chargesheet has cited 78 witnesses including the girl student, for whom her teacher leaked the paper and some students who had received the papers through WhatsApp, said another officer.

Recovered mobile phones, handwritten notes, question paper written by the girl student and other data retrieved from cell phones have been cited as evidence.

""The teacher, Rakesh Kumar, wanted to favour a girl student and with the connivance of bank officials, he got the economics paper and brought it to his residence. He called the girl home and she copied the paper. He then clicked pictures of the paper and circulated it. The girl is one of the witnesses in the case,"" said the officer. Since the teacher had access to the papers, he also leaked Class 10 mathematics paper in the same way to favour a relative in Ferozpur whose son was appearing for the exams.

Along with Mr. Kumar, branch manager of Union Bank of India Sheru Ram, head cashier of the same bank Om Prakash and a 40-year-old woman, who had circulated handwritten question papers of Class XII economics and Class X mathematics through WhatsApp from her mobile phone, were also arrested and have been named in the chargesheet as accused.

Two others -- Amit Sharma and Ashok Kumar -- who worked at the DAV School along with Mr. Kumar, have also been named in the chargesheet. In another development, the police had also busted another module being operated by two teachers of Mother Khazani Convent School in Bawana.

In the Bawana module, three men, including two teachers of the private school, were involved. The teachers -- Rishabh and Rohit -- had taken photographs of the economics paper and sent it to Tauqeer, who used to give private tuition. Tauqeer circulated the paper among his students about an hour before the examination commenced, the police had said, adding, he had received the paper via WhatsApp from Rishabh and Rohit.

The principal of Mother Khazani School, Praveen Kumar Jha, was arrested in July and his name also figures in the chargesheet, the officer said. The economics paper leak was exposed after an envelope containing four images of a handwritten copy of the question paper was delivered to the CBSE headquarters in Delhi on the evening of March 26, the day of the exam.

On March 30, the Central Board of Secondary Education announced it would reconduct the Class 12 economics exam across the country on April 25. Besides the Class XII economics paper, the mathematics paper of Class X had also surfaced online before the scheduled examination.

The police had registered two cases in connection with the paper leak. The first case related to the leak of economics paper was registered on March 27, while the other pertaining to the leak of mathematics paper was filed on March 28.","Teacher leaked CBSE Class XII paper to favour student","1024185037","2018-12-21","https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/teacher-leaked-cbse-class-xii-paper-to-favour-student/article25803418.ece","The Hindu",FALSE

On Sunday, a man complained to the cyber cell that his daughter, a class X student, was being bullied by an unidentified person on social networking site Facebook for a week.

The offender had posed as a mathematics teacher and after some conversation, had started sending her vulgar posts. He also tried to engage her in similar conversation.

""When my daughter blocked him, he started harassing her through Facebook messenger. He bullied my daughter for blocking him and threatened her that he would morph her pictures and make them viral. Hence, we approached the police,"" said the complainant.

The victim lodged a case at PGI police station and also informed the cyber cell. In Hassanganj, the parents of a schoolgirl lodged a complaint against their neighbour for sending her lewd messages continuously.

Inspector at cyber cell Zubair Ahmad said an inquiry has been initiated in all three cases.

"96","","BENGALURU: Aspiring teachers can take a concrete step towards realising their dreams after class 12 as the new Integrated Teacher Education Programme (ITEP) will come into effect from next year.

According to the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE), candidates scoring 50% and above in secondary or an equivalent exam can seek admission to ITEP, generally described as a four-year BEd course. ITEP proposes awarding the aspiring teachers Bachelor of Arts or BSc degrees based on the subject of their choice at the end of the programme.

Unlike the current BEd, the programme will include two different courses: ITEP primary education and ITEP upper primary to secondary education. Currently, an undergraduate degree in any stream is the minimum eligibility criterion for BEd.

The new programme integrates general studies comprising mathematics and science and social sciences and humanities with professional studies which includes perspectives in education, other core education courses, curriculum and pedagogy of school subjects and practicals related to the tasks and functions of a school teacher.

It is expected to equip aspiring teachers with the requisite attitude, pedagogical skills and knowledge to address the challenges of becoming an effective school teacher, with the help of best practices in the field of teacher education, according to a related circular gazetted by the Centre last month.

NCTE, which is a statutory body of Government of India, and works on curriculum related to teacher education, kickstarted the application process for running ITEP from December 3. Higher education institutes offering UG and PG courses in the fields of liberal arts and humanities, social sciences and sciences can apply for permission to offer the course. Those who already have teacher education programmes are also eligible for seeking sanction, the notification said.

Institutions will be granted permission for the course for 2019-23 in the first phase; the last date for submitting applications is December 31, 2018.

The incident which took place in the month of October this year at a private school in Haryana's Gurugram city has shocked parents and children alike. According to reports surrounding the incident, the teacher was suspended by the school following a complaint by parents of the two LKG students.

In the CCTV footage, the teacher can be seen aggressively approaching the two four-year-olds before taping their mouths with what seems like cello tape. While the boy and the girl did not protest at the time, their parents caught wind of the incident on the same day and registered their displeasure with the school in the form of an official complaint. According to a report by Indian Express, the teacher was suspended almost immediately based on the complaint.

An official statement issued by the school principal, Gururaj, read that strict action was taken against the faculty member in question based on a complaint by the parents of the two lower kindergarten students. In her defense, the teacher claims that the students were disturbing the entire class with their conversation and were using 'filthy' language, a claim which is yet to be confirmed.

A somewhat similar case had come to light from a military school in Pune where a teacher was suspended after he allegedly used excessive force to reprimand a Class 6 student. Parents of the student told media personnel that he came back home from school with a swollen face on the day of the incident. Following a complaint by the guardians, an inquiry was ordered into the matter which led to the suspension of the teacher.

"120","","Bengaluru: Sexually harassed allegedly by their yoga teacher, Mohan Polamar of The Practice Room on Wheeler Road, east Bengaluru, a group of women has created a comic, ""The Illustrated Women's Guide to Yogabuse"".

The digital comic starts off with a few women entering a yoga studio, hoping to combat the sort of problems faced by urban people, through yoga. ""All was well in the world, but then odd things started happening,"" it says, over images of women looking visibly disturbed as their teacher gets uncomfortably close to them, ostensibly while helping them practise.

The women had received text messages of the ""Hey gorgeous, how you doing? Didn't see you in class today,"" variety. Doubting themselves at first, they voiced their discomfort to the teachers, only to hear comments like 'Come on!', ""I don't think it was inappropriate"", ""You are averse to touch"" and ""Different bodies experience touch differently"".

Realising that this sort of harassment happens often and to many, the women drew up a list of guidelines such as ""It is not okay for your yoga teacher to put his hands anywhere on your body that makes you uncomfortable or in a manner that causes you discomfort."" ""It is perfectly normal to feel doubt, disbelief or fear, after you are touched inappropriately by a teacher"" and ""It is okay to report your yoga teacher and seek the redressal you need.""

In a series of tweets, writer-journalist Sandhya Menon, one of the women who kicked off the #MeToo protests in India, said, ""When the women complained, the Practice Room put together a committee. This included the harasser's wife, who also runs the place along with the harasser. There was flat denial, gaslighting and aggression ... When the women insisted, he was asked to take time off. But a month later, he's back to teaching, having ""reflected deeply"".""

Menon also posted a screenshot of the harasser's wife circulating the comic on a WhatsApp group of which the students were a part. ""And now, the cleverest cut of all. The husband and wife duo have coopted the comic to circulate this among their classes, claiming what a great illustration of how not to behave as a yoga teacher,"" Menon tweeted.

"121","","BENGALURU: Sexually harassed allegedly by their yoga teacher, Mohan Polamar of The Practice Room on Wheeler Road, east Bengaluru, a group of women has created a comic, ""The Illustrated Women's Guide to Yogabuse"".

The digital comic starts off with a few women entering a yoga studio, hoping to combat the sort of problems faced by urban people, through yoga. ""All w as well in the world, but then odd things started happening,"" it says, over images of women looking visibly disturbed as their teacher gets uncomfortably close to them, ostensibly while helping them practise. Doubting themselves at first, they voiced their discomfort to teachers, only to hear comments like 'Come on! I don't think it's inappropriate"", ""You are averse to touch"" and ""Different bodies experience touch differently"".

Realising that this sort of harassment happens often and to many, the women drew up a list of guidelines such as ""It is not okay for your yoga teacher to put his hands anywhere on your body that makes you uncomfortable or in a manner that causes you discomfort"", ""It is normal to feel doubt, disbelief or fear, after you are touched inappropriately"" and ""It is okay to report your teacher and seek redressal you need.""

In a series of tweets, writer-journalist Sandhya Menon, one of the women who kicked off the #MeToo protests in India, said, ""When the women complained, the Practice Room put together a committee. This included the harasser's wife, who also runs the place. There was flat denial, gaslighting and aggression ... When the women insisted, he was asked to take time off. A month later, he's back to teaching, having ""reflected deeply"".""

The Bombay High Court recently held that ""ghastly and heinous"" crimes, such as rape, when they take place in villages, have a serious impact on the minds of villagers and also place question marks on the future of minor victims in view of the socio-economical backwardness of the areas.

A division bench of Justice S S Shinde and Justice A S Gadkari refused to enhance the sentence sought by the state of a male class teacher and the headmistress of a primary school for raping a Class VII girl and abetting the crime, respectively. A sessions court in Raigad, Alibaug, had convicted the class teacher and the headmistress under rape and abetment charges, along with charges under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, and sentenced them to 10 years in prison.

According to the statement of the victim to the trial court, in December 2012, the headmistress called he girl to a room next to her office. When the girl went in, the headmistress locked up the room from the outside. The class teacher then removed her clothes, took photographs of her and raped her. He also threatened her against speaking to anyone about the incident. Later, the headmistress opened the door and the girl was allowed to go home. She informed her mother about the incident but got no support to file an FIR. On January 22, 2013, the girl went to a police station and filed a complaint.

The bench observed that after considering the evidence, it was found that the evidence of the student is ""consistent, reliable and trustworthy"". She specifically said that the class teacher committed the crime and the headmistress abetted it, the bench noted.

The court also considered the statement of a witness, who said that when the class teacher's mobile phone was checked, it was found that it had as many as 15 obscene photographs of girl students.

The court said: ""The accused No. 1 (the class teacher) being in the profession of a teacher of the school, was having no reason to have such photographs in his mobile phone.""

"146","","Hyderabad: Corporal punishment continues in schools, with two additional cases reported in the last couple of days. J. Bharat, a Class 8 student and Harishchandra Prasad studying in Class 3 were beaten by their respective teachers.

Earlier this week, a student was beaten with a duster in a government school

Bharath was badly beaten by his mathematics teacher Hanumantha Rao at Tondupally Shivaji Vidya Nikethan High School for laughing while the class was going on at about 11 am on Friday morning. The welts remained on his body even on Satuday, and he contracted fever.

Bharat's father D. Mallesh said such incidents were on the rise because the principals were not giving proper instructions to the teachers. ""They should hold a meeting and all teachers should be warned against corporal punishment. One cannot treat children so badly as it leaves a long lasting impact on the child's physical and mental health,"" he said.

Prasad, a Class 3 student of Sri Chaitanya Olympiad School at Boduppal was beaten by his Hindi teacher Padmavathi for three days.

Though there were complaints from the parents, the school officials did not heed, it was alleged.

Education experts said that wooden dusters and sticks were banned in schools to ensure that teachers in a fit of rage did not use them to belabour students. ""Despite the ban, they are in use and being used for all the wrong purposes,"" an expert said.

"147","","Nagpur: A physics professor of Shivaji Science College has created a 'flipped classroom' to run University Grants Commission (UGC) sponsored career-oriented course (CoC) in mathematical modelling that is helping BSc and MSc students hone industry-specific skills without having the need to attend separate classes or stay back after regular lectures.

Conceived in 2013-14 by Shyamkant Anwane, the professor has trained 150 students in the last five years. As many as 140 have joined the one-year programme this time.

The professor believes the tutorials will help students in scientific fields, competitive exams and make the routine BSc course meaningful and technically sound. Explaining about the 'flipped classroom', he said he borrowed the idea from IIT-Bombay which has been providing lectures before holding class. ""When students come to class after hearing lectures, it triggers the process of thinking on the subject,"" he said.

According to the professor, flipped classroom allows them to do away with monotonous theoretical part while students explore their creativity in the 'Maple' lab during their free time in college. During the certificate/diploma course, students are taught the mathematical software named 'Maple' which is used in computing complicated equations, data analysis and plotting 2D or 3D graphical functions.

""Understanding of the subject becomes clear and students start ideating. Generally, students need to take up additional course after or during their degree programmes to learn the software. The syllabus is approved by the Nagpur University. However, students are encouraged to be innovative by applying ideas coming in their minds,"" Anwane said.

He added that the initiatives by college's department of Physics is limited to its students but from next year, the doors would be opened for outsiders as well.

""Learning physics along with Maple is certainly mould young minds to be innovators. We have been encouraging students to execute new ideas and never hesitate to open up for discussions,"" he said.

""In the academic session 2018-19, we plan to reach to maximum students through this CoC in the form of flipped e-classroom. We have uploaded six video lectures on Maple on YouTube which the students should listen to before reporting to the Maple Laboratory for hands-on experience. Some PDF worksheets on Maple are also made available on Google Drive.

Talking about teaching method, Anwane said students need to register online and subscribe the YouTube channel. Those not having access to smartphones or Internet are given hard copies.

""Whenever students have free slots or off lectures, they hear the lectures. So, there is no need to follow a timetable. We are maintaining the attendance in the lab along with their YouTube activity to ensure they go through the study material,"" he said.

How the course is run

In flipped classroom, online lectures are provided before the actual class is held. Students can go through them as many times as they need unlike a traditional classroom where the teacher delivers one lecture on a topic. Pre-hand involvement of students ensures meaningful interaction with the teacher later. Discussion on various points as well as problem solving is done. This opens scope of bringing out students' innovation and creativity.

"150","","Close on the heels of the shocking incident to two minor girls raped in Hinjewadi, yet another shocking incident of molestation of a Class 6 girl by the class teacher, a month ago, has come to light. A woman teacher has lodged a complaint in this regard.

According to the police, the incident came to light through the good touch bad touch programme launched by the school to create awareness about molestation and sexual harassment cases. The FIR under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act was lodged on Thursday.

According to the Hinjewadi police, the 40-year-old teacher who molested the 12-year-old has been arrested. The victim along with her friend was sitting on the bench when the perpetrator asked her to get up and forced himself on her.

The girl being young and naïve to such adult overtures did not realise it initially, but through the good touch and bad touch programme became convinced that she was molested. According to the police, there is a strong possibility that the child molester has done similar type of offences and his background check is being done.

The said teacher was transferred to Hinjewadi due to some bad character related issues, police said.

Meanwhile, former corporator and activist Maruti Bhapkar has petitioned to chief minister's office (CMO) pointed out that the series of Pocso related offences and ineffectiveness of the police to rise to the occasion and provide relief to the citizens demanded strict action against the police officials.

Mere attaching the police officials of the lower rung will not yield results as punitive and disciplinary action against the supervisory officers is the immediate need of the hour failing which the fear of law and order and police will slide further in the days to come, Bhapkar stated in a written complaint to the CMO.

Meanwhile, Vijaya Rahatkar, Maharashtra state commission for women chairperson also visited the families of the victims and heard their grievances. The Pimpri Chinchwad police are facing severe criticism from several quarters for their inept handling of the cases related to molestation and Pocso from the area residents and activists.

Recently, the Hinjewadi police came in for sharp criticism after they kept a young IT professional waiting for four hours and refused to lodge an FIR.

A teacher was arrested while she was teaching a class full of students and the local police were stopped from arresting two others by the local MLA in Gandevi taluka of Gujarat's Navsari district on Monday after the mamlatdar (chief officer of the taluka) issued a warrant for the trio's arrest for missing electoral roll revision work assigned to them.

The roll revision drive is taken up by the Election Commission of India for next year's General Election, and Gandevi taluka's mamlatdar S D Chaudhary asked the police on Monday to pick up the three teachers and present them at his office on Tuesday.

Government school teachers have been appointed booth-level officers (BLOs) in the electoral roll revision drive, and Navsari district administration had asked all BLOs on Sunday to verify and correct them. Three BLOs -- all teachers at village primary schools -- had failed to turn up when the exercise was carried out in Gandevi on Monday: Manisha Raman Patel of Undach village primary school, Nidhi Bharat Patel (Antaliya), and Geeta Arun Patel (Gadat).

Calling it a ""humiliation by the mamlatdar"", Geeta Patel, 50, said, ""I am teaching for the last 20 years at Undach village. I was given election work at Salej village, which is far. I had earlier requested the mamlatdar to give election-related work in Undach. We are not against work but one should think before assigning such responsibility. We are upset that they sent a police team to our workplace to arrest us.""

On Tuesday, Gujarat chief electoral officer S Murali Krishna said, ""The officials are not supposed to take such action. There were no directions from this office (Chief Election Office), neither was this office informed about this (arrest warrant). I have instructed the district officers concerned to ensure such incidents are not repeated.""

Defending his action, mamlatdar S D Chaudhary said, ""These three teachers failed in doing their duty, so we issued arrest warrants and instructed police to take action.""

The police, he said, ""brought them and they gave us in writing that they will do election-related work"" in future.

Nidhi Patel, 32, was arrested while she was teaching students of class VII, leaving the children shell-shocked, according to those present. Nidhi was taken to the mamlatdar office, where she had to give written assurance that she will finish her election-related work before October 15.

The two other teachers, Manisha Patel, 45, and Geeta Patel, 50, were at a science fair in Vadsarang village of the district. When the police reached there to arrest them, two BJP MLAs present at the venue -- Naresh Patel (of Gandevi constituency) and Piyush Patel (Navsari) stopped them from arresting the duo. They told the police team that the teachers would go to the mamlatdar office on Monday evening, once the science fair wound up.

Both went to the mamlatdar office in the evening and gave a written undertaking that they would do all election-related work assigned to them.

Navsari District Teachers' Association president Dilip Patel, who reached the office to support the teachers, said, ""Arrest warrants are not proper; they create a poor impression of teachers on students' minds.... Why are only teachers selected for election and other work? There are other officials in different government department who can do the same work.""

Calling it a situation of ""pressure created by the mamlatdar"" that forced the police to act ""immediately"", Navsari's Deputy Superintendent of Police S G Rana said, ""Our staff were given the arrest warrant by the mamlatdar and they acted on it. The police did their duty; they have not done anything illegal. (But) I think the police team should have waited until the school hours got over before arresting teacher Nidhi Patel.""

Even after we sent her a message on July 12, informing her about our daughter's injuries, she did not inform the principal or the police. The principal got to know about the incident only after police reached the school to arrest the accused.""

"159","","HYDERABAD: Incidents of teachers assaulting students have shown a marked increase in the State. In the third instance of corporal punishment to come to light in the last 10 days, a kindergarten student of NRI Talent School, Chintal, was allegedly beaten up by his math teacher for not paying attention in class.

The incident came to the fore on Thursday, when the five-year-old child's parents saw bruises on his arms, chest and back. ""When we asked our son, he told us that his math teacher had beaten him up with a stick in the class. He is a quiet child. If we had not seen the bruises, he probably would not even have told us,"" said Prashant Reddy, his father. Regardless of the fault, children should never be beaten up so brutally, he added. ""We also approached the school but the principal has asked us to come on Monday,"" he said. The parents have taken the issue to Balala Hakkula Sangham, a child rights body.

In an audio recording doing the rounds on WhatsApp, attributed to the accused Paritala Sunitha, the teacher confesses to punishing the child and seeks the apology of the parents. According to the parents, the teacher also called them up and admitted to beating their son and a few other students. ""She said that she was only disciplining the children and did not hit them hard. She also added that my son's bruises are prominent only because he is fair,"" the father said.

Express, however, could not independently verify the teacher's version as she was not available on phone despite several calls. Meanwhile, though the parents claimed to have lodged a complaint with Jeedimetla police, a police official recounted a different version. ""We insisted that they lodge a formal complaint, but they did not. Until there is an official complaint, we can't take any action against the school or the teacher,"" he said. Child rights activist Achyuta Rao said that the growing incidents of corporal punishment are happening in the city because of the flippant attitude of the Education department in dealing with such pressing issues.","Teacher canes 5-yr-old for being inattentive in class","931539813","2018-08-24","http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2018/aug/25/teacher-canes-5-yr-old-for-being-inattentive-in-class-1862528.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

This is the second time in 40 days that police in Noida have filed charges against a school principal. On July 17, the principal and two teachers of Ahlcon Public School in Delhi's Mayur Vihar were arrested in the investigation into the death of a 16-year-old student, who committed suicide in March.

Her parents had accused the teachers of mentally and physically harassing her.

The reason for extending the probe to the principal and class teacher of the Greater Noida school is the messages sent to the class teacher by the mother of the three-year-old girl.

She had informed the class teacher about her daughter's health on the night of July 12, after she was allegedly raped. But it was the parents who went to the police, not the school, investigators said.

The parents were alarmed by their daughter's sudden resistance to swimming and had informed her class teacher way back on May 15.

As per the RTE Act, a teacher should be appointed for every 40 students in primary schools. In rest of the schools, PTR is 35:1.

""By following the PTR, only two or three teachers were appointed in the schools which have less than 50 students. These teachers should handle multiple classes and multiple subjects.

"168","","New Delhi, Aug 8: Three senior students allegedly molested a nine-year-old student of the same school in Delhi. The senior students are said to have molested the younger boy thrice in the school bus earlier this month.

What is apalling is that a teacher who was travelling in the same bus is said to have ignored the complaint of the nine-year-old. The boy's family alleged that the teacher did not ask the child for details of the incident.

It is really shocking that such incidents are taking place in schools. Last year in December, a complaint was filed against a four-year-old boy for allegedly raping his classmate in a Delhi school.

The issue is truly worrisome and calls for serious attention by parents and school administrators.

The boys are students of Class 7, 8 and 10. The victim is a student of Class 4. The case was registered on August 6, reported HT.

The victim's sister said that the three senior boys who molested her brother were seated in the rear seats of the school bus.

It was reported on Tuesday that the Class 4 student was allegedly sexually abused by three senior students for three consecutive days in the school bus.

The matter came to light when the girl narrated her ordeal to her parents.

It has also come to light that the girl had already complained to the teacher-in-charge of the bus about the same, but no action was taken against the three senior students.

The girl had refused to go to school and apparently locked her self inside the doors when her parents insisted.

It was only then that the parents of the girl came to know about her alleged sexual molestation by her seniors.

After getting to know what had happened to their child, the parents immediately brought the matter to the attention of the school authorities. The parents alleged that they did not get a strong response from the school authorities and finally decided to take the matter to the police.

In their complaint, they alleged that their daughter was sexually abused and even hit by three of her senior students. The parents said that their child was completely traumatised by the events and was very scared.

On the basis of their complaint, the police have registered a case against the three accused students under the POSCO Act.

However, the school management is yet to take any action against the three accused students. Of the three one is a student of Class 10 and the other two accused study in Class 8th and Class 7th.

Incidents of sexual abuse and molestation have been highlighted even in the past with parents being urged to explain the concept of 'good touch, bad touch.' Psychologists and NGOs working with children have often said that such incidents are often not reported due to fear of possible social stigma.

He demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other top leaders of the BJP should clear the party's stand and bar party functionaries from disrespectful remarks about gods and goddesses.

The seer's reaction came after Uttar Pradesh Religious Affair Minister Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary dubbed Lord Hanuman as a Jat, saying like Jats, the deity never tolerated injustice towards anybody, anywhere.

The minister made the remark Friday after a BJP MLC from the state, Bukkal Nawab, dubbed Lord Hanuman a Muslim on the ground that his name rhymed with Islamic names like Rahman, Arman, Qurban etc.

During an election rally in Rajasthan, Adityanath had termed the deity a Dalit.

"337","","MATHURA: Apparently upset with political leaders linking Lord Hanuman to various castes and communities, Shankaracharya Swami Adhokshjanand Deo Tirth on Tuesday asked the leaders of the ruling BJP to clear stand on the issue.

The revered seer said that by making disrespectful remarks on the deity, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and other leaders have vitiated the atmosphere in the country and hurt the religious sentiments of majority Hindus.

He demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other top leaders of the BJP should clear the party's stand and bar party functionaries from making such distasteful remarks about Hindu gods and goddesses.

The seer's reaction came days after Uttar Pradesh Religious Affair Minister Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary dubbed Lord Hanuman as a 'Jat', saying like Jats, the deity never tolerated injustice towards anybody, anywhere.

The minister made the remark on Friday after a BJP MLC from the state, Bukkal Nawab, dubbed Lord Hanuman as a 'Muslim' on the ground that his name rhymed with Islamic names like Rahman, Arman, Qurban etc.

During an election rally in Rajasthan, UP CM Adityanath had called the deity a 'Dalit'.

""On one side the BJP, from time to time, has been bringing up the Ram temple issue and on the other, its leaders are making absurd remarks on Hindu gods and goddesses, hurting religious sentiments,"" Shankaracharya Adhokshajanand Deo Tirth said.

"339","","Sycophancy is quite common in Indian politics. This time Congress president Rahul Gandhi is being targeted on social media for a viral photo which shows TS Singh Deo, a cabinet minister in the newly formed Congress government in Chhattisgarh. In the viral photo, Deo, who is much older to Gandhi, is seen bowing to touch his feet.

A Facebook page, 'India against Presstitudes', posted this photograph with a message: ""48-year-old senior blessing his 80-year-old junior. My friend Pappu ji is kind"".

Thousands of people shared this post and hundreds commented on it, attacking Rahul and the Congress culture. Many people even doubted if the picture was photoshopped.

India Today's Fact Check team found that the photograph is real. Chhattisgarh minister TS Singh Deo did indeed bow in front of Rahul.

Other Facebook pages like 'Social Tamasha', 'I support Modi Ji and BJP' also carried this picture with various captions hitting out at the Congress president.

In the photograph, one can see a grey-haired man bowing in front of Rahul. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is also standing beside Rahul with a bouquet in hand on the red carpet. Senior Congress leader RPN Singh can also be seen in the crowd.

India Today TV spoke to TS Singh Deo to check the claims made on social media regarding the photograph. He confirmed that this is the venue of the swearing-in ceremony on December 17 and he was present there when Rahul Gandhi arrived. However he did not try to touch Rahul's feet and only shook hands. According to him, the photo is morphed.

But at the same time, Deo himself admitted that he has a habit of taking the blessings of senior party leaders by touching their feet on special occasions irrespective of their age.

""On that day too, I touched feet of the guests sitting on the dais after the oath taking,"" said Singh Deo. ""Just after my taking oath as a minister, I even tried to touch Rahul Gandhi's feet on the dais but he stopped me from doing it,"" he added.

Singh Deo indeed touched the feet of the guests on the dais and Rahul Gandhi stopped him; this can be seen in this video.

We could not find any supporting video which would have clearly established the sequence of events captured in the viral photo. But we could also not find any evidence to support the claim of Deo that the picture is morphed.

Moreover, when we pressed upon Deo to describe clearly what had happened at that moment, he gave self-contradictory statements. He even talked about picking up a napkin lying on the floor. But no such napkin is visible in the photo.

Looking closely at the photo, we observed that the shadows were aligned perfectly with the characters, hinting that the image is real.

Rajasthan Patrika, a local newspaper, also carried this viral photo claiming that the minister was actually trying to pick up a thread hanging loosely on the floor from the bouquet in Manmohan Singh's hands. But it can be seen that the thread hanging from the bouquet is nowhere close to the floor. Moreover, Singh Deo is bowing in front of Rahul Gandhi and not Manmohan Singh who is standing few steps away.

We also spoke to Congress leader RPN Singh, who was also present with Rahul. He confirmed that Singh Deo tried to touch Rahul's feet at the entrance but the Congress chief stopped him midway.

"340","","CLAIM

A viral photo on social media claims that senior Congress leader TS Singh Deo fell at the feet of Congress President Rahul Gandhi soon after taking oath as a cabinet minister in the newly-formed Congress government in Chhattisgarh.

In the picture, Singh Deo is seen bending near Gandhi's feet as Manmohan Singh and other leaders look on.

The photo has gone viral on several Facebook pages related to the BJP and PM Narendra Modi, with the message ""48 साल का युवा 78 साल के बुजुर्ग को आशीर्वाद देते हुए""

The photo was also shared by several other pages like Post Card Fans, My Prime Minister Modi, Social Tamasha and I Support Modi Ji and BJP.

TRUE OR FALSE?

Well, the claim is false on two points. Firstly, he is not 78 years old, as claimed in the message accompanying the photo. Born in 1952, Singh Deo is currently 67 years old, as recorded in the affidavit filed by him for the state Assembly elections.

Secondly, while the photo certainly seems as though the senior leader was falling at the Congress scion's feet, it apparently was not so.

A senior journalist based out of Raipur, who incidentally was at the oath-talking ceremony, confirmed to The Quint that Singh Deo had not bent down to touch Gandhi's feet. In fact, the story is quite different.

""I was there when this particular incident happened, Singh Deo had bent down not to touch Gandhi's feet, but to pick up a piece of thread that had fallen off the bouquet that Manmohan Singh was carrying. He definitely did not fall at Gandhi's feet.""Senior journalist to The Quint

Rajasthan Patrika, too, carried the viral photo with a small caption explaining the incident.

The daily had also zoomed into the photo to show the piece of thread that had fallen near Gandhi's feet.

BHUPESH BAGHEL SWORN IN AS CM

The new cabinet in Chhattisgarh was sworn in on Monday, 17 December, with Bhupesh Bagehl taking the mantle as chief minister. Senior leaders Tamradhwaj Sahu and TS Singh Deo were sworn in as ministers.

The party has not appointed any deputy chief minister for the state.

The Congress won a two-thirds majority in Chhattisgarh, bagging 68 seats. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came second with only 15 seats, and Mayawati-Ajit Jogi's JCC+ alliance managed to win in 7 constituencies.

"341","","Chhattisgarh Ministers T.S. Singh Deo is likely to get the key portfolio of Finance and and Tamradhwaj Sahu either Agriculture or Public Works. The allocation of portfolios in the Bhupesh Baghel Cabinet is expected to be completed by December 24, Congress sources say.

Mr. Baghel is expected to meet Congress president Rahul Gandhi soon to discuss the allocation, said a Congress leader, who did not wish to be identified. Mr. Deo and Mr. Sahu, who had earlier been in the reckoning for the top job in the State, were sworn in along with Mr. Baghel on Monday.

A day after pictures of the beaming trio holding hands with Mr. Gandhi were broadcast from Raipur, the jockeying for the meaty assignments has begun.

According to party officials, Mr. Deo had made it clear that having missed out on the top post, he should be given the Finance portfolio, which would enable him to influence key policies. The former Leader of the Opposition is considered the brain behind the party's manifesto, or Jan Ghoshna Patra, which promised a farm loan waiver and a minimum support price of ₹2,500 a quintal for paddy.

Mr. Sahu, who belongs to the dominant Sahu community, an OBC caste, could get either Agriculture or the Public Works portfolio, a party leader said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Mr. Sahu, who had earlier been seen by some as a favourite of the party's leaders in Delhi, lost out after Mr. Baghel, Mr. Deo and former Chattisgarh Pradesh Congress Committee chief Charan Das Mahant all opposed his candidature, party leaders said. A miffed Mr. Sahu had walked out of the meeting before being placated by the party leadership, the sources said. The idea of having Mr. Deo and Mr. Sahu share the top job, with each occupying the post for two-and-a-half years, was also briefly considered before being dropped as many felt that it would send out a wrong message, especially after the Congress had won such a decisive mandate.

Within hours of taking the reins on Monday, the Congress government cleared a waiver of farm loans amounting to ₹6,100 crore which would help over 16 lakh farmers. It also announced the promised support price for paddy and a decision to set up a special investigation team to probe the Maoist ambush of 2013 in the Jiram Valley, in which the party's top leaders in the State were all killed.","T.S.

He directed the Chief Education Officer and Principals of various degree colleges of the district to sensitize students regarding addition, deletion, correction and transposition of names in voter lists. He also asked for providing data of students with disabilities studying in higher classes so that required facilities can be provided to them at polling centers.

DEO asked ACD to seek cooperation of newly elected Panchs and Sarpanchs in creating awareness on SSR with respect to 1st January 2019 as qualifying date. He asked the District Youth Services and Sports Department to generate mass awareness on SSR during Khelo India Programmes and other sports activities. He also advised the EROs and AEROs to monitor the disposal of claims on daily basis.

Dy DEO, Chand Kishore Sharma, informed the meeting that ELC is a platform to engage school and college students through interesting activities and hands-on experience to sensitize them on their electoral rights and familiarize them with the electoral process of registration and voting besides developing a culture of electoral participation.

He said that ELCs shall have no association with any political party or political group and none of the ELC activities should involve partisan forces in any form.

"346","","""Organisation man"" Bhupesh Baghel has finally been chosen over the ""manifesto man"" Tribhuvaneshwar Saran Singh Deo as the new chief minister of Chhattisgarh.

After four days of protracted deliberations and brainstorming, Congress president Rahul Gandhi finally took the decision on who the chief minister should be. The announcement was made in Raipur on Sunday afternoon.

Baghel's rise in state politics began almost five years ago, after the top leadership of the Chhattisgarh Congress was wiped out in a Maoist attack at Jhiram Ghati in Bastar on 25 May, 2013.

The Ajit Jogi-led Congress had lost to the BJP in the 2003 Assembly election. Thereafter, the party also lost the elections in 2008 and 2013, which weakened the organisation deeply.

Baghel's first challenge after taking over as Chhattisgarh Congress chief four years ago was to consolidate the faction-ridden party and strengthen it at the grassroots level. It was certainly a tough task, especially when the BJP had been wielding immense power at the Centre and in the state.

After the election results were announced on 11 December, Rahul sought a referendum through an app called 'Shakti' - a unique experiment of sorts in Chhattisgarh. Nearly two lakh party workers, including the newly-elected legislators, received a pre-recorded call from Rahul seeking their choice for a chief ministerial candidate.

According to sources, Singh Deo was earlier ahead of Baghel in the race for the post of chief minister. However, after a meeting of the Congress' top leadership in Delhi, followed by a meeting of the Congress Legislative Party, the party zeroed in on Baghel's name.

Factors in favour of Baghel

Baghel, the 57-year-old MLA from Patan, was deputy leader of Opposition in the Chhattisgarh assembly. He belongs to the Kurmi caste, which is considered a backward one. He has served as a minister in both the Digvijay Singh and Ajit Jogi cabinets in undivided Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh respectively. After he became president of Chhattisgarh Congress in October 2014, he toured the state on foot and tried to revive the Congress at the organisational level.

Even when he was a minister in the Ajit Jogi government, he had been a strong critic of Jogi, and the two never got along well. After Jogi quit the Congress and became its most bitter critic, the party leadership wanted someone to take both Jogi and the ruling Raman Singh government head on. Baghel was believed to be the right choice.

Baghel is known for his aggressive style of leadership, which has also attracted criticism from a section of party workers. However, this warrior-like image helped him to take the party to victory. The Congress got a landslide victory by winning 68 seats in the 90-member Assembly, while the BJP got only 15 seats.

Baghel had been in jail for 14 days on charges of circulating a ""sex CD"" involving a senior minister in the Raman Singh government. The BJP claimed that the CD was a fabricated one. However, the issue boomeranged against the saffron party, as the jail term became a factor in favour of Baghel.

While Baghel has been a minister, he also has age on his side. He is younger than Singh Deo and another contender, Tamradhwaj Sahu.

""Baghel's strong anti-establishment image, and his agitations over agrarian issues and rural distress, acted in his favour. He has been vocal against the RSS-BJP combine and has exposed corruption in the Raman Singh government. With strong secular credentials, he led the Congress' fight against the BJP,"" Ruchir Garg, a former senior journalist who joined Chhattisgarh Congress before the polls, told Firstpost.

Garg added, ""As he has strong organisational skills, he consolidated the Congress in Chhattisgarh and acted against anti-party people.""

However, the role of TS Singh Deo in the Congress' performance cannot be undermined. The party's manifesto, considered unique among such documents presented by the party in other states, played a pivotal role in the party's landslide victory.

Singh Deo, 66, popularly known as 'TS Baba"" across the state, was the Leader of Opposition in the Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly, and represents Ambikapur.

According to party sources, Rahul hailed the manifesto as a unique experiment and asked his research and analytics team to study and replicate it for the 2019 general election.

""Prior to the drafting of the manifesto, party leaders went to the masses and understood their hopes and aspirations, before coming out with a list of the ""doable"" promises in their manifesto. This ensured that no section of the society was left uncared for. It also ensured that the chances of the party defaulting on its promises were less,"" Chhattisgarh-based political commentator Parivesh Mishra said.

""Often, the drafting of a party manifesto is given low priority, and is done behind closed doors. Many promises are left unfulfilled. However, the Congress' Vachan Patra this time had short and long-term goals, with deadlines,"" he added.

The third contender, Tamradhwaj Sahu (69), the only Lok Sabha MP from Chhattisgarh, is known as Rahul's Man Friday. However, after the result of the survey of the ""Shakti"" app came out, his name was all but ruled out as a chief minsiterial candidate. According to political analysts, Sahu's candidature for the chief minister's post came up quite late.

"354","","HYDERABAD: After the state school education cracked the whip on the institute for charging exorbitant fee -- apart from violating other rules -- Delhi Public School, Mahendra Hills has now slashed its fee by more than half, for the 2019-20 academic year.

In a letter submitted to the district education officer (DEO), Hyderabad, the management stated that the revision has been rolled out keeping with government orders that stipulate schools to adhere by a fixed structure for fee, teachers' salaries and other expenses. Accordingly, the school that was charging kindergarten students ?1.22 lakh per year, will now charge ?57,100 per child. For students in Classes 1 to 4, the revised fee is ?61,600 while for those in Classes 5 to 7 it is ?66,000 per year.

""While we received complaints against four schools, this particular school was found violating norms mentioned in GO Ms No. 1. As per the order, a school should spend at least 50% of the fee on teachers' salaries and 15% on maintenance. However, in this case, the school was spending less than 50% of the fee on teachers and were found allocating more for maintenance,"" said B Venkata Narasamma, DEO, Hyderabad. She said that these discrepancies came to the fore during an enquiry conducted on DPS, Mahendra Hills.

Among other illegalities, the school was also found fleecing students who did not opt for extra-curricular activities. ""If a school is providing activities like swimming, dancing or sports, it cannot add that amount to the fee of all students. The fee should be different for those signing up for them and those who aren't,"" Narasamma added.

Apart from being pulled up by the DEO, the school management also had a case filed against them by activist Vijay Gopal who dragged several schools to the court for charging exorbitant fees.

Speaking about the recent revision, Gopal said: ""Now that the school has accepted its fault, as per rules mentioned in the education act, the management must face a minimum punishment of three years in jail. Also, they must be forced to return the excess fee, to parents, collected over the last decade or so.""

He maintained that the ongoing case will not be dropped just because the school has slashed the fee.

""Once the management of this particular school is awarded jail term, all the other erring schools will fall in line,"" Gopal said, adding, ""if the verdict in the lower court is in favour of the school, I will approach the high court to get justice.""","DPS slashes fee by over 50% after DEO cracks whip - Times of India","1019000739","2018-12-15","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/dps-slashes-fee-by-over-50-after-deo-cracks-whip/articleshow/67101185.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

Besides Deo, Chhattisgarh Congress chief Bhupesh Baghel, Charan Das Mahant and Tamradhwaj Sahu were in contention for the top job of state where Congress wrested power from the BJP after 15 years.

Gandhi had last night deferred the decisions on chief minister of Chhattisgarh as he wanted to hold discussions with prominent party leaders of the state.

Last evening, Gandhi held a meeting with the party's central observer for Chhattisgarh Mallikarjun Kharge. AICC in-charge of party affairs in Chhattisgarh P L Punia was also present in the meeting.

"356","","NEW DELHI: Amid hectic lobbying in the Congress for the top post in Chhattisgarh, party president Rahul Gandhi will hold deliberations at his residence after which the names of the chief ministers would be declared today. The flight of Air India in which the three CM contenders Bhupesh Baghel, TS Singh Deo and Charan Das Mahant were going to Delhi, was diverted to Nagpur due to flight fog.

All eyes now were on party president Rahul Gandhi's choice of chief ministers of the state and ABP News sources say that T S Singhdeo is likely to be the next CM of the state. Singhdeo was the main architect of the Congress party's poll manifesto, which he said was made after feedback from about 80,000 people from across the state. It was this manifesto, especially the promises relating to farmers, that many believe became a game-changer in the party's bid to dislodge a populist chief minister.

Belying predictions of exit polls, the Congress won convincingly in Chattisgarh where T S Singhdeo was given the job of mobilising backward community voters who had largely favoured the BJP in the last 2013 polls. In Chattisgarh, the other contenders for the CM post are Lok Sabha member Tamradhwaj Sahu, who won the Durg Rural seat, state party chief Bhupesh Baghel, but Sahu's non-controversial and clean image goes in his favour, some party leaders said.

The Congress victory in Chhattisgarh ended the 15-year rule of the Raman Singh-led Bharatiya Janata Party government. It won 68 seats in the 90-member Assembly, far more than the 46 required to form the government, while the BJP got only 15 seats. After the result, BJP's Raman Singh submitted his resignation to Governor Anandiben Patel and said he accepts responsibility for BJP's poor showing.

The party high command has summoned senior leaders of state unit including TS Singh Deo, Bhupesh Baghel and Charan Das Mahant to Delhi on Friday.

These leaders are likely to meet Congress President Rahul Gandhi after which a formal announcement about the new chief minister will be made.

T S Singh Deo and Bhupesh Patel are said to be among the top contenders for the CM post.

In Chhattisgarh, some scuffles took place outside the residence of state party chief Bhupesh Baghel (57), who is one of the contenders apart from leader of opposition in outgoing assembly T S Singh Deo (66), OBC leader Tamradhwaj Sahu (69) and party veteran Charan Das Mahant (64).

Mallikarjun Kharge, the central observer for the state, and the AICC state in-charge P L Punia briefed Gandhi late on Thursday night about views of the state's party MLAs. But a decision is expected only on Friday after Gandhi meets the top contenders for the chief ministerial position.

"362","","Confusing signals are emerging from Chhattisgarh for the post of chief minister. The Congress has not come up with a clear choice yet, even after the referendum party chief Rahul Gandhi had sought on Wednesday through an app called 'Shakti'. A unique experiment of sorts, more than three lakh party workers, including elected Congress candidates, received a pre-recorded call from Rahul seeking their choice for a chief ministerial candidate for Chhattisgarh.

After hectic parleys at Hotel Babylon in state capital Raipur on Wednesday, two names emerged on the basis of the referendum through 'Shakti' and a meeting of the Congress Legislative Party in the presence of central observer and senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge. According to party sources, between former Leader of Opposition in the Chhattisgarh Assembly TS Singh Deo and Chhattisgarh Congress chief Bhupesh Baghel, the former is the front-runner for the chief minister's post at present. However, the party hasn't announced the name and is waiting for Rahul to take the final call.

""At our end, we conveyed our decision regarding the chief ministerial candidate. Unlike Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, we don't have a national-level leader for the post, so there's no debate over selection. Now the final decision will be made in Delhi by the party president,"" a Chhattisgarh Congress party source told Firstpost.

File photo of Congress leader TS Singh Deo.

Similar to Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the supporters of the two contenders for the office of the Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh have now got into clashes over the issue of ""Kaun Banega Mukhyamantri"" (who will be the chief minister).

Outside Baghel's house in Raipur, the Chhattisgarh Congress chief's supporters got into a brawl with Deo's backers on Thursday. Even in Madhya Pradesh capital Bhopal, supporters of Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia gathered at Indira Bhawan -- the Pradesh Congress Committee headquarters -- with large cut-outs and posters, shouting slogans in Scindia's favour and demanding his appointment as the chief minister.

Chhattisgarh is the only state among the three that the Congress won where Rahul used the 'Shakti' app to know party workers' choice of chief minister. Project Shakti is an internal digital platform of the party that aims to link all Congress workers countrywide with party president.

So finally, who is likely to be the Chhattisgarh chief minister? Let's look at the choices.

Tribhuvaneshwar Saran Singh Deo, popularly known as ""TS Baba"" across the state, is the Leader of Opposition in the Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly, representing the Ambikapur constituency. A scion of the famous Surguja princely state and son of former chief secretary of undivided Madhya Pradesh MS Singh Deo, the 66-year-old exercises strong influence and popularity in Surguja, which attests to the fact that of the eight Assembly seats in the district, the Congress had won seven in the last election.

Pros: TS Singh Deo is suave and articulate. According to sources, most Chhattisgarh Congress party workers favoured his candidature over Baghel's in both the Shakti referendum and at the Congress Legislative Party meeting. Deo was also the brain behind the Chhattisgarh Congress manifesto, which was considered unique among the five manifestos the party released ahead of the Assembly elections.

""During the making of this manifesto, TS Singh Deo extended his reach to beyond Congress workers. He met every section of the society across the state, discussed issues with them, took their feedback and incorporated them in the manifesto. This exercise helped him get connected with as many voters as possible in Chhattisgarh and made him popular simultaneously. This manifesto, which has been hailed as a unique experiment by Rahul Gandhi, proved to be a game-changer in this election,"" political commentator Parivesh Mishra told Firstpost.

Con: His business ties with a big business house can prove to be a handicap, as some party workers pointed out. ""There can be conflict of interest with our party line,"" an elected member said on condition of anonymity.

Bhupesh Baghel, an MLA from Patan, was the deputy Leader of Opposition in the Chhattisgarh Assembly. A backward-class leader (Kurmi), the 57-year-old has served as minister in both Digvijaya Singh and Ajit Jogi's cabinets in undivided Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Active in social reform works, Baghel toured Chhattisgarh on foot before the elections and tried to revive the Congress at the organisational level.

File photo of Congress leader Bhupesh Baghel. PTI

Pros: Baghel virtually revived the party and gave shape to a new Congress after becoming Pradesh Congress Committee chief five years ago. He has strong organisational skills and is a more grassroots party worker in comparison. He actively campaigned across Chhattisgarh this election.

Con: According to insiders, Baghel's leadership style is not acceptable to many workers in the faction-ridden party in the state. His name had emerged in the alleged case of sleaze CDs involving a senior minister in the Raman Singh government ahead of the election. A special CBI court had sent him to 14-day judicial custody in the case.

Two other leaders, Tamradhwaj Sahu and Charandas Mahant, who were earlier in the fray for the Chhattisgarh chief minister's chair, are now apparently out of the race.

A 66-year-old Lok Sabha MP from Durg and a leader of the Sahu community, which has a sizeable presence in Chhattisgarh among Other Backward Classes, Sahu is now a fence-sitter. ""In case the Congress top leadership disagrees on Deo and Baghel, Sahu may become the chief minister. But the chances are bleak,"" a party leader said.

While finalising the candidate for the Chhattisgarh chief minister's post, the party leadership also has to consider who can play a pivotal role in maximising the party's tally in Chhattisgarh and mobilise resources in the run-up to the 2019 general elections. Besides, the party also has to fulfil the promises it made to voters in the state ahead of the polls.

Although it was initially believed that selecting the Chhattisgarh chief minister would be a comparatively easy task for the Congress, unlike in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, it seems that it's going to be another tight-rope walk for Rahul.

""Chhattisgarh has given a thumping majority to the Congress, ending the three-term rule of Bharatiya Janata Party's Dr Raman Singh. Although pollsters had predicted a tight contest, it eventually turned out to be one-sided, with the BJP losing a significant percentage (8%+) of its votes in the state. The 'Third Front', led by Ajit Jogi's Chhattisgarh Janata Congress (JCC) with ally Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), which was tipped to eat into the Congress vote share, seems to have damaged the prospects of the BJP more than the Congress.

"366","","Did the anti-BJP sentiment and not really pro-Congress mood help your party?

This clearly was a vote for the Congress. BJP has been routed because the Congress presented a very acceptable and clear option. The people of Chhattisgarh did not give a negative vote against any party.

Mankind has not only reached the moon and we have gone even beyond. And we have only made practical promises. We are looking at roughly a budget of Rs 1 lakh crore. We will obviously have to look at ways to generate additional revenue, cut expenses and prioritise. It is difficult but doable and will be done.

Obviously, Narendra Modi's magic didn't work, they did not even cross 20 seats. And Raman Singh, nice guy, a smiling face. He had been in power for 15 years and in all these years nothing really stuck to him. There were talks but still nothing stuck to him. But his own victory margin came down. Obviously, they were on a back foot. But such a massive victory, not only in terms of number of MLAs but in amount of vote share shows that it is the people's victory. And that our (Congress) president Rahul Gandhi managed to connect to the people.

In every election in the State the margin between Congress and BJP has never gone above 2 per cent. But at the same time, in Lok Sabha elections, which are usually held 4-6 months after the State Assembly polls, the margin widens. So obviously whichever party wins the State also impacts the Lok Sabha outcome too.

And more importantly, a chain has been formed in the Hindi heartland. Out of 65 seats in three States (Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan) Congress only had five seats here. Even if we were to hand over half of the 65 seats to BJP it will no longer be in majority in the Lok Sabha.","Positive vote for Congress, not negative vote for BJP, says T.S.

This time, the coalition between Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), former chief minister Ajit Jogi's Janata Congress Chhattisgarh and Communist Party of India (CPI) added another dimension to the poll politics of Chhattisgarh, which has always been dominated by the BJP and the Congress.

This time, the coalition between Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), former chief minister Ajit Jogi's Janata Congress Chhattisgarh and Communist Party of India (CPI) added another dimension to the poll politics of Chhattisgarh, which has always been dominated by the BJP and the Congress.

Several exit polls have predicted a neck-and-neck fight between the big two.

Of the 90 Assembly segments, 51 are for the general category while 10 segments are reserved for Scheduled Castes and 29 for Scheduled Tribes.

"377","","Amidst speculation of probable post-poll alliance among political parties, senior Congress leader T S Singh Deo has said there was no need to ""look left or right"" for any support and his party will form the government in Chhattisgarh on its own.

His comments assume significance as there have been reports of post-poll alliances among different political parties, even before the results are announced.

While Chhattisgarh went to polls in two phases on November 12 for 18 seats and on November 20 for 72 seats, the counting of votes is scheduled for December 11 along with the same for four other states including neighbouring Madhya Pradesh.

""I am confident of victory. We are getting a clear majority. There is no need to look left or right (for any support or post-poll alliance),"" Singh Deo told PTI.

He was asked whether his party would accept support from former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Ajit Jogi in case it lacks numbers to form the government.

""There has been a misrule in the BJP's tenure. Corruption has gone up in all the government departments. Farmers in particular are in a lot of distress. That is the reason why people came out in large numbers to vote against the BJP government,"" said Singh Deo, Leader of Opposition in the Assembly.

The BJP's Raman Singh has been the CM of the state for past 15 years.

Voter turnout of 76.35 per cent was recorded in the Chhattisgarh Assembly election, a little less than the 77.4 per cent in the 2013 polls.

Talking about the Congress party's poll manifesto, which is also called as the 'Jan Ghoshana Patra', Singh Deo said feedback from the people living in almost all the districts of the state were taken into account as part of the planning process.

""It took six long months for our teams to visit whole state and to record feedback in our party's manifesto. We consulted over 80,000 people. We have offered availability of water, electricity subsidy and good price of farmers produce to address farmers distress in the state apparently due to the government's apathy.

""Farmers and people from rural areas came out in large numbers to vote against the BJP government in the state. It will bring result,"" another senior Congress leader said.

When asked who would be their CM candidate in case the Congress comes to power in Chhattisgarh, he said winnig MLAs will choose their leader and the chief minister would be decided by the party high command in Delhi.

Earlier, talking to PTI, Singh Deo had said the chief minister's face of the Congress will be elected through ""Swayamvar"" after the poll results are announced.

Edited excerpts:

How do see the 2018 assembly elections? Can your party form the next government?

We are wining this election. Sometimes there is a sense of undercurrent -- where there is a movement towards you -- but I am seeing a wave. There is a great sense of dissatisfaction that has transformed into wave to remove BJP.

Former Congress CM Ajit Jogi has formed the Janata Congress Chhattisgarh and now contesting in an alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party. What impact will he make?

Jogi was given a golden opportunity by Sonia [Gandhi] ji and the Congress leadership. He had only two MLAs with him when the state was formed. Jogi was seen as a capable person to rule the state, but he lost his chance. He wanted to create his own team, resulting in groupism. This led to the Congress losing the election. We are happy that Jogi is not with the Congress because he was sabotaging the party and helping the BJP.

Do you think Jogi can go with the BJP?

He is with the BJP; he is working for the BJP. But the Congress is getting a clear majority this time.

Who will be the CM if the Congress wins Chhattisgarh?

We have many faces. Two months ago, we met Rahul [Gandhi] ji along with other senior Congress leaders where it was decided that we will fight this election without any face. In Uttar Pradesh, BJP had not projected anyone and bagged 80% seats.

What will be Congress strategy in case we get a hung assembly?

We will certainly not join hands with Ajit Jogi. We will go back to people. If we can't fight an election with him, how can we form a government? We have responsibility towards people ...Coming back is power is not the sole criteria.

It is said that even after being in power for 15 years, Raman Singh is seen a reliable and trusted face. Do you agree?

It may have been so in 2008 but not now because Raman Singh did not fulfil his poll promises. His schemes are not working, electricity situation is bad, and all this has affected his image.

What about the infighting in the state unit of the Congress?

I don't think there is infighting in the Congress in Chhattisgarh. Nobody talks about the infighting in the BJP. Isn't there a fight between Raman Singh and [agriculture minister] Brijmohan Agarwal? Everyone knows who leaked documents showing Agarwal in bad light. And documents regarding scams by Raman Singh are also being leaked.

"388","","Leader of the Opposition in Chhattisgarh Assembly, TS Singh Deo, in an interview discussed Congress' policy regarding tribals in the upcoming Assembly election. MLA from Ambikapur constituency since 2008, Deo is touted as one of the frontrunners to be the chief ministerial picks if Congress comes to power. In a detailed conversation with Parth MN, Deo spoke about the need to improve the standard of living of tribals. He criticised the Raman Singh government for prioritising corporate interests over tribals, alleging that the BJP-led government has neglected their interests, which has resulted in an economic mismatch in Chhattisgarh. Popularly known as TS Baba, Deo, who belongs to the royal family, condemned the arrest of Sudha Bharadwaj, who has lived in Chhattisgarh almost all her life.

Edited excerpts from the interview

If the Congress comes to power in Chhattisgarh, what would be your policy regarding the tribals, who form a major population of the state?

Tribals form about 31 percent of the population in Chhattisgarh. Their population has reduced by 1 percent in the last census. They live mostly in jungle areas, which is less productive as far as the agriculture is concerned. So the main concern for their development is to provide them with means of livelihood other than agriculture.

Which would be?

Their natural habitat is the forest. So, one could be forest produce, two could be tourism, third could be handicrafts, fourth could be their rights in mining areas which they have been denied, and government jobs. The idea is to provide a better standard of living. If you make a road, it is of no consequence unless it improves your standard of living. If you make a school, it is of no use unless it improves the standard of living. It's important for them to make the best of the environment they live in. If you are bringing in industry and it is not providing jobs to them, if you are doing mining activity and they don't have any share of it, it is of no consequence. For example, in Kondagaon, they told me there are around 70,000-80,000 people engaged in cottage industry where they make gun metal statues. I met the workers during the process of making the people's manifesto. And one could see very easily where they are falling behind. There are middlemen who help the tribal with the raw material, and for their profit margins to be higher, they sell the finished good at a price lower than the market price. The tribals complained regarding the handicraft corporation which has been formed. There, too, it is a matter of commission mongering. There is a large market for such products, which are of interest and value to the people within the country and even to export markets. Unfortunately, no government has thought of pushing them in a big way.

You said tribal population has decreased by one percent. What is the reason?

The survey was not done in 100 villages, so it could mean that 500 people in a village on an average, which is 50,000. It is not a small number. Several groups are migrating because of pressure from the Naxals and lack of employment in the state, among other things. Other reason could also be the rise in the number of people coming from outside the state. Reasons behind falling percent in the number of tribals in the state are mostly migration out of tribal areas and migration into Chhattisgarh. There is no proof to conclude that drop in birth rate is the reason.

What are the policies of the Raman Singh government regarding the tribals which you particularly object to?

It is basically neglect. There is a sense of complacency in the current government -- no matter what happens, we win. There is a lot of bureaucracy in the ruling government and Raman Singh is completely dependent on that. So long as they are delivering him a government, election after election, Raman Singh has left Chhattisgarh to be managed by the bureaucrats.

Has the tribal situation worsened in the past 15 years?

Chhattisgarh has the highest percentage of BPL families in the country. At least, 39.93 percent is the reserve bank figure for average BPL families - urban and rural combined - for Chhattisgarh. It is the highest in the country. For a state that is supposed to be developing, something is going wrong. If the per capita income has crossed 90,000 and your family is an average of 4.53. By that calculation a family in Chhattisgarh should earn 4.5 lakh rupees. Tribals aren't earning even close to it. It basically indicates that a few people are earning a lot and the tribals are marginalised. If you are able to project the per capita is increasing, where is the money going?

Tribals are angry with Raman Singh for opening up their forests to the private players. How do you plan to manage them if you come to power?

Whether they are tribals or non-tribals, so long as they are residents of Chhattisgarh, you should target those reserves that displace the least. Secondly, if you are saying that in the next coming years, you are going to change the technology to non-traditional means of production of electricity, that is non-coal based electricity, you are not going to need coal. If you don't need all of this coal, where does it reside? If this coal resides in tribal areas only, then you don't have an option. But if there is coal in non-tribal areas, where the land could be more expensive, then the government is duty bound not to help the industry by getting cheaper land, which is forest and tribal land, in comparison to the land that may be more expensive but lie in non-tribal areas.

How do you plan to correct that?

Don't allot it to them.

Would it be as easy?

Yes, if you have the will. Lemru is an area between Surguja and Korba. It is a forest area of 450 square kilometers. This government had itself projected it as an elephant reserve. The UPA government had approved it. After the approval, Raman Singh government stalled it because they wanted to give it for mining. In our manifesto, we have included that areas like Lemru would be de-reserved for coal block allocation.

When I met the youth in tribal areas, they weren't exactly averse to industries. But they didn't trust the state and corporations coming in and working in their areas. They didn't trust them to provide adequate rehabilitation and compensation policies.

The section of society that is most opposed to land being taken over are the women. They are most opposed to being uprooted. Because, socially, they are the most affected and they are also the most exploited lot -- their lifestyle changes completely. They feel alientated. Then you have the male members, who go by how much will they get and what will they get. Then there is the youth -- after studying and switching over to wearing jeans, how many would like to till the land? They are looking for a different way of life. It is influenced by what they see on TV, or when they go to cities.

Social media has played a role in it?

Yes. The youth is not averse to land being taken. Yet, the rights of the landowners should have priority. The new land acquisition act requires 70-80 percent of the landowners.

But the biggest gripe of tribals is that the Forest Rights Act is not enforced and the consent is often ignored or forged.

We change that by governing better.

After having endured exploitation, there are several people who feel no matter who comes to power, the bureaucracy remains by and large the same.

We would like to believe that we are the kind of team that changes that.

There is an argument that the adivasis are torn between Naxals and police. How do plan to combat it?

When people use force to get power, then people will be seen standing behind whoever is in power and dominant. Historically, entire population never rebels. Eventually, the tendency is to accept whoever is stronger. In the Naxal area, whoever is seen to be stronger, will be able to subdue the population. The question is do people want to be with the Naxals or do they stand with the State? They would just want to be free. They do not like any pressure from anybody in their day to day lives. Basic nature of a tribal is independence. Among the adivasis, discontent begins when they are falsely accused of being Naxals, jailed for three-four years and then let off over lack of evidence.

Secondly, if Naxals or other organisations, that have the means to be dominant in that area, and are able to have their presence felt, why would people be listening to them? Either it is genuine support, where people feel the Constitution is a piece of paper worth nothing. I don't think that's what the people of Chhattisgarh think. Those villagers, who aren't fully educated, don't understand the matters of state or Constitution. It is a matter of making your dominance in an area through the ideology that you purport to believe in, using force to create dominance, and using people either as supporters - genuine or under pressure - or because you want to use them as shields. The informer is the target number one, not the exploiter. Had the exploiter been the target, we would have felt they are ideologically inclined.

You mentioned how the people are jailed and then let off for no proof. Sudha Bharadwaj has lived almost all her life in Chhattisgarh. She is in jail. What do you have to say about her arrest?

I have met her on a number of occasions. And she is a committed lady. Committed to the cause of those in need. She has given up better options in her career. The government does not have proof, and it is just trying to create pressure because somebody doesn't agree with what they are saying. No state organisation can make false charges against people to make their ends meet. She is an honest woman of high morale and ethical values. These are the people we need. If she has Maoist links, bring them out. What are you waiting for?

"390","","Speaking at Democracy Wall, the Biju Janata Dal leader said he strongly opposed criminal defamation.

New Delhi: Biju Janata Dal (BJD) leader Kalikesh Narayan Singh Deo Friday said he strongly opposed criminal defamation and that nobody should be arrested on the basis of what they think.

Deo's comments on free speech come in the backdrop of the arrest of Right-leaning defence analyst Abhijit Iyer-Mitra over a joke by the BJD-led Odisha government.

Speaking about the right to free speech, he said, ""The government has no right to tell us what we should eat, wear or how we should behave in our bedrooms.""

Deo was in conversation with ThePrint's National and Strategic Affairs Editor Jyoti Malhotra at the twelfth edition of Democracy Wall.

Democracy Wall is a monthly free speech campus initiative organised by ThePrint in collaboration with Facebook. The event at Xavier University Bhubaneswar, Odisha, also featured actor Nandita Das, stand-up comedian Rajneesh Kapoor and rap artist Big Deal.

Speaking about the Ram Temple issue in Ayodhya, Deo called the demand baseless and added that if one were to look back at the history of India, even the Aryans would be found to be immigrants.

Deo also encouraged people to look forward and not in the past, adding that a future must be considered for cities instead of renaming them.

Deo called Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) an interesting experiment which ""has now become very mundane like other political parties"".

""It can only be revived if Kejriwal reinvents himself,"" said Deo.

However, he added that the issue of pollution in Delhi really bothered him, and wondered why the AAP-led state government and the Bharatiya Janata Party-led central government are not doing anything about it.

He suggested that pollution in the city could be reduced if all the parties came together and provided Rs 7,000 crore to the farmers of Haryana and Punjab to stop burning crop stubble. He said it worried him that the government has ""Rs 10,000 crore to build statues"" but nothing to deal with the grave issue of pollution.

As the #MeToo movement raged on around the world and in India, the political establishment in the country maintained studious silence. On this, Deo said that politicians are very concerned about their goodwill.

""There are already many people who are waiting for reasons to defame politicians so why would a politician let their reputation to damage,"" he said.

Deo, however, added that he was quite surprised that people in the media kept quiet about the issue of sexual harassment for so long.

Both the BJP and the Congress, in their current avatars, are not suitable enough to run the government, said Deo.

""I think BJP has become increasingly autocratic, it doesn't listen to different voices in India and tries to suppress different voices as they exist today,"" he said.

""They were sitting in the school when five Class IV employees entered the school by jumping the boundary wall. The DEO then called them and asked where they were.

"394","","Related Stories State Polls Not A Referendum On Modi Govt, No Anti-Incumbency In Chhattisgarh: Raman Singh

Even as it battles the ruling BJP's ""poaching prowess"", the Congress veteran and Leader of Opposition T.S. Singh Deo firmly believes Chhattisgarh is all set to end 15 years of the BJP's ""misrule and anti-people"" policies.

Voting in Chhattisgarh will be held in two phases. In the first phase, voting will be held in 18 constituencies in the southern part of the state on November 12, while the second phase of elections will be held on November 20.

""The agrarian crisis, exploitation of tribals and a downward spiraling economy with no jobs are the hallmarks of the Raman Singh government. Reeling under 15-years of misrule, the people, especially farmers and tribals, will vote the Congress to power in the state,"" Singh Deo said in an interview.

Widely considered as one of the party's Chief Ministerial hopefuls, Singh Deo has been leading the Congress campaign in the state that promises complete waiver of farm loans and Rs 2,500 as minimum support price for paddy.

""Under the BJP, Chhattisgarh has consistently been among the top states to account for most number of farm suicides. Annually, more than 1,200 farmers and agriculture labourers end their lives. In fact, the government admitted in Parliament that there have been nearly 2,400 farm suicides between 2014-2016 in the state,"" said Singh Deo, highlighting the deepening crisis in the agriculture sector in the state.

""Its the farmers and tribals who will vote Congress to power,"" said the MLA from Ambikapur.

Notwithstanding Singh Deo's assertions, the Congress is faced with a stiff challenge in the state which, for the first time, will witness a three-way poll battle with arch-rivals Congress and BJP wrestling it out with Mayawati's BSP, which has aligned with the Chhattisgarh Janata Congress of former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi and the CPI.

Still recovering from the snub by Mayawati, the Congress received a jolt when its state working president and prominent tribal face Ramdayal Uike joined the BJP. Soon after Uike switched loyalties, the BJP allegedly approached Chintamani Maharaj, the Congress MLA from Lundra, offering money and a ministerial berth to quit the party.

Since the 2013 Maoist attack that wiped out its top leadership, including then state unit chief Nand Kumar Patel and party veteran Vidya Charan Shukla, the Congress has been facing a leadership crunch that was further compounded in 2016 when Jogi quit to form his own outfit.

Adding to the problems, Congress chief Bhupesh Baghel has been charge-sheeted by the CBI for distributing a pornographic CD allegedly featuring a state minister. He was arrested in September and is now out on bail.

Singh Deo, however, asserted there is no leadership crunch and exuded confidence of the people putting their faith in the Congress.

While the Congress leadership, including President Rahul Gandhi, has refused to read much into Mayawati's alliance with Jogi and the CPI, Singh Deo admitted the BJP's ""poaching prowess"" is a big hurdle.

""The BJP is brazen in using money and muscle power in its bid to decimate the opposition. They have mastered the art of subverting the democratic process. It exposes their political bankruptcy,"" he said, adding that it was good for the Congress to have lost an ""opportunist"" like Uike.

""Going by BJP's way of fighting by by-hook-or-crook, but its the people who would give a befitting reply,"" he said asserting the Congress has been able to reach out to farmers, tribals and the youth who have been the biggest victims of the BJP's ""misrule"".

Asked if the Mayawati-Jogi alliance was a threat to Congress' plans on winning Dalit votes, Singh Deo asserted that both were insignificant players in the state.

""Compared to the Congress securing 40.3 per cent of the vote share and 39 seats in 2013, the BSP got only 4.27 per cent and could win only one seat. Our vote share difference with the BJP (41.04 per cent) was just 0.75 per cent. The people realise that it's only the Congress which is the alternate and they will vote for us. The BSP-Jogi combine is only bidding to hurt our chances,"" he said, asserting that the Congress will come to power with an absolute majority.

Hitting out at the BJP government over the rising Maoist violence, Singh Deo said that bringing the rebels into the mainstream through dialogue and appropriate policies was high on the Congress' agenda.

""Like in other fields, the BJP government has been a complete failure in tackling left- wing extremism. For 15 years, the state has been deprived of any development and even basic amenities like water and roads. Raman Singh is only known for making promises and not fulfilling them. Dialogue with the Maoists and an effective surrender policy will be our way to tackle the issue,"" said Singh Deo.

Polling to the 90-member assembly will be held on November 12 and November 20, with the first phase covering 18 seats, spread across the Maoist-affected districts of Bastar, Bijapur, Dantewada, Sukma, Kondagaon, Kanker, Narayanpur and Rajnandgaon. The second phase will cover the remaining 72 seats.

The Congress has fielded a mix of youth and experience with prominent faces including Baghel, Singh Deo and senior leader Satyanarayan Sharma.

Among the main candidates in the first phase is Devati Karma, widow of former state minister Mahendra Karma and founder of the controversial anti-Maoist Salwa Judum militia.

Besides reaching out to the people at the grassroots, the Congress is actively running a digital campaign to appeal to both urban and rural voters.

Using social media to reach out to the youth, the party has also been targetting voters in the hinterland, particularity farmers and tribals.

""We have been running a campaign called the '15 saal kayi sawaal' (15 years, many questions) across the state, particularly in rural areas, highlighting how the Raman Singh government has paid only lip-service and all its promises to farmers have remained unfulfilled,"" said Naresh Arora who is spearheading the digital campaign.

Dilip Chowdhari, the owner, issued a 'Notice' stating, ""Flat in which late Yeshwant Deo was residing is now in control and possession of landlords of Vandan building, the Chowdharis.

before marriage and they both lived here ever afterwards. Along with the Deos, his brother's son Dnyanesh and his family, too, have been staying here. The landlord didn't even take Dnyanesh or his family into consultation before pasting the eviction notice.

Speaking to the Free Press Journal, Dnyanesh, the nephew, said that it has been a rude shock. ""Just today we immersed my uncle's ashes and I really don't know how they could be so insensitive.

"414","","Mumbai, Oct 4 (IANS) Veteran Indian classical vocalist Rajabhau Deo is the sculptor of her musical upbringing, his daughter and disciple Alka Deo Marulkar said here ahead of her 'khayal vocal recital here on Thursday, adding that he was her first critic to teach her the aesthetic values of the Gwalior, Kirana and Jaipur Gharanas.

""My father and guru, Pt. Rajabhau Deo, was the sculptor of my musical upbringing. He taught me the best aesthetic values of Gwalior, Kirana and Jaipur Gharanas for more than 45 years,"" the vocalist told IANS in an email interview.

""Having your guru as a meticulous father is a matter of advantage, but in this journey my father mostly remained strict. He maintained an excellent balance between my upbringing as a growing child, as a growing student of music, as well as a growing academician,"" she said.

Marulkar, who is also trained in the semi-classical repertoire of the Purab music tradition, also teaches young classical singers in the emotive and fluent styles of Purabi 'thumri' and 'dadra'.

She attributes her association with the Purab genre to her prolonged stays in Varanasi, during which her recitals came to be influenced by this style.

The 67-year-old musician -- entitled ""Gaan Saraswati"" by Chandigarh-based Pracheen Kala Kendra -- feels that newer entrants in the music industry do not tend to be selective about their performances.

""We had a strict discrimination in accepting concerts,"" Marulkar said.

""Now, the number of concerts a performer tends to accept does not allow him to observe himself, self-evaluate his concerts and contemplate on the coming assignments,"" she added.

The Jaipur gharana exponent is also known for her intricate analysis of the 'raags' of Indian classical music.

Along with initiating young singers into music, she demonstrates its subtleties with workshops and lectures in education spaces.

""Music cannot be confined into a syllabus-based teaching plan,"" asserted Marulkar, who says her constant inspirations in her repertoire remain Pt. Siddheshwari Devi, Pt. Girija Devi and Pt. Nirmala Arun.

The musician will be performing the musical forms of 'khayal' and semi-classical compositions at the National Centre for Performing Arts here on Thursday.

"590","","THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Higher Education Department has proposed to implement a specific term for registrars and controller of examinations in all universities in the state aiming to bring a periodical upgradation of varsity proceedings. The proposal is to replicate the four-year tenure of Vice-chancellors.

K T Jaleel, Minister for Higher Education, told Express the proposal was to ensure a periodical development in the system of universities.

""What the government proposes is a system like the tenure of VCs. Right now, the post of registrar and Controller of Examinations does not have any specific time period and it is purely based on the normal service rules. The new proposal could bring a paradigm shift to the higher education sector,"" he said. He also said the new system would be implemented in all universities very soon.

Nomination process will be mandatory for the appointment of VCs

Another major decision is to make the nomination process mandatory in the appointment of Vice-Chancellor in the universities in the state. ""Some universities in the state are following the nomination process to appoint the VC in addition to receiving the job application of the applicant. This has to be replicated in all universities so that an efficient person can become a VC based on the nomination by a set of experts. In short, the priority of appointment of VC will be based on nomination, but we will not scrap the application process,"" the minister said.

Other major recommendations are to change the old pattern of examinations and to make the question papers and answer sheets available online. According to the minister, the authorities are exploring the possibility of informing the examination results to students and parents via mobile phones. The valuation should begin immediately after the examinations. Jaleel made a point to the syndicate members on the recognition of certain courses between the universities in the state.

More emphasis on research

Research facilities in all universities will be strengthened. As part of the first step, a research consortium will be formed soon. The main aim will be to transform the institutions into centres of excellence. A proper co-ordination between universities will be ensured for hassle-free research programmes.","Higher Education Department mulls fixed term for registrars","1018228279","2018-12-14","http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/thiruvananthapuram/2018/dec/14/higher-edu-dept-mulls-fixed-term-for-registrars-1911279.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia Saturday said the exercise of the education department to verify residence proof of school students was aimed at restraining the ""mafia"" involved in admission frauds. His remark came after the Election Commission reportedly asked the AAP government to stop the exercise of collecting voter identification details of families of school students.

Sisodia also said poll panel had no mandate in this matter, even as the Delhi BJP hit out at AAP government and accused it of collecting data for ""political purposes"". ""The education mafia is causing this controversy. The EC's mandate is not to support the BJP's education mafia, but to conduct elections. As long as the voter card is a valid address proof, the EC cannot ask us to stop the exercise,"" the deputy chief minister told reporters.

""During checking it was found that in two schools wrong address proof of children were furnished,"" he said. No children will be removed from the schools but the department is seeking address details, the AAP leader said.

"598","","Aspiring teachers seeking employment in aided schools or junior colleges in the state will now have to take an eligibility and aptitude test conducted by the state education department.

The Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday upheld the validity of section 9 (2A) and (2B) of the Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools (MEPS) (Conditions of Service) Rules, 1981. This makes it mandatory for these institutes to select new teachers from amongst those securing a high rank in the test.

The division bench justices RK Deshpande and Vinay Joshi was hearing three separate petitions filed by educational institutes challenging the provision of the MEPS Rules. They contended that the provision binds the institute's management to appoint teachers only from the merit list prepared by the state education department.

They said this violates the institute's fundamental freedom of selecting candidates of their choice and interferes with the autonomy of the educational institute.

However, HC ruled that the state government was competent to prescribe additional qualifications for the candidates seeking appointment in aided educational institutions.The additional requirement did not interfere with the right of managements to select and appoint qualified and suitable candidates of their choice, the bench said.

The court also added that the additional requirement would help reduce corruption, nepotism, favouritism and other such malpractices while appointing teachers.

However, the court struck down a government resolution related to the provisions, which mandates school management to appoint candidates in order of the merit list prepared by the state department. Institute managements cannot be mandates to appoint teachers strictly per the order of merit list without judging the comparative merit and suitability, said HC.","State aptitude test must for selection of teachers, says  education department ","1002861399","2018-11-25","https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/state-aptitude-test-must-for-selection-of-teachers-says-state-education-department/story-yLBHeJ2Nkrjj0xlL1ArugN.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE
"599","","On Friday, November 16, 2018, the U.S. Department of Education released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding how schools must respond to allegations of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct. The Department's press release and links to the proposed rules are online here.

The proposed rules would apply to elementary, secondary, and postsecondary schools receiving federal financial assistance. This Alert addresses the provisions affecting institutions of higher education.

The current regulations offer almost no detailed standards, providing only that schools must designate a responsible employee and must publish a grievance procedure. Under the Obama Administration, the Department of Education issued a number of guidance documents that seemingly created a wide range of procedural requirements, which led to many lawsuits against institutions of higher education.

Last fall Secretary Betsy DeVos withdrew most of the Obama-era guidance because critics complained that the guidance was not promulgated through proper administrative procedures. The newly released proposed regulations will be considered through the rulemaking requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act and will be open for public comment for 60 days from the date of publication in the Federal Register.

Responding to sexual harassment and sexual misconduct is certainly a crucial priority for all schools. However, the proposed regulations may create a variety of new procedural and technological challenges for colleges and universities. If finalized, these complications could result in difficulties with implementation and potential litigation for years to come. Institutions of higher education may want to take advantage of the opportunity to provide their comments to the Department of Education before the regulations are finalized.

The significant changes would include the following mandates for schools hoping to take advantage of the Department's new safe harbor to avoid a finding of gender discrimination under Title IX. Institutions of higher education would be required to:

In addition, institutions of higher education would be responsible for meeting the burden of proof for responsibility, rather than either the complainant or the respondent (accused). Institutions could choose to meet either the ""clear and convincing evidence standard"" or the ""preponderance of the evidence standard,"" with several caveats. Institutions would be required to use the same standard for determining responsibility both in cases involving complaints against students and in cases involving complaints against employees (including faculty) who are accused of sexual harassment. And institutions would only be permitted to use the preponderance of the evidence standard if the institution uses the same standard for other disciplinary infractions that lead to similar sanctions.

The proposed rules would also impose specific requirements for investigators, including that they receive training, are unbiased, and do not serve as the decision makers who assess the sanctions on respondents. Investigation reports would be mandated to set forth the institutions' procedures in the specific case, including the date the complaint came in, the formal notice that was provided to the parties, and any support measures that were offered. At the opening of the investigation, and prior to the initial interview with the respondent, the institution would have to provide formal notice of the allegations against the respondent with important details and the specific conduct code violations. The notice would have to recite that respondents are presumed not responsible unless found responsible at the conclusion of the grievance process. If the scope of investigation changes and additional charges are added, the investigator must provide additional formal notice. And where the allegations, even if true, would not constitute a violation of the institution's code of conduct, the institution would have to dismiss those allegations.

Further, the investigator would be required to allow each party to gather and present relevant evidence and would be prohibited from advising any party that they should keep the investigation confidential. The investigator would be required to share all evidence with all parties, including inculpatory and exculpatory evidence, and would be required to make the investigation report available to both parties to allow them to have meaningful input prior to any grievance procedure/hearing. Notably, the Department of Education would require that prior to the finalization of the investigation report, the institution must use technology to share all evidence in a format that restricts downloading and copying and allows each party at least ten days to submit a written response.

Schools may welcome some of the many proposed changes, such as allowing institutions to designate informal and formal complaints, thus giving more flexibility in responding to informal complaints. The Department has proposed a new definition of sexual harassment that for the most part aligns with case law. Safe harbors are provided for institutions, so that if a school complies with the proposed regulations regarding formal grievance procedures, its response will not constitute a violation of Title IX. Although prior Department guidance had prohibited mediation for sexual harassment complaints, the proposed rules would allow mediation in some circumstances.

In short, the Department of Education is requesting comments and feedback before these proposed regulations become final. Now is the time to offer your thoughts and suggestions.","United States: Department Of Education Requests Comments On Proposed Title IX Regulations - Schnader Harrison Segal & Lewis LLP","1001365677","2018-11-23","http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/757522/Education/Department%2Bof%2BEducation%2BRequests%2BComments%2Bon%2BProposed%2BTitle%2BIX%2BRegulations","mondaq.com",FALSE

""Not having internal marks in languages and social science will be extremely stressful for students as they would have to write a 100-mark paper.

"605","","The carpool policy initiative of Haryana government is aimed at ensuring that girls do not drop out of schools due to safety concerns.(HT File )

In an initiative aimed at providing a safe travel facility to girl students, the education department has started a carpool policy under which it will reimburse the monthly travel costs incurred by parents or custodians of girls studying in state government schools. Chhatraa Parivahan Suraksha Yojna (safe transport scheme for girls), which came into effect last Friday, applies to girls in Class 9 and above.

Dinesh Shastri, district education officer, said that the initiative was aimed at ensuring that girls did not drop out of school due to safety concerns.

""The purpose of this policy is to ensure that girls get an avenue to reach school safely. We have seen that girls face several obstacles in reaching the school from far-flung villages and other areas. They are also hesitant about going to co-education schools. This scheme seeks to address that issue so that girls can continue going to school without any restrictions,"" said Shastri.

The education department has already apprised different district officers about the initiative through an official circular. Hindustan Times has a copy of the circular. As per the circular, the policy applies only to those girls who live in areas where there is no senior secondary school at the proximity of three kilometres. Girls who have opted for science stream in Class 11 and do not have a school teaching the same at a distance of 3 kilometre will also be able to avail the scheme. Further, the policy will only be available for girls who have a monthly attendance above 60%. The policy will include vehicles such as SUVs, auto rickshaws, minibus among others under its ambit.

""The policy will encourage parents and guardians to make use of carpool facility for girls in their neighbourhood. We will compensate the costs incurred per student through a monthly deposit in the girl student's account. Girls interested in the scheme can approach their school principals to avail the benefit,"" said Shastri.

As per the provisions of the scheme, the vehicle and the vehicle driver need to meet necessary travel norms. A valid drivers' license, vehicle insurance policy, and certificate from the transport department are some of the requisites. Vehicle carriers will not be allowed to ferry students beyond the prescribed capacity of the vehicle.

Education experts, however, said that reimbursing the travel cost would only bring a minuscule change.

""Incentives such as these depend on how people use or misuse these schemes. Financial reimbursements alone cannot guarantee safe transport. Safety depends on the larger attitude of the society towards girls. Societal attitude coupled with poor sanitation in schools makes girls withdraw.

The students and special educator aspirants alleged that special educators for such students are yet to be appointed in schools even though the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, which came into force in 2016, has provisions for appointment of special educators in schools at primary and upper primary schools to help differently-abled students.

The agitators alleged that not a single special educator in the State has been appointed so far. Members of Odisha Special Educator Federation for Divyang (OSEFD) also submitted a memorandum to OPEPA officials seeking immediate appointment of special educators in all schools at the elementary level.

Acting on the direction, Secretary of Social Security and Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (SSEPD) in an official communique in June this year had urged the S&ME department to implement the provision and submit an action taken report in this regard within 30 days.

However, the S&ME department is reportedly yet to act on the matter.","Special teacher aspirants gherao Odisha Primary Education Department office in Bhubaneswar","987937764","2018-11-06","http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2018/nov/06/special-teacher-aspirants-gherao-odisha-primary-education-department-office-in-bhubaneswar-1894828.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

"609","","THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In the run-up to the Kerala Piravi Day, the Higher Education Department's decision to use the language oath released by the Malayalam Mission has courted controversy. The department recently released a circular mandating the language oath by Malayalam Mission be read out in the educational institutions, including the professional colleges, that fall under the department. This, when the government itself had issued a circular making the verses penned by writer M T Vasudevan Nair as the official language oath. The order that mandated MT's oath to be used in all educational institutions in Kerala was released in February 2018.

The confusion has risen with the release of the recent circular of the department which says the language oath be administered on November 1 as part of the 'Bhoomi Malayalam' project of the Malayalam Mission. ""This is in contravention with the order released by the government which mandates the language oath be administered on Kerala Piravi day in all the educational institutions. This will include colleges as well. The official language department itself has necessitated the oath be read out to the students. A state should have only one oath as its official language oath. The issue needs to be sorted out,"" said R Siva Kumar, a language expert.

Interestingly, the two circulars have come out in the same month. The government's circular mandating the oath be read out in schools was issued on October 10. The Higher Education Department's order too came out in October.

Meanwhile, Malayalam Mission director Suja Susan George said there was no need of a controversy regarding the oath of the mission which has been prepared by poet K Satchidanandan. ""The pledge is aimed at Keralites living abroad and outside the state. It has been structured in a manner the expatriates can relate to. And that is why we chose an expatriate such as K Satchidanandan to pen the pledge,"" said Suja.

""We gave the request to the different government departments regarding this. In the backdrop of the floods, we thought this could bring Malayalees together. Our only aim was to bring those living in Kerala and abroad under one umbrella and line them up for the language and show the strength of Malayalam to the world.

"610","","HYDERABAD: The education department is already faced with a plethora of problems due to a large number of vacant posts of regular district education officers (DEO), deputy district education officers (DyDEO) and mandal education officers (MEO). And adding to the woes is the latest diktat to inspect CBSE schools, which the already burdened officials claim is very difficult to implement.

According to education department sources, of the 31 DEOs in the State, only 10 are regular appointees and the remaining ones are acting DEOs while all the 63 dyDEO posts are lying vacant. In 584 mandals, there are 539 sanctioned MEO posts but only 36 regular MEOs are presently on the job. In rest of the 503 mandals, headmasters are given full additional charge of MEO posts.

The headmasters, each of whom are now in-charge of at least 200 schools, allege that as a result they are unable to attend to their regular duties since they are always away to inspect the schools.

Chava Ravi, general secretary of Telangana State United Teachers Federation (TSUTF), said that lack of regular appointments was having a telling impact on education in general and supervision of schools in particular.

Inspection of SSC schools in the State is done currently by FAC MEOs and this too is not done properly, he said, adding that in the current scheme of things, for inspection of CBSE schools government has to come up with a new mechanism as handing it over to the FAC MEOs might not work. One of the DEOs, on the condition of anonymity, told Express that such inspection of CBSE schools cannot be undertaken in Telangana.

""If we had to conduct visits, it would have been fine but inspection of all schools when we are so short on manpower is not possible. In our schools too we only do random inspection,"" the officer said. The teaching community, therefore, has been demanding regularisation of 21 DEO posts, along with one DEO per constituency & 45 additional posts MEO posts to ensure one for each mandal.

""Overlooking the need for supervisory officials has resulted in the collapse of the education sector in TS. There is absenteeism in government schools because HMs are not there to monitor teachers. Neither teaching is done nor are schemes implemented properly,"" said T Swaroopa, a government school teacher.","Education department has no manpower to check quality of CBSE schools in Hyderabad","977904032","2018-10-25","http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2018/oct/25/education-department-has-no-manpower-to-check-quality-of-cbse-schools-in-hyderabad-1889812.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

The order was withdrawn following criticism from different sections of society, besides political parties, including National Conference (NC) vice-president Omar Abdullah.

""The Communication No: Edu/Genl/35/2013 dated: 22-10-2018 issued by the School Education Department to the Director School Education Kashmir/Jammu has been withdrawn ab-initio on the directions of the Chief Secretary, BVR Subrahmanyam,"" an official spokesperson said.

"612","","PUNE: School and junior college picnics to hill stations and other such destinations for entertainment will not be easy to undertake henceforth.

A notice issued a week ago by the deputy director of education, Pune division, said all the schools and junior colleges in Ahmednagar, Pune and Solapur to ensure that the destination of the excursion be with an aim to develop the intellect or overall personality of the students.

Action will be taken against principals of the schools or junior colleges who organise tours without permission to places just for entertainment or to those which abound in natural beauty but pose a threat to the safety of students, the letter said.

Deputy director of education Minakshi Raut said, ""We get proposals from junior colleges while the education departments at the local bodies get those from schools in their respective area. However, it is mandatory for all schools and colleges to take permission from the local body before a trip. In case the school or college does not take such permission, and we get a complaint, we will send a show-cause notice and action against them will follow as per the rules.""

Education activist Matin Mujawar said such a step will help students and parents, but schools should submit to the deputy director or concerned authority the amount of money taken from students for every trip.

""On excursions, students are more and supervising teachers are less. Students may not always listen to their teachers and end up hurting themselves. If trips to dangerous terrains are avoided, and the focus of the trip is value addition, then it will be easier for teachers to manage them. Parents will be at peace too,"" Mujawar said.

Strict compliance even from private schools is necessary, Raji Nair, a parent, said. ""Teachers should have a students' list along with their emergency contact numbers, blood group and allergies to medicines, for immediate action.""

The education department had issued instructions to all institutes regarding the process to follow for an educational trip in 2016. This came in the wake of the Murud beach tragedy where 14 students from a college in Pune drowned while on a college trip.

"613","","BENGALURU: Poor rate of admission in government-run schools and high annual refunds paid to private schools under Right To Education (RTE) has forced the department of primary and secondary education to propose amendments to the RTE Act. The department has proposed the Kerala model in which priority will be given to government-run schools to fill seats under RTE rather than private unaided schools.

""The Kerala model gives top priority to filling seats in government-run schools, next come aided schools and third priority is to private unaided schools,"" explained a senior official from the department. The official confirmed sending the proposal to the state government to be placed before the next cabinet meeting for approval.

Officials said there were two main reasons for this proposal to amend the rules: Seats remaining vacant in government-run schools as parents of children, under the RTE rules, preferred sending them to private schools rather than government-run schools; and the financial burden on the state government in refunding the cost to private unaided schools which spend on kids admitted under the RTE quota. ""RTE refund is a burden of Rs 1,200 crore every year for the state government. Not just that, this is impacting admissions in government schools, which is drastically going down since the last three years,"" said a senior official.

""It is also a fact that the state government is helping some private schools sustain as they are getting admissions only because of the RTE Act where kids are getting admission under the 25% reservation quota,"" said the official.

Meanwhile, poor infrastructure in government schools is also being blamed for the poor rate of admissions. One education expert said on condition of anonymity, ""One can't blame the RTE Act. The face of government schools will not change by abolishing or amending the RTE Act.""

However, education expert V P Niranjanaradhya said, ""There were some errors in the implementation (of the RTE Act) itself and bringing amendments to the rules is the best way to correct it. As per Section 3 of the Act, it is a must to admit kids in neighbourhood schools, but it is being violated.

"614","","Plans to prioritise government schools over private; parents and experts say this will dilute the Act

The State govt. is again planning to tweak the criteria for admission under the reservation quota of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, which will prioritise government schools over their private counterparts.

The move has been criticised by parents' groups and education experts, among other stakeholders, who believe that the government is diluting the reservation clause. The Dept. of Primary and Secondary Education is proposing that the changes be applicable in the 2019-20 academic year.

The RTE Act states that 25% of seats be reserved for students of weaker sections and disadvantaged groups in private schools. However, as per the department's plan, a child must be admitted to government or aided schools in the neighbourhood.""Only if government or aided schools are not in the neighbourhood, should the child be allotted seats in a private school,"" said a source privy to the latest proposal.

Experts point out that the proposal will ensure that the reservation quota is scrapped as almost all neighbourhoods have a government school in the vicinity. (For admissions under the RTE quota, a 'neighbourhood' is considered as a revenue village in rural areas, a ward within city corporation limits, and the entire jurisdiction for urban local bodies.)Other sources confirmed that the department was planning to amend three clauses under the Karnataka Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2012.

""This move has been proposed as officials in the department feel that reimbursements to private schools for the RTE quota caused a huge burden to the State exchequer,"" the source added. This academic year alone, the State government is estimated to have reimbursed around ₹500 crore.

This January, a similar proposal was submitted by the department, but was not approved by the former Primary and Secondary Education Minister Tanveer Sait after widespread criticism. The State department's own analysis pointed out the rate of decline in government school enrolments for class one got steeper in the years following implementation of the RTE Act. It had also pointed out that only a small percentage (1.2%) of the overall budget of the Department of Primary and Secondary Education was spent as reimbursement for 2015-2016. Parents are unhappy with this proposal as they enrol their children in private schools in the hope they would become well-versed in English.

Shashikala K., a domestic help whose son studies under the RTE quota in a private school in North Bengaluru, said: ""When we applied for admissions this year, there were more than a dozen private schools that we could apply to. We were very happy as we could get English-medium education free of cost. If the rules are changed, it would mean that English-medium education is no longer accessible to us as every locality has a govt. school.""","Education Department mulling over changes in RTE admission process","973789494","2018-10-19","https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/education-department-mulling-over-changes-in-rte-admission-process/article25266601.ece","The Hindu",FALSE

A Pune-based think tank, which focuses on college education, asked the state education department to scrap the 20% in-house quota in minority colleges for junior college admissions.

The think tank -System Correcting Movement (SYSCOM) -in a 28-page-long document, suggested measures to improve the online admission system for first-year junior colleges (FYJC). Scrapping the in-house quota in minority colleges across the state was one of them. The document has been submitted to the education commissioner.

""Minority colleges have 50% reservations under minority quota as well as 5% reservations under management quota. With the 20% in-house quota, the total reservations go up to 75%. As per high court orders, the total quota should not exceed 50%,"" said Vaishali Bafna, a member of SYSCOM.

Other suggestions include, having a centralised admission portal for all admissions under the state education department, making it mandatory for colleges to display their fees, facilities, subjects offered, etc. on their official website.

SYSCOM has also asked the education department to ensure that dual reservation admissions are conducted on the basis of application and not on the basis of allotment. For instance, a student applying under the Scheduled Tribe (ST) quota and the sports quota at the same time should be first allotted the ST-sports quota seat before a student who is eligible for both quotas but has not applied under the same.

As first step, the department has directed all District Educational Officers (DEO) to hold school-level meetings to include Saturday as a working day to complete the minimum working days of 200. However, Christmas examination and final examinations will be held as per schedule, top officers of the Education Department told Express.

A Shahjahan, General Education Secretary, told Express the decision on which Saturdays would be included as holidays will have to be decided by the respective DEOs in the affected districts. ""The DEOs will rearrange the working days of schools based on the holidays given to them on account of rain and floods. In some districts, more holidays were given and hence Saturdays will be working days based on the number of holidays. The rearrangement is underway. Since there were no Onam examinations, we are planning to make up the classes lost before the second term examinations itself,"" Shajahan said.

He also said the SSLC and HSE examinations will be held as per schedule and there is no room for any postponement.

A School Quality Improvement Programme (QIP) monitoring committee will also check the number of working days and recommend DEOs to plan the working days on Saturdays. Second Saturdays will be holidays as usual.

Last year too, the department targeted 200 working days, but could only achieve 172 days. Earlier, the higher secondary directorate's decision to assign a few Saturdays as working days in order to ensure at least 200 academic days this year has kicked up a storm.

However, the finance department has asked the education department to submit the details regarding the additional posts available in the department and the student-teacher ratio. To this, the department officials submitted the details and received clearance from the finance department recently.

With the Physical Education and Training (PET) candidates demanding the State government to increase the PET posts, the HRD Minister assured that they might be increased after discussing with the Chief Minister.

The candidates demanded the government to recruit for 1,056 PET vacant posts across the state.

The officials want to fill the 9,500 vacant posts under DSC 2018. Only around 6,000 posts out of these belong to the department, while the rest are of welfare schools.

Of the total 6,019, 3,225 are SGT, 1,569 are school assistants, 210 language pandits, PET's 47, 59 music teachers and 909 model school teachers.","Teacher's recruitment notification on October 10: AP Education department","962781472","2018-10-06","http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/andhra-pradesh/2018/oct/06/teachers-recruitment-notification-on-october-10-ap-education-department-1881705.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE
"625","","HYDERABAD: The Telangana school education department is set to conduct a survey on the number of pre-primary and playschools in city limits and crack the whip on those running without recognition. This follows the closure of the pre-primary section of a Tolichowki school where a minor was sexually abused.

The school education department asked the Tolichowki school to shut down it's pre-primary section after it found that the management ran it without seeking recognition and following the safety guidelines issued by the National Council of Protection of Child Rights.

""We have now given a final deadline of October 31 to all such schools running preprimary sections without approval. They have to submit online details following which the deputy education officers will conduct necessary inspections and compile the data,"" B Venkata Narasamma, Hyderabad district education officer told TOI.

The Hyderabad DEO admitted that while several schools running pre-primary sections had sought recognition after the department made it mandatory in 2016, there are several independent schools which continued to flout norms. ""We are finding it difficult to tap these private players who run schools under a franchise without seeking recognition. After October, we will be initiating strict action against all such schools which function without recognition and which fail to follow child protection and safety norms on campus,"" added Narasamma.

The Andhra Pradesh Education Act, 1982, clearly specified that school managements failing to secure recognition from the education department may face imprisonment from six months to three years. A fine of Rs 3,000 to Rs 50,000 can also be imposed on the management if found guilty.

Although the school education department jumped into action following the Tolichowki case, it faced flak from parents and activists for failing to maintain a list of such schools running preprimary sections without recognition. ""The school education department's selective action against one school is not fair.Despite multiple incidents of negligence occurring in pre-primary schools, the department has miserably failed to maintain a list of schools running without recognition,"" said N Subramanyam, president of Hyderabad School Parents Association. HSPA members also shot a letter to the Hyderabad DEO on September 30 to resolve the issue of unrecognised schools in the city.","Illegal playschools to shut, Tolichowki abuse jolts education department - Times of India","960126782","2018-10-03","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/illegal-playschools-to-shut-tolichowki-abuse-jolts-education-department/articleshow/66048307.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

"633","","The parents, who feel that education officers should have taken action against the IES Modern English School, say no action is the failure of the government. File Pic

Parents of students at the IES Modern English School, Dadar, have complained to the Maharashtra Commission for Protection of Child Rights (MCPCR), demanding action against education department officials from the state government, who they say, have failed in their duties. They have alleged that the new increased fee structure by the school is being debated for the past two years, yet the school administration took action against their children by suspending about 15 of them.

The parents, who feel that education officers should have taken action against the school for this, say no action is the failure of the government, and are demanding that MCPCR take action against the persons responsible for this.

School moved court

After a complaint by parents, the fee hike by the school was declared inappropriate by the education officer's office, but the school administration moved court and won. Parents fighting the fee hike were sent legal notices. As the fee payment was delayed by these parents following the dispute, their wards were suspended from school.

""First of all, removing children from school for delay in paying fees is wrong. We paid the full fee amount obeying the court's decision, yet education department officials did not take any action against the school for victimising children in the row over fees. This is clear failure of the officials from the state education department,"" said the parent who has submitted the complaint, adding, ""This is very dangerous behaviour on part of the education officials, which is setting a bad precedent of giving a free hand to private educational institutions in profiteering.""

While Satish Nayak, trustee of the Indian Education Society (IES), which runs the school, was not available for comment even after several attempts to contact him, a senior official from the MCPCR said, ""One case regarding action taken against the children is already going on at the commission after receiving parents' complaint.

"636","","Our Correspondent

Kohima, Sep. 24 (EMN): The Naga Students' Federation (NSF) on Monday drew the attention of the advisor to School Education KT Sukhalu to what it stated were discrepancies in government schools. The NSF has demanded corrective measures or action by October 24. The students' organisation submitted a representation addressed to the legislator on Monday.

Addressing a press conference NSF president Kesosul Christopher Ltu said that the anomalies were detected by the NSF following a visit to educational institutions in various districts during different occasions.

The main issues raised by the NSF include implementation of the Mid-Day Meal (MDM) Scheme; and issues concerning school uniforms, infrastructure; composite schools and implementation of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act of 2003 (Copta).

MDM scheme: During the visit in 2017, the federation said to have noted the failure in the implementation of the scheme; students were deprived of their benefits. Ltu said that the issue was highlighted to the chief minister, which was then taken to the State Vigilance Commission for investigation into irregularities and mismanagement. He lamented that despite a lapse of one academic session, the irregularities were still taking place this year.

""For the academic year 2018, most of the schools were not provided MDM and many schools were supplied with only 'dal' (dried, split pulses) and cooking cost without supply of any other commodities,"" the student leader pointed out. It compelled the school managements to sell afew bags of 'dal' to purchase rice and other commodities to provide meal to the students. It was learnt that the NSF had written to the State Vigilance Commission on August 21 last to expedite the investigation process, and to produce the report by 30 days. It also asked the commission to investigate discrepancies in MDM for the year 2017 and 2018, advocating that strict and effective disciplinary measure should be initiated against offenders in the implementing agencies.

With the passage of the 30-day mark, the NSF had a meeting with the Vigilance department officials, wherein, the latter was stated to have proposed for three months' time to complete the process. Towards this, Ltu said the NSF will take a call only after consultation with its federating units.

Free uniforms: The NSF has said that there was shortage and delay in supply of the school uniforms including trousers, skirt and shirts. ""Most of the schools were issued with only sweater and a pair of socks, all of which were of the same size, and could not fit even students from the lower primary classes,"" the federation lamented.

In several schools, Ltu said, students were given just cloth materials of 'compromised quality', and without stitching cost. ""It is imperative to mention that the cloth materials supplied were of the lowest quality,"" he said.

The NSF had written to the chief secretary on September 4 regarding the issue of school uniforms, and sought measures from the government within 15 days. Interestingly, the department of School Education was said to have replied to the letter on September 24, the day the NSF submitted its representation to the legislator in-charge of the department. The department simply stated that 'the government has decided to refer the matter to the State Vigilance Commission for necessary action'.

The student body also raised the issue of deteriorating infrastructure of most of the government schools. It highlighted that most of the classrooms and staff rooms in the government schools were in dilapidated conditions, and the schools, since their inception, have not received any funds for repair and renovation. Some of the schools were built in 1940s and were still running under the same structure, Ltu maintained.

The organisation also expressed concern that it was found through records from the government schools that no official inspection were being undertaken by the department, respective district education officers (DEO) and sub-divisional education officers (SDEO).

""This negligence of duty from the government officials is one of the factors mainly responsible for the untold hardships being faced by the schools and students and for low performance of students in their academics,"" the NSF stated in its representation. Stating that there was a gap between the schools and the department, NSF leaders were of the view that instead of just reviewing the performance of government schools in HSLC, department and government need to review and assess the schools and students by carrying out physical visitation and verification.

The federation also pointed out that the government has initiated to merge few schools together under one administration in the form of 'composite school.' However, with the lack of infrastructure in almost all the government schools, it felt this exercise will not serve its purpose as intended without upgradation of the present infrastructures.

Meanwhile, reminding that the Copta (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) being enacted and enforced, the NSF maintained it was imperative to put it in order. It informed that many shops within the given perimeters were detected selling banned tobacco products and demanded that the respective district administration should strictly monitor the strict enforcement of the act.

The student body asked the advisor for School Education to initiate action, and inform about it within 30 days. The NSF leader asserted that the affected party being the students, they would have to step out and show their resentment in a democratic way.","NSF wants mess in Education department swept out","953849560","2018-09-24","http://www.easternmirrornagaland.com/nsf-wants-mess-in-education-department-swept-out/","Eastern Mirror",FALSE
"637","","BENGALURU: Officials in the state Higher Education Department are allegedly bypassing Higher Education Minister GT Devegowda and issuing orders or forwarding files without bringing it to his notice. This latest trend has reportedly irked the minister so much so that he has even asked for a change in portfolio.

In three of the recent incidents, the files related to appointments of registrars for Karnataka State Open University (KSOU), term extension for Hampi Kannada University vice chancellor and issuing some work orders for a big amount, the officials of the department had not brought the matters to the minister's notice.

Devegowda told this to The New Indian Express and conveyed the same to Public Works Department Minister HD Revanna. Revanna later called senior officials of the department and warned them against bypassing the minister. ""I was kept in the dark and even the files related to the appointment of KSOU registrars were not brought to my attention,"" Devegowda said.

On Tuesday, Devegowda has written to the state government urging it to relieve a senior official from the department's planning section who had released Rs 108 crore in payments for various projects without informing the minister.

According to sources close to Devegowda, he recently met Revanna and sought a change of portfolio.

Recently, while reacting to questions on extension of term given to Hampi Kannada University Vice Chancellor Prof Mallika Ghanti, the minister said he was unaware of it. But when asked, sources at Raj Bhavan confirmed that the file had come from the state government.Sources close to the minister allege that former VC of University of Mysore Prof K S Rangappa is playing a role in all this. However, this allegation could not be independently verified.","Karnataka higher education department officials bypass Minister GT Devegowda in issuing order, files","949731392","2018-09-19","http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2018/sep/19/karnataka-higher-education-department-officials-bypass-minister-gt-devegowda-in-issuing-order-files-1873974.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE
"638","","While students welcome move on Plus Two marks, teachers are against proposal

The School Education Department's announcement to consider only Plus 2 marks for college admissions has evoked a mixed reaction.

While many students and schools expressed relief, teachers' associations opposed the move saying the schools may not take Plus 1 seriously.

""We're extremely happy since the prospect of taking up the boards in the new curriculum seemed daunting. Many of us were scared that if our total in the Class XI exams goes down even a bit, it will affect our chances during college admissions,"" said A. Priyadarshinie, a student from the city.

The School Education Department introduced board exams for Plus 1 in 2017 and the first batch of students who took up the exam in March 2018 secured a pass percentage of 91.3. While many schools had secured a good pass percentage, many teachers and students felt that individual scores could have been much higher.

While a number of teachers say that the new curriculum for Plus 1 introduced this year was interesting and challenging, the students found the transition difficult. Also, delays plague textbook distribution for a few subjects. ""We are yet to see the second volume of textbooks for many subjects. The faculty and students have been working hard and this announcement comes as a breather,"" said the headmaster of a school in the city.

The Tamil Nadu Post Graduate Teachers Association, however, vehemently opposed the move by the government and said that it would further disadvantage students from government schools in rural areas.

""Private schools will now have a free run to teach Plus 2 portions in Plus 1 itself like before. Now, it is enough if the students merely clear the Plus 1 exams,"" said K.P.O. Suresh, State president of the association.

""Even though Plus 2 students will have a new curriculum next year and therefore can't be taught now, this will set a precedent for the future. Students in government schools who are actually taught both Plus 1 and 2 portions thoroughly will once again be left behind,"" he said.

Mr. Suresh also said that the move to not consider Plus 1 marks for admission into colleges defeated the purpose of ensuring that the students gave importance to their lessons during both years, which would have ensured that they were better prepared to handle competitive exams.

""This is unnecessary confusion for the students who are getting adapted to the changes already in place,"" he said.

N. Ramasubramanyan, correspondent, Sri Natesan Vidyasala Matriculation Higher Secondary School, said that before the compulsory Plus 1 board exams were introduced, he had appealed to the government to reintroduce the old practice of having district-level common exams in Plus 1.

""That Plus 1 board exam marks will not be considered for admissions is welcome since no other board has the system. As the Education Department has specified that students will not get their Plus 2 marksheets without clearing Plus 1, schools can't take them lightly,"" he said.

Welcoming the move, Vishnucharan Paneerselvam, correspondent, Shree Niketan Group of Schools, said that it will definitely lessen the burden and stress on the students who will be writing board exams for three successive years.","Mixed reaction to Education Department order on criterion for college admission","947991784","2018-09-16","https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/mixed-reaction-to-education-department-order-on-criterion-for-college-admission/article24963013.ece","The Hindu",FALSE
"639","","HYDERABAD: Despite education officials keeping tabs on private schools to check their treatment of pending fee cases, corporal punishments continue to be reported in the city. In a recent incident, a class 9 student from Brilliant Grammar School, Boduppal, was sent home over due fees.

""We are not against schools collecting fees, but that should purely be between parents and school management. Under no circumstances, should the child be involved. The same thing happened in this incident, where the class 9 student was sent back on the pretext that he did not pay the fees,"" said Achyuta Rao, honorary president, Balala Hakula Sangham.

""Unfortunately, despite a number of cases being reported every month, the school education department has no concrete plan to deal with such issues... We feel that unless they are directly made accountable and action is initiated against the district or mandal education officer concerned along with erring teacher and school management, the situation is going to remain the same,"" Rao added.

Meanwhile, school education department officials, who started inspecting private schools since the first week of August, have not taken action against a single school. ""I have had directed the deputy inspection officers and deputy education officers to visit at least 20 private schools every month and interact with students to know about issues bothering them. However, we haven't issued any show-cause notices yet,"" said B Venkata Narassama, Hyderabad district education officer.

Parents too blamed education officials and said that they are hardly initiating any action and are merely conducting enquiries for the sake of it.","Class 9 student sent home over fees, education department blind - Times of India","947288653","2018-09-15","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/class-9-student-sent-home-over-fees-education-department-blind/articleshow/65818391.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

On the other hand, still, around 16,000 seats of in-house, management and minority quota have not been surrendered to the education department for the ongoing second FCFS round.

A department official told the Asian Age, ""Before the FCFS second round began, colleges were given two days to surrender the seats to the department.

Considering the least number of admissions to some of the streams, the Higher Education Department has decided to request the All India Council for Higher Education (AICTE) to shut down, disaffiliate or ban the streams which have failed to attract students.

Data from Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU), Belagavi, shows that 12 streams have been getting the least number of admissions for three years -- 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17. According to university officials, there is no demand for those subjects in the job market. This list of 12 streams includes aerospace engineering, automation and robotics engineering, ceramics and cement technology, environmental engineering, instrumentation technology, manufacture science and engineering, and mining technology. ""The problem with these streams is that very few colleges offer these courses and some have started when the market was in boom in that particular area. Now, the trend has changed and it is obvious that the subject is not in demand,"" said a principal of a private engineering college in the city.

According to principals of engineering colleges and officials of VTU, other short-term courses are available now and students prefer to join them. ""Environmental engineering is now offered at under-graduate courses; even four-year integrated MSc courses available and there are also diploma and certificate courses,"" said an official.

An official of the Higher Education Department said, ""This streams reflect on the overall intake and vacant seats.

The message also applies to other students who were allotted seats through previous rounds.

The move is to ensure that every student gets a seat at a time when students are repeatedly cancelling admissions as they are unhappy with the college preference.

If the teachers do not provide satisfactory reasons, action would be taken against them. As per the memo 17 B, increment could be cut for a year to the teachers.

The decision was taken in a meeting held last week following the tragic incident at New Century Public School in Kukatpally which led to death of two students after a beam collapsed.

""The deputy education officers are instructed to visit minimum 20 schools in every mandal per month. They have to inspect if the buildings are structurally sound and whether there is any scope of hazardous events to occur.

Inspections will also be carried out at government schools as part of the exercise. ""So far, we have identified four government schools which are lying in dilapidated conditions.

Sharma added that the teachers have submitted an undertaking stating that they would ensure results above 75 per cent. Teachers were up in arms against the education department for the action taken against them, blaming officials for allowing grace marks and numerous violations of the RTE Act at government schools.

Teachers' bodies, including Joint Action Committee of UT Teachers and SSA Teachers' Welfare Association (SSATWA), also submitted representations to local MP Kirron Kher who spoke to Sharma and other officials too.

When asked if Sharma had bowed to pressure from the MP, he said, ""It had nothing to do with pressure. But yes, I had earlier told Kirron Kher that we want to take strict action against underperforming teachers.""

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said that education should be able to strengthen the values of the renaissance, humanity and secular ideals, calling on students to grow up as righteous people who can take in human culture transcending communal and casteist thoughts.

Inaugurating the second floor of the higher secondary block of the Chala Government Higher Secondary School here, and the State-wide launch of 'Relish', the project to improve the English language skill of secondary students, on Saturday, Mr. Vijayan said there was a time when a large section of people in the State had been denied the right to education based on their caste. That situation changed now. ""We won that right not because those who imposed the denial of education voluntarily withdrew it, but as a result of strong struggles."" The move from certain quarters to push people into old social conditions and the dark ages should be defeated, he said.

Mr. Vijayan said the State had reached the present condition by defeating casteist division and discrimination practised by the feudal system.

Students should understand facts and analyse subjects scientifically, he said, adding that the educational programmes being implemented in the State catered to that goal.

As a result of the education protection initiatives, the academic standard in government schools has been improved, he said.

Stressing the need to improve the standard of education in accordance with the changing times, Mr. Vijayan said that 'Relish English' is a research-oriented project implemented under the leadership of the NCERT.

It was being introduced in ten schools in the State, he added.","Education should strengthen values of renaissance, says Chief Minister","1029223475","2018-12-30","https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/education-should-strengthen-values-of-renaissance-says-chief-minister/article25863735.ece","The Hindu",FALSE

With the new academic year set to commence in the next few months, there are various key decisions that are now lying in the backburner as the CM is yet to allot ministries to the newly-elected members of the assembly.

Take for instance the schedule for common entrance tests and school admissions. Last year, the Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE) had declared the schedule for all common entrance tests on December 28 and released the admission schedule for schools on December 30. However, this year, the government is yet to commence the process for the same. ""The release of the schedule will take another 2-3 weeks. We have to wait before the minister of education department is appointed,"" said Papi Reddy, chairman of TSCHE, adding that there won't be much of loss as there is sufficient time before the exams are held.

Finalising of a committee to issue notification for fee fixation of professional courses also lies pending. ""First, a committee is constituted that will issue a notification calling applications from private colleges to fix the fee structure for the next three years. Once we receive applications, the same shall be audited and subsequently fee will be fixed. However, we have to wait for the minister to be appointed to seek approval on the committee,"" said Rama Rao, consultant at Telangana Admission and Fee Regulatory Committee (TAFRC).

Other aspects such as affiliation process for intermediate colleges and finalization of admission process for degree courses are also pending.

"879","","Society should rethink its attitude towards education as a means of making the grade in examinations, Education Minister C. Ravindranath has said. He was speaking at the P.M. Foundation Education Awards function here on Sunday.

Students' creative aptitude gets killed when education becomes examination-centric. Probably, such a trend does not create geniuses -- be it scientists or artists -- despite the fact that the State has made immense progress in the education sector.

The government is not in favour of examination-centric education, and it aims to transform the education system from being teacher-centric to student-centric. It is also the objective of the education protection campaign, the Minister said.

He added that studies should be considered as a journey towards making discoveries, and that one does not gain much by learning things by heart. An A+ in life is more important than an A+ in examinations, and students, teachers, and parents should be sensitive to this significant aspect, Mr. Ravindranath said. He also called upon students to use their mother tongue as a tool to excel in life.

The Minister pointed out that parents and teachers should motivate students to excel in their own creative fields. Never should a student be discriminated against for not making the grade.

The foundation's Haritha Vidyalayam Awards were presented to KMHSS, Valakkulam, Malappuram; Krishnavilasam UPS, Pangode, Thiruvananthapuram, and GHSS, Udinoor, Kasaragod.

"881","","PANAJI: Union minister for human resource development (HRD) Prakash Javadekar, on Saturday said the much-awaited draft National Education Policy would be ready shortly.

At the Goa University's 31st annual convocation ceremony, Javadekar said work on the report on higher education, authored by former Indian Space Research Organisation chief K Kasturitangan, was completed on Saturday and would be submitted to the government soon.

Javadekar also said a separate category would be created for smaller universities in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) of the HRD, to ensure that such institutions don't lose out to larger ones.

""The National Education Policy will include accessibility, affordability, equity, quality and accountability,"" Javadekar said. ""These will be its five pillars. Our committee, under Kasturirangan, met for the last time on Saturday. Members said work was over and that they would hand over the education policy to me any time now. This will give a new direction to our education system.""

After GU vice-chancellor Varun Sahni said in his speech that it would be better if NIRF considered not just absolute numbers but per capita data, so that smaller universities don't find themselves disadvantaged, Javadekar said, ""It is a good suggestion that smaller universities should have a different category under NIRF so that they are not compared to universities having 1 lakh to 1.5 lakh students. If we compare smaller universities, they will appear to not be performing on par. But if we assess them on per capita output, the picture will be different. I assure you that a different category will be made in the NIRF ranking for smaller universities. I want to announce it here.""

The minister said other organisations would also be involved in the National Assessment and Accreditation Council's accreditation of institutes, so that each institute could be ranked at least once in five years.

Sahni also maintained that the GU legitimately had a place in Institutes of Eminence (IoE) competitions. ""At least a couple of IoEs should be small universities doing excellent work that can rapidly be scaled up to comparative size,"" he said.","Draft national education policy soon: HRD minister Prakash Javadekar - Times of India","1019527777","2018-12-16","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/draft-natl-edu-policy-soon-hrd-minister/articleshow/67110424.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

Union Minister for HRD Shri Prakash Javadekar has said that the government is committed to increase quality education in the country right from primary education to higher education.

Mr Javadekar was speaking at the national Conference on 'Positioning India on the Global Education Map' in New Delhi today. In higher education, we have taken tremendous steps to improve college education, for this we are making accreditation process more scientific and tough. Government wants to increase the strength of NBA and NAAC so that more number of institutions can be accredited, the Minister added.

He further said that government is open for other agencies to take the responsibility of accreditation and IITs and IIMs have been asked for the same so that more and more institutions can be accredited from reputed agencies.

The Minister said that ranking and rating increase competitiveness among institutions for better performance. He gave the example of National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) and said that because of NIRF every institute has constituted an internal committee to improve the ranking. Students also see institutions ranking before taking admission, he added.

The Union Minister said that teacher is the most important component to increase quality educationin the colleges and universities. He said that attendance should increase in the classroom because of teacher's skills not because of the infrastructure of the college. He further said that we are lacking good teachers in the institutions because good people are not becoming teachers.

We have to attract good people for teaching profession and we have to give respect to teachers then only we can create a good learning environment in the institutions. Best teachers attract students to the institution not the best infrastructure, he added.

Graded autonomy is another major step of the government to boost quality education in the country, the Minister said. Shri Javadekar explained that the universities will remain within the ambit of UGC but will have the freedom to start new courses, off campus centers, skill development courses, research parks and any other new academic programs. They will also have the freedom to hire foreign faculty, enroll foreign students, give incentive based emoluments to the faculty, enter into academic collaborations and run open distance learning programmes.

The Minister said that we are focusing on research and innovation to boost research culture in the country. The Ministry of HRD successfully conducted two Smart India Hackathon in 2017 and 2018 and started process for third installment of Smart India Hackathon- 2019, he said.

The Minister further said that to promote innovation culture in India we have started Innovation Cell in AICTE and more than 1000 colleges started Innovation Club in their campuses. The research and innovation culture will make education more relevant and reliable, he added.

Beside these steps to promote quality education in the country we have increased budget amount for the higher education through HEFA, the Minister added. He said that India is improving its ranking in world class institutions but we want to enter in top 100 club of best institutions, therefore we are trying to make 20 Institutes of Eminence in the country, 10 each in public and private category.>","Several steps have been taken to promote quality education in country, says Minister","1018538746","2018-12-14","https://www.clipper28.com/en/several-steps-have-been-taken-to-promote-quality-education-in-country-says-minister/","Clipper28 Digital Media",FALSE

Chatterjee pointed out that the state education department has fixed 60 percent attendance as a criterion to sit for semester exams, even as the UGC suggested 75 percent attendance for higher educational institutions.

""Maybe the agitating students wanted to sit for exams without attending classes or studying,"" he said. Heramba Chandra College Principal Nabanita Chakraborty, who met Chatterjee Saturday morning, said the authorities are planning to reduce the cut-off figure for attendance from 60 percent to 55 percent. Trinamool Congress Chhatra Parishad (TMCP), the students' wing of the ruling party, also appealed to the education minister to find a ""way out of the deadlock"" to restore normalcy in the institutes.

TMCP president Trinankur Bhattacharya, who met the minister at his residence, told reporters that the unit has sought a solution that would be acceptable to all sides. A TMCP source said the union urged Chatterjee to consider relaxation in attendance norm for this year.

""Very soon you will get good news,"" Bukhari said, speaking about the alliance.

Kashmir's richest legislator

Bukhari held the post of education minister in the erstwhile Mehbooba Mufti government. In March, he was given the additional charge of the finance ministry, after Haseeb Drabu was axed from the post over his remark that Kashmir was not a political issue.

Earlier, Bukhari held the portfolio of roads and buildings minister during the tenure of Late Mufti Mohammad Sayeed. According to News18, he was the richest candidate in 2014 Assembly election with assets worth Rs 84 crore. The 55-year-old holds a graduate degree in agriculture science from Government Agriculture College in Sopore.

In September 2018, the businessman-turned politician also welcomed the suggestion of Jammu and Kashmir Civil Society Coordination Committee for a tie-up between NC and PDP for the formation of the new government to defend the Article 35A and to fight communal forces.

When Bukhari was asked on Wednesday if he was in the running for the chief minister's post, he said, ""There is no such thing. The chief minister will be from among the leaders. This issue is not about chief ministership"".

He added that the alliance was being formed to address the Kashmir issue, and to protect the special identity of the state that ""we have in the Constitution of India"". ""As elected representatives, we have to respond to the aspirations of the people and the emerging situation. Article 370 and Article 35A are under attack.

Tawde will hear their objections, before the bill is introduced in the winter session of the legislative assembly.

Bandopant Bhuyar, president, professional teachers association (PTA), a pan-Maharashtra body of coaching institute owners, said one of the major demands is an increase in the permissible class size. ""Currently, the draft permits only 80 students per class, which we feel needs to be extended to 100. We also demand the formation of a regulatory body - a coaching class council that will have representation of class owners and government"", said Bhuyar.

Another provision that has been criticised is the mandate for all coaching class owners to provide a dedicated parking space. ""Most coaching classes are near the station. There is no need to have a dedicated parking area,"" Karnavat said.

Subhash Joshi, trustee, science parivar group of classes, said, ""The bill should consider the fact that classes thrive because of a competitive market. Excessive restrictions would neither benefit students nor classes"".

The first draft of the bill had been laid out in December 2017. Some of the provisions, that were included in the first draft but later removed owing to criticism by the association, include the setting of a cap on fees, giving discounts on fees and reservation of seats for economically backward students.

In a major blow to state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, the Supreme Court has also refused to entertain his plea seeking rejection of an election petition against him pending before the Gujarat High Court. The minister had moved the apex court against the rejection of his plea by the high court and the division bench of Justice AK Sikri and Justice R Subhash Reddy dismissed it on Monday.

The rejection of Chudasama's plea has paved the way for the hearing of the petition filed against him by his rival and Congress candidate Ashwin Rathod alleging that Chudasama won the assembly election through unfair means and his election be declared void.

Notably, high court's single judge bench of Justice Paresh Upadhyay, while rejecting the education minister's plea, had pronounced that Rathod's petition cannot be dismissed at the threshold and his contentions against Chudasama's election need to be tried. Interestingly, the minister had won the election by a wafer-thin margin of 327 votes and that too after the returning officer mysteriously rejected 429 votes through postal ballots, a number greater than the winning margin.

As per the case details, the Assembly elections for the Dholka constituency was held on December 14, 2017, and the results were declared on December 18. It was the contention of Rathod that the rejection of 429 votes received through postal ballots by the returning officer was illegal and resulted in Chudasama winning the election.

He had also contended that the then deputy collector of Dholka, Gaurang Prajapati, who was supposed to be the returning officer as per his designation was removed after the election code of conduct was implemented. In place of Prajapati, one Dhavan Jani was posted at Dholka with an aim to increase Chudasama's prospects of winning the election. Another argument of Rathod was that although the standing instruction of the Election Commission of India is that the postal ballots are to be counted before counting of votes on EVMs, the same was not followed. In fact, the postal ballots were counted only after counting of the EVM votes and after knowing that there was a narrow margin between the two contesting candidates.","Supreme Court refuses relief to Gujarat education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama","992911728","2018-11-13","https://www.dnaindia.com/ahmedabad/report-supreme-court-refuses-relief-to-gujarat-education-minister-bhupendrasinh-chudasama-2685101","Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India",FALSE

"909","","On re-election in 2016, the LDF government in Kerala had made it clear that it was committed to ensuring 100% literacy and providing access to education to every single person in the state. On Wednesday in a gesture that certainly furthers those promises, the state's education minister gifted a laptop to a 96-year-old woman who made history by becoming the oldest person to clear the state's literacy exam as part of the 'Aksharalaksham' mission.

Karthyayini Amma, who scored 98 marks out of 100 in the literacy exam at the age of 96 last month, had expressed her desire to learn how to operate a computer and also to write the class 10 equivalency exam soon. On Wednesday, C Raveendranath, the education minister, visited her home in Cheppad in Alappuzha district and gifted her the laptop. An overjoyed Karthayayini Amma who was taken by surprise with the gift, impressed the minister by typing her own name in English on the laptop.

Sources close to the minister said he visited her house when he was in the area to take part in an official engagement. When someone told him that the nonagenarian wanted a computer, he visited a shop nearby and bought a Dell laptop worth Rs 25000 and gifted it to her in an official capacity. Public education director KV Mohan kumar accompanied the minister.

Karthyayini Amma, who never went to school in her life and raised her family by working as a sweeper and domestic help, lives with her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren at a humble home in Cheppad. She enrolled herself for the literacy exam earlier this year and spent months preparing for the exam in August with the help of a teacher. She told the Indian Express last month that she was happy she scored 98%, but also a bit sad to lose out on two marks. She added she wanted to study as long as she was healthy.","Kerala: 96-year-old who cleared literacy exam wanted to learn computer, education minister gifts her one","988773863","2018-11-07","https://indianexpress.com/article/india/kerala-96-year-old-who-cleared-literacy-exam-wanted-to-learn-computer-education-minister-gifts-her-one-5437214/","The Indian Express",FALSE
"910","","Teachers, under the banner of Sanjha Adhiyapak Morcha, are protesting against the regularisation of 8,886 contractual teachers of Sarv Siksha Abhiyaan (SSA) and Rashtriya Madhyamik Siksha Abhiyaan (RMSA), due to which they will get a salary of Rs 15,000 per month, the entry-level pay, instead of their present salary of Rs 42,800.

Amid PROTEST by the regular and contractual teachers of Punjab government schools since October 7, Education Minister O P Soni termed the agitation 'uncalled for'. Teachers, under the banner of Sanjha Adhiyapak Morcha, are protesting against the regularisation of 8,886 contractual teachers of Sarv Siksha Abhiyaan (SSA) and Rashtriya Madhyamik Siksha Abhiyaan (RMSA), due to which they will get a salary of Rs 15,000 per month, the entry-level pay, instead of their present salary of Rs 42,800. Most teachers are on contract for the past 10 years. The minister spoke to The Indian Express, justifying the government decisions.

Teachers across the state, especially in the Chief Minister's home town Patiala, are sitting on dharna since October 7.

Our talks with the teachers are going on and a number of them have gone back to their schools, rather than sitting on dharna. Their fast unto death has also been withdrawn. We took a historic decision by taking 8,886 SSA/RMSA teachers on regular government rolls as they had been demanding it for long. They should be thankful to us for this decision, rather than protesting. Gradually this protest will fizzle out. Already numbers at dharnas are reducing with each passing day. In addition to this, 2,000 teachers have joined work, a few union leaders are not letting the others to join.

Teachers are talking about slash in the salary from Rs 42,800 per month to Rs 15,000 only. Your take on it?

It is not a slash. Rather we have given them an incentive of Rs 4,700. If a teacher joins on regular rolls, the starting salary is Rs 10,300 per month, but we have made it to lump sum Rs 15,000, looking at their work done in the previous years. They were on contract in SSA/RMSA and everything has been done in consultation with the teachers. I am surprised why they are protesting now. The probation period, which is three years, has been reduced to two-and-a-half years for them. Even if a PCS officer joins a government job, his/her starting salary is Rs 15,000 only. They will get all benefits of this job and moreover, it is not a compulsion for them to join at Rs 15,000. They can continue to remain on contract at Rs 42,800. Even in the past, many SSA/RMSA teachers had quit their contractual jobs and joined at Rs 10,300. So why a hue and cry now?

Why over 50 have been transferred to far-off areas?

The teachers, who are not reporting to their schools and participating in union activities, have been clearly told no work, no pay. When they did not relent, our next line of action was immediate transfers of all those who are not taking classes, rather forcing others to join dharnas. They can either be teachers or union leaders. So we have to act strict against the ones who take salary from the government and don't fulfill their duties. If they will not join their new stations, we will think of the next action.

What is the mode of payment to the SSA/RMSA teachers?

The SSA and RMSA are the societies introduced by the Centre, under which 60 per cent of the salary is being funded by the Union government and rest by the state. However, now the Centre has told us that they will pay a lump sum of Rs 15,000 per teacher per month only. Hence it is a huge financial burden on us to contribute the rest. Still, we are not forcing all to join on regular rolls. It is their choice to remain contractual or on regular rolls. After two-and-a-half years, when the probation period will end, the state government will have an additional burden of Rs 400 crore in form of perks to these teachers and we are ready to bear it, however, they also need to get serious and give quality education.

Now teachers are pinning all hopes on November 5 meeting with the CM. Will you be part of it?

I am not aware of any meeting of teachers with the CM.

Teachers say the department is treating them very harshly.

We started with cordial talks and appeals, however, strict action needs to be taken if one flouts rules . Our primary aim is to make teachers available in schools and disciplinary action needs to be taken, if they are not teaching.","Teachers free to continue on contract: Punjab Education Minister O P Soni","984304260","2018-11-01","https://indianexpress.com/article/education/teachers-free-to-continue-on-contract-punjab-education-minister-o-p-soni-5430306/","The Indian Express",FALSE

Under fire for attacks on migrants in Gujarat, the state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasma on Friday described the migrant-labour force as 'brothers' and appealed to the businessmen state to ensure that the state's image of Vibrant Gujarat built by Prime Minister Narendra Modi should remain blemish-free.

""Under the leadership of Narendra Modi, Gujarat through the Vibrant Gujarat summits have built an image for itself across the globe in the past 15 years. It is our combined responsibility to ensure that this image of the state remains blemish-free,"" said Chudasma at an awards function of the Ahmedabad Vepari Mahajan, a body of small businessmen and traders that employ huge number of migrants as workforce. The minister was speaking in reference to a series of attacks on migrant labourers working in factories in Mehsana, Sabarkantha, Ahmedabad, Vadodara, and Gandhinagar. These attacks have lead to their exodus from the state.

Remembering a World War-II incident where the Maharaja of Jamnagar had sheltered a large number of Polish citizens, Chudasma told the gathering, ""I am remembering the Polish incident because today migrants are the talk of the town. We have given shelter to even the Polish, and these migrants are our brothers."" The minister recounted how the Polish survivors recently visited Jamnagar to express their gratitude to the Maharaja.

""At your respective workplaces... at some place there might be a brother from Uttar Pradesh who will be doing a small job. They should not be treated differently. They should be sheltered with love,"" he remarked.

Earlier, speaking at the occasion, Harshad Gilletwala, president of Ahmedabad Vepari Mahajan pointed out that 70 percent of the workforce employed by the businessmen to load their goods carriers are migrants. ""You guys should also see who is instigating and spoiling the atmosphere,"" he added.

""Many colleges still don't have a sufficient number of students due to the dip in the quality of education. It was due to the unscientific approach by a section of people who opened colleges without any study. A student will get admission in an engineering college by securing only two per cent.

"923","","In a major blow to state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, the Gujarat High Court on Tuesday upheld a petition that challenged his election from the Dholka constituency in the Assembly elections held in 2017.

Notably, the minister had moved the court seeking rejection of an election petition filed against him by his rival, and Congress candidate, Ashwin Rathod alleging that Chudasama won the election through unfair means and that his election be declared void.

The single-judge bench of justice Paresh Upadhyay, while rejecting the education minister's plea, pronounced that Rathod's petition cannot be dismissed at the threshold and his contentions against Chudasama's election need to be tried.

Interestingly, the minister had won the election by a wafer-thin margin of 327 votes and that too after the returning officer mysteriously rejected 429 votes through postal ballots, a number greater than the winning margin.

As per the case details, the Assembly elections for the Dholka constituency were held on December 14, 2017, and the results were declared on December 18. Rathod's contention is that the rejection of 429 votes received through postal ballots was illegal and resulted in Chudasama winning the election.

He has also contended that the then deputy collector of Dholka, Gaurang Prajapati, who was supposed to be the returning officer as per his designation, was removed after the election code of conduct was implemented. In place of Prajapati, a Dhavan Jani was posted at Dholka with an aim to increase Chudasama's prospects of winning the election.

Another argument of Rathod was that although the standing instructions of the Election Commission of India are that the postal ballots were to be counted before counting of votes on EVMs, the same was not followed. In fact, the postal ballots were counted only after counting of the EVM votes and after knowing that there was a narrow margin between the two contesting candidates.

After considering the contentions from both the parties, the court pronounced that the election petition of Rathod discloses enough cause of action and meets with all the requirements of the Representation of the People Act. Therefore, the contentions raised require a trial to adjudicate whether the election in question needs to be declared void, the court added.","Gujarat High Court blow to education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama","965680186","2018-10-10","https://www.dnaindia.com/ahmedabad/report-gujarat-high-court-blow-to-education-minister-bhupendrasinh-chudasama-2673679","Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India",FALSE
"924","","Warning teachers of Sanjha Morcha Teacher Union who are sitting on dharna in Patiala, Punjab school education minister Om Parkash Soni on Monday asked them warned to either join duty or be ready to face action as ""they are spoiling the future of innocent students which is not tolerable"".

He asked the teachers sitting on dharna to join the duty as the the school exams are round the corner.

Soni said, ""The decision of regularising these teachers, who earlier were under societies being run with funds provided by the Union government, was taken after conducting three decisive meetings with their union leaders.Now, they are misguiding the other teachers due to their individual interests.""

He said, these leaders should not spoil the future of innocent students just for their personal gains and if this is their hidden agenda they should join politics rather.

The cabinet minister, who was here to attend district-level sports programme, pointed out that the state government had earlier regularised 800 teachers working under these societies and they were getting only basic pay.

""These newly regularised teachers are getting more salaries (₹5,000 per month) than the teachers who had been regularised earlier. Instead of being thankful to the state government, few teacher union leaders are misguiding the other teachers just to fulfil their individual interests,"" he said.

He said, state government has decided to regularise the services of these teachers keeping in mind their better future, adding, they should welcome the decision.

Soni also said that the state government was also considering regularising the services of employees and teachers, working under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan in government schools.","Join duty or face action, Punjab school education minister OP Soni warns agitating teachers","964959955","2018-10-09","https://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/join-duty-or-face-action-punjab-school-education-minister-op-soni-warns-agitating-teachers/story-7FH6hsxCSMXynzNmIBj6BI.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE

Once again rupee is in crisis and has depreciated by nearly 5 percent since August, 2018, from rupees 68.7 per US dollar to nearly rupees 73 per US dollar by October 5, 2018. Prime Minister Modi has taken over the command to manage this crisis. If we see overall depreciation it's more than 13 percent during 2018. Present decline in rupee value has been primarily due to outflow of foreign institutional investors and rising crude prices.

Conflicting Signals

Whereas, generally people are worried due to depreciating rupee, those at the helm of the economic affairs are busy making their own, generally personal views about the value of rupee, which is sending conflicting signals. Recently Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog expressed the view that rupee is overvalued and therefore it is expected to fall further. The former Chief Economic Advisor before leaving India had expressed similar views. Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Garg had said that rupee can go even to rupees 80 per US dollar. Interestingly Prime Minister Modi during his last election campaign had criticized these UPA regimes for having ruined the rupee. Under these circumstances constantly falling rupee and irresponsible statements by important Government functionaries are actually causing embarrassment to the Government.

RBI's Role

As Central Bank of the economy Reserve Bank of India, is considered to be the custodian and controller of foreign currency. Though the exchange rate (value of rupee in terms of foreign currency) is determined by the market forces of demand and supply, role of RBI's interventions is also of great importance. Supply of dollars comes from the export of goods and services and also by inflow of foreign investment, both FDI and portfolio investment. On the other hand, demand for dollar comes from import for goods and services and outflow of foreign investment. If demand for dollars exceeds supply for dollar rupee depreciates, and more rupees are shed for every dollar. Same is happening at present as outflow of FIIs and rising crude prices are causing demand for dollars exceed their supply. Therefore, the rupee is depreciating. If RBI intervenes and raises the supply of dollars picking from its foreign exchange reserves, it can stem the fall of rupee. Till a few days back RBI was not inclined to do the same.

Is RBI's Approach Appropriate?

Approach of the RBI, not to intervene in foreign exchange market, does not seem to be appropriate for many reasons. When the present regime took over the reign of power in 2014, foreign exchange reserves of India were hardly 312.4 billion dollars, which have increased to more than 400 billion dollars at present. In raising these reserves, net foreign institutional investment has a great contribution. It is interesting when FIIs bring money into India, the same is absorbed by RBI and rupee is generally not allowed to appreciate, while when they take their money out increase in the demand for dollars cause rupee to depreciate. The underlined concern of RBI has generally been that appreciation of rupee may impact exports adversely. However, when FIIs money outflows, RBI leaves the market forces on their own whims, saying that it will not intervene. This approach is fundamentally inappropriate, because if RBI absorbs dollars when FIIs bring money, why doesn't RBI supply dollars when they go out?

What Can We Do?

It is true that Government does not have any control on the factors causing the depreciation of rupee in the recent past. Rising oil prices are leading to increase in Current Account Deficit (CAD). On the other hand increase in interest rates by US Federal Reserves and reduction in income tax rates by US administration are encouraging reverse flow of investment by FIIs. However, in the long run Government has a role to play in reducing the outflow of money by FIIs by making efforts to disciplining them. It is notable that FIIs do not pay any taxes on their profits. Therefore, they don't have any obligation on transfer of money overnight. The government can impose a minimum 'lock-in-period' on the investments made by these FIIs, to keep them invested in India. In some countries tax is imposed on conversion of currency by FIIs, which is known as 'Tobin Tax'. This may also discourage the outflow of investment by FIIs.

In the past few days the major reason for the depreciation of rupee has been the net sale of securities by FIIs and taking the money out of India. In such a situation demand for dollars increase overnight and in view of generally low supply of dollars rupee depreciates. A small scarcity of dollars causes a big fall in value of rupee. However, if we see, India doesn't have any deficiency of dollars per se. Today India is sitting at huge stock of foreign exchange reserves to the tune of more than 400 billion US dollars. Since the beginning of the year 2018 foreign exchange reserves have declined hardly by 11 billion US dollars, despite huge outflow of portfolio investment and rising crude prices. In the last one month FIIs have sent hardly 1.3 billion US dollars abroad. Extra burden on the economy due to increase in crude prices has been nearly 10 billion US dollars since the beginning of 2018. Since our foreign exchange reserve are more than sufficient to meet additional demand for dollar due to above mentioned factors, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) can easily intervene in the foreign exchange market to stem any depreciation of Indian rupee.

RBI intervention may be win-win for economy

We must understand that depreciation of rupee means a burden on economy. It increases the cost of debt servicing by both private sector and the Government. Cost of foreign travel and education also increases and so does the inflation. Foreign exchange reserves give promise to deal with the future payment problems, however, they do not earn any significant income. It is important to stabilize the value of rupee, to save the economy from problems related to depreciating rupee. Today Indian economy is in good shape, as GDP is rising fast with both industrial and agricultural production increasing and inflation is also under control. Therefore, Reserve Bank of India does not need to worry on that account. RBI's shying away from intervening into the foreign exchange market does not serve any purpose. Let's hope that the good sense will prevail and RBI will intervene to stabilize the rupee.

HARYANA EDUCATION Minister Ram Bilas Sharma will now be teaching at Government Senior Secondary School at Koti village of Morni hills in Panchkula district, once every month. The school is located around 45 kms from Panchkula.

""My decision will also draw the local administration's attention towards this school. I have already taught in 1996 and will now do so again after a long hiatus.

After Chandigarh Newsline, in a series of stories, highlighted the plight of at least 100 students of this school who come from nearby villages and have to cross a 20-foot-high water pipeline over the Ghaggar to reach school daily, Sharma visited the school on Friday and spoke with the teachers and students.

For these students, who come to school daily from villages covered under three gram panchayats, Bhoj Koti, Rajji Tikri and Thandog, Sharma has directed officers of the district administration and PWD to construct a proper bridge that would allow students to cross the river safely. PWD officials told Newsline that construction of the bridge shall commence by October 15 and it will be completed before next monsoon.

The school also has a number of students who walk long distances daily from village Johrian to reach Koti. For them, Sharma directed the education department to arrange daily transport service. ""During my interaction with the school authorities, I learnt that many students have to walk long distances daily to reach school.

"934","","The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi inaugurated the Conference on Academic Leadership on Education for Resurgence in Vigyan Bhawan today in which the Vice-Chancellors/Directors from more than 350 universities participated. The conference was organized jointly by UGC, AICTE, ICSSR, IGNCA, IGNOU, JNU and SGT University. Union Minister for Human Resource Development Shri Prakash Javadekar and MoS, HRD Dr Satya Pal Singh were also present on the occasion.

Speaking on the occasion the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi said that when one thinks of resurgence or revival, the first image that comes to mind is of Swami Vivekananda, who presented before the world, the strength of Indian thought.

The Prime Minister recalled Swami Vivekananda's emphasis on self-reliance, character building, and human values, as elements of education. The Prime Minister said innovation is another vital element of education today.

Recalling the ancient Indian texts, the Vedas, the Prime Minister said that we cannot imagine our society, our country, and even our lives, without knowledge. He said that our ancient universities such as Taxila, Nalanda and Vikramshila, gave importance to innovation, besides knowledge. The Prime Minister also recalled the views on education of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, Deendayal Upadhyay, and Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia.

Shri Narendra Modi said that today, no country or person can live in isolation. He mentioned the importance of thinking in terms of 'global citizen' or 'global village.' He said our Universities and Colleges should be leveraged to find solutions to the challenges facing us. We should ""Interlink Institutions to Innovate and Incubate"", he added. He urged students to link their classroom learnings to the aspirations of the country. He also mentioned Atal Tinkering Labs which have been set up to encourage children to innovate. He mentioned the RISE - Revitalization of Infrastructure and Systems in Education -programme for improving education infrastructure. He mentioned the steps taken for higher education.

The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of preparing good teachers for society. He also said that scholars and students can take responsibility for spreading digital literacy, and generating greater awareness of government programmes that can improve ease of living.

The Prime Minister said that the youth has given ""Brand India"" a global identity. He mentioned schemes such as Start Up India, Stand Up India and Skill India, which are aimed at nurturing young talent.

The theme of the Conference is to deliberate on the challenges facing the Indian education system and to work out a plan for a paradigm shift both in terms of achieving academic outcomes and also in regulation of education.

While addressing the gathering, Shri Prakash Javadekar lauded the vision and mission of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in providing holistic development in education sector with a stress on research and innovation. Shri Javadekar said that without innovation a nation cannot achieve sustainable growth, so the Ministry of Human Resource Development has taken a number of initiatives like IMPRINT, Smart India Hackathon (SIH), GIAN, SWAYAM and National Digital Library (NDL) to change the structure of the entire education system in this direction. The minister said that high technology research labs are being developed to promote brain gain as innovation in higher education is a key focus to support research within the country. He also informed that the budget allocation of Rs 1,00,000 crore for Revitalising Infrastructure and Systems in Education (RISE) will also help to step up investment in research and related infrastructure. Government is promoting quality education in identified aspirational districts through RUSA, he added.

Shri Javadekar said that to ensure quality education, the ministry has developed learning outcomes, which will fix accountability on education providers. He also informed that for the overall development of students government has started ' Samagra Siksha' in which government is providing financial assistance to all government schools for library and sports and extended hostel facility for Katurba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya. The Union Minister congratulated all organizers for organizing the conference.

The Conference inaugurated by the Prime Minister, will have several sessions covering eight thematic areas namely:

The valedictory session will be chaired by Shri Prakash Javadekar, Minister for Human Resource Development in which each of the eight groups will make presentation on the course of action that they have agreed upon. This will be debated further in the Plenary Session and it is expected that a comprehensive action plan would emerge for improving the higher education sector in the country.

This Conference is in continuation of the efforts being made by the Ministry for evolving an action plan for transformation of the higher education sector.

"936","","In an interview to HT, school education minister Om Parkash Soni, a five-time MLA inducted into the cabinet five months ago, was candid in admitting serious deficiencies in the state's school education system and talked about hard steps needed to bring any meaningful change.

Abysmal results, dip in enrolment, lopsided teacher deployment and frequent protests by teachers - these are not just some of the myriad problems that the school education department in Punjab is grappling with. But they are also symptomatic of a deeper rot in the education system. In an interview to HT, school education minister Om Parkash Soni, a five-time MLA inducted into the cabinet five months ago, was candid in admitting serious deficiencies in the state's school education system and talked about hard steps needed to bring any meaningful change. Excerpts:

What are your focus areas?

In the last 10-12 years, the graph of school education in Punjab has gone down quite a lot. The exam results were 50% to 60% last year. In border areas, these were 20% to 25%. With such poor results, we realised it is time to stem the rot, especially in border districts. And, this has been my first priority in the past five months. When we looked into reasons for such dismal performance, we found teachers were not coming to schools or not paying attention. Another alarming finding was that they had engaged some persons to teach on their behalf or even tied up with fellow teachers to take classes on alternate days. We are making biometric attendance compulsory.

Special teams have been deployed. Another priority is border districts such as Gurdaspur, Tarn Taran, Amritsar, Ferozepur and Fazilka where we plan to open 100 model schools. Also, 3,500 newly recruited teachers have been given postings there.

Student enrolment in government schools has seen a sharp dip in the last 7-8 years. What are you doing to check this exodus?

If there is no quality education, what will the parents do? They want to give quality education to their children and are sending them to private schools. In government schools, most children are from poor families, be it from the Scheduled Castes or general category, because their parents cannot afford private schools. First, it was terrorism and then successive governments did not pay attention to school education. We need to ensure quality. Only then will children come to our schools.

NCERT had recently conducted an assessment of learning achievement of students of classes 3, 5, 8 & 10 in which Punjab fared badly. How do you plan to change this?

Teacher availability is one part, but that alone will not help. We have started making efforts to improve the quality of education, facilities and infrastructure in schools by ensuring timely delivery of books, regular assessment of leaning achievement, healthy classroom environment, proper sitting arrangements, availability of clean drinking water and good quality midday meal.

About 2,100 schools are being upgraded to 'smart schools' this year at Rs 64 crore and additional classrooms are being constructed in schools. We are also providing free uniform to 14.43 lakh children at Rs 90 crore, setting up solar system in 880 schools, installing RO systems in 1500 schools and giving library books.

The government had made a similar promise to deliver textbooks on time this year, but failed.

I know books could not be delivered on time. After I took over five months ago, we have reviewed the process. Corrective steps are being taken. Textbooks will be delivered one month in advance next year. They will have good quality paper and proper watermarks. No outside books will be allowed.

Class 12 students are still waiting for their history book. Why the expert committee headed by historian Kirpal Singh is taking so long?

As you know, the book was ready, but some political parties raised a ruckus over its contents. The expert committee is reviewing its contents and the syllabus. They gave three chapters which have been put online. The complete book will be ready in the next one-and-a-half months.

There is serious imbalance in teacher deployment with surplus teachers in urban areas and schools in rural and border areas facing a severe shortage.

How serious is the government about teacher rationalisation?

The policy has been approved. We are posting teachers to rural schools and wherever they are fewer in number. It is an ongoing process. As there is shortage, additional recruitment will be done.

The online transfer policy has worked well in several states. Why has Punjab abandoned the policy after it was cleared by the cabinet?

If someone is teaching well and there is no complaint, why shift him or her after a fixed number of years. If a teacher is sent to a school located 100 km away from home, he or she will not work. What is the logic? If one is teaching well, what is the harm if he or she remains there? The department has allowed transfer of differently abled teachers, those suffering from serious ailments, widows or unmarried ones on compassionate grounds. We are trying to fill up all vacant posts. There will be no mass transfer of teachers during the next three years. Frequent transfers disrupt education and teachers are not able to develop connect with children. We are clear on this.

Teachers' unions are demanding regularisation of 27,000 contractual and other temporary teachers. What is stopping the government?

Yes, these unions have been holding protests. In democracy, it is their right to protest. Why disrupt classes and waste time of children? I have told them I will not allow this. We have taken stringent action. I will transfer teachers who disturb education 200 kilometres away.

The government is considering their demands. I am meeting union leaders again two-three days later. If someone talks of dharna, I don't talk to them. As for their demand, the regularisation of services of 8,896 teachers of SSA, RMSA, etc. will be approved shortly.

The department proposes to cut the salary of these teachers to ₹10,300 per month on regularisation from ₹30,000 to ₹35,000 they are currently drawing. This is lower than the minimum wage for semi-skilled labour. Is this fair?

No doubt these teachers have been working for the past 10 years or so, but the government policy is to pay a fixed monthly sum for first three years on regularisation. There are other compulsions too. The government is trying to find a way. We are thinking of giving them an allowance of Rs 5,000 in addition to Rs 10,300 per month.

Chief minister Amarinder Singh is keen on English and foreign languages such as French, Chinese and German in government schools. Any update?

If we don't teach English to our children, they will not be able to compete. We have introduced English as medium of instruction in several schools and expand it. CM is also keen on foreign languages and wants all this to be done quickly. This can't be done in one go. We will do this in stages.","'Frequent teacher transfers disrupt system' says Punjab school education minister OP Soni","955796582","2018-09-27","https://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/frequent-teacher-transfers-disrupt-system-says-punjab-school-education-minister-op-soni/story-VC4dRcgaqEsOWerVY68KfL.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE

"940","","Union Minister for Minority Affairs Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi today said that the foundation stone of first world class educational institute for poor, backward and Minorities will be laid at Alwar in Rajasthan on 01 October, 2018.

While chairing the 57 meeting of General Body and 101 meeting of Governing Body of Maulana Azad Educational Foundation, Shri Naqvi said that the educational institution, being set up in Alwar, will start functioning in 2020.

Shri Naqvi said that the Rajasthan Government has given 15 acres of land in Kohrapipali village in Kishangarh Bas tehsil of Alwar district for this educational institute. World class research centres, labs, libraries, educational facilities for primary to higher studies and sports facilities will be established here. He said that these world class institutions will provide education in technical, medical, Ayurved, Unani and job-oriented skill development courses etc. We have proposed 40 per cent reservation for girls in these institutions.

A 3-member committee of Minority Affairs Ministry's officials and members of the Maulana Azad Education Foundation has been constituted to chalk out the entire process of the institute at Alwar. Soon, the detailed project report (DPR) will be prepared regarding construction and other process for the institute. The Minority Affairs Ministry had worked out on a plan a year ago to establish world class educational institutes for poor, backward and Minorities and a 11-member committee, headed by former Secretary, Govt. of India, Shri Afzal Amanullah, had been constituted in this regard.

In the 57 meeting of General Body and 101 meeting of Governing Body of Maulana Azad Educational Foundation, various schemes for educational empowerment of minorities, ""Begum Hazrat Mahal Girls Scholarship"", ""Gharib Nawaz Kaushal Vikas Yojana"", other scholarship programmes were reviewed.

Shri Naqvi said that during the last about 4 years, the Central Government's ""Empowerment without Appeasement"" policy has ensured that record about 3 crore students belonging to poor and weaker sections of Minorities have been benefitted from various scholarship programmes. The beneficiaries include about 1 crore 63 lakh girls.

Shri Naqvi said that school dropout rate among Muslim girls, which was earlier more than 70 per cent, has now been reduced to about 35-40 per cent due to awareness and educational empowerment programmes of the Government. Our goal is to bring it down to zero per cent. Transparent and hassle-free scholarship system has played a key role in this endeavour. This year, ""National Scholarship Portal Mobile App"" (NSP Mobile App) has been launched which will ensure a smooth, accessible and hassle-free scholarship system for students from poor and weaker sections.

Shri Naqvi said that Ministry of Minority Affairs has worked with commitment to ""3E- Education, Employment & Empowerment"". In the last about one year, thousands of educational institutions of all Minority communities including Madarsas, have been included in the mainstream education system by connecting them with ""3T-Teacher, Tiffin, Toilet"".","Union Minister for Minority Affairs Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi Chairs 57th Meeting of General Body and 101st Meeting of Governing Body of Maulana Azad Education Foundation","954390321","2018-09-25","http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=183673","pib.nic.in",FALSE
"941","","State Education Minister Partha Chatterjee on Friday said that educational institutions in West Bengal will not observe Surgical Strike Day on September 29, as directed by University Grants Commission (UGC).

State Education Minister Partha Chatterjee on Friday said that educational institutions in West Bengal will not observe Surgical Strike Day on September 29, as directed by University Grants Commission (UGC).

Criticising the Centre's move, the minister said, ""This is an agenda of the BJP and it is trying to push this agenda by using UGC, ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. It is a matter of shame that they are using UGC to spread their political agenda. We would have understood if it had asked us to observe the day to honour sacrifices made by our soldiers. We have full respect for our soldiers and their sacrifices.""

Coming under criticism over the UGC circular, Union HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar Friday said that it was just an advisory and that nothing was made mandatory.

""The allegations are ridiculous and false because we have not made any compulsions, neither to the institutions nor to the students. We have issued a programme because there was a suggestion from many students and teachers that we need to commemorate second anniversary of the surgical strike. Therefore on 29th of September we have asked the colleges, those who want to do, can arrange a lecture and the lecture by an ex-Army officer who can describe to the students how the country gets defended,"" Javadekar said.

""This information needs to reach students, it's not political,"" he said.

In a letter to vice-chancellors on Wednesday, the UGC suggested that institutions ask students to ""pledge their support"" to the armed forces through letters and cards, which the government will use for publicity.

""All the NCC units will have special parade on that day. That is also good. Where is the politics in it? This is patriotism,"" Javadekar said. ""We never mandate anything, we just suggested. We don't make anything compulsory,"" he added.

Asked why the government did not observe the first anniversary and chose to do so in the second year just ahead of the elections in key states, Javadekar said, ""Every time is good for noble acts.""

The state education minister also slammed the central government for trying to malign the image of the Indian Army. ""The Indian Army has always been above politics and controversies. But now we are witnessing that the BJP is trying to malign its image and politicise the Indian Army. This is not right and we won't support it,"" he said.

BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said, ""This is nothing new as we had seen earlier how West Bengal government opposed directions by the UGC. We are not surprised at all.""

Earlier, the state government had criticised Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi for witting a letter to vice-chancellors of state universities advising them to celebrate International Yoga Day on June 21. The state government had defied Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) and UGC circular on the same issue and had asked state-run schools not to observe International Yoga Day. The state education department had organised a separate yoga competition among state-run schools later.

In September last year, the state government had refused to follow MHRD guidelines on how to celebrate Teacher's Day in state-run schools.

"942","","KOLKATA: A day after two former students of Darivit High School in Uttar Dinajpur district of West Bengal were shot dead in alleged police firing during a protest against appointment of Urdu teachers, state education minister Partha Chatterjee claimed that Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) cadres were brought from 'outside' to foment trouble and politicise the deaths. ""RSS cadres were brought from outside to foment trouble in the school and politicise the unfortunate deaths,"" he said.

However, state BJP president Dilip Ghosh denied RSS involvement and demanded CBI inquiry into the incident.

Rajesh Sarkar died after being shot at allegedly by police on Thursday while another former student Tapas Barman succumbed to his injuries at North Bengal Medical College and Hospital in Siliguri on Friday. The school witnessed pitched battles between students and police on Thursday after students protested appointment of Urdu teachers and demanded Science, Computer and Bangla teachers instead.

However, Uttar Dinajpur superintendent of police Sumit Kumar said: ""Seven people have been arrested in connection with the incident of which some are BJP supporters. We have not yet received the post-mortem reports to know the cause of death. There was a violent mob at the school which had illegal firearms and bombs so we don't yet know whose guns killed the two people. Police had not opened fire on the protesters.""

On the other hand, education minister Partha Chatterjee removed district inspector of education Rabindra Kumar Mondal from his post on Friday after the incident and said the education ministry was in the dark over the appointment of Urdu teachers.

""A DI has no rights to appoint teachers on their own. Education ministry was kept in the dark. We had no information about the appointment. We are also scrutinising the role of the school principal who did not seek any permission for appointing new teachers,"" he said.

Despite the police washing off its hand from the incident, victims' relatives claimed that cops with masked faces had shot the two students with silencer-fitted guns.""My son was supervising construction work at our shop outside our residence when he was shot by a policeman who was wearing blue uniform and had his face covered with a black cloth,"" deceased Tapas Barman's mother said.

On the other hand, deceased Rajesh Sarkar's niece Bhiti Sarkar said that police used silencer-fitted guns 'to silence' his uncle. ""Policemen tore off clothes of girl students and verbally abused them. When my uncle protested against it, they shot at him with a silencer gun,"" she said.

The BJP said the TMC government has made it a practice to oppose each and every decision of the central government.

On September 29 in 2016, the Indian Army carried out 'surgical strikes' on seven terrorist launchpads across the LoC as a response to an attack on its base in Uri earlier that month. The Indian Army had said its special forces inflicted ""significant casualties"" on terrorists waiting there to cross onto the Indian territory.

""This is an agenda of the BJP and it is trying to push this agenda by using the UGC ahead of elections. It is a matter of shame that they are using the UGC to achieve their political agenda. We won't abide by the directions of UGC,"" Chatterjee said.

The University Grants Commission yesterday directed varsities and higher education institutions across the country to observe September 29 as ""Surgical Strike Day"".

Talk sessions by ex-servicemen about sacrifices by the armed forces, special parades by NCC and visit to exhibitions are among the prescribed events by the University Grants Commission for the celebration.

""Various educational officers should coordinate to help the schools for preparing the action plan. DDEs should ensure that the master plans will bear fruit. The priority of the action plan should be to ensure the completion of 200 working days in the academic year as several school days were lost due to rain and flood,"" Raveendranath said.

He also listed out three priorities that need to be done as part of a quality improvement programme.

""In the academic monitoring process, the DDEs should instruct school authorities to take special care of those students who are poor at studies. Proper planning is needed before the periodical monitoring at schools. We can't compromise on academic excellence. So the DDEs are also responsible for the academic performance of students.

"949","","THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state higher education system could see a drastic change with Minister for Higher Education KT Jaleel making a slew of recommendations for the good conduct of university examinations. He advised syndicate members of various universities in the state on Monday for the conduct of odd semester examinations of degree courses at college level itself.

The minister said universities could directly conduct the examination of even semesters and the grade for the whole result of the course has to be decided based on this system. Jaleel also made it clear that the results for the final semester UG examinations should come before April 30 while the results for PG examinations should come before May 31.

Other major recommendations were to change the old pattern of examinations and to make the question papers and answer sheets available online. The valuation should begin immediately after the examinations. Jaleel made a point to the syndicate members on the recognition of certain courses between the universities in the state.

""Many students are struggling to get admission in a university if they transfer from other universities because of the grade is given to a course based on a university. So this should be prevented. For instance, some students who pass out from foreign and national universities are being told to produce equivalent course eligibility certificates,"" said Jaleel.

He also said that a State Assessment and Accreditation Council (SAAC) would be formulated soon to evaluate the performance of self-financing colleges. University syndicate members were also asked to make necessary changes in SAAC based on districts and areas. Jaleel also asked syndicates to avoid delay over the distribution of degree certificates to the students. He said the certificates should also be made available online and the research area should get proper attention.

""A research consortium should be formed. Centralised Instrumentation facility should be implemented. All necessary materials for the research programmes should be available at all universities. A proper co-ordination between universities is required for hassle-free research programmes. Each university should admit at least 100 foreign students in each academic year.

"950","","CHENNAI: Private schools may once again stop giving importance to Class 11 syllabus as the government has withdrawn its proposal to give a consolidated higher secondary mark sheet, say some teachers' associations.

On Saturday, School Education minister KA Sengottaiyan, announced that separate mark sheets each for 600 marks will be issued for Classes 11 and 12. He also said Class 12 mark sheet alone will be enough for higher education. ""We received complaints that students get too stressed and are unable to deal with the pressure. In order to ease the pressure on students, we decided that only Class 12 marks will be sufficient for higher education,"" the minister told reporters on Saturday.

The government last year, introduced board exams for Class 11 and a consolidated mark sheet, to ensure that schools do not give unequal importance to Class 12. The composite mark sheets of both years put together was brought in, as students performed poorly in first year of college, which is based on Class 11 syllabus.

""In government schools, we always give equal importance to both Class 11 and 12. But, private schools rush through the first year, give importance to Class 12 exams and score better and make it to the better colleges,"" said KPO Suresh, president of Tamil Nadu Post Graduate Teachers' Association, adding that this may even lead to students migrating to private schools.

""Students who go to private schools have better exposure and can get privately coached for competitive exams. School is the only exposure for government school students. When Class 11 public exam's importance is reduced, students will not have incentive to study well,"" he said.

However, teachers from private schools welcomed the decision. ""Simply knowing that their higher education will depend on only 600 marks and not 1,200 marks will reduce a lot of stress on them,"" said A Mayavan, a history teacher.","Private schools may neglect Class 11 syllabus again: School Education minister KA Sengottaiyan","948063285","2018-09-16","http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2018/sep/17/private-schools-may-neglect-class-11-syllabus-again-school-education-minister-ka-sengottaiyan-1872945.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

"953","","Dear Sir,

We, the Scholars/researchers/academicians from Nagaland working and pursuing studies from various universities across the country, are writing to you to express our deep concern and thereby draw your kind attention with regard to the failure to advertise the newly created post of 68 Assistant professors and Librarian in the recently advertised Common Education Services Examination 2018 by the Nagaland Public Service Commision. As you are well aware that the state cabinet has approved the creation of 110 Assistant Professors posts to be recruited within the year 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 vide the Office Memorandum No. CAB 2/ 2013, Sl. No 5, dated 4th of July 2018. The office memorandum clearly mentions that 68 of the 110 posts were to be created within the year 2018-2019 and the remaining 42 within 2019-2020.

Accordingly, the honourable Governor of Nagaland has given his consent by approving the recruitment of the 68 posts on the 9th of August, 2018, through the notification No. HE/ESTT/2-6/207. It may be humbly mentioned that both documents- the notification and the office memorandum of the state cabinet- were widely circulated in social media.

As such, the decision of the State Cabinet to create a sizable number of Assistant Professor posts for the year 2018-19 has been a positive departure from the existing trends.

Hence, this noble decision taken under your able leadership is a testimony of you giving due importance to meritocracy and bettering the quality of higher Education in the state; your decision has also been widely commended and welcomed by the academic fraternity. In view of this, all NET/PhD qualified, assistant professor aspirants have been waiting in great anticipation for the announcement of the said posts by the NPSC. However, much to our disappointment, when the Nagaland

Public Service Commission advertised the Common Education Service Examination, 2018, for various posts of Assistant Professor and Post Graduate Teacher, the 68 posts meant to be recruited within 2018-2019 were not included. On enquiry, the Department of Higher and Technical Education has responded that it is yet to requisition the 68 posts to the Nagaland Public Service Commission. With the last date of applications, as advertised, fixed on the 21st of September, 2018,

apprehension has risen among the academic fraternity with regard to the fate of the 68 posts of Assistant Professors and librarian, which are clearly earmarked for the year 2018-19; and whether the exams can be conducted along with the recently advertised posts.

Therefore, in light of the above, we appeal to your esteemed office to kindly restore our faith and requisition the 68 posts (without any reservation of posts for regularisation for those appointed through backdoor) to the NPSC at the earliest for advertisement and ensure that the exams for the mentioned posts be conducted along with the recently advertised Common Education Service Examination, 2018.

It is felt that your timely intervention will go a long way in once again instilling faith among the thousands of young Naga aspirants in the recruitment system, in meritocracy and right to equal opportunity. It is also felt that your sagacity will be instrumental in giving hope to the future generation and in imparting better quality education.

The academic fraternity look forward to your positive response on this crucial matter of education.","Open Letter to Temjen Imna Along, the Honourable Minister of Higher Education, Nagaland","943589473","2018-09-10","http://www.easternmirrornagaland.com/open-letter-to-temjen-imna-along-the-honourable-minister-of-higher-education-nagaland/","Eastern Mirror",FALSE

At 2 pm on Friday, the HRD Ministry had organised a meeting of Javdekar with higher education ministers of 10 states, including Karnataka, through video conferencing. The meeting was to discuss the celebrations planned for the 150th birth anniversary of Mahathma Gandhi on October 2. The same was scheduled in the state higher education minister's daily engagements, and room number 118 at Vikasa Souda was booked for this.But the minister decided not to take part in the meeting.

""The minister had agreed to take part in the video conference meeting and everything was ready ... but at the last minute he decided to skip it just because he was wrongly advised by some people around him,"" he said.

Senior officials of the Higher Education Department were supposed to accompany the minister for the video conference, but they did not even bother to take it forward in the absence of the minister as far as efforts to translate it for the minister was concerned. And when the minister decided to skip it, the officials did not even bother to communicate the same to the HRD Ministry.

This is not the first time that Devegowda is doing this. He had expressed the same when a foreign university delegation came to meet him just after he had taken charge of the department. It was one of the reasons for him initially refusing to take charge of the portfolio when it was allocated to him.Moreover, when the higher education portfolio was allocated to him, he was trolled on social media for not completing his high school education.

"956","","The Minister of State for Human Resource Development, Dr. Satya Pal Singh lead a high level delegation to the G-20 Education Ministers' Meeting as well as Joint Ministerial Meeting held at Mendoza, Argentina on 5 & 6 September, 2018. It was the first ever meeting of Education Ministers in the history of G-20.

While speaking on the inaugural day in Educational Ministerial meeting, Dr Satya Pal Singh, appreciated and thanked Argentina for hosting an exclusive meeting of Education Ministers for first time in the history of G20 Summit. He said that Education should be the first and foremost priority area for any society to develop and for any country to flourish. Therefore, it is most appropriate to place education at the center of global agenda.

Dr Singh said that India has been cradle of civilization and culture since ancient time. In modern time, India without forgetting its ancient wisdom has been making rapid strides in the field of education. He said that Prime Minister Modi has given immense importance to the education and therefore, India, under his initiative, has devised the strategy for its development which has core components of Accessibility, Equity, Quality, Affordability, Accountability, and Employability. He said that education should be 'Child Centric' and it should develop students holistically to make them a good human being first and global citizen later. To translate above philosophy in action, India is designing a new education policy.

He mentioned that India is one of the largest education systems in the world with over 1.53 million schools, 864 Universities and enrolment of about 300 million students. Despite hosting such a large education system, India still needs further expansion to improve accessibility. Dr Singh said in last 4 years enormous work has been done to achieve the same. He highlighted the several digital initiatives of Modi Government which include India's own MOOCs platform SWAYAM, which has been facilitating and encouraging a large number of students to learn anytime, anywhere. He said a special emphasis has been laid for teachers training by setting up National Resource Centres in 75 specific disciplines for delivering online refresher courses for 1.3 million faculty in higher education institutions.

Dr Singh apprised the gathering about the various initiatives of Innovation Index ranking of higher educational institutions, Smart India Hackathon in both software and hardware to find solutions for the problems faced by the Government, Industry and Academia by young undergraduate students, Atal Tinkering Labs in schools and Research Parks in higher education institutions to promote the design thinking and innovation, and joint research projects with international collaboration.

He said that we believe that education system should not only provide education but should also address the needs of the community directly. To achieve this, Government in India has launched 'Unnat Bharat Abhiyaan' under which higher education Institutions adopt nearby villages and help them by proving technological solutions to their problems.

Dr Singh said that India is a major economy in the World and we fully understand and realize our roles and responsibilities for furthering the cause of education and evolution of human being. He assured India's full support to the agenda of G20 Education Ministers meeting.

With active help of India, G20 Education Ministers' Declaration 2018 was finalized. [Copy attached]

On the second day, Dr Satya Pal Singh addressed the Joint Ministerial Meeting which comprised the Education Ministers and Labor & Employment Ministers of member countries. He said that India enjoys demographic dividend as 52% of its population is below 25 years of age. While it is a unique advantage, it also poses a challenge to utilize them productively towards the development and progress of the country. Realizing this, the Prime Minister of India has launched 'Skill India mission' in 2015 with a view to skilling 400 million youth by 2022. Vocationalization of the education has been undertaken at a large scale. He apprised that National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) has been laid down under which learner can acquire the certification for competency needed at any level through formal, non-formal or informal learning, leading to Certificate, Diploma, Advanced Diploma, Degree and further advanced studies and research.

Dr Singh said that G20 is the most appropriate forum for the creation of a collaborative framework where transnational skilling standards are shared with countries.

He ended his address with once again thanking Argentinian Government and G20 Group for affording him an opportunity to showcase India's achievements, concerns and future plans. At the end of the meeting, G20 Joint Education & Labour and Employment Ministers' Declaration 2018 Mendoza Joint Meeting was released.

He showcased the progress made by India in the field of education. He said that while India has a lot to offer, it also desires to learn from other countries to take its education sector to greater height. Dr Singh apprised them about recently launched initiatives of India for international collaboration. He elucidated salient features of Study in India, GIAN (Global Initiatives for Academic Initiatives) and SPARC (Scheme for Promotion of Academic & Research Collaboration). Education Ministers showed keen interests in all these schemes and assured India full cooperation. Italy, China, Japan, and USA also agreed to have an MoU with India. It was decided that further talks may be held to work out more details to develop roadmap for further collaboration. Dr Satya Pal Singh assured them that India will provide all support in their endeavor for bilateral collaboration.

The two meetings included Ministers of Education and Ministers for Labour and Employment from member countries as well as representatives of International Organizations like the World Bank, UNESCO.","Minister of State for HRD, Dr. Satya Pal Singh successfully attended G20 Education Ministers' and Joint Ministerial Meeting at Mendoza, Argentina","941398724","2018-09-07","http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=183329","pib.nic.in",FALSE

He asked them to first take steps to provide five classrooms. He directed the engineer to immediately call for tender. Asking the authorities to provide the toilet facilities to women at the earliest, he said that if it was not possible for them, he would help in building the toilets.

Ramdas assured that he would talk to the Corporation authorities and arrange for drinking water facilities. As it is a Music University, lot of cultural programmes are held regularly. Hence, the students need a proper stage and auditorium to rehearse.

(If you don't clap in your teacher's honour, you will end up clapping outside every household in your next birth)

Traditionally, clapping at people's doorstep is a practice exercised by transgenders in India in order to seek donations for their livelihood. Also, the transgender community is looked down upon by the people.

Shah is not new to controversies. In 2013, he had to resign from his post of state's tribal minister after allegedly making derogatory remarks against BJP leader Nirmala Bhuria and the Chief Minister's wife Sadhna Singh. Shah made the alleged remarks while attending a summer camp in Jhabhua district.

In 2010, Shah had also faced criticism for organising belly dance show near a holy shrine in Malgaon.

It seems like the leaders of Bhartiya Janata Party are involved in a weird kind of competition as to who can speak the most nonsensical stuff that's possible. After BJP MLA from Mumbai Ram Kadam told youngsters during a Dahi Handi event on Janamashtmi that he will abduct girls for them if they did not respond to their advances, the next BJP member to join the bandwagon is Madhya Pradesh's Education Minister Kunwar Vijay Shah.

Addressing a gathering on the ocassion of Teacher's Day, Shah ridiculed transgenders of the nation. Speaking to youngsters, the education minister said that if they won't clap in the honour of their teacher, they will have to go and clap in front of every home in their next birth.

""Agar Guru ke samman mein apne taaliyan nahi bajayi to agle janam mein ghar ghar ja kar taaliyan bajani padengi"", Shah said. Such an insensitive comment coming from an education minister calls for some introspection for the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led BJP government in the central Indian state. The surprising part about his comment was that after he had made the derogatory statement about transgenders, he even laughed.

This is not the first instance when a BJP leader has made an insensitive or unscientific remark in a public gathering. Recently Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Dev had said that ducks raise the oxygen level in water bodies when they swim.

More recently, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was criticised for advising people in Mathura to read the Hanuman Chalisa to get rid of the notorious monkeys in the city. Speaking on the Ram Mandir issue, Adityanath had said that the date of construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya will be decided by Lord Ram himself.

"962","","Terming the Bhagwad Gita a ""non-religious"" text and ""a way of life"", Maharashtra Education Minister Vinod Tawde on Saturday said there is nothing communal in distributing the text in educational institutes.

Tawde also said the copies of holy books of other religions can also be given to colleges, provided they are made available for free.

Nowadays, even if anyone thinks of distributing the Gita in educational institutions, the move is seen as BJP's attempts of saffronising the education system, he alleged, blaming the media for ""projecting it that way"".

""Today, distribution of the Bhagwad Gita means one is communal. When will we come out of this mentality? Even a Class 1 child can be taught several aspects of life through the Gita,"" Tawde said at the launch of Bhaktivedanta Vidyapitha Research Centre at Girgaum in south Mumbai.

""The Gita, Vedas and Upanishads are not religious texts, but philosophical and scientific in nature and these texts should not just be confined to temples, but be made available to common man as they are a way of life,"" he said.

""If copies of the Quran and the Bible are provided free of cost, they will also be distributed in colleges,"" the minister said.

In July this year, the office of the Joint Director, Higher Education for Mumbai region had issued a letter asking NAAC 'A' and 'A+' ranked colleges in the city to collect the copies of the Gita from its office. The letter, however, did not mention which group or organisation gave the copies for distribution.

The move had kicked up a row with the opposition Congress calling it an effort to ""saffronise"" the education system.

""If anyone thinks of distributing Bhagwad Gita (in educational institutions), it is termed as BJP's attempts of saffronising the education system by newspapers and television channels,"" Tawde said.

"963","","Maharashtra Education Minister Vinod Tawde also said the copies of holy books of other religions can also be given to colleges, provided they are made available for free.

Terming the Bhagwad Gita a ""non-religious"" text and ""a way of life"", Maharashtra Education Minister Vinod Tawde said on Saturday there is nothing communal in distributing the text in educational institutes.

Tawde also said the copies of holy books of other religions can also be given to colleges, provided they are made available for free.

Nowadays, even if anyone thinks of distributing the Gita in educational institutions, the move is seen as BJP's attempts of saffronising the education system, he alleged, blaming the media for ""projecting it that way"".

""Today, distribution of the Bhagwad Gita means one is communal. When will we come out of this mentality? Even a Class 1 child can be taught several aspects of life through the Gita,"" Tawde said at the launch of Bhaktivedanta Vidyapitha Research Centre at Girgaum in south Mumbai.

""The Gita, Vedas and Upanishads are not religious texts, but philosophical and scientific in nature and these texts should not just be confined to temples, but be made available to common man as they are a way of life,"" he said.

""If copies of the Quran and the Bible are provided free of cost, they will also be distributed in colleges,"" the minister said.

In July this year, the office of the Joint Director, Higher Education for Mumbai region had issued a letter asking NAAC 'A' and 'A+' ranked colleges in the city to collect the copies of the Gita from its office. The letter, however, did not mention which group or organisation gave the copies for distribution.

The move had kicked up a row with the opposition Congress calling it an effort to ""saffronise"" the education system.

""If anyone thinks of distributing Bhagwad Gita (in educational institutions), it is termed as BJP's attempts of saffronising the education system by newspapers and television channels,"" Tawde said.

He said when Bhaktivedanta Trust of Bhiwandi in adjoining Thane district wanted to distribute the copies of the Gita in colleges, he informed them that the government itself cannot do so, but it could give a list of colleges to which the copies of the Gita could be provided.

Adityanath met Sunita, the officer's widow, and her two sons Shreya and Abhishek at his residence here. The elder son, Shreya, is studying MBA and Abhishek engineering. Assuring them all help, Adityanath said his government would not only take full responsibility of their education loans but would also give a government job to one of the family members.

In a letter to Podar International school in Nerul, the education officer has asked the school to take a decision on a change in the school's uniform only after the consent of the Parents Teachers Association (PTA).

The letter was sent to the school on April 23 by Sandeep Sangve, education officer of the education department of Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC). Parents of students attending the school's Nerul campus held a silent protest asking to roll back the new uniform decision. They have written a letter to the school's management stating, ""We, the parents of Podar International, totally and unanimously oppose the new uniforms on the basis of the following: Uncomfortable full sleeves shirts for the boys, light coloured bottoms for boys which are impractical for a place like Mumbai which is dusty, the light coloured skirts are a problem for our girls as they will easily stained, the Physical Training (PT) uniforms are gender discrimination that is pink tops for girls and blue for boys.""

It seems the education department issued the letter after the parents complained to the education officer. The letter also states that the school should not force parents to buy stationery from any particular shop. The school has also been asked to follow the government's school bus policy.

In an email, Hina Shah, CEO, Podar Education Group, said, ""A letter received by the school from the NMMC Education Department is being studied for further action. The School has already informed parents that feedback with regards to the new uniforms will be sought from the parents and appropriate changes made for the coming years. Parents have also been informed that during this transitional year, students can continue to wear the old design of uniforms for the first term. The school authorities have had multiple meetings with the PTA members and school parents directly to clear any such doubts. Podar International School - Nerul has provided parents with multiple options to purchase books and uniforms for the 2018-19 academic session. Parents are free to purchase the required items from online vendors and physical shops. There is no compulsion from the school side to purchase from any one vendor. The same has been clearly communicated to the parents. ""

While Class 12 students will have to sit for a re-exam of the Economics paper on April 25, the government last week said Class 10 students will not have to take an exam again for the CBSE Mathematics paper that was leaked before the exam last month.

The CBSE had announced that the re-examination for Class 12 Economics would be held on April 25.

To add to the surprise of many in the department and people visiting the office, he has also got the directive pasted on the notice board. Pamphlets displaying charan sparsh nishedh (touching of feet prohibited) have also been put up at prominent spots in the office.

The incident was reported from the office of the district inspector of schools (DIOS) in Bahraich. Rajesh Kumar Pandey passed this written order about two months ago.

However, the practice did not stop, forcing the officer to put the instructions on the notice board. No sooner I reached the office, there would be hoards of people waiting there just to touch my feet. It took me a lot of time just to get to my chamber and another group of people would be waiting for me there, Pandey said. The practice was not only limited to the DIOS, but extended to other influential officers of the department.

I agree that it is an age-old tradition of our Hindu culture, but does it look nice if a teacher who is sometimes elder to you touches your feet? This could also be termed as an extreme example of smarminess, or chatukarita, where people bow down to you and even touch your feet to get their work done, Pandey explained.

Though he refused to divulge the exact nature of favours, a visit to the DIOS office throws up enough hints.

However, the district collector on 18 January ordered for withdrawal of the circular with immediate effect and said a show cause notice was being served to the officer concerned to explain his action.

In the circular issued yesterday, Dewas district education officer (DEO) Rajiv Suryavanshi directed the principals and headmasters of all government and private schools to stop using the film's song, titled 'Ghoomar', during cultural programmes in their respective institutions.

""Shri Rashtriya Rajput Karni Sena has submitted a request letter in the honour of Maa Padmavati.

So, do not use 'Ghoomar' song in the cultural programmes in schools,"" reads the circular.

However, Dewas Collector Asheesh Singh said he has asked the education officer to withdraw the circular with immediate effect.

""I came to know about the circular this morning. Only the state government can issue such circulars. The DEO is not entitled to pass such an order. I have directed the DEO to immediately withdraw this order,"" Singh told PTI.

He said the DEO is also being served a show cause notice to explain his action, within three days. The 'Ghoomar' song, featuring actor Deepika Padukone and Shahid Kapoor, was released by the makers of the film recently.

The education department has also decided to go lenient on the unrecognised schools in terms of area and facilities. However, they have decided that safety will be the top priority that has to be fulfilled by the schools if they want recognition. Department will also not allow any school running from a residential and rental building.

The leniency have been brought in as the government schools, too, will not be able to adjust all the students studying in unrecognised schools.

Nearly, 15 unrecognised schools have given representations after TOI mentioned about the four committees recommending only seven out of total 65 schools who had applied for recognition. Some of the schools that have submitted representation have been running for more than two to three decades.

An official from the education department informed that the schools in their representation had shared that their schools were better than many of the seven schools, that the four committees have mentioned. ""The DEO has inspected the seven schools and has also found that some of them do deserve recognition. DEO, being the nodal officer for schools, has decided to inspect all the schools personally and make a decision,"" an official told TOI.

""There are some schools, we got to know about, which have been allotted land in the name of education trust and have been doing very well. They have CCTV cameras and smart classes. We feel such schools deserve a chance as they are teaching only till primary and are imparting quality education,"" an official said.

The four committees formed to inspect the schools had in their report recommended only 7 out of 65 schools for the grant of recognition. There are more than 15,000 students studying in 57 unrecognised schools.

As per the report, no government school in areas like Manimajra, Mauli Jagran, Hallomajra and Industrial Area, was asked to accomodate students from unrecognised schools as they are already overcrowded. None of the schools in these areas was recommended for granting recognition. However, the department has found some schools that are better than the seven schools which were recommended by the committees.

Also, the officials of education department are planning to go to Delhi to study the rules followed by Delhi government in granting recognition. ""They have granted recognition to schools operating in just 16 marlas. They have become lenient. We will study their methodologies and see, what among those can we implement here,"" said an official.

The education department has also decided to give a chance to the deserving (those fulfilling most of the norms) schools to fulfill norms.

"1266","","New Delhi [India], May 11 (ANI): Union Education Secretary Anil Swarup on Friday stated that the role of Public-Private Partnership (PPP) is vital for a robust pre-school education format.

Addressing the FICCI ARISE 'Re-imagining Pre-school Education' conference here in New Delhi, Swarup noted that the PPP model is crucial for building a strong education infrastructure.

""The government or private sector alone cannot solve the humongous task of redefining the pre-school education system in India. Volume or size can come from government, but quality will come from the private sector,"" he added.

As per Anil, one of the most challenging tasks in pre-school education currently is the lack of trained teachers. In this regard, he recommended that the private sector to submit ideas to the government with a focused approach, keeping in mind that the idea is politically acceptable, socially desirable, technologically feasible, financially viable and administratively doable.

Meanwhile, FICCI Assistant Secretary-General Shobha Mishra Ghosh said for the development and growth of a country, education and skills play a significant role, and focus cannot be on education in silos.

However, they also pointed out that protests carried out by teachers' association against the decision also played a vital role.

In Rajasthan, at least 300 government schools were set to be handed over to private firms in the first phase by April and May this year.

Devesh Goyal, principal of government girls' senior secondary school, Mandana in Kota, said that the teachers' associations along with the villagers and Bhamashahs across the state had been carrying out protest against the government decision on PPP mode. But the state government kept ignoring it. However, the debacle in the recent bypolls forced the government to withdraw the decision.

"1268","","Budget 2018: Last year, finance minister Arun Jaitley in his budget 2017 speech had identified imparting the right educational skills and job creation as one of the nine pillars that could enhance India's growth. With budget 2018 around the corner, educators are eagerly waiting to see if the government would align the educational system to the realities of 21st Century changes in social and economic environment. For years, the education sector is purely dominated by government investments. Government heavy lifting education spending in the long run may not be viable hence it's important to draft policies to promote private investment in education.

Public private partnership in education sector

The Indian education sector is at the cusp of historic reforms. To fund the introduction of 21 Century learning techniques and skill the Indian youth to be market ready there is a need for huge investments in the education space.

Public private partnership is an innovative method to tap the resources of a private school in order to help the government run schools. Private or public company whose earnings is more than 10cr or revenue is more than 25 cr can collaborate with top 50,000 existing municipal or government funded schools in order to introduce international curriculum. This would benefit students and public schools that want to provide a new learning approach that promotes creative and critical thinking and better communication skills. The international curriculum is more research-oriented that boosts the thinking capacity of the students and lets them widen their skills.

Robust guidelines promoting PPP in education sector would help corporates use their corporate social responsibility funds efficiently.

Introduce performance based funding for state-run schools

Dropout rate of students across state-run schools are very high in India on account of lack of facilities and lack of English medium learning. It may be important to get a performance metrics in place to ensure managements at public schools use funds for the benefit of students.

Also read: Wow! Modi government's Budget 2018 will connect India with these ambitious steps

Like there are performance metrics set for public sector banks to get government funds. The similar structure should be introduced for public schools in India. Low dropout rates could be one parameter on which fund allocation to a particular school can be decided.

The central government in its budget 2018 should encourage state governments to make funds of public schools fixed and variable. The variable funding should be released on the basis of achievement metrics. The achievement metrics will be uniform for all schools and the learning outcomes can be measured through assessment tests which will help government put their funds in the deserving schools. The government can further use these data for analytics to provide other state benefits to better performing schools.

Learning outcome

Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan has been the government's pet project and now that it has achieved 100% enrollments. The government would now look at strengthening teaching learning outcomes. Learning Outcomes is a practice that aims at monitoring a student's performance and development periodically, to enhance capabilities and create future leaders. A strong assessment model for learning outcomes need to be formalized by the government.

Introduce mass scale re-training program for teachers

The changing social fabric and use of technology in modern day teaching calls for robust training and retraining center for teachers. Growing competition and performance pressure have put students under tremendous pressure. Teachers play a very important role in helping students balance their academic as well as non-academic performance.

Modern day teacher needs to be armed with behavioral skills, technology skills and subject matter skills too. The innovative teaching methods like activity-based learning, new technology tools and developing entrepreneurial skills in students requires teachers to be trained regularly. The quality of teaching in public schools is always under scrutiny. A mass retraining program for teachers across the country would be beneficial.

Union Budget 2018 is the last full budget of the Modi led NDA government that has executed some radical reforms in India like implementation of Goods and Services Tax and Demonitisation. The expectations are high that the government would not shy away from taking some radical decisions. In 2018, the focus of the educational institutions and government should be to align the Indian educational system to needs of corporate India.

Technological disruption has increased unemployment and made workforce redundant across sectors. It's the need of the hour for policy makers and educationists to introduce modern learning and teaching techniques in India. It's also time to revamp the traditional curriculum to take into account the needs of corporate India. In 2018, we would see educational institutions with the right policy intervention by the policy makers striving to introduce 21st Century learning techniques to build future leaders.

(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

"1271","","Government is serious about improving the quality in teaching in higher education. In this regard, University Grants Commission (UGC) and All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) have taken various initiatives. Some of these initiatives are as under:

(i) Diksha- It is a platform for teachers which enables capacity building of all categories of teachers. It helps over 50 lakh teachers in improving the quality of education. Teachers upload their own material on the portal, which also offer online courses, allow sharing of best content, monitor progress and introduce energized text books with QR Code.

(ii) Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQUIP)- This is a quality improvement program in technical education. In phase III, hill states of J&K, Himachal and Uttarakhand, 8 North-eastern States, Andaman Nicobar, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand and Assam has got Rs.2,600 crore. This ensures bridging the regional gaps in technical education. 1200 IIT and NIT graduates have opted for 3 years teaching in educationally backward regions. They have resumed their duties in 53

government engineering colleges where faculty vacancies were large. Thus 1,00,000 students get quality education which they were deprived off till recently.

(iii) Global Initiative of Academic Networks (GIAN) - Under GIAN, 700 professors from 58 countries have so far conducted about 1120 courses in specialized topics for students in Indian Higher Educational institutions. More than 40,000 students and associated Indian Faculty has benefited from this international teaching exposure.

(iv) Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya National Mission for Teachers Training (PMMMNMTT) - Under this scheme in-service training programs for more than 1,00,000 college and university teachers have been organized. Newly appointed teachers undergo six months pedagogical training, so they can make good rapport with students and the quality improves.

(v) INTER UNIVERSITY CENTRES (IUCS) : To improve the standards of higher education and research, the UGC establishes Inter-University Centres for Teachers Education within the university system under Clause 12(ccc) of the UGC Act.

Annual Refresher Programme in Teaching (ARPIT) is a 40 hours programme with 20 hours of video content offered in a highly flexible format which can be done at one's own pace and time. The programme has built-in assessment exercises and activities as part of the academic progression in the course. At the end of the course, there is a provision for terminal assessment which can be either online or written examination. The course offered under the ARPIT programme is treated as equivalent to one Refresher Course for the purposes of Career Advancement. This helps in assessment of teachers.

AICTE has issued All India Council for Technical Education (Career Advancement Scheme for the Teachers and other Academic Staff in Technical Institutions) (Degree) Regulations, 2012. Each faculty member submits performance based appraisal system(PBAS) in a performa as evolved by the concerned institution/ University duly supported by all credentials as per the Academic Performance Indicator(API) guidelines set out in these regulations.","UGC and AICTE have taken up Several initiatives to improve teaching quality in Higher Education","1029973058","2018-12-31","http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=186977","pib.nic.in",FALSE
"1272","","The University Grants Commission has pushed ahead with the strategy of providing autonomous status to the country's better performing colleges.(Hindustan Times)

The University Grants Commission (UGC) , the regulator of the higher education sector, has pushed ahead with the strategy of providing autonomous status to the country's better performing colleges, in an attempt to improve the quality of teaching and learning in the country's higher education institutions.

Thus far this year, it has given the autonomous status to 37 colleges, taking the total number to 672 colleges across 106 universities. To be sure, this has been UGC's long-time strategy: between 2007-08 and 2017-18, the number of autonomous colleges rose from 281 across 55 universities to 635 across 105.

According to data from UGC, the south Indian states account for a lion' s share of colleges with autonomy status. Tamil Nadu with 183 colleges leads the pack, followed by Andhra Pradesh (97), Karnataka (70) and Telangana (59).

Large states such as Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, with 11 and 5 autonomous colleges, lag behind. Interestingly, experts point out that Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan lag the southern states in various educational

indicators, perhaps suggesting a link between the presence of autonomous institutions and this.

Government officials are confident that with new guidelines for autonomous colleges issued earlier this year, more colleges from all geographical areas will now be applying for this status.

An autonomous college can review existing courses, programmes and restructure, redesign and prescribe its own courses or programmes of study and syllabi. These colleges can formulate new courses with the UGC-specified nomenclature and even evolve methods of assessment of students' performance and conduct of examinations.

However, even for these colleges, the degree is awarded by the University with the name of the college on the degree certificate.

""Nearly, 40 colleges in districts across the country were granted autonomous status in the current year by the commission. We are also planning to make the process of applying for autonomous status online and comparatively simpler. It is felt that autonomy can provide a much needed boost to academic standards,"" UGC secretary Rajnish Jain said.

Several top performing colleges have been given the autonomous college status in the course of this year, including Pune's Ferguson College, Chennai's Loyola College, L N Welingkar Institute of Management Development and Research, Mumbai and PSG College of Technology in Coimbatore, a government official said on condition of anonymity.

""Even in the last commission meeting on December 10, at least eight new colleges, including SGGS Khalsa college in Patiala, were approved for the autonomous status,"" this person added.

""The idea of academic autonomy to higher education systems is a good idea. But the full benefits of academic autonomy can be reaped only if the colleges have financial support to effectively implement innovations and new academic structures. In the absence of such a support only minor tinkering with the routine academic structures are possible,"" said former UGC member Inder Mohan Kapahy.

India started giving colleges such status in the eighties, Kapahy pointed out. Three decades on, an in-depth review may be called for to see if these colleges have fulfilled the original promise of helping the cause of academic excellence , he added.","To boost education quality,UGC pushes for autonomous colleges","1028644574","2018-12-29","https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-boost-education-quality-ugc-pushes-for-autonomous-colleges/story-UWcmFyUf5wOs7Hk7TzP0vK.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE

Preference for opening of new school is given to tribal areas, and areas with high concentration of Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST) and minority population. The districts with high concentration of population of SCs, STs and Muslims have been identified as Special Focus Districts (SFDs) for ensuring equity and inclusion at all levels of school education. Provisions have also been made for 1020 residential schools/hostels for children living in sparsely populated areas, children living in areas where schools cannot be opened due to unavailability of land and children in need of care and protection.

The RTE Act also provides for Special Training for age-appropriate admission of out-of-school children including children of disadvantaged groups in urban and rural areas. Approval has been given for special training of 8.08 lakh children with the financial outlay of Rs. 56353.95 lakh in 2018-19.

During 2018-19 an amount of Rs. 19668.26 crore has been released (as on 30.11.2018) to States/UTs as central share against the total Budget of Rs. 30891.81 crore for implementation of various interventions under Samagra Shiksha.","Samagra Shiksha Scheme running successfully to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels of school education","1023879544","2018-12-21","http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=186730","pib.nic.in",FALSE

"1275","","At NRIs' conclave in Dallas, he takes a dig at dynastic politics

Jana Sena Party president Pawan Kalyan has said his party will take up skill development programmes on priority basis, apart from laying emphasis on agriculture and tourism sectors and adoption of technologies, among other things, if it comes to power in Andhra Pradesh.

Besides, it will introduce free, quality education and bring about a common hostel system. For the NRIs seeking support for their business ventures, single window systems will be launched, he has said.

Addressing NRIs at Dallas in the U.S. along with party leader Nadendla Manohar on Sunday, Mr. Pawan Kalyan said he was camping in the U.S. not to raise funds, but to express solidarity with the NRIs who were going through a turmoil far away from their homeland.

He observed that the NRIs went to the U.S. because of their zeal to achieve something big as they lacked adequate opportunities in India. But they were facing many difficulties and needed the support of fellow Indians. He was, therefore, harping on the anomalies in the U.S. Government's immigration policy that adversely affected the Indian diaspora.

Taking a dig at corruption and dynastic politics in India, Mr. Pawan said he never had the greed to loot people's money or ""make my son Chief Minister"" by entering politics, and only had a dream of his country as a place where people and law and order were strong and youth not inclined to migrate to foreign shores for jobs.

Mr. Kalyan said the objective behind the formation of JSP was to bring about the desired change in politics dominated by men who became MPs by winning the polls with money and muscle power. He expected the NRIs to participate in politics.","Pawan promises free, quality education","1019943001","2018-12-16","https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/pawan-promises-free-quality-education/article25759398.ece","The Hindu",FALSE

Mr Javadekar was speaking at the national Conference on 'Positioning India on the Global Education Map' in New Delhi today. In higher education, we have taken tremendous steps to improve college education, for this we are making accreditation process more scientific and tough. Government wants to increase the strength of NBA and NAAC so that more number of institutions can be accredited, the Minister added.He further said that government is open for other agencies to take the responsibility of accreditation and IITs and IIMs have been asked for the same so that more and more institutions can be accredited from reputed agencies.

The Minister said that ranking and rating increase competitiveness among institutions for better performance. He gave the example of National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) and said that because of NIRF every institute has constituted an internal committee to improve the ranking. Students also see institutions ranking before taking admission, he added.

The Union Minister said that teacher is the most important component to increase quality educationin the colleges and universities. He said that attendance should increase in the classroom because of teacher's skills not because of the infrastructure of the college. He further said that we are lacking good teachers in the institutions because good people are not becoming teachers. We have to attract good people for teaching profession and we have to give respect to teachers then only we can create a good learning environment in the institutions. Best teachers attract students to the institution not the best infrastructure, he added.

Graded autonomy is another major step of the government to boost quality education in the country, the Minister said. Shri Javadekar explained that the universities will remain within the ambit of UGC but will have the freedom to start new courses, off campus centers, skill development courses, research parks and any other new academic programs. They will also have the freedom to hire foreign faculty, enroll foreign students, give incentive based emoluments to the faculty, enter into academic collaborations and run open distance learning programmes.

"1284","","Bringing the unique technology offering of 'Chhota Internet' to these schools will open doorways to information, knowledge and allow access to increased learning opportunities beyond the classroom digitally.(Getty Images)

Access to the Internet can improve the quality of education. Despite multiple efforts, many students in schools in rural areas are deprived of the knowledge and opportunity provided through internet due to unavailability and lack of access to Internet in the rural areas. Given that the majority of India's population lives in rural and semi-urban areas, it only makes sense if the infusion of technology in education is done on a larger scale, and at the grass-root level, without dependency on the Internet to achieve similar results, which Internet would provide.

Identifying the need to provide regular connectivity without hindrance, the district of Ghaziabad, under the basic education department, has initiated the process to install 'Chhota Internet', an innovative Content Access Management Device (CAMD) for learning, in 197 of its upper primary schools. Bringing the unique technology offering of 'Chhota Internet' to these schools will open doorways to information, knowledge and allow access to increased learning opportunities beyond the classroom digitally.

The implementation of 'Chhota Internet' will help the children get access to buffer-free focused education content. It will also help to deliver quality educational material digitally, over a Wi-Fi network without the need of the internet, in a responsible manner. It will also allow the school authorities to monitor the progress of students individually, the results of which can then be used to develop programs that address learning gaps.

Digital literacy is a technology-in-the-classroom solution that helps find, evaluate, utilise, share, and create content using information technologies and the Internet. The benefits of digital literacy can be best harnessed in a controlled and responsible environment. 'Chhota Internet' provides the school authorities to deliver learning solutions in a controlled and responsible manner.

It has the ability to revolutionise the traditional education system, and to address the challenges that rural India faces, such as access to quality content due to lack of Internet penetration, shortage of quality teachers, and measurement of growth of children.

Sandeep Arya, Chairman and CEO, 'Chhota Internet' said, ""The digital age has opened up newer dimensions to learning, which were previously unheard of. The twenty first century learning is more complex than ever before, and the current context of growth demands various skills from a student. Therefore, it is the need of the hour for us to use digital technology like Chhota Internet to provide more efficient ways of learning. As rural India prepares for a tectonic change in education with the launch of digital classrooms, we need to ensure consistent implementation of digital literacy on a large-scale to ensure quality education.""

""The vision of Chhota Internet is to bridge the gap between learning and growth and erase the educational divide, and more of this can happen when corporations direct their CSR funds to this cause instead of solely depending upon government funding. Chhota Internet will achieve this by bringing students in rural India abreast with the rest of the world, in terms of providing access to a more advanced system of education that is loaded with the latest technological aids, paving the way for future growth via innovative technology."" he added.

In the last 5 years, the government has made several efforts to improve the quality of education in India, especially in the context of rural India.Though the literacy rate in rural India is far less than the urban areas, yet the pace with which the literacy rate is growing is commendable. While the efforts of the government steer education in rural India towards greater heights, there is a need to build-in efficiencies through innovative technology in the school and classroom environment to secure the future of our children.","'Chhota Internet' to digitally provide quality education without Internet in 197 Ghaziabad schools","1005195094","2018-11-28","https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/chhota-internet-to-digitally-provide-quality-education-without-internet-in-197-ghaziabad-schools/story-9rnDOAhaTAp39ZJC6ed4YI.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE
"1285","","The Internet has helped us in many ways - from education to entertainment. But what about areas that cannot connect to the internet? Meet Chhota Internet - a Content Access Management Device (CAMD) that can help make education accessible to all.

In a district of Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh, 197 upper primary schools will adopt Chhota Internet to increase learning opportunities for their students.

Using this, the schools will be able to access better quality educational material over a WiFi network without using the internet. This digital initiative will also allow schools to focus on each student's progress and help them design custom-based programmes to further enhance a student's performance. Digital literacy, when harnessed in a controlled and responsible environment, can help schools find, evaluate, utilise, share and create content using information technologies and the internet.

Chhota Internet is aimed at bridging the gap between quality education and its beneficiaries, with students as the focus of buffer-free education content.

The initiative will uplift the traditional educational system in the rural area and address various issues that hinder the quality of education like lack of internet penetration, shortage of quality teachers and measurements of the growth of children.

In a press statement, Sandeep Arya, CEO and Chairman of Chhota Internet, said,

"1286","","Reasons include poor school infrastructure, poor access to toilets, sanitation facilities, teacher absenteeism ... ironically, it's been almost a decade of the passing of the RTE Act

India has a positive demographic opportunity, with half of its population in the working-age group. Needless to say, education is tool required to realise this demographic potential. Along with childhood nutrition, healthcare and good mentoring, quality schooling forms the basis of ensuring all-round development of a person.

Quality of education depends on infrastructure such as classrooms, water and sanitation facilities, availability of electricity, provision for digital learning, sports equipment and facilities, availability of chairs and desks, and softer elements such as presence of school staff, professional competencies of teachers, access to books and learning materials, among others.

The density of schools in rural India and teacher-student ratio have both improved, and enrolment ratio has shown a largely upward trend. This, coupled with sustained increase in education expenditure as a percentage of GDP, paints a positive picture for schooling. However, at the grass-roots level, the quality of rural education in India leaves much to be desired.

School infrastructure

Despite high demand for schools, as is visible by the upward trends in enrolment data, supply-side factors related to teacher availability and infrastructure leave much room for improvement. For instance, the District Information System for Education (DISE) data shows only 53% of total government schools, which form majority of schools in rural India, have electricity connection. Only 28% schools (18% government schools) have a computer and 9% (4% government schools) an internet connection. With the digital revolution beginning to be seen in urban schools, including urban government schools, it is likely that rural schools will miss riding the digital wave due to insufficient infrastructure.

Many states are yet to fulfil the norms laid down in the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009. Provision for playgrounds and construction of boundary walls, both of which feature in the Act, exhibit the largest shortfall, with 40% schools not having a playground and 43% not having a boundary wall. The figures for laboratories for science-related subjects is even dismal.

Access to sanitation facilities poses a major impediment to student attendance, especially girls, and leads to drop-outs. The Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2017 data found that only 68% toilets in government schools are usable. Despite the fillip provided by the Swachh Bharat Swachh Vidyalaya campaign, which has increased the number of toilets across schools, the usability of these structures remains questionable. Lack of water, lack of lighting and electricity, poor drainage systems, and paucity of funds for maintenance and cleanliness have failed to feature on the agenda of sound WaSH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) management in schools, thus limiting the usability of WaSH facilities in schools.

Availability of teachers

The number of teachers admitted to schools has risen, and the percentage of vacant posts has been decreasing. But the competencies of the teaching staff are below par -- according to DISE data, 18% teachers in India, in 2016-17, had no professional qualification in teaching.

Even when teachers are on-roll, high rates of absenteeism have been recorded. A World Bank study found that one in four teachers are absent at a typical government-run primary school. Absenteeism rates were seen to be higher in low-income states of Jharkhand and Bihar, with the former reporting a rate of 42%.

Teachers, especially in rural India, often take on auxiliary tasks such as attend to the maintenance of school infrastructure, mobilise students & sensitise community on the importance of education, ensure implementation of social schemes at the school level, etc. All of this takes away from teaching time, and takes a toll on the quality of learning delivered. As per ASER 2017, a large portion of students surveyed had trouble with foundation skills of reading and arithmetic, fared poorly in abilities of calculating and telling time, could not use unitary method properly, and were unable to solve complex mathematical problems.

Outcomes for India

Poor employability is a direct outcome of poor education. With 70% of India's workforce residing in rural areas, it is rural India that will form the majority of tomorrow's workforce -- half of the total population is expected to be in rural India by 2050 (according to NITI Aayog). A major cause for rural to urban migration is the search of better employment opportunities. The net migration from rural to urban areas is about 20 lakh per annum, of which 10 lakh are expected to be job-seekers (MSS Research). The poor quality of education in rural schools will surely affect the employability of rural youth. Handicapped with low employability skills and poor educational foundation and the resultant low productivity, their struggle to find better-paying opportunities will likely follow them wherever they go. Against this background, India's positioning to convert the benefits of the demographic dividend into increased national income is weak.","Why rural India still has poor access to quality education?","1003148187","2018-11-25","https://www.financialexpress.com/education-2/why-rural-india-still-has-poor-access-to-quality-education/1393555/","The Financial Express",FALSE

A total of 268 social welfare residential educational institutions from class V to undergraduate level have been imparting quality, holistic and value-based education to the students from the economically weaker sections on a par with the advantaged students.

Not just academics in the classroom, the Society is providing a wide range of opportunities, including coding, robotics, cricket coaching, and entrance examination coaching to tap their full potential. Several students who graduated from the Society have made a remarkable mark in various fields.

In an interview with Sunday Scape, Dr RS Praveeen Kumar, secretary, Telangana Social Welfare Residential Educational Institutions Society, who was the brain behind the success of these schools and colleges, talks about the journey of the Society so far, and future plans.

The Society schools and colleges have been giving basic security and hope for the students from marginalised sections to pursue dreams of their choice. Students who join the institutions have an assured pathway of entering unknown horizons. The institutions are preparing future leaders from the underprivileged sections. So far, the journey of the Society has been encouraging and impactful.

The Society's model has impressed several States, including Karnataka, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Bihar, Delhi, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The officials from those States who visited the schools were overwhelmed by the brilliance of students, besides overall development. They were awestruck by the focus the Society has been laying on the girls' education. The officials were also impressed by the support from the government and parents' trust on the Society.

We want to clone the spirit of Poorna among all students of the Society in various fields including mathematics Olympiads and sports. We want to tap the potential of the students in their interest.

Women were traditionally not given an opportunity to join the Indian Armed Forces. Recently, the doors were opened for women. With one stroke, we want to bring students from the periphery to the core and provide them with steady training and prepare them for a career in the armed forces. The college has been started this year and it received an overwhelming response.

Robotics and coding have been introduced for the Society students. We want to create a new generation of students who not just master three languages - Telugu, Hindi and English - but also a language that is used for communicating with the machines.","Empowering through quality education","1002544972","2018-11-24","https://telanganatoday.com/empowering-quality-education","Telangana Today",FALSE

"1292","","Professor Kumar -- Rhodes scholar at the University of Oxford, where he obtained his Bachelor of Civil Law (B.C.L.) degree; and a Landon Gammon Fellow at the Harvard Law School -- became the founding VC of the university in 2009 and, in the nine years since, he has guided the institution to rank among the top 450 universities in Asia, as per the QS Asia University Rankings 2019.

In an email interview with IANS, he sheds light on how the higher education system is burdened by over-regulation and why more corporates and high net worth individuals should come forward to support the government in making India a preferred global destination for pursuing higher education and research.

Q: What is ailing India's higher education system? What kind of reforms, according to you, can improve the system?

A: The Indian higher education system is over-regulated and under-governed. This is evident in recent government policies that aim to reduce regulatory oversight through initiatives such as Graded Autonomy for well-performing institutions, and the Institutions of Eminence project that will allow for selected institutions to self-regulate on key aspects such as recruitment, admissions and collaborations. However, given the gap in scale, access and relative quality of higher education in the country, further reforms are urgently needed to match the rapid expansion of the sector with performance and quality. We also need greater engagement from private actors, including from industry, to promote quality in higher education.

Q: What is stopping private universities in India from becoming world-class universities?

A: If one were to look at the parameters on which international ranking agencies such as THE (Times Higher Education), QS (Quacquarelli Symonds) and ARWU (Academic Ranking of World Universities) operate, one would notice common metrics such as research, reputation and internationalisation. Indian universities primarily focus on teaching and less on research. Secondly, functions of internationalisation (i.e. hiring of foreign faculty members, admitting foreign students and building student mobility programmes) within higher education institutions are currently over-regulated by the government. For private universities to flourish, there needs to be greater balance between government oversight, functional autonomy and a diversified funding ecosystem within the country for such institutions.

Q: How can Indian universities improve rankings in list of the world's top universities?

A: Indian universities need to prioritise research impact and outcomes. There is greater need for funding in Indian universities, which ought to come from both public and private sources. Secondly, the regulations that encumber the internationalisation efforts of universities need to be eased. Universities need to be encouraged to promote all forms of internationalisation. We need to create an ecosystem in which students from other parts of the world should desire to study in India just as we create opportunities for student mobility programmes where Indian students go abroad for various short- and long-term programmes. All of this will require greater support from the government and private actors.

Q: What measures should India put in place to improve access to higher education among the underprivileged?

A: While public universities now provide the broadest access to students from under-represented and disadvantaged communities, private higher education institutions need to play a far greater role in expanding access to quality higher education in India. The higher education sector is yet to see meaningful private participation in a not-for-profit mode where corporates and high net worth individuals support access to quality higher education. O.P. Jindal Global University is a stellar example of private, not-for-profit and corporate philanthropy in higher education. Unfortunately, for a large country like India, there are very few such examples and we need more of them.

Q: What role do you see for universities in shaping the future of the nation?

A: A nation is built on the basis of its people and, indeed, institutions. Visionaries who inspire others and change the way of doing things are critical in every effort to build a nation. In order for our citizens to dream, aspire and inspire, there needs to be greater imagination and efforts in creating enabling and inspiring environments in the form of university spaces where teaching, learning and research can happen. Institution-building is central to nation-building and that is how we can create an enabling environment for the future.

"1297","","President Ram Nath Kovind Tuesday said India has a vast network of universities and colleges but gaps still exist in attaining world-class excellence in education.

To achieve global standards, the government has taken a decision to promote 20 institutions of higher education as ""institutes of eminence"", Kovind said at the 15th convocation ceremony of the Symbiosis International University here.

The President noted that India has a massive network of 903 universities and 39,050 colleges.

""But the fact is there are still gaps in quality and in attaining world-class excellence across the spectrum,"" he said.

""In this context, the government has taken a decision to promote and support 20 institutions of higher education as 'institutes of eminence', to grant them recruitment and curricula flexibility in order to reach best-in-class global standards,"" he added.

After a competitive process, the first few of these institutes of eminence were announced recently. There will be future rounds as well, he said.

Underlining the performance of girls in higher education, he said as president, he made a conscious effort to visit universities and educational institutions across the country to meet and interact with students and future thought leaders of the country.

""One of my findings has been that the academic performance of girl students tends to exceed that of boys. Today too, of the nine gold medals awarded at this convocation, six have gone to graduating girls. This is commendable and a happy sign for our society,"" he said.

He also asked students to use their education to help fellow citizens.

""Your education gives you responsibility to help those less-privileged and less-fortunate. How you choose to do this is entirely up to you, but remember that your empathy for fellow citizens is as much a test of your scholarship as your mark-sheet or your degree,"" the president said.

He said knowledge has no gender or geographical boundaries and that India has been a centre of learning for centuries.

From Taxila to Nalanda, the subcontinent's age-old universities attracted students from different parts of Asia and beyond, he noted.

""In modern times as well, our campuses have been open to and welcoming talented young people from many countries, specially those in our neighbourhood and in Africa, a continent with which we have a special relationship, shaped in classrooms,"" Kovind said.

He said it was worth noting that 46,144 international students from 166 countries study in various colleges, universities and institutions of higher learning in India.

""Of those who are graduating today, 329 students are from 33 countries other than India. This adds to the multicultural and cosmopolitan atmosphere of your (Symbiosis) campus, and promotes goodwill among nations,"" he said.

"1299","","Washington, Oct 22 (PTI) India has no dearth of talent but a large number of students lack access to quality education that could meet the demands of the modern times, Super 30 founder and mathematician Anand Kumar has said.

Kumar, who is presently in news for an upcoming biopic on his life starring Bollywood actor Hrithik Roshan, was felicitated in the Silicon Valley over the weekend in recognition of his effort to help poor children to get admission into the prestigious IITs.

""In India, there is a huge craving for education, but quality education is not accessible to all of them. Today, technology can make it happen. online classes can do what is not otherwise possible,"" Kumar said.

""Education is changing fast, as the requirements are changing. This calls for new approach to education,"" he said while speaking at the golden jubilee function of 'Indian for collective action' organised in San Jose, California, on Saturday.

Observing that there is no dearth of talent in India, Kumar said equal opportunities in terms of quality education and modern-day requirements often eluded a large number of students.

""Today, there are opportunities to fill this void through technology. You people can make it happen through small contributions from your side in your own way to make a big difference,"" he said.

Anand runs Super 30 educational programme to mentor 30 students free off cost through a year-long residential programme for India's prestigious IIT-JEE exam.

"1303","","India's population growth story is far more complicated than its bringing down the total fertility rate (TFR) -- the average number of births a woman has in her lifetime - to 2.3.

More than half of India's population lives in states where the population has stopped growing, with the TFR in urban India and 18 states having fallen below the replacement level of 2.1, which is when the population stops growing.

Yet another one-third of the country's population has TFR between 2.5 and 3, with the rates being the highest 3.4 in Bihar, which is home to 10% of the population. The country's demographic transition varies not just widely across regions and states, but also across districts. The states in southern India and a few other regions, including Delhi, have reduced fertility and deaths at a much faster rate than the rest of the country.

According to demographer Ansley Coale, fertility rates begin to fall in a sustained way when people consider fertility a conscious choice that they can control, when they believe that having smaller families is advantageous, and when reliable methods of contraception are widely available. ""Family size, whether small or large, is intertwined with reproductive rights, which are tied to many other rights, such as those to health and education, adequate income, the freedom to make choices, and non-discrimination. Where all rights are realised, people tend to thrive. Where they are not, people are not able to realize their potential, and fertility rates tend to be higher or lower than what most people really want,"" said the UNFPA State of the World Population Report 2018.

How India grows

How India's populations story plays out depends on India's young population.Every fifth person in India is an adolescent (10-19 years) and every third a young person (10-24 years). Every year, 12-14 million people enter the workforce, largely from the northern states.

""India needs to invest in the health, education and technical skill development of this age group to leverage its competitive advantage for economic growth,"" said Poonam Muttreja, executive director of the Population Foundation of India.

Rapid fertility decline raises the share of working age population( ages 15-49 years) and leads to a corresponding fall in the dependency ratio. After a few decades, however, this demographic advantage is lost as the share of the elderly population increases.

Low dependency ratio is the period of demographic dividend, which provides a window of opportunity to countries to boost productivity and economic growth. A dependency ratio of less than 67% boosts growth.

India is set to ride this wave, with its dependency ratio falling from 75% in 2001 to 65% in 2011. It is projected to fall to 55% in 2021, where it will remain for two decades before beginning to close at 2041 and finally closing in 2061, when the ageing population will push up the dependency ratio above the critical 67%.

While Kerala and Tamil Nadu, which led the demographic transition in India, are already gaining from their shrunken population, they will lose the dividend before the 1940s when their population ages. In sharp contrast, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar will reach a dependency ratio below 67% only by 2021.

Mind the gap

With the demographic dividend varying so widely between states, India's challenge is to implement customised and differential policies that correspond with each state's level of demographic transition.

""Government policies must focus on social and health security and promoting new employment skills for the ageing population in the demographically advanced states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Andhra, Gujarat, Punjab, Himachal and West Bengal,"" said ,"" said Shailaja Chandra, former executive director, Population Stabilisation Fund.

""With the population ageing, we need to focus on building skills to provide care, including health and social services, and establish old-age homes and housing models where the older population can live independently with supportive facilities on call,"" said Chandra.

In the six states where fertility remains high, promoting sexual and reproductive health services, providing quality education and vocational skills to young people must be prioritised.

""Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Iran and Turkey all saw substantial declines in infant and child mortality, partly because of wider reach of health-care systems, economic development, reduced poverty, and increased female enrolment in primary and secondary education,"" said the UNFPA report. Other factors that led to lower fertility is decreasing infant and child mortality and strong national family planning programmes.

The age of marriage needs to be raised further so young girls are mature enough, physically, mentally and emotionally, to make the right reproductive choices, say experts.

In states with high fertility, contraceptive information and services must reach young people.

""An estimated 70% of the population momentum is fuelled by the young population and young girls don't want to have kids as soon as they get married. Young couples, especially women, need the information and the tools to choose when and how many children they want,"" said Muttreja.

""Young girls have less knowledge and access to contraception and health services and are more likely to succumb to pressure to start a family at a young age, which is not good for the health of both the mother and child,"" said Muttreja.

""In the end, our success will not just come in reaching what we imagine is ideal fertility. The real measure of progress is people themselves: especially the well-being of women and girls, their enjoyment of their rights and full equality, and the life choices that they are free to make,"" writes Natalia Kanem, executive director, UNFPA.","Quality education, health services drive family size","971416062","2018-10-17","https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quality-education-health-services-drive-family-size/story-oTMefJmaaCNUaSrxK1nmLL.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE
"1304","","To ensure that the mushrooming of private universities across the country does not lead to a decline in the standard of education, the Union human resources development (HRD) ministry has initiated a massive exercise in which hundreds of legislations establishing these varsities will be scrutinised to identify if there are deviations from set norms, according to a senior official familiar with the developments. The exercise, which is expected to begin mid-November, is being led by the regulator of the higher education sector, University Grants Commission (UGC), which has already collected at least 300 state acts. A team of legal consultants working with Niti Aayog will study these acts to give a holistic picture, the official added.

UGC is already working on revising parameters for the setting up of universities. ""There have been concerns about the standard of education in the hundreds of private universities spread across the country, and also about to maintaining quality. There have been reports of varsities with insufficient infrastructure, including some functioning from just a few rooms,"" said the ministry official who asked not to be named.

It was felt that a way to address the situation was to have a comprehensive evaluation of the legislations through which these bodies are set up, the official added.

The hundreds of acts under which private universities are set up in different states will be examined in light of the latest parameters that the regulator will soon come up with, said the official. ""The idea is to identify any lacunae or gaps that lead to a laxity in the maintenance of educational standards, and ways to address them.""

He added that the ministry has taken steps to bring UGC and legal consultants together to address this key aspect following directions from HRD minister Prakash Javadekar.

""The government is in favour of granting more funds and more autonomy to institutions that provide quality education, but ensuring that standards are not diluted is a key premise. Therefore, it is believed this exercise would go a long way in addressing quality concerns,"" the official said.

Apart from this, UGC is analysing nearly 8,000 cases it finds itself embroiled in, because, officials feel, ambiguities in existing legislations could be the reason behind several of these legal matters. ""The study may help in suggesting ways in which the burden on the UGC of such cases may come down in the coming days,"" said the official quoted above.

Former UGC member Inder Mohan Kapahy said, ""Some (private universities in India) are very good and some not as good. At times, even political pressure may lead to the formation of such a body. A key aspect is: the day an act or ordinance is passed, the body can give degrees. There should be some mechanism to ensure quality checks at the time of inception. In India, operations of a varsity have hardly ever been stopped. So it is important to have quality checks at the time of inception, particularly with regard to new private varsities.""","To maintain education quality, UGC to tighten scrutiny of private universities","969555148","2018-10-15","https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/to-maintain-education-quality-ugc-to-tighten-scrutiny-of-private-universities/story-D8aebrNCcoR8PqR9UmLrEL.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE
"1305","","Assuring all possible support from Government, Advisor to Governor, Khurshid Ahmed Ganai today urged on academics, intellectuals and private school managements to improve the quality of education.

The Advisor said this in his meeting with a delegation of All J&K Private College Association and J&K (un-aided) Private Schools Coordination Committee Srinagar, during his weekly public durbar, where scores of public delegations called on Ganai to apprise him with their demands and issues here at JK Governor's Grievance Cell at Church Lane, Sonwar.

Ganai said that all the stakeholders need to come together to improve the quality of teaching and quality of learning. He said public as well as private sectors need to work in synergy so that the desired results in education sector could be achieved.

The meeting also suggested frequent student exchange programmes, where students from public schools could frequently visit private school campuses and avail their resources so that their talents could also be harnessed.

Earlier, the delegation presented various demands including making B.ed mandatory for teaching purpose, besides, abolishing B.ed conducted through distance mode. They also wanted a uniform pay norms for B.ed students across the State. According to the delegation, the B.ed students in Jammu have to pay less than Rs 10, 000 towards university, while as Kashmir University is charging the B.ed students around Rs 18000, which as per them was ""unfair"".

The Advisor assured that he would surely consider all their genuine demands and do the necessary at an earliest.

A delegation from Rambir Garh Check Razak Khan demanded that they should get due compensation for the land coming under ring road. The delegation members informed the Advisor that land owners of district Baramulla have received 35 lakhs for Abi-awal and 52 lakhs for apple orchad land. However, the delegation members said that their village despite falling in district Srinagar was only provided with 23 lakhs as compensation. The delegations demanded par rates like Baramulla residents.

Besides, they also demanded installation of new pipes for Sukhnag water supply as the current pipes have developed rust and the water supplied through them is not fit for drinking.

The delegation of contractual lectures of Government Degree College Pampore requested the Advisor to intervene to get their three months' salary released.

The delegation of PHD scholars called on Advisor and requested that they should be considered for teaching jobs in medical colleges as was the past practice.

A delegation from Bazar Committee Solina demanded the release of assured compensation for the loss their businesses have suffered due to the construction of Rambagh flyover.","Advisor Ganai for improving quality of education","968164614","2018-10-12","http://risingkashmir.com/news/advisor-ganai-for-improving-quality-of-education","RisingKashmir",FALSE
