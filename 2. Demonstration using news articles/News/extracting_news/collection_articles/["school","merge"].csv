On paper, this school was shut down this year, in reality, it has been locked since 2015.

Sehrawan's students now travel 2km to village Dhani to reach the nearest school. Sat Singh, an elderly resident, said: ""I've myself studied in the GPS. It was running fine. I don't know why the government decided to shut it down."" Most parents in Sehrawan said they find it hard to send their kids to school now. Sukhvinder Singh said, ""Even though Dhani is not too far off, I can't send my son there, as the national highway runs between our villages, and it's dangerous to cross it every day with the kid. So he's sitting at home. This was the only school in the village, and they have closed it.""

The elementary education department at Panchkula has decided to close or merge 62 GPSs having ""zero student strength"" this year. Of these, four are in Gurugram, including the one at Sehrawan, as well as GPS at Daultabad, Government Girls Primary School at Garhi, GPS at Rampur. An education department official said: ""This decision was taken by the department. We had no say in it. Officially, the reason is low attendance.""

According to official records that TOI has sourced, at the time of being closed down, GPS Sehrawan had zero students and two teachers. Charan Singh, one of the teachers at the school, said: ""I don't know what the records say, but at the time the school was unofficially shut down in 2015, we had around 26 students."" Today, the four rooms in the school lay deserted. A poster in one room displays the midday meal schedule, that includes among others chaat on Monday and dal on Wednesday. One of the walls has a political map of Haryana, showing different districts.

A letter sent by the education department earlier this year reads: ""The government has decided that 62 government primary schools having zero student strength may be closed down or merged. Posts sanctioned and teachers working in schools which are to be merged may be shifted to schools with which it is proposed to be merged. However, at the time of rationalisation, posts of teachers will be rationalised on the basis of actual requirement at that point of time. All such teachers shall compulsorily participate in the next transfer drive.""

Officially, there are no students at GPS, Sehrawan, although the school has two teachers. Following the education department notification, the staff have been told they may be transferred to a school facing staff crunch. Tarun Suhag of Haryana Primary Teachers Association said, ""Primary schools should never be shut down. If at all, closures should happen based on data from three consecutive years, not from a single year."""

Any move to dilute the scheme will impact the quality and, in turn, the children, activists argue

Confusion reigned supreme in the social development sector in Tamil Nadu last week. The cause was a circular from the office of the Commissioner of Social Welfare that sought to rationalise the staff in over 8,900 noon meal centres where the strength of children was less than 25. Many people read it as a move to cut down the number of noon meal centres. That's when panic set in.

However, the Social Welfare Department clarified that it was only following up on a 1992 rule, and was going to retain only two staff in these 8,900 centres, instead of the existing three members.

Each centre, as per existing arrangements, is entitled to a noon meal organiser, a cook and a cook's assistant. V. Amuthavalli, Director, Social Welfare, reiterated that none of the noon meal centres would be closed. ""We will only be shifting the organisers in centres that have less than 25 children. The cooks and assistant cooks will remain. And, an order has been issued not to shuffle organisers who are scheduled to retire in 2019,"" she told The Hindu.

The noon meal scheme is one of the AIADMK's flagship schemes. And it serves a definite nutritional purpose. To wind that down, to whatever extent, would be a serious setback for the State government, activists argued. No doubt, the development surprised many, given the fact that it is Tamil Nadu that has been the trendsetter in the implementation of the nutritious noon meal programme for pre-school and school children. The scheme, now called Puratchi Thalaivar M.G.R. Nutritious Meal Programme, is named after the party's founder, M.G. Ramachandran.

The reaction from the political class and representatives of noon meal staff has been one of strong disapproval. Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) founder S. Ramadoss and the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) deputy general secretary T.T. V. Dhinakaran were apprehensive that the move, which was likely to cause a ""huge setback"" to the cause of social welfare, would lead to ""disastrous consequences"".

If the government goes ahead with its decision, workers at the centres preparing food would suffer ""extensive burden and stress"", said A. Solaiyan, Madurai District Secretary, Tamil Nadu Nutritious Noon Meal Workers Association. Each centre must have three employees dedicated to the preparation and distribution of the afternoon meal. If a noon meal cook is tasked with preparing food for over 30 students, she/he must receive support and help from others, he argued.

Noon meal organisers are the ones who would be hit hard by the move, said M. Innasi Muthu, who heads the Coimbatore district chapter of the Tamil Nadu Nutritious Noon Meal Workers Association. The organisers are in charge of buying vegetables, condiments and arranging for cooking gas cylinders. They also ensure that cooks are given the right quantity of rice, pulses, eggs and oil. ""How does the government expect the organisers to be present at two places in the mornings,"" he wonders, citing practical difficulties for the organisers in apportioning time to supervise the work of cooks at more than one centre.

There will be other ramifications. Karpagam of Modakurichi block in Erode, whose child is one of the beneficiaries of the scheme, fears that the move will have a direct bearing on the enrolment of students.

Regardless of the force behind arguments of those who want status quo ante to be maintained, what is indisputable is the dwindling strength of students of government schools in the State, which, in the words of a senior official of the Social Welfare Department, requires a deeper study.

A document of the department reveals that compared to about 55.15 lakh children-beneficiaries in 2015-16, the tally is down to around 51.96 lakh now.

A representative of the Tiruchi district unit of the Noon Meal Employees Welfare Association acknowledges that in some schools, full-fledged noon meal centres are serving only a handful of students. For example, in Sankagiri, Salem district, a total of 29 noon meal centres serve less than 25 students.

The government appears unfazed by any criticism regarding its move to ""redeploy"" the staff. ""How can you justify the present staffing pattern of about 13,450 persons working at about 8,900 centres, which are serving less than 25 children? Why should there be three people - noon meal organiser, cook and cook's assistant - for every such centre,"" questions the official, pointing out that that about 45% of the centres are serving less than 50 children.

The Central government, for instance, does not ordinarily provide for more than one staff per centre. Only a few States have the post of noon meal organisers.

Even while sticking to its position, the State government is not oblivious to the past, wherein its attempt, through an order in 1992, to merge smaller centres serving less than 25 children-beneficiaries with nearby bigger ones failed, thanks to opposition from unions.

Conscious of history, the government dismisses talk that it is going to close down the centres. Only if there are two or more noon meal centres within a school's premises will such centres be attached to the bigger one. Also, where they are in ""close proximity"", a ""merger"" will take place.

""We are very much sensitive to the welfare of children-beneficiaries as well as interests of the staff. These factors will guide us while reorganising the staff. The whole exercise will be based on practical considerations and not blind adherence to certain norms,"" asserts the official, adding that hilly regions and urban areas are exempted from the latest drive to ""rationalise"" the staffing pattern.

As per current plans, if a centre has less than 25 children, one of the three staff will have to move out. ""Even on this count, we will be considerate with respect to those who are on the verge of retirement. Besides, choice of place of re-posting will be ascertained from those who are shifted,"" the official explained.

As for the organisers being asked to look after more than one centre, the government's response is that that such an arrangement will be a ""temporary measure"". The State also claims that it provides a host of benefits to the staff working in the centres: special monthly pension, lump sum payment, festival advance, Pongal bonus, hill allowance, winter allowance, family benefit fund, new health insurance scheme, and appointment on compassionate grounds.

Notwithstanding its explanations in support of the move, the government should not, according to activists, give the impression that it is preparing the ground for phasing out a scheme that has earned widespread acclaim for the State."

In the aftermath of the assembly results, the capital is abuzz with the Will-Modi-Return? chatter. During my brief stay I found that at one level disenchantment had truly set in and the man on the street was ready to bid adieu to the present dispensation. The Modi government had failed on several counts.

A Calcuttan, I thoroughly enjoyed this conversation with anyone who crossed my path in Delhi. So as I get into my Uber on a cold December morning, I find the guy at the wheel is a complete political animal and a staunch Modi supporter.

""Yes Modiji has made mistakes I am aware,"" he says, ""But who else is there? Demonetisation was a disaster. GST badly handled. But Madam, who else is there?""

""Can the Opposition put up a united front? Will the Congress get the numbers? What will the Mulayam Singh Yadavs and Mamata Banerjees do? I will vote for Modiji.""

""What about the institutions that are being destroyed?"" I ask.

""What is he doing to the RBI?""

""Modiji is good. It is his team that is to blame,"" he insists.

I am not a Modi fan so after a point I just listen. He continues his animated soliloquy.

Suddenly, he surprises me.

""Madam, do you know there is one person in this country who can actually give Modiji a fight.""

""And who is that?"" I ask.

""She is a mirror image of Indira Gandhi. mAnd do you know she has the same voice too.""

This one is an unusual Modi fan. ""If she appears on the scene, she definitely has my vote.""

I am speechless. This diehard Modi supporter's blatant adoration surprises me. Though just a few days ago, I too was part of an enthralled audience at a private event in Kolkata.

While we drive to my destination I relive the fascinating insight into the mind of the elusive Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.

Political dynasty was not about entitlement and legacy. ""I think the idea of dynasty arises because generations of us have been in politics but it was not instilled in us,"" Priyanka explains.

To the outside world political dynasty reeked of privileges but to a young child who had seen her grandmother Indira Gandhi's political and private life merge into one, it was not a legacy of privileges, but a supreme sense of duty and service. A legacy of greater responsibility.

She had seen her grandmother's physical courage, her inherent strength, her femininity and her gentleness as a grandmother. She had a great sense of humour too.

""It is strange my mother, Sonia Gandhi, being Italian, is more submissive and quiet compared to my grandma who was a very strong lady. She was a very powerful example in front of us.""

As Priyanka matured, her physical resemblance to her grandmother became more obvious, prompting people to draw parallels.

""It was not a quality, just the fact we looked similar. She was bossing people. I wanted to boss over kids,"" she adds with humour.

IMAGE: The resemblence between grandmother Indira Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi. Photograph: Kind courtesy twitter _PriyankaG

Memories of that fateful morning when her grandmother was assassinated are etched forever. She had borrowed a jhola from her grandmother for a drama competition and left for school. Her mother was alone at home, while her father was in West Bengal.

It was six days after Diwali and the sound of gunshots had stunned her mother who stepped outside and found the then prime minister lying on the path between the house and the office. She breathed her last before she could reach the hospital.

""We could not fathom that she was killed. She was larger than life. It was while watching television that we realised my father had been made prime minister. I remember saying they've made a mistake. See what they have written below papa's name.""

Life changed drastically. They now lived under the shadow of threat.

She and her brother were home schooled. For a young girl it was an excruciatingly boring schedule. They barely went out.

Once a week they were permitted to visit a friend's home.

When she entered college, she was initially terrified as seniors ""were waiting to catch Rajiv Gandhi's daughter"".

""While I was comfortable at a table with heads of State, I had never interacted with people my age,"" she points out.

At heart she was a simple girl who just wanted to have a normal existence. She handled it with aplomb and grace and after a couple of months, college turned into the nicest experience of her life.

She had seen her father Rajiv Gandhi live a private life as a pilot with his shy Italian wife. As a youngster, she had watched her parents's internal struggle to enter a world so different from their own.

A series of events pushed him into the world of politics.

""He was not perpetuating a dynasty. It was a sense of duty, a greater mission, a calling. That's how I understood politics. It was a different patriotism from the one we see today,"" she explains.

1991 brought greater trauma for the Gandhi family. Her father's assassination brought her world crumbling down.

""He was my best friend, the stabilising force in my life. He was strong, gentle, kind and I could rely on him 100%. Each time he left home I felt he was not coming back. We had psychologically lived with his loss,"" Priyanka reveals.

When it finally happened, the family was devastated.

Engulfed in pain, she viewed the whole world through that angst.

Her anchor had gone. She saw the family as victims of a ghastly event.

She spent many years doing Vipassana and meditation.

In 1998, the Congress asked her mother to campaign. ""We had a family discussion. We explained to our mother that you will be used, you will be discarded once you are done with the campaign. A few days later I got a call from my mother. She said, 'I have decided to campaign'.""

""We were stunned. Why was she doing this? She said she couldn't face our father's photograph.""

Her mother dropped her low-key profile and took on the task of memorising her speech for the Ramlila Ground, ""There were a lakh-and-a-half people. Her hands were shaking. 'I can't, I can't,' she kept saying. We told her it was too late, she had made this choice.""

""Gradually, we saw her transformation. It was her courage, her sense of duty. She went beyond the interests of the self towards a greater calling.""

It was in 2008 that Priyanka found the courage to acquaint herself with one of her father's assassins at the Vellore Central Jail.

Nalini Sriharan, who was married to Murugan who made the bomb, was also sentenced to death. She found herself forgiving those who had brutally brought his life to an abrupt end. They had a cause they believed in, they committed this horrific act for this cause.

Reminiscing about her meeting with Nalini, Priyanka points out, ""I went to forgive her. The minute she started speaking, I realised I was so wrong. She had been a victim too. I was 19, she was 23. She was one of 9 children with an alcoholic father and a mother who struggled to send them to school.""

""She had fallen in love with a maths teacher and was pregnant with his child. I thought I was the victim, but when I met her, I realised how her life had been destroyed. I saw another human being suffering.""

""I was better, I thought. I was going to forgive her. I was the victim. But that single experience altered my way of looking at things. We are all victims.""

""We just have to move from judgement to empathy. Victimhood has now become a political tool. Every time we suffer we think it is because of others, which is just not true.""

A fundamental lesson Priyanka learnt early was the fact that power did not come from within. Power is given to you by the people you work for. Tomorrow if the people don't want you, you will have no relevance.

She said she had a problem with the way politicians talk down to people.

""The way we were brought up, if our parents saw us being delusional even for a second it would have been difficult for us.""

""People tell me, 'Your children are very humble'. I tell them what is there not to be humble about. And how could I be consumed by a delusion of power? I had seen so much trauma, loss and violence associated with power. These were my set of problems. Others have worse.""

Like any other mother she has enjoyed the role and faced the same issues.

Children will constantly challenge you. You may want them to be a particular way, but they will be their own person.

Her 18-year-old son Rehan and her 16-year-old daughter Miraya now teach her. ""Our children are our best teachers. They are sharp. I keep quiet, they lecture me. They straighten you.""

""The other day I was going to Lodi Gardens for a walk. I was putting on lipstick. My daughter asked me why I was doing that. I told her someone might ask for a selfie with me. 'Why? Why would someone take a selfie with you?'"" she recalls.

""Children are creatures of their own. They should never have a legacy other than the legacy of being a good human being.""

""I have faith in the people. They will vote out of a sense of survival. Our democracy has to be kept alive. Democracy means bringing people together, hearing every voice. As a people we love to complain. You cannot take away our right.""

When asked about the Emergency her grandmother had imposed, she replies, ""I was a child at that time. But then it was grandma who called elections and lost, so she realised it was a wrong decision.""

For a firm believer in democracy, was she not being autocratic by not giving into her party's request for her to step into public life?

With an endearing smile she says, ""I am 46 years old, I still have time. For now I have made a conscious call to not get too involved with politics, but just be there for my brother and mother."""

As a step towards 'merger', all chief educational officers have been instructed to send the list of such elementary and high schools located within or near higher secondary schools. ""The department is collecting the data now so that action can be initiated next academic year. After merging, the school buildings will be converted into libraries or adult learning centres,"" said an officer, requesting anonymity.

Friday was set as the deadline to submit the list, according to a letter sent to all officers on December 17, days after they met in Chennai.

Sources said a government order had been issued in this connection but the officers were instructed not to act upon it till the next academic year. ""However, we have been instructed to increase the students' strength in the meanwhile,"" said one of the officers who attended the meet.

Tamil Nadu had earlier informed the Centre that it had taken an initiative to merge 1,053 government schools. Also, funds for another 1,950 schools with less than 15 students each were stopped recently.

This move was adopted so that Tamil Nadu adhered to Samagara Shisksha Abhiyan's (SSA) guidelines. SSA was formed recently by merging erstwhile schemes -- Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (Class I-VIII) and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (Class IX-XII).

Under the new guidelines, government schools with less than 15 students are not eligible to receive the composite school grant, ranging from ?25,000 to ?1,00,000 depending on student strength.

Composite grants were used by schools to improve infrastructure, maintain toilets, buy material to develop students' reading skills and carry out other development activities.

Of the 31,200 government schools, nearly 3,000 institutions that come under various municipalities or are run by departments such as Adi Dravidar, Kallar Reclamation, forest and social welfare have a strength of less than 25 students, shows official data.

So, only ?89.6 crore was released as composite grants for schools in TN this year despite ?97.18 crore being earmarked. Condemning this, educationist Prince Gajendra Babu said the governments were systematically destroying state-funded schools by denying funds and it was unfair to expect parents to admit their children in these schools without adequate teaching staff or facilities."

The 'yatra', which is to start from Kurtha in Jehanabad district, is considered to be aimed at galvanizing people of his Koeri (Kushwaha) caste, which is in OBC group and accounts for six percent of the population, and also pillorying CM Nitish Kumar on the poor education scenario in the government-run schools in the state.

""For the last one and a half years, we have been campaigning for educational reforms and chalked out 25-point demands, but CM Nitish has ignored them,"" Kushwaha said.

Kushwaha, who left NDA and joined the RJD-led Grand Alliance in Bihar through Congress-led UPA last week, alleged that the BJP's national brass (read PM Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah) were in cahoots with CM Nitish who was bent on destroying both and his own party.

Kushwaha said his 'yatra' would cover all the districts before concluding on January 30, coinciding with the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. Incidentally, both the Centre and the CM have announced yearlong celebrations of Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary next year.

Kushwaha said he would also lead an 'aakrosh march' to the Raj Bhavan here on February 3. He would also submit a memorandum to governor Lalji Tandon, giving details of the demands backed by signatures of 1 crore people. The RLSP rank and file would start collecting signatures on the issue from January 1.

The 'yatra' from Kurtha is symbolic as Jehanabad district has strong presence of Koeri caste population. The place is significant for Kushwaha as the Jehanabad parliamentary constituency is represented by Arun Kumar, who had won the seat on the RLSP ticket in 2014, but later turned a rebel. Recently, he condemned CM Nitish and the police lathicharge on the procession of Kushwahas in Patna. Arun's move was considered as trying to mend fences with Kushwaha.

Otherwise, Kushwaha also said the Nitish government's decision to merge two primary schools into one owing to the lack of teachers and to provide transport facility for the distantly located children to reach the newly merged school was both ""impractical and faulty""."

As many as 13 schools have recorded zero enrolment, while another 171 schools have fewer than 20 students. A total of 1,140 schools have fewer than 40 students.

These were the details furnished by the state in 2017-18 to the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), a database about schools in India, developed at the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA). According to officials, the reason for the low enrolment is parents' preference to private schools due to lack of infrastructure, teacher absenteeism, and poor quality education in government schools, among others.

This is in addition to 1,773 schools without buildings, which the government plans to merge with nearby schools with infrastructure. The merger plan comes after the state failed to land for the 1,773 schools. Most of these schools have been merged. Of them, 190 schools in Patna district alone.

The enrolment in government schools dropped to 1.8 crore in 2017-18 from 1.99 crore in 2016-17. The number is expected to drop further when fresh data is examined, diluting the government claim of more than 99% enrolment.

The most alarming trend reflected through U-DISE is that the dropout rate from Class 9 to Class 10- almost 25% of the total enrollment in 2014-15, which jumped to 39.73% in 2016-17, the period when there was unprecedented increase in the number of students failing in Bihar class 10 and 12 board exams.

One of the reasons for the drop, authorities admitted, is parents' preference for private schools for better education and infrastructure.

""If the incentives (such as scholarships, bicycles) attached with government schools are removed, the number will drop further. Many students get admitted to government schools to avail incentives but study in private schools. In 2011, when reports on inflated enrolments surfaced, it created a flutter,"" an education department official added.

Three years ago, the then principal secretary, department of education, Amarjeet Sinha, had said the duplication of enrolment in government schools could be up to 20%.

Bihar Education Project Council (BSEPC) director Sanjay Singh, however, said that the drop in students' number was due to government's drive to do away with duplication in enrolment. ""The number children availing mid-day meal has come down to 1.20 crore compare to previous years,"" he added.

Singh said that the sanctity of data was being maintained. ""Earlier, there was no data on private schools. Now, that is also being prepared. Around 12 lakh more students have joined private schools, not necessarily because they have suddenly opened, but because they are being documented,"" he added.

Singh said under the Right to Education Act, there should be a school within a kilometre for Class 1-5 students provided there are a minimum of 40 students. ""If that is not the case, teachers can be used elsewhere more effectively. Having 3-4 teachers for fewer than 40 children is not relevant,"" he said, adding he would do another appraisal in January after studying the reasons and reports of physical verification."

A proposal for 20 such schools with low enrolment was cleared by the north corporation's House meeting on Monday. These will give rise to 10 new schools.

Located mostly in the Karol Bagh, Narela and Rohini zones, these schools are currently running at places like Inderpuri, Pyare Lal Road, Shahbad Daulatpur, Nimari Colony, Shiv Nagar, Pratap Kunj, Avantika, Sangam Park, Molar Basti, Old Ranjeet Nagar, Azadpur Colony and Auchandi.

A senior corporation official attributed the decision to low enrolment, poor finances, and proper utilisation of resources. He gave the example of the proposal to merge Municipal Corporation Primary School (MCPS) Pyare Lal Road 2 and MCPS New Dev Nagar Co-ed School. ""Keeping in view better management, saving of posts and the poor economic condition of north corporation, it would be feasible to merge schools in case of availability of accommodation,"" he said.

The proposal also argues that more and more parents want to educate their wards in morning-shift schools. ""MCPS Pyarelal Road has 202 kids while the Dev Nagar school has 265. After merger, a school with 467 kids and 12 sections will be formed,"" the official said.

He added: ""There are many vacancies in other schools and the staff from the schools being closed down can be sent there. At the same time, we will be able to use the buildings and other infrastructure for purposes such as sports academies.""

The merger of the two schools alone would lead to a surplus of a principal, five teachers and two Class IV employees who could be reassigned. The official also said that 29 schools with low enrolment had been similarly shut down two years ago. But education experts have been criticising the corporations for their failure to enrol more children.

Khagesh Jha, a Supreme Court lawyer and education activist, remarked, ""If the corporation has extra land, why not add to the capital's school infrastructure so that more kids can be brought in the school system? There are more than 20 lakh kids outside the school system in the city. Besides, children from unrecognised schools too need to be brought to government schools.""

The north civic body runs 714 municipal primary schools, in which children, mostly from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, study. Enrolment in all corporation-run schools, however, has been declining steadily. Around 70,000 students have opted out of north schools since the 2012 trifurcation. It then had 3,70,648 students in its primary schools. This figure slid to 3,50,611 in 2013-14 and 3,14,022 in 2016-17. At present, around three lakh students are on the rolls."

The staff strength at eEach centre, comprising a head cook, an assistant and an organiser, increases with student strength. Of the Rs 5,000-Rs 7,000 a month paid to each employee, the Centre pays Rs 1,000 and the state the rest.

Concerned over the drop in government school enrolment with more than 1,000 schools having less than 10 children, the state has decided to re-position employees to centres where there is a demand. Officials have been asked to close centres in low-enrolment schools and transport food from nearby centres to children in these schools.

Condemning this, TN Noon Meal Workers Association secretary R Noorjahan said transporting food from nearby centres would delay distribution. ""Already 10,000 cooking assistant posts are vacant and this will weaken the nutritious meal programme further. When the government is ready to pay over Rs 1lakh for teachers in low-enrolment schools, what is the big deal about paying Rs.5,000 for cooks?""

Social welfare commissioner V Amuthavalli said the order, originally passed in 1992, was being implemented now. ""The aim was to rationalise the workforce. This involves several steps and centres will not be closed straightaway.""

Experts say this will impact student enrolment and eventually lead to closure of the schools. State has already planned to merge 1,053 schools with low enrolment and another 1,950 schools face an uncertain future with funds being cut."

The Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ranchi, will evaluate the merger of primary schools in Jharkhand. The state education department has roped in the institute for a detailed study of 4,600 merged schools to find out if the reorganisation has brought about any improvement or not, department officials said.

State education secretary AP Singh said, ""IIM Ranchi would see if the reorganisation has brought any benefits for students as well as the education system. It would also evaluate if the initiative brought about any improvement in the education of those students who were shifted to other schools in the merger process,"" he said. ""We have sought a financial proposal from the institute for the study.""

The reorganisation exercise of schools had also caught the interest of IIM Bangalore, which expressed its willingness to carry out a study on the process and its benefits, said the secretary.

Merging schools with low enrolment is an exercise that has been undertake by Rajasthan and Jharkhand in the country with the support of the Union government and NITI (National Institution for Transforming India) Aayog, the policy think tank of the Government of India. Jharkhand started the merging procedure in 2016-17.

Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) director Uma Shankar Singh said that there were 39,600 schools in 2016-17 under the education department in Jharkhand. ""Of them, 18,000 schools had 60 or fewer students. These schools had an average of one or two teachers per school. Providing quality education was a major challenge. One teacher was handling four-five classes at a time. How could one expect a better education in these schools?"" he said.

The council said that a four-step process -- field inspection; cross-district verification; block and district consultation; and final notification -- was undertaken to merge the schools.

Singh said that 98% students from the 4,600 primary schools had been shifted and 96% of the students had expressed satisfaction with the consolidation. ""We faced difficulty in shifting 150 schools due to some technical reasons. Now, the issue has been resolved, and students from 120 schools have been shifted,"" he said.

The reorganisation of primary schools benefited seven lakh students, giving them better teacher availability, and cut the requirement of 4,500 teaching positions. The merger process saved the government Rs 400 crore by reducing teaching positions and infrastructure requirements, said JEPC officials. The officials added that the funds thus saved would be spent on strengthening the education infrastructure of the merged schools."

Two years back when theatre director Nimi Ravindran, 43, got a grant to teach theatre to students at a public school, she was confident her fluency in the local language, Kannada, would be enough to communicate with the students. Instead she found that all but one of 20 fifth graders at a Kannada-medium public school in Bengaluru's Marathahalli area spoke Bengali.

""Most of them said they were from West Bengal. I wondered what these children were doing so far from home,"" Ravindran said. As she started conducting workshops in Hindi, that the children were somewhat familiar with, their stories started flowing.

""They spoke about the trees near their homes, the spirits that lived in them and the clean air. They missed their home,"" Ravindran recalled.

The Sundarban delta--nearly one million hectare in area--is formed at the point where the rivers Ganga, Brahmaputra and Meghna merge into the Bay of Bengal. The delta is extremely fertile as the three rivers carry an estimated one billion tonnes of sediments.

Nearly 40% of Sundarban--the world's largest mangrove forest, three times as large as Goa--is in India, the rest is in neighbouring Bangladesh.

Sundarban (literally 'beautiful forest') features in the list of UNESCO's 209 natural heritage sites in the world for supporting ""an exceptional level of biodiversity in its terrestrial, marine and aquatic habitats"".

Over the last 40 years, Sundarban has lost 220 sq km--nearly the size of Kolkata--to the sea, according to Sugata Hazra, director of the School of Oceanographic Studies at Jadavpur University.

As rising sea levels engulf entire islands, residents are migrating en masse, from the Bangladesh as well as the Indian side of Sundarban.

Not all are environmental migrants, but with no documentation of this kind of migration, the numbers are hard to estimate.

But ripples of this migration are being felt over 2,000 km to the southwest. As many as 40% of students in some Kannada-medium government schools in Bengaluru speak Bengali, according to the Samridhdhi Trust that runs bridge schools to help these children cope.

IndiaSpend tracked some of these migrants from Sundarbans to the Kalihata slum in east Bengaluru's Marathahalli area. Studies show that several districts of West Bengal, not just in Sundarban but across the state, are extremely vulnerable to the impact of climate change.

By 2060, nearly 1.4 billion people across the world will be at risk of becoming environmental migrants, some internal and others flocking across borders. The annual rate of sea level rise is expected to triple by the year 2100, making agriculture as well as everyday life in low-lying places, like Sundarban, unsustainable.

This is the third story in our series on how climate change is disrupting people's lives (you can read the first story here and the second here). The series combines ground reporting from India's climate change hotspots with the latest scientific research, and highlights how people are adapting to the changing climate.

The Sundarban delta, home to the world's largest mangrove forest, is at risk from rising sea levels because of global warming.

One in 10 individuals living in a low-lying coastal area on this planet is in India. Along with China, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam, India has the highest population that will be exposed to the impact of flooding and extreme weather events that the rising sea will bring, according to a 2015 study.

Human activities have already caused global warming by 1 degree Celsius, according to the September 2018 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world body for assessing science related to climate change. Governments of 195 countries are on this panel.

""Over 90% of the heat trapped in the climate system is actually in the oceans. As the oceans warm, just like liquid in a thermometer, it expands and (the) sea level rises,"" said John Church, research scientist and one of the lead authors for the chapter on sea level rise in the IPCC's fifth assessment report.

Melting of non-polar ice, like that in the Himalayas, the thermal expansion of oceans as they warm, and the melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are pushing up global sea levels.

""With unmitigated emissions the sea level rise could be as much as one metre by 2100,"" Church said. If the entire ice sheet over Greenland were to melt, that alone would cause global sea levels to rise by seven metres. If all the ice sheets in Antarctica melt, it could push the levels up by another 55 m.

A video by the European Space Agency (ESA) explaining what contributes to sea-level rise.

Sea levels will continue to rise not just through the century but well past 2100. For people living on small islands, low-lying coastal areas and deltas, this means, at best, that more salt water from the sea will enter their fields making the soil unsuitable for agriculture, there will be increased flooding, frequent cyclones and infrastructure damage. At worst, it means the piece of land they call home would be under water.

Scanty research on the India side of Sundarban

The changing climate in the Bangladesh side of Sundarban is well documented but not much is known about the Indian side, according to Selvin Pitchaikani, an oceanographer at the Institute of Environmental Studies and Wetland Management (IESWM) in Kolkata.

Pitchaikani, who published his data on the changing weather patterns in Sundarban in 2017, found that the land is increasingly growing saline and that cyclonic storms have become frequent. Rainfall patterns have already changed, making conventional cultivation difficult for farmers, his research found.

But ""to come to any conclusion, we need data for a minimum of 20-25 years. We need more weather stations in the region as well as funding"", he said emphasising the need for more research.

With migration, children grow up without a parent, fewer people to care for the elderly

It's a four-hour car ride from Kolkata to the Sundarban delta region. Once here, a car becomes useless. To reach the island of Mousuni, it's another hour-long journey of switching between electricity-powered rickshaws while on small stretches of land, and small boats to cross the streams.

Electricity reached Mousuni--one of the larger islands in the delta with a population of over 25,000--a year ago, trailing climate change by decades.

Mousuni is an island in the Sundarban delta with a population of over 25,000 residents. Frequent floods and the rising sea level have forced many to migrate from Mousuni.

Sheikh Sufi, 27, grew up in Mousuni. His home is on the coast overlooking the Bay of Bengal. ""We used to grow rice and chillies but a decade back there was severe flooding. After that the crops haven't grown,"" Sufi said, holding his three-year-old son Abdul Rehman over his shoulder. Once their land became infertile due to salt water, they learnt to fish. Now, six months a year, Sufi travels over 2,000 km to Kerala to work as a construction worker earning about Rs 300 a day.

Like Sufi, nearly 96% of these environmental migrants are headed to other areas within India, according to a study of 1,315 households in the region. The study was conducted by Deltas, Vulnerability & Climate Change: Migration and Adaptation (DECCMA), a consortium of researchers from universities in UK, Ghana, Bangladesh and India.

Of these migrants, 83% are men and 17% women. Most are young; between the ages 21 and 30. The men interviewed for the study said they were moving for employment opportunities as agriculture was unsustainable. The women were moving to either join their husbands post marriage or to live with other family members.

Left behind are the elderly, children and most women.

""There are two types of migrations--proactive, who plan their retreat from the coast in advance and reactive, who move only when there is no other alternative left. In Sundarban we are still witnessing reactive migration,"" said Indrila Guha, principal at Basanti Devi College, Kolkata and a researcher in environmental economics.

Children growing up without a parent, fewer people to care for the elderly, and poor women who could become easy targets for traffickers, are some of the potential fallouts of this situation, according to Guha.

For the ones who move with their families in tow, life continues to remain tough. The children in Bengaluru's bridge schools struggle to adjust to life in the city, the language barrier making it even more challenging for them to adjust. Parents frequently move in search of jobs and education is one of the first casualties.

Residents adapt to rising seas

As the onslaught of the sea continued, Sufi's home was reduced to rubble. During high tide, the sea waves wash away chunks of his house. On a low tide day, like the one when IndiaSpend visited, his home provides a view of the sea that tourists scout the globe for.

Sufi, his wife and young son live with a neighbour. ""We have no money to build another home. Where can we go?"" he said, with eyes downcast.

Sheikh Sufi, 27, outside his destroyed home in Mousuni. Sufi works as a construction worker over 2,000 km away in Kerala for six months in a year.

""We have no policies directed at rehabilitation and resettlement of people who have lost their land due to sea level rise and coastal erosion,"" said Hazra, of Jadavpur University.

Rainfall is usually heavy, and severe cyclonic storms frequent. This area receives 1,501-2,500 mm of rainfall, compared to the Indian average of 801-1,500 mm.

Those who haven't migrated try to adapt. Shabir Sheikh, 27 and Khushbanoo Bibi, 25, married for 12 years, are constructing a new home for themselves and their three children, on higher ground.

""During floods, the stove gets wet and so we are making sure in the new home it will be higher so flood waters don't reach it,"" Khushbanoo said. Most women here cook in the open, on mud stoves and firewood, which makes it impossible to cook during the floods.

Shabir Sheikh and his wife Khushbanoo Bibi's new home is being built at a higher level to keep flood waters at bay.

The government is helping by building embankments along the coast to stem the flood waters, and flood shelters to accommodate those affected by floods. There are no long-term policies to help relocate and rehabilitate residents.

Double burden of rehabilitation and poor health in Sundarban

Globally, of the regions in the low lying coastal areas at the risk of flooding, most are underdeveloped or developing.

Nearly a third of the children under the age of five in South-24 Parganas, the district where Mousuni is, are stunted--short for their age. Half of the households still lack modern sanitation facilities and as many six in every 10 women are anaemic. Yet, the district is now having to prioritise infrastructure to deal with climate change.

Depending on the material used to build the embankment, a one-km long section could cost as much as Rs 1 crore. As seas rise, locals plead for the government to build more walls even as they are aware that these are just short term measures against climate change.

Threat to biodiversity

More than 200 species of plants, 400 species of fishes and 300 species of birds, numerous phytoplankton, fungi, bacteria, zooplankton, reptiles, amphibians and more call Sundarban their home. Even within Sundarban, species differ depending on the salinity of the soil. Sundarban is also home to many threatened and endangered animals like the Royal Bengal tiger, estuarine crocodile and the Indian python.

The changing temperature of water and increased salinity and acidity in the soil has already impacted the region's biodiversity, according to studies by the Marine Science Department of Calcutta University and the Department of Biological Science of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in Kolkata.

While the rising sea level impacts biodiversity, experts also blame human activity. ""If, for instance, there were no obstructions on the major rivers and flows were not diverted, eroded material would have reached the delta,"" said Anurag Danda, senior advisor for Climate Change Adaptation at the World Wildlife Fund.

""Between the Tehri dam (Uttarakhand) and Farraka barrage (Murshidabad, West Bengal), there are at least 1,000 interventions along the Ganges that either divert water or hold water resulting in much reduced sediment delivery,"" he explained.

Problems for nature and man will continue to grow as sea levels continue to rise, scientists say. ""The question would be not whether it would happen but how quickly it would happen,"" Church, co-author of the latest IPCC report, said.

What is the way out for those living along the coastline? Planned retreat to safer places, aided by the government, is the main option, Hazra said. ""It will be economically beneficial as a whole rather than keeping people there and rebuilding embankments."""

After merger of 4,600 primary schools, the Jharkhand government is planning to shut over 6,466 middle schools (classes 6 to 8), having less than 100 students.

These schools would be merged with upgraded high schools in phases, starting with the institutions, which have less than 50 students, education department officials said on Thursday.

Initially, 3,732 middle schools having less than 50 students would be undertaken for merger. The process of merging has already been started.

""Merger is an effort to provide quality education to students in a better educational ambience. Jharkhand has around 411 such middle schools where number of students is less than 10. If these schools are merged with high schools, students would get better education,"" said state education secretary AP Singh.

""As per the rules in the right to education (RTE), there should be at least three trained graduate teacher (TGT) in middle schools where number of students is less than 100. It means, we would have to afford additional Rs 18 lakh on teachers' salary even in the schools where number of students is less than 10, which is not logical,"" he added.

The decision comes at a time when the opposition parties and critics have been criticising the state government for merging the primary schools. Several ruling party elected representatives have also been lobbying with the government against the move. There have been protests in several parts of the state as well, against merger of schools.

The officials, however, argue that, ideally, there should be one middle school and five to seven primary schools in a panchayat. As many as 6,466 middle schools have been identified in Jharkhand, which could be merged with high schools within a 5-km radius in a panchayat, Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) officials said.

The state government has decided to offer bicycles to the students, who would be shifted to other schools so that they do not face any trouble in commuting to the school.

Meanwhile, the JEPC officials said they have completed the merging exercise of 4,600 primary schools.

JEPC director Uma Shankar Singh said there were 39,600 schools in 2016-17 under education department in Jharkhand. ""Of them, 18,000 schools had 60 or few students. These schools had an average of 1 or two teachers per school. Providing quality education was a major challenge. One teacher was handling four to five classes at a time.

The reorganisation of primary schools benefited seven lakh students with better teachers' availability and reduced the requirements of teachers by 4,500. Besides, the process saved government's Rs 400 crore through reduced teachers and infrastructure requirements, JEPC officials said.

Education Dept ropes in IIM Ranchi for merged school evaluation

State education secretary AP Singh said the department has roped in Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ranchi, for evaluation of the merged schools. The IIM, Ranchi would see if the reorganization process brought any difference in improving the education of students, who were shifted in merging process.

He said IIM Bangalore has also expressed willingness for a study of the reorganization process and its benefit."

Ever since Anjali Kumari, a Class X student of Bihar government-run GA High School in Lalganj, spoke up against the caste-wise sitting arrangement at her school, all benefits she is entitled to under various government schemes have been put on hold, allegedly by the school administration.

On Wednesday, the girl, in a written complaint to Lalganj Block Education Officer (BEO) Arvind Kumar Tiwari, maintained that ""making students enrol and sit in classrooms on lines of caste (social groups) is violation of our fundamental rights.""

Another Class IX student of the school also said the practice has been going for the past four years.

The segregation of students on castelines came to light after the Vaishali District Education Officer sent a team to the school on Monday. A detailed inspection report in this regard has been sent to State Secondary Education Director.

Advertising

According to school records, the GA High School has more than 1,500 students in Classes IX to XII, and castes of each student is mentioned against their names on attendance sheets, reportedly to ""help the school administration to easily identify beneficiaries"" of all government schemes.

The attendance sheets have been seized by the Vaishali District Secondary Education Office.

Under various government schemes, a Class IX student is entitled to Rs 3,000 to purchase a bicycle; girl students from Classes IX to XII are entitled to Rs 1,000 for uniform and Rs 150 for sanitary napkins; students from Classes IX to XII are also entitled to Rs 1800 scholarship annually.

All the benefits are, however, given only against 75 per cent attendance.

Claiming that the report of compliance on government schemes are sought every month, and at times fortnightly, the school's in-charge principal, Meena Kumari, said: ""My predecessor, Phool Mohammed Ansari, had introduced segregation on caste lines in attendance register in 2014 and I have been following it because it has comes as handy to identify beneficiaries and prepare the reports.""

Dismissing the allegations of ""dividing students on caste lines"", she, said: ""One should know that we have only six classrooms, which can accommodate maximum 600 students. As we have a daily attendance of 50-60 per cent, we have to merge two sections (of a class) daily... There is no feeling of discrimination on caste lines. Nor have parents and students complained about it."" Meena Kumari has submitted a written explanations to the DEO.

Lalganj BEO AK Tiwari, however, said: ""Attendance sheets on caste or social category lines is a bad practice. I have not heard of a Bihar school having such registers..."" The BEO added they had warned the school administration about the practice twice after random inspections in 2017.

Vaishali DEO, Sangeeta Sinha, said: ""We had sent an inspection team to the school and found attendance registers in violation of rules. We have sent our report to Director, secondary education."""

They want your democracy. They're hovering just beyond the horizon in those black helicopters. They control the media and Wall Street. They've burrowed into a deep state that stretches like a vast tectonic plate beneath America's fragile government institutions. They want to replace the United States with the United Nations, erase national borders, and create one huge, malevolent international order.

The only thing that stands in their way is -- take your pick -- the Second Amendment, Twitter, or Donald Trump.

Conspiracy theorists have, in fact, been warning about just such a New World Order for decades, going all the way back to the isolationist critics of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and to fears about the United Nations in the post-World War II moment. During the Cold War, the John Birch Society and fringe elements of the Republican Party nurtured just such anti-globalist sentiments, but they never made much headway in the mainstream world. As the Cold War ended, however, the anti-globalist virus began to spread again, this time more rapidly, and it's threatening to become a pandemic.

The Agenda 21 Dystopia

On September 11, 1990, just after Saddam Hussein ordered the invasion of Kuwait and just before the reunification of Germany, George H.W. Bush spoke of a ""new world order"" that would unite all countries in defense of the rule of law and thwart the Iraqi autocrat's regional ambitions. The phrase was meant as a rallying cry, not an actual plan, but that didn't stop the president's America First critics from reading all manner of mayhem into his speech.

The elder Bush, who had long toiled in the shadow of Ronald Reagan, was in some ways a curious target for those who feared the end of U.S. sovereignty. As recent posthumous assessments revealed, he was an early champion of states' rights (against civil rights), supported prayer in school and the NRA, made a U-turn as a presidential candidate to oppose abortion, launched wars in Panama and the Persian Gulf, and presided over the collapse of the Soviet Union. Anti-globalists, however, focused on a different part of Bush's résumé: he'd gone to Yale, later belonged to a wealthy elite of Texas oil barons, served as ambassador to the United Nations, and was a card-carrying member of both the Council on Foreign Relations and that most elite of global agenda-setting outfits, the Trilateral Commission.

Such characteristics made him particularly vulnerable to attacks from the far right. Preacher Pat Robertson, for instance, disliked Bush's staid Episcopalianism and resented losing to the future president in the 1988 Republican primaries. In his 1991 bestseller, The New World Order, Robertson refocused all his ire on the president's presumed global ambitions. ""Is George Bush merely an idealist or are there now plans underway to merge the interests of the U.S. and the Soviet Union in the United Nations?"" he asked rhetorically and then, of course, provided the answer:

""A single thread runs from the White House to the State Department to the Council on Foreign Relations to the Trilateral Commission to secret societies to extreme New Agers. There must be a new world order... There must be world government, a world police force, world courts, world banking and currency, and a world elite in charge of it all.""

Though that 1991 book is largely forgotten, the televangelist's attacks on Bush's ""globalism"" resurfaced again and again in different forms. Beginning in 1994, for instance, Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins' Left Behind series spun Robertson's dire predictions of a one-world government into 16 novels and several dreadful movies. Just to ensure that readers wouldn't miss their point, they even installed the anti-Christ as the head of the United Nations. More recently, Donald Trump's attacks on Hillary Clinton's elitism echoed some of the very themes Robertson had sounded almost three decades earlier.

Oddly, though, Bush and Robertson agreed on one thing, on which they even found common ground with former Vice President Al Gore: the importance of addressing climate change.

As president, Bush pushed a number of environmental initiatives related to air quality, ozone depletion, and climate change more generally. In 1992, his administration even endorsed a tepid ""action plan,"" Agenda 21, that came out of that year's global environmental meeting in Rio de Janeiro. In reality, it was just another of an endless stream of documents produced by such environmental conferences. For some Americans, however, those two words came to evoke the most terrifying aspect of the Bush era, proof positive that he was covertly constructing the very New World Order that he had invoked.

Perhaps the leading proponent of Agenda 21 conspiracy theories has been TV and radio personality Glenn Beck. In 2012, he even published a dystopian novel called (you won't be surprised to learn) Agenda 21. In it, he and co-author Harriet Parke fingered environmentalists as the true agents of the coming apocalypse and issued dire warnings about climate change becoming the lever a future global authority would use to eradicate national sovereignty and enslave Americans to a collective vision. ""Just a generation ago, this place was called America,"" Beck and Parke wrote. ""Now, after the worldwide implementation of a UN-led program called Agenda 21, it's simply known as 'the Republic.' There is no president. No Congress. No Supreme Court. No freedom.""

Once you start looking for Agenda 21, it pops up in all sorts of strange places. Newt Gingrich ran for president in 2012 with a pledge to rescind the ""plan."" Ted Cruz linked it to -- you guessed it -- George Soros and warned that its implementation would deprive Americans of their right to play golf (no joke). Most recently, YouTube and Twitter have lit up with contrived reports that Agenda 21, not climate change, was somehow responsible for the latest California wildfires.

And here's the truly bizarre part: while Glenn Beck, Newt Gingrich, Ted Cruz, and the rest of them were nattering on about an obscure, non-binding U.N. document, they were missing the real story. A nightmarish New World Order was indeed being constructed around them. It's global, malevolent, aimed at destroying ever more American lives, and -- according to a recent Trump administration report -- getting worse by the minute."
