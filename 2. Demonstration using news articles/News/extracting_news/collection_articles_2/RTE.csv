States in turn are to reimburse a certain amount of money for every RTE admission.

However, it turns out that the Maharashtra government is looking around for ways to not pay these schools the money it owes them.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Maharashtra, led by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, can claim credit for many successes, especially with the irrigation project Jalyukt Shivar and an impressive infrastructure upgrade topping the list. However, its record on one front has been abysmal, i.e., in fulfilling its responsibility under the Right to Education (RTE) Act.

According to Section 12 of the RTE, non-minority unaided private schools are required to reserve 25 per cent of the seats in entry-level classes (either primary level or Class 1) for students belonging to disadvantaged groups (DGs) [Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), etc] and economically weaker sections (EWS) [income less than a certain amount]. The state in return is supposed to pay these schools, for every RTE admission, an amount fixed by the government or the tuition fee of a school, whichever is less. Maharashtra has fixed an amount of Rs 17,000 a year for RTE students.

But it goes to great lengths to avoid reimbursing this amount to schools. Though the schools have been reserving seats under RTE since 2012, the government tried to get out of its commitment by simply agreeing to pay dues for only one academic year. Then, there was disagreement over the actual amount due and how it should be calculated. The government said it owed Rs 300 crore while the schools said the amount was more than 1,000 crore.

This mismatch in estimates came about because the government wanted to pay only for fresh RTE admissions while the schools were asking to be compensated for all RTE admissions (new and repeat/old students - explained in detail here).

Even to date, the dues of past academic years have not been fully released to all the private schools. Now, the Maharashtra government has come up with a new plan to avoid paying the money it owes to these institutions. In a government resolution released recently, it has modified the norms for RTE reimbursement stating that ""if a private school is using any government land and benefiting from the same then the school would not receive reimbursement for students who have been admitted in 25 per cent RTE quota,"" Mumbai Mirror reported.

Through this order, the government has effectively imposed a retrospective binding of sorts in an agreement that is in force for years and it has done so in a one-sided manner. This is a textbook definition of ""breach of contract"". When the government leased out land, it didn't impose a condition that schools will have to reserve 25 per cent seats for EWS/DG category students. Nor does the RTE Act mandate that those schools that have received land from the government at concessional rates will not be compensated for fulfilling the RTE quota. Hence, both from the RTE Act and the leasing agreement, the government's action is prima facie illegal. Less said about the ethical aspect of its action, the better.

Independent English Schools Association (IESA) secretary Rajendra Singh told Swarajya that ""the government's action is not just illogical but outright illegal. The RTE and land leasing are two separate contracts. In any case, under the RTE Act, the government gives reimbursement for only tuition fees and not for infrastructure costs the school has to bear. Land comes under the latter category. How can the two be clubbed? If the government was paying per student reimbursement for infrastructure costs also, then they had a case. In such a scenario, they could have deducted this from total reimbursement, but how can they not reimburse the tuition fees?""

Singh further explained that the government simply ""doesn't have the data to ascertain how many schools have the land leasing agreement with the government. Nor it has the manpower to determine this number. It will take anywhere between one to two years to collect the data. This is nothing but their latest attempt to delay payments to private schools."""

Right To Education (RTE) helpline was launched recently by the Social Welfare Department of Karnataka, which allows one to lodge complaints and get information on the Act. The Executive Director of the Child Rights Trust, Vasudeva Sharma, spoke to RadioActive about how the helpline could be used effectively.

Vasudeva Sharma explained that the RTE Act had been introduced way back in 2009 in Karnataka, and a lot of calls used to be received by the Child Rights Trust members on their personal numbers seeking clarifications. Even though there were no instructions available regarding RTE at that time, they used to clarify or give information in a comprehensible way. Of late, the calls had been about more specific and less common information.

He said they had attempted to set up a hotline back then, which failed because their personal numbers were still popular. The new helpline would have to have employees well-versed in the intricacies of RTE - the national Act as well as the rules for Karnataka and section (12)(1)(C), because (12)(1)(C) was often misused.

He spoke about the dangers of (12)(1)(C) being misused and despite it having popular aspects like forbidding corporal punishment, or stating the kinds of facilities an institution must have, how that could cause people to lose trust in it. It gave the impression that (12)(1)(C) was introduced as an attempt to control private institutions, as the condition laid down for availing this provision spoke only of what was expected of the institutions without placing any responsibility on the government. With the rampant misuse of this section, private institutions became richer but could not be brought under the control - and that such situations would lead to mistrust in the RTE Act itself.

Vasudeva Sharma said that he used to find a lot of children in government schools, but of late the number had been dwindling because they had moved to private schools. However, over time, parents were faced with demands for multiple additional payments. This at times forced the children back into government schools, and other times, they continued education there despite the heavy expenditure.

He also proposed some solutions:

On the move to make 8th standard the equivalent of 10th standard, Vasudeva Sharma said that though there had been discussions, the Central Government was yet to make a decision. He opined that it could not be taken without thorough discussions and analysis but was apprehensive about the imbalance a positive answer would create.

Vasudeva Sharma said that ignorance among activists and officials will deprive the children of the rights extended to them by the government. He suggested that guidelines be prepared wherein the responsibilities of each official is clearly mentioned and that such clarity would enable effective implementation of the Act.

He added that ignorance causes lack of coordination between the concerned departments and organisations, which could lead to failure of the programme."

Members of the southern unit of Right to Education (RTE) Forum have urged the government to withdraw the Bill tabled in Parliament seeking amendment to Section 16 of the RTE Act which aims at bringing back the detention policy in school education system.

In a resolution unanimously adopted at the first southern regional consultation on RTE, organised by the National RTE Forum and facilitated by Save the Children in Vijayawada, they alleged that it was an attempt to dilute the most progressive section of the Act through 'backdoor' methods. ""This is an ill-conceived move aimed at victimising children from the marginalised communities such as Dalits, adivasis, the urban poor, persons with disabilities and other disadvantaged sections.

The resolution demanded that the Centre allocate 6 % of the GDP and the State Governments 25 % of their respective budgets to ensure care, protection and equal right to quality education for all children.

The members said they would urge political parties to include 'right to equitable quality education for all children' in their political agenda in the 2019 elections.

Lakshmi works as a domestic help with a few families in Bengaluru. Her daughter during the academic year 2018-2019 had been admitted to LKG in a private school through the Right to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act 2009, section 12(1)(c). The Act promises 25 percent reservation in private unaided schools for weaker sections and disadvantaged groups.

Lakshmi chose to avail this choice as she felt that in government schools, children are left to themselves and aren't provided adequate attention. She says that she wants to educate her daughter, and felt private school was the best option.

There are several other parents from marginalised groups who would like to avail free education in private unaided schools, during the academic year 2019-2020. But that might not be a possibility if proposed amendments to the RTE rules, for which the cabinet has given the nod, come through. The proposed amendment gives government schools the priority, and the choice of availing admission in a private unaided school will be applicable only if there are no government schools in the neighbourhood. The Minister for Law and Parliamentary affairs Krishna Byregowda in his brief to the media said that preference to private schools has resulted in the government schools having fewer enrollments.

""If parents want to send their children to government schools, they will. Why is the government forcing this upon parents ?"" asks B N Yogananda (General Secretary, RTE Students and Parents Association). He says the private school lobby who don't want children from disadvantaged communities to study in their schools, are pushing for this. While there has been the mention of following the Kerala model with these proposed amendments, Yoganand says that the governments schools in Karnataka aren't at the same level compared to Kerala, and parents in Karnataka aren't willing to send their children to government schools.

In terms of next steps, the association plans to meet the Principal Secretary (Primary and Secondary Education) and demand that the proposed amendments be withdrawn. If not they plan on staging wide protests, and as a last resort would file a petition in the court.

G Nagasimha Rao ( Director, Child Rights Trust ) and convener of the RTE Task Force highlighted the lack of consultations in the process od changing rules. He says that after the RTE rules have not been reviewed even once after being notified in 2012, and amendments were directly called for. The RTE Task Force in their letter to the Principal Secretary, demands that the plan for the proposed amendments be halted; and recommends consulting civil society organisations working in the field of education, concerned parents and children while formulating recommendation to amend RTE rules. The RTE task force too plans on holding protests if the governments goes ahead with the proposed amendments.

This is not the first time that there have been proposals to amend the RTE rules in Karnataka. In January 2018 similar amendment to the rules were proposed by the Education Department but were rejected after coming under severe opposition.

What the government is proposing isn't something outside the law, says Niranjan Aradhya (Centre for Child and Law, NLSIU). He says that section 3 of the RTE Act provides fundamental right to free and compulsory education in the neighborhood school, and there is nothing wrong if the state decides to admit children in a government school available in the neighbourhood.

He adds that other options - aided and unaided schools come in when there are no government schools in the neighbourhood. As a member of the committee by Karnataka Development Authority working to strengthen government schools, Niranjan opines that section 3 of the act must be implemented in letter and spirit and several concrete steps are to be taken in order to strengthen state government schools so that they are on par with central government schools.

The average RTE reimbursement for a child stood at Rs 6871 during the year 2017, compared to the maximum ceiling of Rs 11,848 (cost per child in government schools). This indicates that a large section of the private unaided schools charge a low fee, and come under the low fee paying category schools (LFP). While there are several private schools that provide quality education, the same can't be said about LFPs. Research has pointed to how they even fall short in providing English education, which is one of the reasons parents from marginalised groups are attracted to them in the first place. ""LFP schools can't be thought of as an alternative to government schools "" says Rishikesh Shanker, Associate Professor, Azim Premji University, who advocates for the strengthening of the public education system.

Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh had previously attempted to modify the RTE rules along the same lines that the Education Department of Karnataka has proposed. In a notification by the Department of Elementary Education (Government of Himachal Pradesh) dated June 6th, 2015, guidelines were provided for admission and reimbursement of children under section 12 of the RTE Act.

Under these guidelines the government schools and private unaided schools in the neighborhood would initiate the process of 25 percent reservation in private unaided schools only if the minimum number of students (25) have been filled in the entry standard of the government school. This notification was challenged in the High court in Smt Namikta vs State of HP and others. The grievance of the petitioner was that the notification is contrary to the provisions of section 12(1)(c) of RTE Act which doesn't contain any inhibition and therefore restricts the scope of the Act.

The High Court struck down the notification stating that the notification creates a hierarchy in availing the benefits under section 12(1)(c), and is being read in a contrary manner where importing"" an obligation to admit students from the weaker section and disadvantaged groups only where seats are not available in the state run schools and aided institutions would be to defeat the object of the provisions."" The court concluded that there is no hierarchy in the parent Act and therefore the state government is in violation of the provision of the Act.

A petition regarding similar concerns was raised in the Allahabad High Court in Ajay Kumar Patel vs State of UP where the court stated that a policy of hierarchy can't be laid down by the government as it is contrary to the Parliamentary Act.

While the proposed amendment in RTE act is not supported by parents, the idea of prioritising the government schools may not be bad, after all. The parents and several civil society organisations opposing the amendment think that the condition of government schools in Karnataka is abysmal, including the poor learning levels of students. However, available research shows that there is no difference in learning levels between both groups of students.

A study by Azim Premji Foundation between 2008 and 2013 conducted in Andhra Pradesh examines the difference in learning levels of students (randomly selected from government schools) who were provided a scholarship and attended private schools, and students who didn't receive the scholarship and continued attending government schools.

The private schools who were part of the study had to admit a maximum of 25 percent students from disadvantaged groups, in line with the current 25 percent quota under the RTE. The students were tested at the end of every year for five years on their learning outcomes in Telugu, Mathematics, English and EVS.

The results showed that there was no difference between the learning levels of the different groups of students, and that private schools didn't add any value to the learning levels of the students from disadvantaged groups who had hitherto been in government schools and had joined them. The author of the paper notes that worldwide research is divided on student achievements after obtaining choice to study in private schools, and currently there is no consensus on this matter."

They aren't sure if the authorities would do all that is needed to enhance the quality of government schools and bring them on a par with private ones.

Notably, Section 3 of the Act, which is considered the core of the legislation, provides children the fundamental right to free and compulsory education in a neighbourhood school.

According to the proposal, if there's a government school in neighbourhood of a child -- within 1km for primary education and 3km for higher primary -- he/she should get admitted to that instead of a private school.

Nagasimha G Rao, state convener of the RTE task force, said, ""The government is citing the example of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where government schools are in high demand. We're in touch with RTE activists there too. But the Karnataka scenario is different. Parents prefer English medium schools over government institutions.""

Mohammed Yousuf, a Marappa Garden resident and parent of a child who's an RTE beneficiary, said, ""I don't think government schools are up to the mark. They don't have good English teachers and lack infrastructure. Moreover, the nearest government school in our area is located on defence land, can be accessed by every passerby and has a dumpsite too. My son will not be safe.""

Education department officials admit that no new government school has been opened in the state in the past three years.

Citing a 2017 study by the RTE Forum, a national organization, which states that 90% of RTE students paid fees to private schools,Y Mariswamy, chairperson (in charge), Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights said, ""We get a lot of complaints from parents. It is sad that students are still made to pay fees at private schools despite being admitted under RTE. As we are the monitoring body for RTE and as well as child protection laws, I feel this move will give a boost to government schools and put in place systems required in these institutions.""

Niranjan Aradhya, senior fellow and programme head, Universalisation of Equitable Quality Education Programme, Centre for Child and the Law, NLSIU, said: ""This is a chance for government schools to improve. The government just needs to do a few basic things like recruit more English teachers and upgrade schools to the level of Kendriya Vidyalayas. To make RTE effective, they need to implement section 12(2) of the RTE Act which mandates private unaided schools receiving government largesse to reserve seats for weaker sections from their neighbourhood without the state having the obligation to reimburse them. Delhi has been following this since 2004."""

The State Cabinet's nod to amend the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act quota rules has come as a blow to families from lower socio-economic backgrounds.

Many parents have decided to protest the Cabinet's decision which stated that children from weaker sections and disadvantaged communities can get admission in private schools under the RTE quota only if there are no government schools in their neighbourhood.

A majority of neighbourhoods already have a government school. In other words, the probability of getting children admitted into private schools is almost nil.

The Department of Primary and Secondary Education is planning to amend three clauses under the Karnataka Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2012.

However, experts point out that amending the State rules alone is not adequate as the RTE Act mandates that 25% of the seats in private schools are reserved from children from weaker sections and disadvantaged communities.

The Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, which is supposed to be the monitoring body for all aspects concerning the RTE Act, was reportedly not consulted.

Shruthi R., who is hoping her son gets a seat under the RTE quota in a private school for 2019-2020, said: ""I live in the Kamakshipalya ward and there is a government school in the ward. But I do not want to send my child there. The government is denying our right to free English-medium education.""

Many parent support groups have decided to challenge this move legally. B.N. Yogananda, general secretary of RTE Students and Parents' Association, said that they had written to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights asking of legal possibilities to challenge this move.

""The State government is doing this to appease the private management lobby. This is against the interest of lakhs of parents and children,"" he said.

Nagasimha G. Rao, convener of the RTE task force, said that the State government had taken up a drastic step without consulting different stakeholders.

""The government is saying they will follow the Kerala model, but the quality of education imparted in government schools here cannot be compared to that of Kerala's,"" he said.

For admissions under the RTE quota, a 'neighbourhood' is considered as a revenue village in rural areas, a ward within city corporation limits, and the entire jurisdiction for urban local bodies."

The present RTE rules does not stipulate parents to approach government schools before applying in private schools and students are eligible for the RTE fee reimbursement.

Briefing the reporters, Parliamentary affairs minister Krishna Byre Gowda said, under the proposed change, the child would be eligible for a RTE fee reimbursement from a private school only if there is no government school within the 5 kms radius or if he failed to get a seat in the government school.

The minister justifying the changes has said, we need to improve the student enrolment in government schools as we are neglecting it, added that priority should be given to improve standard of education in government schools."

The RTE Act provides for reservation of 25% of seats for students of weaker sections and disadvantaged communities in private schools. But the State Cabinet on Tuesday decided to amend the rules to add a rider that such children would get admission under the RTE Act in private schools only if there are no government schools in their neighbourhood.

Briefing reporters after the Cabinet meeting, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Krishna Byre Gowda said the preference being given to private schools under the RTE Act had resulted in fewer enrolments in government schools.

Stressing the need for giving importance to government schools, he said the original spirit of the Act was to provide admission in private schools in areas where there were no government schools.

Emulating models of neighbouring states like Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the state government plans to amend the Act allowing parents to enrol children in private schools only if there are no government schools in the vicinity. The Act defines vicinity as a radius of 1km.

Briefing mediapersons after the cabinet meeting, state minister for law Krishna Byregowda said: ""The primary intention of RTE is to provide education to all class of students. For students from BPL families it is free of cost. Till date, Karnataka had allowed parents to admit children in private schools despite having government schools in the same neighbourhood. This has resulted in the enrolment ratio dropping drastically. We have decided to amend the RTE Act allowing parents to admit children in a private school only if there are no government schools in the vicinity.""

States like Kerala and Tamil Nadu already have such a law in place and it is said to have yielded positive results in terms of the number of students enroling in government schools.

The move to reduce admissions in private schools under RTE was first initiated in 2017 when then education minister Tanveer Sait had said the cost of educating children in private schools was a huge burden on the exchequer.

""In the past five years (2013-2017), the Karnataka government has spent over Rs 800 crore to educate children in private schools,"" Sait had said. ""It means we have lost so many students to private schools, who otherwise would have studied in our schools. We want to promote government schools."""

As things stand, as many as 51,849 seats are yet to be filled despite the long-drawn process.

Activists have pointed out that lack of awareness among parents belonging to the disadvantaged category, lack of a competent grievance redressal cell, and an arduous process of obtaining eligibility documents are some of the reasons for not achieving the 100% admission target.

Komalbai, who works as a maid in Pashan has two of her children living in the city. ""I don't know anything about RTE. My elder daughter is in class I and my son in KG. When I tried to admit my son to an aided school, but they refused admission. So I have admitted him in a Zilla Parishad school.""

While lack of awareness is one issue, another problem is that the migrant population may not have required documents. ""We have a voter ID and Aadhaar card but we don't have the income certificate. The agent asked for a lot of money for it. Hence, we just left it at that,"" said Komalbai.

Matin Mujawar of Shikshan Hakka Manch said, ""Awareness is the first step. The government needs to conduct massive awareness programmes about the RTE Act in slums and other areas. The polio drive is a success because of the massive awareness campaign. On similar lines, there should be an awareness drive about RTE Act so that everybody knows what needs to be done so that their children can get admission.""

Grievance redressal is another major problem that is hampering even NGOs and other activists working to help disadvantaged students get admission. The education department had announced a grievance redressal department with a helpline number. However, none of it was implemented.

""Currently, just one person talks to people with grievances. When a parent complains, this person would tell them to go to the school. Why would the school entertain the parents? Even letters from the education officer were hardly of any use because there were no follow ups,"" said Mukund Kirdat, an education activist.

Education commissioner Vishal Solanki said, ""We are working on various aspects of RTE admission. We would improve the present system from next year onward."""

The RTE Act on standards and norms for a school mandates the minimum working for teachers to be 45 hours per week, including preparation time that comes to seven-and-a-half hours per day for a working week of six days.

The DoE on 24 January 2014 had in a circular, increased the working time from 6.45 am to 2.15 pm, for noon session and 11.00 am to 6.30 pm for the afternoon session in double-shift schools (summer timings) and 7.15 am to 2.45 pm for single-shift schools.

Stating that the current working hours of teachers in Delhi government and local authority schools are in violation of the provisions of the Right to Education Act, a petition in the Delhi High Court called for extending it to seven-and-a-half hours.

The petitioner, civil society organisation Justice for All, challenged a May 20, 2014, circular by the Directorate of Education (DoE) laying down the working hours of teachers in government and government-aided schools in Delhi at six-and-a-half hours for single-shift schools and six hours for double-shift schools.

A bench of Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice Kameshwar Rao took cognizance of the matter and sought responses from the respondents -- the civic bodies, the Delhi government's education secretary and the Government Schools Teachers' Association. The next hearing is on January 30.

According to point number four of the schedule, under sections 19 and 25 of the RTE Act on ""norms and standards for a school"", the minimum working for teachers should be 45 hours per week, including preparation time -- seven-and-a-half hours per day for a working week of six days.

On January 24, 2014, the DoE had issued a circular increasing the hours from 7.15 am to 2.45 pm for single-shift schools and 6.45 am to 2.15 pm, and 11.00 am to 6.30 pm for double-shift schools (summer timings). Three days later, a fresh order was issued, keeping the earlier order on hold till the next academic year. It cited representations from teachers stating that infrastructural facilities such as extra staff rooms and furniture needed to be put in place before enforcing the extended working hours.

A fresh order was issued in May 2014, increasing work hours of teachers from six hours to six-and-a-half hours in single-shift schools and from five-and-a-half hours to six hours in double-shift schools. The petitioner stated that the work hours, as laid down by the May 2014 order, ""defeat the aim"" of the RTE Act ""to provide equitable quality education... as well as minimum working hours for teachers""."

The resolution, issued on November 1, has also directed education inspectors to check attendance records of students who were given admission under the 25 per cent quota of the RTE Act before disbursing reimbursements to the schools.

The education official also claimed the provision of not reimbursing schools that are built on government land has always been in place, although its mention has been formalised thanks to the government resolution. Moreover, different directives have been given to the education department after a meeting held in September of higher officials from education and sports departments.

This apart, education officers have also been asked to visit schools to check if audit reports have mentioned the school fees, to hold meetings with parents and ask them about the fees charged by the schools, and to check for schools that were given government land on a lease for minimal charges. Moreover, the schools themselves will also have to mention fees charged for classes I to VIII on the SARAL government portal.

""The rule of not reimbursing schools that got land from the government was always there in the RTE norms.

She was talking to The Hindu on the sidelines of a workshop on inclusive education at the State Council of Educational Research and Training here recently. Ms. Julka said talks had been held with the Ministry of Social Justice on amending the RTE Act, as special schools had been made a legislative option for students under the Rights of Persons With Disabilities (RPWD) Act, 2016. The RPWD Act, she said, promoted inclusive education and gave a child the option of studying in regular or special schools or have home-based education. Inclusion, she said, did not mean in the physical sense alone. It meant that the education system had to accommodate the requirements of a child rather than child having to fit the system.

Therefore, if a neighbourhood school was not ready to accept a child with high-support needs or its teachers were not equipped enough for that or parents felt that their children needed full-day attention or had many learning gaps, then special schools were an option in the initial years before shifting them to regular schools.

Home-based education should be the last resort, and was preferable only for children with profound disabilities, Ms. Julka said.

Inclusion, in an optimal sense, would mean providing all support in school, but it was difficult in the country. So, if at all a child was attending a special school, it should be only till the child caught up, she said. However, even if special schools were to be treated as resource centres for inclusion, it would not work till they were brought under a single umbrella, she said. Taking parents' choice into consideration was also important.

Attitude changes were possible only if everyone worked together. The earlier differently abled children went to regular school, the more they would be be accepted by other students and teachers."

They feel the private ones are more conducive and safer, found a recent study 'Adversarial Parental Perceptions About Government Schools in Ahmedabad'. The study was conducted by Right To Education Resource Centre (RTERC) of Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIMA).

Many parents have a poor impression about the government schools because they've had bad experiences, RTERC researchers said. However, their opinion slightly changed after they visited several government schools.

The study, supported by UNICEF was conducted by professor Ankur Sarin of IIMA and a research associate Nisha Warnekar found flaws with issues such as lack of teachers, non-teaching staff loaded with too much work, principals and administrators lacking authority over teachers, among others. The findings come at a crucial time when around 40,000 seats under the RTE Act remain vacant this year.

""We interviewed several parents belonging to a particular geographical area comprising 34 schools. We wanted to compare their responses. We investigated the extent of information asymmetry amongst the households on the lines of parental perceptions. Our researchers also visited ten schools,"" professor Sarin's team said.

The parents feel that schools should have CCTV cameras, students should have uniforms, identity cards, and regular parent-teacher meets.

The parents suggested that government schools usually were large open spaces where anyone could walk in because the gates are always open. On the contrary, the private schools are ""bandh killas"" or fortresses.

For this reason, parents said, their wards often leave the premises during school hours.

In contrast, the parents whose wards made it to the private ones feel the gates are locked and the students can't leave the premises during school hours.

Many government schools are cleaner and more spacious than the private ones. Some say many have walls that are nicely done or boards displaying letters and numbers in different languages, maps and prayers. The infrastructure in these schools are also better and focus on extracurricular activities.

However, many parents cited the new focus of government schools on extracurricular activity and participation in competitions as being a waste of time.

""Private schools, in contrast, were incredibly cramped with almost 60- 65 students sitting on benches, which is double its capacity. Another private school was located in the middle of a marketplace and reels under tremendous noise. To solve this, the authorities have put up boards on the windows. This has made the classrooms dark and dingy,"" professor Sarin said.

""We found mixed results inside the classrooms. For example, in one government school, a teacher was very strict. But, even many private schools had the same rules. Also, in one of the private schools, we found a teacher spending a lot of time during the class on the phone. The students silently sneaked out without taking any permission,"" Sarin added.

The report found that all five government schools had at least one teacher short. As one school explained, a recent mandate on the qualification of teachers had led to a shortage of subject teachers in secondary classes.

This led to an excess of primary grade teachers and a shortage of secondary-level teachers. The two Urdu medium schools said it was a major problem as very few with higher degrees required to teach in the secondary classes. The report concluded laying a map for the state government which can help parents change their perception. They included highlighting achievements of government schools, ensuring more accountability, etc."

The State govt. is again planning to tweak the criteria for admission under the reservation quota of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, which will prioritise government schools over their private counterparts.

The move has been criticised by parents' groups and education experts, among other stakeholders, who believe that the government is diluting the reservation clause. The Dept. of Primary and Secondary Education is proposing that the changes be applicable in the 2019-20 academic year.

The RTE Act states that 25% of seats be reserved for students of weaker sections and disadvantaged groups in private schools. However, as per the department's plan, a child must be admitted to government or aided schools in the neighbourhood.""Only if government or aided schools are not in the neighbourhood, should the child be allotted seats in a private school,"" said a source privy to the latest proposal.

Experts point out that the proposal will ensure that the reservation quota is scrapped as almost all neighbourhoods have a government school in the vicinity. (For admissions under the RTE quota, a 'neighbourhood' is considered as a revenue village in rural areas, a ward within city corporation limits, and the entire jurisdiction for urban local bodies.)Other sources confirmed that the department was planning to amend three clauses under the Karnataka Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2012.

""This move has been proposed as officials in the department feel that reimbursements to private schools for the RTE quota caused a huge burden to the State exchequer,"" the source added. This academic year alone, the State government is estimated to have reimbursed around ₹500 crore.

This January, a similar proposal was submitted by the department, but was not approved by the former Primary and Secondary Education Minister Tanveer Sait after widespread criticism. The State department's own analysis pointed out the rate of decline in government school enrolments for class one got steeper in the years following implementation of the RTE Act. It had also pointed out that only a small percentage (1.2%) of the overall budget of the Department of Primary and Secondary Education was spent as reimbursement for 2015-2016. Parents are unhappy with this proposal as they enrol their children in private schools in the hope they would become well-versed in English.

Shashikala K., a domestic help whose son studies under the RTE quota in a private school in North Bengaluru, said: ""When we applied for admissions this year, there were more than a dozen private schools that we could apply to. We were very happy as we could get English-medium education free of cost. If the rules are changed, it would mean that English-medium education is no longer accessible to us as every locality has a govt. school."""

Over 4,700 such children in the city have not yet secured a seat, but Friday's lottery made allotments only to 402 of them. This lottery was the final round of admissions for the current academic year.

BMC conducts online admissions for 25% seats reserved under RTE Act, 2009, at unaided non-minority schools in the city. This year, 347 schools were eligible for the process, and on offer were 8,341 seats. However, through three rounds of admissions, only 3,168 out of the 11,343 applicants secured admission. As many as 3,209 did not report for admission despite being allotted a seat.

Over the past few days, several parents came to BMC's education department with requests for another chance at admissions. ""Since there were vacant seats, we decided to hold another round of admissions for those who had not been allotted a seat in the entire process. But those who have rejected a seat will not get another chance,"" said a BMC official.

In this round, out of the 402 allotments, 352 got a seat in state board schools. The rest of the students will, however, now not get a chance. ""Many students have been left out because of demand-supply mismatch. While there are some schools which have applications exceeding their capacity, some schools have no takers,"" said the civic official.

Parents will have until October 20 to confirm admissions at the respective schools. In case schools do not admit students, parents can approach the local education officials for help."

The court said in its order that the state needs to publicise the number of seats available and the number of students who are yet to get admission after the first round is over. It also said that this details be made available school wise.

The court clarified that the option to modify and expand their choice of schools will not be available to students who had already accepted the schools assigned and those who had been offered their choice of schools but had chosen not to take admission in the same.

The court, however, said that no changes will be made to admissions this year as the process is more or less complete. Thus, the option of modifying their choice of schools will not be available to students who are left out under RTE this year.

The court observed that since it is already the end of September, if students get admission they would end up attending classes from the second session, which would affect their education.

It also directed the government to ensure that widest publicity be given to ensure that parents and students are aware about the form filling exercise.

It said that they should be encouraged to indicate as many choices of school as possible while filling up the form.The court observed that the guardians of students who apply under RTE are often themselves handicapped by poverty and illiteracy and the state needs to be sensitive about it.

It also did not entertain the government's view that permitting changes in choice even after first round was not possible since the entire system was online. The court observed that it would not be impossible to implement. ""It will ensure that more students secure admission under RTE. System must realise that we are dealing with a sensitive issue,"" said the court."

The Kailash Satyarthi Children's Foundation, in association with Delhi Legal Services Authority (DLSA) and Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) organised a national conference on Combating Trafficking through Education at Constitution Club of India in Delhi.

Priyank Kanoongo, member, National Commission for Protection of Child Rights pointed that children who do not attend school are often the most susceptible to perpetrators of trafficking. ""They often come from poor families who are unable to afford the academic fee. Education can be a source of empowerment steering their future away from the ugliness of trafficking. Free and compulsory education to girls of 15- 18 years of age is the first step towards achieving this reality, "" Kanoongo said.

The National Crime Records Bureau reported that in 2016 alone, 9,034 children were trafficked, a figure that had risen dramatically by 131 per cent from 3,905 in 2015. Given such alarming data, there is an urgent need of a comprehensive approach to combat the organised crime of trafficking.

Geetanjali Goel, special secretary, Delhi Legal Services Authority said, ""There are gaps which need to be identified. When I was at the Juvenile Justice Board I would see many cases of children who had been trafficked from states like Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh for executing thefts. So it is not just trafficking for prostitution or labour. More research into the causes and purpose behind trafficking needs to be done to find specific solutions."" She emphasised on the need to identify and map children who are school drop outs as they are more vulnerable. ""We are working on the module to educate children in schools in Delhi to prevent offences and protect them,"" Goel added.

Bhuwan Ribhu, lawyer and child rights activist stressed on the need to take ownership of the issue to combat trafficking. ""When a child is trafficked every fundamental right of that child is snatched. Let us pledge to make this a public movement so that every child is free, safe and educated,"" he added."

In a report tabled in the Assembly, the CAG has revealed that 12.80 to 15.11 per cent of children in the age group of 6-14 years were not enrolled in any school in the state during 2012-17. But the state government could only identify between 2.72 to 6.12 per cent of children as ""out of school children"" during the same five years.

These deficiencies, the report said, include failure to provide basic facilities in schools and setting admission targets without taking into consideration the availability of seats as per the RTE quota. ""The state government could not provide basic infrastructure facilities in majority of government schools even after seven years of implementation of the RTE Act,"" the CAG report mentioned. The Government of India and the Gujarat government's share of Rs 3635.57 crore (34 per cent) was short due to under utilisation of funds for implementation of the RTE Act, the report noted.

The CAG also expressed dissatisfaction about the state government's monitoring mechanism to ensure the proper implementation of the Act, also known as the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act of 2009. The CAG noted that the ""monitoring mechanism was weak as Block Resource Centre Coordinators or Cluster Coordinators had not conducted the prescribed number of inspections of schools"".

On RTE Act's clause for establishment of neighbourhood schools and transportation facility, the CAG report stated that the state government mapped schools in 2011-12 and found the requirement of 201 schools to meet the neighbourhood school norm. ""Of these, only 25 schools have been established and made functional as of March 2017. As a result, the number of students identified to be provided transportation facilities due to non-availability of schools in the neighbourhood increased three times from 51,653 in 2012-13 to 1,41,854 students in 2016-17,"" the report stated.

Further, during the audit, it was revealed that several primary and upper primary government schools were functioning without any teacher during 2012-17 as against the minimum requirement, it stated.

On the other hand, in the ""test-checked"" districts, the audit found surplus teachers in 275 primary schools (349 teachers) and 924 upper primary schools (1105 teachers). ""The state government could have utilised these surplus teachers in schools which did not have or which had less number of teachers. Thus, even after a lapse of more than seven years since implementation of the RTE Act the state government failed in ensuring maintenance of pupil- teacher ratio as mandated by the Act,"" the report pointed out.

The report pointed out that the prescribed pupil-teacher ratio in Gujarat was not achieved in 1,156 out of 10,531 primary schools and 3,098 out of 22,234 upper primary schools as on March 2017. As per the pupil-teacher ratio prescribed under the RTE Act, there should be at least two teachers in a primary school and three teachers in upper primary schools.

Further, the audit found that the local authorities had not provided training to 90,789 (27 per cent) of the 3,41,157 out-of-school children during 2012-17. ""Thus the objectives of the Act of increasing the competency level of out of school children for their mainstreaming in appropriate class remained unachieved,"" the report stated.

It also observed that the State Advisory Council met only ""twice"" against 16 meetings to be held during 2013-17.

In its annual compliance report of Gujarat Education Department on implementation of Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2009, the CAG noted that the targets for admission to economically weaker section and disadvantaged groups under the Right to Education Act have been fixed by the Gujarat government without considering the mandated provision of the Act.

""The process of fixation of a target was erroneous. The target fixed was much less than the mandated 25 per cent of the seats reserved as per RTE Act. As per DISE (District Information System for Education) data (2016-17), there are total 4,26,510 seats available for admission in Class I of unaided schools in Gujarat. However, against 1,06,628 seats (25 per cent of total seats) available for admission to children from economically weaker and disadvantaged groups, the target fixed was only 46,000 (43 per cent). This indicates that the targets have been allotted by the state government without considering the mandated provision of the Act,"" the report stated.

Citing the case of Ahmedabad city, the report stated that the District Education Officer received 17,866 applications as against the target of 18,950 seats during 2013-17. Of these only 13,126 children have been given admission.

Of the remaining 4,740 applications, 2,178 applications were rejected for want of supporting documents, while 2562 children did not join the school due to-allotment of admission is a school other than the one chosen, the schools being far away from residence and allotment in other medium than chosen.

Pertaining to reimbursement of fees (Rs 10,000 or actual fee charged by the school whichever is less) to the private schools against these 25 per cent reserved seats, the report pointed out a delay of six to twelve months by the district authorities.

""In test-checked districts (Ahmedabad and Banaskantha), the district authorities had not reimbursed as of June 2017 fees of Rs 91.28 lakh payable to 377 private schools against 2,121 students admitted under RTE Act during 2014-17. Further, seven talukas -- Dhandhuka in Ahmedabad, Anand in Anand district, Radhanpur, Harij, Santalpur, Saraswati and Shankheshwar in Patan district -- have not even calculated the fee to be reimbursed to 59 schools for 770 students admitted during 2014-17,"" the report stated.

The reason cited by the District Primary Education Officers (DPEOs) of these districts for this delay is ""due to late receipt of grant from the Director of Primary Education"".

As per the pupil-teacher ratio prescribed under the RTE Act, there should be at least two teachers in a primary school and three teachers in upper primary schools.

Commenting on the admission targets, the CAG has observed that the education department allotted targets to the district and municipal corporations for admission under 24 per cent RTE quota without considering the total number of seats available for admission in Class 1.

""The targets allotted were observed to be much lower than the actual seats available for admission in the state"" the report said.

The CAG also came across instances of ""denial of admission to eligible children"" during its scrutiny.

During scrutiny, the CAG found that in Surendranagar district alone, 359 eligible children of ""weaker sections and disadvantaged groups"" were denied admission during 2016-17 by the district authorities ""stating that the reserved seats of the schools opted by the applicants had been filled up"".

""Allotment of admission in different medium or school not opted for by the applicants were also noticed"", the central auditor said in its report.

The CAG also took note that 27 per cent identified Out of School Children (OoSC) were not given training for their ""mainstreaming to regular schooling in appropriate class"" during 2012-17.

""The above deficiencies indicated that the key objectives of the RTE Act of universalisation of elementary education could not be fully achieved,"" the CAG observed.

The CAG recommended that the state government should conduct an annual survey to identify children in the age group of 6-14 years and enrol them in schools.

""The state government may ensure that the provisions of the RTE Act regarding admission under 25 per cent quota in all the unaided schools are adhered to in letter and spirit"" the CAG recommended."

Despite receiving record number of applications from candidates across Tamil Nadu, only 70,000 managed to get admissions in private schools under the 25% RTE quota, according to official data.

""This is because the admission guidelines were revised this year. Only those residing within 1km radius of the schools were considered for the admission process,"" a state school education department official told TOI on condition of anonymity.

Until last year, applications from those within 3km or 5km radius were considered during the second or subsequent rounds of admissions.

Explaining the rationale behind this decision, the official said the Centre had not only denied reimbursement claims made for admissions made under the said act in kindergarten sections but also delayed releasing the promised funds.

""Every year, the state had to spend over and above its allocated budget to bridge this funding gap,"" he said.

Corroborating this, minutes of the recent Samagara Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) project approval board meeting suggest that the state had sought Rs 99 crore as total reimbursement towards expenditure incurred for 25 % admission under RTE quota in 2015-16.

But the central government (HRD ministry) has sanctioned only Rs 27.6 crore approximately one-fourth of the proposal, show records.

Commenting on this, V Eswaran from MDMK party, also an RTE activist, said, ""Other states including Maharashtra increase the radius to 3km or 5km if the seats remain vacant. So when there is a provision to do so, the government can't cite shortage of funds as a reason to revise guidelines.""

""Instead, the government can fix the loopholes in admitting students from disadvantaged groups (SC/ST/BC/MBC) to make the scheme more efficient. These students become eligible only by submitting a community certificate. So, even the affluent managed to study for free,"" he told.

According to section 12 (1)(c) of the act, 25 % seats in private schools are reserved for students aged between 8 to 14, belonging to weaker sections (with an annual income of less than Rs 2 lakh) and disadvantaged groups.

Eswaran added if the RTE Act doesn't accept KG admissions, then the state should instruct private schools to readmit them in Class I and submit these applications for reimbursement."

The commission has recommended that the ECI take into account during the discussion on ""one nation one election"" the need to secure the Right to Education of children.

The commission in its representation to the EC also cited a desk analysis of data and complaints to say that during the period of election duties, midday meal is not served in the schools depriving them of the nutrition and their fundamental right to development. Also schools are converted to polling stations resulting in a loss of 10 days in preparations, security and inspection.

The court observed that against the vacant seats 41,000 students who had applied for the admission were yet to be granted one.

The Uttarakhand Commission for Protection of Child Rights (UCPCR) has received over 70 complaints this year against private schools allegedly violating provisions of the Right to Education (RTE) Act.

Usha Negi, chairman of UCPCR, said, ""We have received many complaints against private schools of the state flouting the RTE Act. Many schools are demanding fees from students admitted under RTE. Several students are harassed by the school authorities as well.""

The commission has received complaints against prominent private schools, including Scholars Home, Moravian Institute, Doon World School and Doon Sarla Academy. In the various complaints, all four schools have been accused of demanding money from students enrolled under RTE Act.

While complaint against Scholars Home and Doon Sarla Academy stated that they were demanding a monthly fee ranging from Rs 500-1,000 from students under RTE and not giving a receipt of the same, parents of a student from Doon World School produced a 'Fee Card' issued by the school which recorded the monthly charges taken from the child.

As per a complaint registered by the parents of a student from Moravian Institute, the school had been demanding fees from the Class 5 student. Unable to pay the fees, the parents asked the school for the transfer certificate (TC) of their ward. The complaint said that the school refused to issue the TC until the parents cleared the pending dues. The child had been admitted to the school in Class 1 in May 2014.

A hearing was held between both the parties, following which the commission demanded an affidavit from the school stating their version. ""The school granted the TC without charging the parents,"" said Kamal Gupta, spokesperson of the commission.

The commission has also received complaints where private schools refuse to give admission to students under RTE Act. ""We got some complaints from Haridwar where private schools like Shivam Academy English Medium School refused to give admission to students under RTE Act. There have been reports of children being manhandled by teachers or school authorities in Haridwar,"" Gupta said.

Usha Negi said that while the commission is acting upon the grievances that are raised with them, in many cases, parents are too scared to even file a complaint. ""We have got to know that a prominent private school of Dehradun has given special identity cards to students admitted under RTE Act.

Despite the high court order to clear dues by March 31 this year, the government is yet to pay them. The association is gathering details of students and pending dues from schools to submit before the court.

""We will reach out to the high court for the clearance of pending dues by next week. Running schools has become a liability especially in times when the government has failed to clear the bills. Many schools aren't able to pay salaries to their staff,"" Prem Kashyap, president of the association, said.

Approximately Rs 90 crore is to be paid to over 4,000 private schools in the state under RTE. In Dehradun alone, Rs 50 lakh was distributed in July and August while nearly Rs 7 crore is still pending.

The number of students admitted under RTE in unaided schools rose from 80,000 in 2015-16 to 1.7 lakh in 2016-17. But people close to the matter claim that from the current financial year 2018-19, admissions under RTE were restricted.

Under the RTE Act, Centre gives states 65% of the cost of providing free primary education. For north-eastern states, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Uttarakhand, it is 90%. The state government selects students and allots them private schools, where they are granted free admission. The state government reimburses the schools at a fixed rate.

As per the provisions of the RTE Act, the Centre pays to school a monthly fee not exceeding Rs 1,383 and an annual fee of Rs 2,100 for uniform, meal and textbooks per child. Some schools even charge a nominal fee from such students.

""The central government hasn't paid dues pending before 2015-16 which is a burden on the state exchequer,"" Bhupinder Kaur Aulakh, secretary, school education, said.

As per the data available with the school education department, central government paid Rs 39.80 crore against the total expenditure of Rs 49.55 crore for the academic session 2015-16.

In 2016-17, R 81.89 crore was spent on providing education to children from underprivileged families. The Union government didn't provide funds that year, said officials who did not want to be named.

Citing low prevalence rates where girls have completed secondary education, the report by National Commission for Protection of Child Rights and voluntary organisation Young Lives makes a pitch for making secondary level schooling a fundamental right.

Findings show the completion rate of secondary schooling is considerably higher among unmarried girls aged 15-19 years in almost all states. Even National Human Rights Commission secretary general Ambuj Sharma emphasised the need to extend the right to education from Class VIII to the secondary level.

The NHRC is also planning to recommend to the ministry of women and child development a uniform age for marriage for both men and women. In 140 countries, age of marriage is 18 for both men and women. Last month the law commission in a consultative paper on family laws suggested the legal age for marriage for both men and women across religions should be recognised at 18 years, the universal age for majority.

The study based on NFHS-4 data shows that of the 15 to 19 year old girls, who at the time of the survey reported to have been married before the legal age of marriage, 30.8% had never been to a school and 21.09 % had education up to the primary level. The percentage of girls who had secondary education and were married before 18 was 10.2%.

Those with higher levels of education were further down to 2.4%. While overall prevalence of child marriage declined from 26.5% in 2005-06 to 11.9% in 2015-16. Bihar is a case in point. The state recorded a significant decline in child marriages from 47.8% in 2005-06 to 19.7% in 2015-16.

The study also reveals that amongst the married girls aged 15 to 19 years, 31.5% girls were found to be have babies. Almost a quarter of the married girls in the age group of 15 to 16 years had at least one child."

Even as a Bill to make child marriage void in India is pending before the cabinet, the National Human Rights Commission's (NHRC) core group on child marriage has, in its report to be submitted to the Ministry of Women and Child Development this week, recommended that the Right to Education must be extended to all students up to the age of 18 years so as to prevent child marriage. The NHRC has based its recommendation on research that shows a strong correlation between a girl child's education level and age of marriage, with better education levels showing lesser likelihood of her being married early.

A report released by the apex child rights body National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) on Tuesday shows that being out of school at 15 years is a strong predictor of early marriage. The finding is based on analysis of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 4 data (2015-16) for determining prevalence of child marriage among girls in the 15-19 years age group.

NHRC Secretary General Ambuj Sharma, who released the report on Tuesday, said, ""The NHRC had recently formed a core group on child marriage. In our report, we have noted that a necessary step to prevent early marriage is to make education free and compulsory for all children up to the age of 18 years. Accordingly, the Right to Education Act must be amended so that it is applicable up to class 14 instead of class 8 right now.""

The report, 'India child marriage and teenage pregnancy', compiled by NCPCR and the NGO Young Lives India, shows that in almost all states, the completion rate of secondary schooling is significantly higher among unmarried girls in the 15-19 years age group. The report shows that in the 15-19 age group of married girls, 30 per cent have never received any education, 21.9 per cent have got primary education, 10 per cent have secondary schooling while only 2.4 per cent have higher education.

Among states, in Bihar, which has a child marriage prevalence far above the national average, the completion rate of secondary education among girls who married before 18 years is 51 per cent, followed by Delhi and Rajasthan at 54 per cent and 57 per cent, respectively. ""There is a strong correlation between educational attainment of girls and early child marriage. There is also a strong association between parents' low aspirations for child's education and teenage marriage,"" said Renu Singh from Young Lives. The data also showed that 32 per cent of married girls aged 13 to 19 years had their first child when they were still in their teenage. NCPCR Chairperson Stuti Kacker cited the example of Karnataka, which has made child marriage null and void.

The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006 doesn't invalidate child marriage but only gives the contracting parties the option of annulling it within two years of becoming adult or through a guardian in case they are still minors. The WCD ministry's proposal, seeking to make make child marriage 'void ab initio', is pending approval of the Union cabinet for a while now.

The White House in August announced that Trump would travel to Ireland for the first time as president as part of a trip to attend the Nov. 11 commemoration in Paris of the 100th anniversary of the armistice that ended World War One.

The White House, the Irish Foreign Ministry and the office of Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar all declined immediate comment on reports of the cancellation from Irish state broadcaster RTE and the Irish Independent newspaper.

An correspondent for RTE said it understood that no formal communication had yet been made to the Irish government and that a statement from the U.S. State Department or the White House was expected in the coming hours.

A number of groups announced they would stage protests during the Trump visit, in which the president had been expected to visit the capital Dublin and his golf resort in the west coast village of Doonbeg.

Varadkar, who as a cabinet minister opposed extending an invitation to Trump before changing his mind when he became prime minister, described the trip as coming ""a little bit out of the blue"", but said the office of the U.S. president must be respected."

Can the RTE achieve its stated goal of providing 'free and compulsory education for all'?

How does one describe a hair oil, which is designed to help hair grow, but after actual use causes the remaining hair to fall? Or, how does one describe a potency drug, which is prescribed to cure impotency but which, when used, makes someone permanently impotent?

There is no single word or phrase, at present, in the English language that can accurately describe such a behaviour or effect - wherein, the result yielded is the exact opposite of the one intended. But thanks to RTE (Right to Education Act), which is having a similar effect of destroying education instead of improving it, we might soon be able to describe all such contrarian effects with a simple phrase - ""doing an RTE!"" For instance, it may be fair to say that ""the hair oil did an RTE on its user"" to indicate that the hair oil caused hair fall instead of hair growth or that the ""potency drug did an RTE on the patient"", to indicate that the potency drug increased impotency instead of curing it.

The present write up, seeks to capture the some of the dangerous implications of RTE and thereby justify the usage of the phrase ""doing an RTE!""

The RTE Act was passed by Parliament in 2009 with the 'intended' objective of providing 'free and compulsory education to all' children between the age of six and 14. Let us evaluate how 'successful' RTE has been in achieving exactly the opposite. Let's look at its impact on a few of the critical parameters:

1. Has RTE Succeeded In Providing ""Free Education For All?""

The answer is a big no.

RTE has neither provided nor will it ever be able to provide ""free education for all"" because it is just not designed to do so. In fact, ""free education for all"", seems more like a homily thrown in to silence any likely opposition, than like a statement of serious intent. Look at the table below:

- At the time of enactment of RTE in 2009-10, around 5.73 crore children were studying in private schools but they were all left in the lurch, with RTE having nothing positive to offer them.

- A huge 13 crore plus children were studying in government schools but surprisingly, RTE offers nothing positive for them too.

So, if RTE totally ignores all the 19 crore (approximately) school-going children, who on earth does it seek to benefit?

- RTE seeks to benefit only a tiny fraction of these 19 crore students, based not on any 'economic' criteria, as is made out to be, but on the criteria of sheer luck (lottery conducted to give RTE admissions) or rampant corruption (rigging of RTE lottery).

- This tiny fraction of students, who are said to be benefitting from RTE is as tiny as 0.31 per cent or just 6.71 lakh students (for the year 2013-14). Sadly, even this number is found to be highly over estimated in several studies.

Another critical question to be asked is - what if most of the beneficiaries, who are now said to be getting the benefit of free education under RTE, would already have been getting the same benefit in government schools under the non-RTE regime?

2. Has RTE Improved The Condition Of The Nearly 12 Crore Students Studying In Government Schools?

The answer again is a resounding no.

- RTE gives the government a great excuse to not do anything significant for the government schools and dangle the carrot of RTE to anyone who complains.

- The government schools will never ever improve and will only continue to further deteriorate as the entire game plan of RTE, seems to be, to systematically destroy the government schools by sequentially pushing more and more students from government schools to private schools.

- Telangana Chief Minister Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao has in fact cited the same reason, on the floor of the state assembly, for not implementing RTE in the state. He termed RTE as a ""durmargamaina chattam"" (a draconian act).

3. If The Government Wants To Shift More And More Children To Private Schools, Has It Enabled A Rapid Expansion Of Private Education Capacity?

The answer, yet again, is no.

Look at the table below, clearly showing the decreasing trend in the number of schools:

- There is hardly any addition to the number of schools in the country. The number of schools, in fact, decreased in 2014 and 15 and increased by only 0.1 per cent in 2015 and 16

- While the number of government schools, as expected, continued to decrease, the rate of growth in private schools also registered a rapid decline from highs of 13.1 per cent in 2011 and 12 to just around 1.2 per cent in 2015 and 16.

Let's look at it realistically - who in the right frame of his/her mind, would want to open a shop (read school) where 25 per cent of the goods (25 per cent seats reserved under RTE) have to be sold at a huge loss - that too in a market where this rule applies only to his/her shop (Hindu-run schools) and not to the shops of others (minority schools)?

4. Has RTE Succeeded In Educating More Children By Bringing More Of Them To Schools?

The answer, once again, is no.

This is the stark reality of RTE - it seems to have 'successfully' managed to reduce the number of school-going children. Look at the trend of enrollment in Classes I to V.

- The number of students in Classes I to V reduced from 13.52 crore in year 2010-11 to 12.91 crore in year 2015-16.

- The number of students in government schools reduced rapidly from 9.41 crore in 2010-11 to 7.81 crore in 2015-16.

- The rate of growth in enrollment in private schools also declined from a high of 9.5 per cent in 2011-12 to just around 1.2 per cent in 2015-16.

The population of India, for sure, has not declined. What then could have led to the reduction in the number of school-going children?

5. Has The Condition Of More Than 7 Crore Children Studying In Private Schools, Improved?

The simple answer is that - it has never been worse!

Ironically, while these 7 crore plus students are totally excluded from benefits of RTE, they are covertly included while sharing the costs of RTE.

- People have been falsely led to believe, by the government and by most prominent RTE activists, that the government reimburses, to the schools, the full amount of fees for the 25 per cent seats allotted under RTE.

- The fact is that the government reimburses only a fraction of this fees and not the full fee charged by the schools. Look at the amounts reimbursed in some states and compare them with the fees charged by private schools in these states:

- The amount of reimbursement varies from a low of Rs 5,400 in UP to a high of Rs 18,311 in Uttarakhand. Sadly, even these amounts are rarely paid on time and some never paid at all.

- Who is to foot the bill for the difference between the amount paid by the government and the actual fee charged by the schools? Who, for instance, is to pay the deficit of Rs 90,000 per RTE seat in a school, that may be charging 1 lakh as its fees but would be getting only Rs 10,000 per seat as the reimbursement?

- This deficit, unfortunately, is being paid by common folks - the worthless ""unreserved"" category - making their children study in private schools.

Hope that the deceit, sham and irony of it all sinks into the peoples' minds - that the government, vide RTE, has fixed, for itself, an MRP (maximum retail price) on school fees when it 'buys' education from the private schools but refuses to similarly fix any MRP for private citizens when they buy the same education from the same set of schools.

It is, perhaps, the only one-of-its-kind case in the entire world where - the citizens subsidise the government instead of the government subsidising the citizens! (Read this article for a more detailed discussion)

6. Has RTE Succeeded, At The Very Least, In Improving The Overall Quality Of Education?

The answer to this too, unfortunately, is no.

Look at the trend of learning outcomes given in the ASER - Annual Survey of Education Report 2016:

- The number of students in Class V who can read a Class 2 level text was already at an abysmal 50.7 per cent in 2010. However, with RTE, instead of improving, it fell further down to 41.6 per cent in 2016.

- Similarly, the number of students in Class VIII who could read a Class II level text fell from 83.5 per cent in 2010 to 73.1 per cent in 2016.

Look at the data on the level of math that the students can do:

Just like in basic reading, a drastic drop can also be seen in the number of students who can do basic division - all thanks to this great panacea for all education ills of India - RTE!

Thus, the summary of this remarkable legislation called RTE, is that:

1. It will never ever succeed in achieving its stated goal of providing 'free and compulsory education for all' because it is just not designed to do so.

2. It completely neglects the nearly 10 crore students studying in government schools and provides the government a great excuse to not do anything much for them.

3. It seeks to push the government school students to private schools but does nothing to increase the private school capacity. On the contrary, RTE does everything to constrict the growth of private schools - leading to a reduction not only in the number of schools but also in the number of school-going students.

4. It seeks to give the benefit of 'free education' to around five to 10 lakh students (most of whom might already have been getting free education in government schools) by making nearly 19 crore other students suffer.

5. Even these five to 10 lakh students don't really benefit because of the drastic drop in the quality of learning and education of all students.

6. It has, additionally, made education so unaffordable for more than 8 crore students studying in private schools that the school fee has now become a top means of birth control and is even leading to suicides of parents and students. (Read for more details)

With 'achievements' as great as the ones listed above, what other than destroying India and its education, can we say, is the objective of RTE?

One can only hope and pray that all the learned souls of India - in the media, in the think-tanks and in the government - see through this charade of RTE and immediately stop RTE from ""doing an RTE"" on India."

The petitioner has asked the court to order a third round of the admission process and allow applicants to modify their choice of schools in such a way that children should be able to add and delete the schools as well as set priority with the knowledge about vacant seats in particular school. The petitioner further suggested that enough attempts should be made to fill up all vacant seats under the RTE Act.

The petition said: ""After nearly two-and-a-half months of delay, the second round of admission was done without any application of mind.

Speaking to dna, he said: ""Minimum 40,000 students are waiting for admission, how can the state only allot seats to 4,642 students.

With nearly 40,000 seats remaining vacant after three rounds, the government claims that only 11,000 students are yet to get admitted.

Giving 'preferred schools not available' as the reason for the discrepancy in numbers, state government officials said, ""Even if there are vacancies, parents want only 'certain schools', which is why 11,000 children are yet to get admitted. If need be, we will be conducting another round of admissions to accommodate them,"" said an official from the Education Department.

The state government this year had surprised everyone when they nearly doubled the total number of seats under RTE to 1,12,000. In the first round, nearly 80,000 students were allotted seats out of which 71,000 took admission. The second round was delayed for a few months and was held after getting a nod from Gujarat High Court; 4,642 students were allotted seats. However, of the 4,642, only 2,091 confirmed their admissions. Another 1,810 children were allotted seats after the third round.

When DNA asked state Education Minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama about the same, he said, ""If there are seats vacant as per 25% reservation and there are eligible students, only then we will conduct the fourth round.

Speaking about the academic loss, Manan Choksi, Executive director, Udgam School for Children and President, Association of Progressive Schools, said, ""As per RTE Act, a student needs to attend 200 days of schooling. However, in the present scenario, half of the year has gone. Especially for CBSE schools, where the new session starts in April, RTE children getting admitted in September may face lot of difficulties in coping up. During the pendency of the cases, provisional admission of these children should have been allowed so that their education would not have suffered."""

The Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka said the money should be used by the government for rehabilitation of victims, rebuilding of houses and schools in affected areas.

Shalini Rajneesh, principal secretary, education department, has forwarded a proposal to the chief secretary, seeking approval to open a joint account of the education department and private unaided schools, where schools can deposit the money they raise.

""There are a lot of organizations who have been collecting relief materials and sending them to affected areas. But we don't know if they are reaching the needy.

Education department officials expect an order to be issued with regard to the joint account and disaster management fund by Friday.

Private unaided schools get about Rs 6,000 to 18,000 per child as RTE annual reimbursement.

According to school heads, a separate fund will help them draw up a clear plan, ensure effective implementation and prevent misuse.

Higher education minister GT Devegowda on Tuesday said he'll donate his one month salary for the CM's Disaster Relief Fund to help rebuild Kodagu.

KR Venugopal, vice-chancellor of Bangalore University, has donated a month's salary, about Rs 2 lakh. ""I request all vice-chancellors and college principals in the state to contribute towards the relief fund. Bengalureans get water from Talacauvery and they must all contribute for the district which is now affected,"" he said.

The Karnataka Government College Teachers' Association has contributed Rs 10 crore, Bengaluru Central University Teachers' Association Rs 25 lakh while engineering colleges have pooled in Rs 2 crore.

The Federation of University and College Teachers' Association in Karnataka has requested the government to deduct a day's salary. NCC units of Tumakuru University have raised Rs 2.43 lakh from science and arts colleges, postgraduate students of Red Cross Units of all colleges and students of affiliate colleges.

However, last week, the state government allotted seats to only 4642 students in second round despite over 35000 vacant seats in schools.

The state government this year had almost doubled up the total number of seats for RTE children in the state and had assured smooth admission process. For a total of 112000 seats, the state government had approved 125000 applications. However in the first round, only 80000 seats were allotted out of which nearly 72000 confirmed their admission.

For the remaining 48,838 children from the economically and socially disadvantaged groups, who have been waiting for four months to start school, the wait only gets longer, even as there is a week's window period for the second round of online admissions to conclude. This comes as most of the non-Gujarat board affiliated schools are wrapping up their first semesters.

In the beginning of this academic session, the state Education Department had announced that 1.20 lakh seats in 9,744 private schools across the state have been set aside for admission of students from economically weaker sections under RTE Act's 25 per cent reservation rule. Of the 1.87 lakh applicants, the government after scrutiny approved 1.25 lakh. The first list of 80,199 students was released on April 19. After the admission of the first list closed on May 30, it was found that 71,520 students had taken admissions.

Now after a gap of four months, the government has released the second list of only 4,642 students. This despite the fact that 48,480 seats are still vacant in private schools across the state. ""The reason for this huge number of seats still lying vacant is that these schools do not fit under the RTE rule of a maximum distance of 6 km. All these seats are either in schools that are beyond 6 km (from the place of residence of the child seeking admissions) or there is no school within 6 km-radius of the applicant,"" Director (Primary Education) M I Joshi, who is heading the RTE admissions, said.

The reason cited for the delay in announcing the second list was the ongoing hearing of a PIL filed in the Gujarat High Court for admission under RTE Act in the minority schools. ""Since the minority schools were denying admission to students under the RTE Act and with the PIL we could not go ahead with admissions till the time there was a decision on these seats allotted to these minority schools,"" Joshi added.

Nearly 600 students were denied admissions by 100 schools that claimed to be 'minority institutions', but did not have a valid certificate from the state government. Granting interim relief to the minority schools till August 13, the High Court on July 30 passed an order, stating that schools lacking minority certificate from competent authority could not deny admission to students under the RTE Act, thus clearing the deck for the Education Department to announce the second round of admissions.

According to the Education Department, they waited till August 13 before announcing the second list. ""As no representation from these minority schools was received by the Department till August 13, we went ahead and announced the second round,"" Joshi said. However, sources said that the minority schools have challenged the High Court ruling in the Supreme Court and had given a letter to the Education Department informing about it on Tuesday.

This year, the Education Department did not accept objections from applicants who claimed to be aggrieved by either incorrect school allotment or by an inadvertent error committed by them at the time of filing online applications. ""We did not allow objections this time as it was a foolproof transparent online admission process. Only a few did not get schools of their choice,"" Joshi said.

This year, in a major decision, the state government raised the income bar for both rural and urban residents under the RTE Act by more than 100 per cent -- from the previous annual family income limit of Rs 47,000 for rural areas it was increased to Rs 1.2 lakh, a hike of more than 2.5 times. Similarly, the limit for urban areas was increased by more than double -- from existing Rs 68,000 to Rs 1.5 lakh per annum.

There had been already two previous revisions pertaining to RTE admissions. As per the rule modified by the Education Department and notified on March 4 last year, if seats remained vacant in private schools after admitting students under the 25 per cent quota seats, children belonging to general category with a family income below Rs 68,000 in urban areas and Rs 47,000 in rural areas will be eligible for admissions in these vacant seats.

Mahesh Palkar, education officer of the BMC education department, told this newspaper, ""We are waiting for 10 days to get over to decide whether to go for another round.

Speaking to Express, All India Muslim Personal Law Board secretary Khalid Saifullah Rahmani said, ""It is an attack on the sovereignty of madrasas. If it is brought under RTE, the government will interfere in their working. Madrasas are protected under Articles 29 and 30 of the Constitution.

On Thursday, the advisory committee cited lack of diversity in subjects taught at madrasas and advocated applicability of the Act to those religious schools. ""The irony is that while missionary schools follow fundamental syllabi like normal schools and have become elitist, madrasas are just imparting religious education,"" a member said.

It is not just minority organisations but madrasa managements also fear that the right of children to free and compulsory education under the Act will end their autonomy.

In a conversation with Express, Mufti Mohammed Hassan Uddin, director of Jamiat ul Mominat madrasa in the city, said, ""We follow the state government's syllabus and also teach subjects like science and mathematics."" However, Jameela Nishat, chief functionary of Shaheen's Women Resource and Welfare Organisation, held a different view, saying, ""Madrasas should be brought under the RTE Act. Most madrasas in the country teach only Islamic studies.

The study there is actually memorising. What happens in the end is that the students, who mainly come from marginalised families, don't learn anything which could help them get jobs."" An official of the state Minority Welfare Board said on condition of anonymity, ""Anything that benefits stake-holders, in this case chidlren, should be supported."""

For RTE's online lottery software, the biggest problems that came to fore were connected with distance mapping. NGO RTE Action Committee has filed a complaint with the education department and is even mulling legal action.

Shahid Sharif, the NGO's founder, said, ""The distance mapping is done through Google maps with the applicant placing the marker balloon at their residence, after which the software calculates the distance to school.

Six months after the management of Old Sangvi's National English School told the education department that they had decided to shut down the school due to non-payment of Right to Education (RTE) dues, parents and activists said the management continues to operate on the premises but has not continued RTE quota admissions. Parents and activists have accused the education department of turning a blind eye to the situation.

Activists wrote to Primary Education Director Dinkar Temkar, demanding an inquiry against the school management and also action against local education officer Jyotsna Shinde. In February 2018, parents of RTE quota students had complained to the education department that their children were allegedly not allowed to use the playground or participate in school events. School chairman Dominic Lobo had denied all allegations and had told the primary education department that he was shutting down the school from the next academic year.

But according to parents, Lobo continued to accept fees from students for the next academic year. Parents had complained to the education department, and the Pimpri-Chinchwad education officer was directed to inquire into the matter.

Mukund Kirdat, an AAP activist, said the school is now under a new management, which has kept all the old students except RTE quota ones. ""Without physically inspecting the school, the officer has written that it has shut down and that the RTE students should be placed in other schools. The parents submitted both photo and video proof that the school was running for all old students, except RTE students. Later, we saw boards stating that Priyadarshini Group of Schools had taken over the school, but government officials said they have no record about this. So basically, the old management has handed over the school to a new management and kept all paying students and removed RTE students. How is this legal?"" asked Kirdat.

One of the parents said they have written to the education department demanding to know the current legal status of the school being run on the premises. ""Assuming that the school is shut down, the education department gave our children alternate schools. The school allotted to my child was a semi-government school, where not more than 10 students were studying in Class IV because teaching was not up to the mark. If I wanted to put my child in such a school, why would I take admission in RTE quota? Many of us have taken loans and got our children admitted to private schools. But if the old school is still running, we demand action against them,"" said the parent on condition of anonymity.

Neither Lobo nor Shinde responded to calls or messages. But Jitendra Singh, CEO, Priyadarshini Schools, which has put up a board outside the National School saying it has taken over, said his group had not yet taken over the school.

According to Singh, Lobo approached them in June to take over the school but by then, many students had taken admission elsewhere. ""We ... have not formally taken over the school as the paperwork given by Lobo is not complete. Currently, only one of my administration officials is posted at the school. Until now, it is Lobo who has taken fees from students for this year. The old staff is still teaching there and they are being paid by him,"" he said.

Asked why only fee-paying students were continued and not RTE quota ones, and also if the education department was informed of the takeover, Singh said, ""We have not denied any such parents, maybe they took admissions elsewhere. We are not aware of who the RTE students are ... we agreed to run the school on humanitarian grounds so that students do not have to suffer. But since the paperwork is not done until now, the school is not being run by Priyadarshini Schools. Also, we have not written to the education department since nothing is formalised."""

Justice Sidhharth Mridul directed the Centre to inform the court about the amount it has paid for this year after the Delhi government claimed it has received only Rs 160 crore from the overall corpus of Rs 2,100 crore earmarked by the Centre for improving Delhi government schools.

Appearing for AAP government, standing counsel Ramesh Singh told the court that education directorate is facing problems in providing quality education and proper infrastructure partly because of lack of funds from the Centre even though these funds were approved for release.

The court is hearing a batch of petitions filed by children from various government-run schools complaining about the absence of infrastructure and violation of the Right to Education Act.

Appearing for the students, advocate Khagesh Jha highlighted a CAG report that had found last year that the central government disburses the amount almost at the end of the financial year and then utilisation is delayed by the Delhi government, and as a result, fund for education of the children lapses every year.

Jha also cited an RTI reply that said Centre has only dispatched roughly Rs 160 crore which is even less than 10% of their obligation and for this year the central government's obligation was Rs 2,100 crore, which is statutory requirement for the education of children and implementation of the provisions of Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009.

Students told HC in their plea that some of them are studying in schools that run in two shifts as the building is not able to accommodate children of the locality in one shift due to lack of facilities.

The petitioner students added that parents of most students are uneducated and even illiterate and when they had approached the Delhi government, they had been assured that the government is going to construct 1,200 classrooms and 30 new schools in the current financial year, ""but the process is slow due to non-disbursement of funds by the Centre."""

Incidentally, none of the primary schools, out of over 400 claiming to be of minority status, has got the NOC for exemption under RTE according to the provisions of the National Commission for Minority Education Institution (NCMEI) Act. However, the HC earlier had granted a stay in cases of some of these schools, and the stay will continue till August 13 allowing them time to approach the Supreme Court.

There are 39,914 seats available for RTE admissions in the second round and the state government was not moving ahead with admissions due to the logjam over legalities as over 400 schools claiming minority status refused to grant admission under RTE norms.

A bench of Justice M R Shah and Justice A Y Kogje made it clear that no school can claim minority status without an NOC from a competent authority either of the state or the Centre under the NCMEI Act. The judges upheld arguments by petitioner Sandip Munjyasara that a school does not attain minority status merely by having members of minority communities in trusts of the institutions. With these observations, the judges ordered all schools not having minority status to admit kids under RTE.

The HC ordered for the second round admission on a plea by another petitioner Chandravadan Dhruv.

This issue first reached the high court in May when the education department threatened action against schools run by religious minorities for not admitting poor kids under RTE. These schools had then approached the HC, which had stayed authorities from taking action.

The court also asked the state to ensure that students, who were left out of admission under RTE, are considered. This could pave the way for second round of admission under RTE.

The court's order came in connection with several petitions related to RTE. One involved minority schools moving the court on the grounds that their minority status exempted them from RTE while another petition had sought direction to the state government to begin second round of admission under RTE as over 40,000 students were yet to get admission.

The court, in its order, said article 30 allowed for religious minorities and linguistic minorities to establish minority institution of choice. ""As per an SC ruling they are exempted from RTE but such institutions need to get NOC from the competent authorities. They cannot automatically claim minority status,"" the court observed.

It said that the DEO's order directing the minority schools to admit students under RTE was not illegal and arbitrary.

It also directed the state to ensure that the students who were yet to be admitted under RTE were given admission as per their choice of schools but subject to the 25% limit for each school. The court also asked the government to consider those RTE applications that were rejected on technical grounds.

Meanwhile, some of the schools sought continuation of the interim order -- which prevented the state from carrying out penal action against schools that had refused admission to students under RTE -- so that they can appeal the matter in the Supreme Court. The high court granted them time of a fortnight.

The state had opposed the move on the grounds that over 1,000 children, who were given admission to minority schools, were still waiting to be admitted and they had already lost two precious months and granting a stay would only further the waiting period."

The Gujarat High Court on Monday held that primary schools that run by minority trusts but don't have certificate for being minority schools will have to admit students under the Right To Education Act (RTE). The court while disposing off a public interest litigation (PIL) and a set of special civil applications held that minority schools are however exempted from the 2009 Act, under which private schools have to keep 25 per cent of seats for children from ""disadvantaged and weaker sections"".

The Division Bench of Justice M R Shah and Justice A Y Kogje pronounced the judgment on a set of petitions moved by over 170 schools, run by minority trusts, including Mar Gregorious Othodox Syrian Church, Vadodara; Ayyappa Education Centre, Vadodara; Rajkot Kelavani Samaj, among others.

During the hearing, the state government had submitted that petitioner schools don't have certificates of minority primary schools. The state's contention was that trusts of these schools have acquired minority status for secondary and higher secondary schools, but not for primary schools. It said that the competent authority never granted minority status to the primary schools.

The state submitted that only those schools are exempted from the RTE Act that have minority school certificates. In its affidavits, the state said that communication issued from the Director of Primary Education specifically stated that ""any school which is claiming to have status of minority is required to produce a valid certificate of status of minority qua primary section issued by the office of Director of Primary Education...under the provisions of The National Commission for Minority Educational Institution"".

The schools have decided to challenge the High Court order in Supreme Court.

The High Court, meanwhile, extended the interim relief granted to these schools in the form not taking any coercive action against them till August 13."

This year, the percentage of vacant seats under the RTE quota in both aided and unaided schools has increased compared to the previous year.

Seats up

Officials attribute this to an increase in the number of seats, and the fact that very few parents choose to admit their children under RTE quota in aided schools as the medium of instruction in primary classes is in Kannada.

This year, 21.32% of the total 1.52 lakh seats are vacant, a marked increase from the 2017-18 academic year where only 15.2% of the total 1.28 lakh seats were vacant.

The number of vacant seats has increased from 19,647 last year to 32,440 this year. Statistics provided by the department show that 73% of the total 14,281 seats under the RTE quota in aided schools were vacant, while for unaided schools 15% of the 1.37 lakh seats were not filled.

Earlier only unaided schools had to reserve at least 25% of their seats to students belonging to weaker and disadvantaged sections in the neighbourhood. According Section 12 (1) (b) of the RTE Act, aided schools have to provide free and compulsory elementary education to the children admitted based on the annual recurring aid or grants, subject to a minimum of 25%.

""All parents want their children to study in English medium. So even if they do not have to pay for education in an aided school, they prefer to pay by taking a loan and admit their child in an unaided school that imparts English-medium education,"" an official said.

Sources in the department also pointed out that although 1.43 lakh seats were allotted in three rounds under the RTE quota, there were no takers for 24,599 seats that were allotted.

Parents more aware

Nagasimha G. Rao, convener of the RTE task force, said the awareness among parents had increased prompting them to avoid admitting their children in schools that do not have adequate infrastructure or good teachers.

""As a result, although they have been allotted seats, they do not admit their children in these schools,"" he said."

Advocate Yogesh Tandava, who filed a PIL in the Hyderabad high court over the non-implementation of RTE in the two Telugu states, said that enforcing RTE would make the state better as it would promote communal harmony and social integration.

""This is not just about admitting economically backward children into private schools. By doing so, people from different classes will get to study in the same place thereby promoting brotherhood and inclusiveness among them. Not implementing it is not just affecting poor people, but also students from middle and rich classes who are being deprived of the opportunity of studying in an inclusive environment,"" said Tandava, adding that there is no question of private schools running into losses because of RTE as education is meant to be a non-profitable profession.

Pointing out how just about 10% of schools in the state, who collects lakhs of rupees in fees, are against RTE, the participants said it is time the government makes private schools redundant.

According to the civic education department, only 45 per cent students have confirmed their seats till now. There is no word yet on when the admission process under the RTE quota will be complete even as civic officials say the process is lagging behind as there are not enough students seeking the allotted seats.

A senior official of the department said, ""Even after the second lottery round, very few students showed interest in securing admissions. We will not be able to proceed till the minimum required seats are filled.""

As per the schedule, parents had time till June 30 to complete the admission process but out of the 2,382 allotted seats, only 737 have been confirmed.

A bench of Justice M R Shah and Justice A Y Kogje questioned so during the hearing of various petitions as well as two PILs on provisions of admission under the Right to Education (RTE) Act in primary schools being run by the minority education institutions. The question arose when one of the petitioners, Sandip Munjyasara, submitted that none of the schools, claiming to be run by minority institutions, have the certificate showing their minority status, which is required to be obtained from either the director of primary education or the National Commission for Minority Education Institutions (NCMEI). There is a provision under the NCMEI Act that the minority run education institute must obtain certificate of its status.

Earlier, a single-judge bench has stayed the state government to take any action against nearly 400 schools for denying RTE admissions on their claims to be minority institutions. This has left nearly 8,000 poor children stranded in the first round of RTE admissions when minority institutes refused them admissions. This dispute has practically delayed the second round of RTE admission, where there are 45,000 applicants against 39,914 seats available, according to the state government.

In reply, the advocates representing schools submitted that the trusts running the schools were formed by people from minority communities. They are not required to obtain any certificate in this regard.

The state government submitted that after it contemplated action against these schools for denying RTE admissions, some of these schools have filed applications for the certification.

Petitioner Munjyasara also submitted that if the schools can prove their minority status, it is not his demand that poor students should be granted admission in these schools. But, their status is required to be verified and it is possible by scrutiny of trust deeds.

Earlier, the petitioner had spoken against such schools and said that under the National Commission for Minorities Institution Act, the state and central government were to nominate a competent authority. Such an authority was to give a no objection certificate to the minority institution for it to be declared one. The petitioner argued that in the present case the institutions were 'self declaring' themselves as minority without following the due process of law.

The court, after hearing arguments from both the sides, asked the institutions if the certificates were not required, why would such a rule be in place? Further hearing on the case is scheduled for Tuesday.

The Lok Sabha on Saturday, passed an amendment to the Right to Education Act, revoking the no-detention policy. It is likely that given the support across parties, it will pass through the Rajya Sabha too. Even so, it is necessary to continue this conversation and inform both the public and policy-makers about the potential damage of this reversal.

Section 16 of the RTE Act that earlier prohibited from holding back a child in any class cannot be read in isolation, and no detention did not ever mean no assessment. Section 16 should have been read in conjunction with Section 29 that talks about Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation and ""making the child free of fear, trauma and anxiety"".

The revised Section 16 has the provision for having examinations in classes 5 and 8, and sub-section 3 also allows ""schools to hold back a child... if he fails in the re-examination"". Going by ASER data, roughly half of the children in classes 5 and 8 are a few classes lower in terms of learning outcomes than the class they study in, and hence, would fail their exams. Re-examination is an important element of the amendment. The additional instruction will have some associated costs too - it may require additional training, special curricula, and if regular teachers are not available during the two-month window, some honorarium for part-time or volunteer teachers may need to disbursed. Additional remedial interventions like these can cost Rs 800 - 1,000 per child, but even the most cost-efficient program will have an average cost of Rs 2501. Assuming 30 per cent of children in classes 5 and 8 fail their first attempt and have to undergo the additional instruction. This would translate to 61 lakh children in rural government schools, and the cost of providing such programs would be Rs 150 crore.

Now, this does not seem much given the scale of the public education system in India. But while some children may pass this re-examination and some may drop-out, others will repeat the same class. Let us say 25 per cent of the 61 lakh children have to repeat a year. Assuming an average expenditure of Rs 12,700 per child, this would mean an additional financial burden of over Rs 1,900 crore. To put this in perspective, this equates to 8 per cent of the Rs 26,129 crore Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) budget for 2018-19.

The question is wouldn't it be better to invest in Early Childhood Development (more Anganwadis, better training) to ensure that children have the right start before class 1?"

He said the evaluation was meant to address the deficiencies of no detention policy. ""But the state government did not bother to implement continuous and comprehensive evaluation,"" said Patel.

With the Lok Sabha passing the amendment to the Right to Education Act (2009), the Delhi government has decided to do away with the ""No Detention Policy"". With the amendment, states can scrap the policy wherein children, from classes III to VIII, were not detained even if they failed the examination.

""It is yet to be passed in the Rajya Sabha, so we are waiting for it. Once it is passed, we will be working to bring back detention,"" said Atishi Marlena, former advisor to Education Minister Manish Sisodia.

From the very beginning, when the proposal for the amendment was moved by the Ministry of Human Resource and Development (MHRD), Sisodia has voiced support to scrap the policy.

The government justified the stand, stating that no detention policy leads to children being promoted without learning, and that scrapping the policy would lead to improved learning levels.

According to a source, the government will work to bring back detention from the next academic session, and consult parents and teachers on the same.

Sisodia has also been in favour of scrapping the policy as he received complaints from teachers about its negative impact on learning, said the source.

""It's a good thing that the amendment to the RTE Act has been passed. As children could not be detained, parents and children did not take the process seriously, thinking they will be promoted anyway. Now, the process is going to get better,"" said Sapna Singh, a government school teacher.

However, experts argued against the removal of the policy, claiming that it would lead to an increase in the number of dropouts.

""It is the poor quality of education, lack of infrastructure, teacher vacancies and the presence of untrained teachers that may have an effect on learning outcomes. The no detention clause, one of the most critical parts of the RTE Act that has been pulled out, has put the entire RTE Act at risk of disintegration. The greatest negative impact will be on disadvantaged groups, first generation learners and Adivasi students, as well as girls,"" said Ambarish Rai, national convenor, Right to Education Forum."

Replying to the debate in the Lok Sabha on The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (second amendment) Bill, 2017, Union Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar said that it will be at the discretion of the states whether to continue with no detention or not.

The states, he said, will decide at what level and who will conduct the examination, the minister said.

""It is a broken education system. We have to rebuild our education system,"" he added.

Under the current provisions of the RTE Act, no student can be detained till Class VIII and all students are promoted to the next grade.

The minister said that in some of the states like Sikkim , Kerala and Telangana, the students, who were studying in private schools, have come back to government schools.

""Teacher training, quality and accountability are most important,"" Javadekar said.

Stating that there was no shortages of teachers, the minister, however, added that the deployment of teachers was not right.

While moving the bill in the Lok Sabha, the minister said, ""It is a very important legislation and a majority of state governments supported this Centre's proposal. It brings accountability in our elementary education system.""

Referring to the no-detention policy in the Act, the minister said ""schools have become only schools for mid-day meal as education and learning are missing"".

This bill has also been analysed by the standing committee and the panel also recommended bringing back the concept of detention in schools, the minister added.

The policy had been brought as it was felt that compelling children to repeat a class was demotivating, often forcing them to abandon school, he said.

This bill provides for a regular examination in Classes V and VIII and if the child fails, he or she shall be given additional opportunity for re-examination in two months' time, Javadekar said.

Speaking on the bill, Congress MP KC Venugopal said that the proposed legislation lacks ""clarity"".

""This bill needs clarity. It should be clarified that whether the Centre or the states will conduct the exams,"" Venugopal said.

He also demanded a hike in the allocation for Centre's flagship programme Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan.

Echoing similar sentiments, BJD MP Bhartruhari Mahtab said the government should form uniform guidelines for conducting exams and leave it to the state on how the exams should be conducted.

Arvind Sawant of Shiv Sena and Saugat Roy of the TMC also lent support to the bill.

Sawant asked the government to focus on primary education.

Roy praised Javadekar for his ""non-confrontationist"" approach as he supported the bill.

Children often do not study if there are no exams, he said, adding that education system is currently in a bad shape and learning outcomes were going down due to non-detention policy.

""The education system is like an inverted pyramid and adequate focus has not been given to primary education,"" he said.

Supriya Sule of NCP also supported the bill and said introduction of exams was necessary.

Prem Singh Chandumajra of Akali Dal and Sanjay Jaiswal of BJP also spoke in support of the Bill.

Several members demanded that teachers should also be made accountable for learning outcomes.

The amendment allows states to hold a regular examination at the end of Classes 5 and 8. According to the amendment bill, a child who fails in the examination held after Classes 5 and 8 will be given additional instruction and the opportunity to appear for a re-examination.

This examination must be held within a period of two months from the date of the declaration of the result. If the child still does not pass the exam, the state government may decide to detain them. However, no child can be expelled from school before they complete elementary education, the amendment bill states.

The proposed amendment was introduced in August last year and referred to a Standing Committee of the Rajya Sabha. The committee submitted its report to both the Houses of Parliament in February, endorsing the amendment bill ""in its present form"".

The no-detention policy of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, banned the practice of making under-performing children repeat classes in elementary school - Classes 1 to 8 - to ensure they do not drop out of school. It was meant to reduce the emphasis on year-end examinations and replace it with a form of evaluation that would track students' progress through the year.

However, the present government feels that the lack of ""pass-fail"" system has led to deterioration in quality of learning in schools as evident in the poor results of the National Assessment Survey carried out by the Union Human Resources Development Ministry and NCERT."

The state said in the affidavit, that on verification it was found that 2,208 applicants had provided an income certificate that was not issued by the Mamlatdar. The state also said that it was in the process of taking action against such applicants.

The affidavit said that to ensure a level playing field for children from weaker sections of society who were admitted to schools under RTE, it had directed the DEO and the DPEOs to hold a meeting with schools under its jurisdiction. The officials were to hold a meeting with the school authorities to provide a proper environment to the students and to also carry out counselling sessions for both the students and the parents. It also advised the schools to carry out a pre-meeting with parents whose children were admitted to the schools under RTE.

The state also informed the court that that of the 80,165 students who were granted admission, the admission of only 72, 294 were confirmed. The remaining would be given admission during the second round.

States in turn are to reimburse a certain amount of money for every RTE admission.

However, it turns out that the Maharashtra government is looking around for ways to not pay these schools the money it owes them.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Maharashtra, led by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, can claim credit for many successes, especially with the irrigation project Jalyukt Shivar and an impressive infrastructure upgrade topping the list. However, its record on one front has been abysmal, i.e., in fulfilling its responsibility under the Right to Education (RTE) Act.

According to Section 12 of the RTE, non-minority unaided private schools are required to reserve 25 per cent of the seats in entry-level classes (either primary level or Class 1) for students belonging to disadvantaged groups (DGs) [Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), etc] and economically weaker sections (EWS) [income less than a certain amount]. The state in return is supposed to pay these schools, for every RTE admission, an amount fixed by the government or the tuition fee of a school, whichever is less. Maharashtra has fixed an amount of Rs 17,000 a year for RTE students.

But it goes to great lengths to avoid reimbursing this amount to schools. Though the schools have been reserving seats under RTE since 2012, the government tried to get out of its commitment by simply agreeing to pay dues for only one academic year. Then, there was disagreement over the actual amount due and how it should be calculated. The government said it owed Rs 300 crore while the schools said the amount was more than 1,000 crore.

This mismatch in estimates came about because the government wanted to pay only for fresh RTE admissions while the schools were asking to be compensated for all RTE admissions (new and repeat/old students - explained in detail here).

Even to date, the dues of past academic years have not been fully released to all the private schools. Now, the Maharashtra government has come up with a new plan to avoid paying the money it owes to these institutions. In a government resolution released recently, it has modified the norms for RTE reimbursement stating that ""if a private school is using any government land and benefiting from the same then the school would not receive reimbursement for students who have been admitted in 25 per cent RTE quota,"" Mumbai Mirror reported.

Through this order, the government has effectively imposed a retrospective binding of sorts in an agreement that is in force for years and it has done so in a one-sided manner. This is a textbook definition of ""breach of contract"". When the government leased out land, it didn't impose a condition that schools will have to reserve 25 per cent seats for EWS/DG category students. Nor does the RTE Act mandate that those schools that have received land from the government at concessional rates will not be compensated for fulfilling the RTE quota. Hence, both from the RTE Act and the leasing agreement, the government's action is prima facie illegal. Less said about the ethical aspect of its action, the better.

Independent English Schools Association (IESA) secretary Rajendra Singh told Swarajya that ""the government's action is not just illogical but outright illegal. The RTE and land leasing are two separate contracts. In any case, under the RTE Act, the government gives reimbursement for only tuition fees and not for infrastructure costs the school has to bear. Land comes under the latter category. How can the two be clubbed? If the government was paying per student reimbursement for infrastructure costs also, then they had a case. In such a scenario, they could have deducted this from total reimbursement, but how can they not reimburse the tuition fees?""

Singh further explained that the government simply ""doesn't have the data to ascertain how many schools have the land leasing agreement with the government. Nor it has the manpower to determine this number. It will take anywhere between one to two years to collect the data. This is nothing but their latest attempt to delay payments to private schools."""

Right To Education (RTE) helpline was launched recently by the Social Welfare Department of Karnataka, which allows one to lodge complaints and get information on the Act. The Executive Director of the Child Rights Trust, Vasudeva Sharma, spoke to RadioActive about how the helpline could be used effectively.

Vasudeva Sharma explained that the RTE Act had been introduced way back in 2009 in Karnataka, and a lot of calls used to be received by the Child Rights Trust members on their personal numbers seeking clarifications. Even though there were no instructions available regarding RTE at that time, they used to clarify or give information in a comprehensible way. Of late, the calls had been about more specific and less common information.

He said they had attempted to set up a hotline back then, which failed because their personal numbers were still popular. The new helpline would have to have employees well-versed in the intricacies of RTE - the national Act as well as the rules for Karnataka and section (12)(1)(C), because (12)(1)(C) was often misused.

He spoke about the dangers of (12)(1)(C) being misused and despite it having popular aspects like forbidding corporal punishment, or stating the kinds of facilities an institution must have, how that could cause people to lose trust in it. It gave the impression that (12)(1)(C) was introduced as an attempt to control private institutions, as the condition laid down for availing this provision spoke only of what was expected of the institutions without placing any responsibility on the government. With the rampant misuse of this section, private institutions became richer but could not be brought under the control - and that such situations would lead to mistrust in the RTE Act itself.

Vasudeva Sharma said that he used to find a lot of children in government schools, but of late the number had been dwindling because they had moved to private schools. However, over time, parents were faced with demands for multiple additional payments. This at times forced the children back into government schools, and other times, they continued education there despite the heavy expenditure.

He also proposed some solutions:

On the move to make 8th standard the equivalent of 10th standard, Vasudeva Sharma said that though there had been discussions, the Central Government was yet to make a decision. He opined that it could not be taken without thorough discussions and analysis but was apprehensive about the imbalance a positive answer would create.

Vasudeva Sharma said that ignorance among activists and officials will deprive the children of the rights extended to them by the government. He suggested that guidelines be prepared wherein the responsibilities of each official is clearly mentioned and that such clarity would enable effective implementation of the Act.

He added that ignorance causes lack of coordination between the concerned departments and organisations, which could lead to failure of the programme."

""The data so collected will not be shared or retained at the school/zonal/district level for personal or any other use and it will be collected in strict compliance with guidelines,"" the reply read.

The reply came while hearing a plea filed by the Delhi Government School Teachers Association, through advocate Kamlesh Kumar Mishra, challenging the move by the government, seeking the voter ID details of the parents and relatives of students.

On Tuesday, the court was informed that on November 27, a circular was issued by the Directorate of Education (DoE) where it is specifically mentioned that, ""except DoE, no outside agency' has been hired or engaged for data collection or verification"".

Members of the southern unit of Right to Education (RTE) Forum have urged the government to withdraw the Bill tabled in Parliament seeking amendment to Section 16 of the RTE Act which aims at bringing back the detention policy in school education system.

In a resolution unanimously adopted at the first southern regional consultation on RTE, organised by the National RTE Forum and facilitated by Save the Children in Vijayawada, they alleged that it was an attempt to dilute the most progressive section of the Act through 'backdoor' methods. ""This is an ill-conceived move aimed at victimising children from the marginalised communities such as Dalits, adivasis, the urban poor, persons with disabilities and other disadvantaged sections. We strongly demand that the government drop this Bill and create an enabling condition in the classroom,"" said Ambarish Rai, convener, National RTE Forum.

The resolution demanded that the Centre allocate 6 % of the GDP and the State Governments 25 % of their respective budgets to ensure care, protection and equal right to quality education for all children.

The members said they would urge political parties to include 'right to equitable quality education for all children' in their political agenda in the 2019 elections.

Constitution of School Management Committees/School Development and Monitoring Committees in all schools to ensure effective implementation of the RtE Act, establishment of government-funded neighbourhood schools and ultimately move towards Common School System and to strengthen grievance redressal mechanism were among the other demands.

The resolution also called for effective measures to make all schools RTE-compliant, steps to stop closure of government schools in the name of rationalisation, put an end to privatisation and commercialisation of education, imparting adequate training on teachers to make the classroom space more interesting, timely supply of textbooks, uniforms and other learning equipment to students and improvement of infrastructure facilities in schools.

""Steps to regulate private schools is essential besides making them accountable by asking them to set up monitoring committees,"" said Vikas Gora, general manager, Save the Children."

Lakshmi works as a domestic help with a few families in Bengaluru. Her daughter during the academic year 2018-2019 had been admitted to LKG in a private school through the Right to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act 2009, section 12(1)(c). The Act promises 25 percent reservation in private unaided schools for weaker sections and disadvantaged groups.

Lakshmi chose to avail this choice as she felt that in government schools, children are left to themselves and aren't provided adequate attention. She says that she wants to educate her daughter, and felt private school was the best option.

There are several other parents from marginalised groups who would like to avail free education in private unaided schools, during the academic year 2019-2020. But that might not be a possibility if proposed amendments to the RTE rules, for which the cabinet has given the nod, come through. The proposed amendment gives government schools the priority, and the choice of availing admission in a private unaided school will be applicable only if there are no government schools in the neighbourhood. The Minister for Law and Parliamentary affairs Krishna Byregowda in his brief to the media said that preference to private schools has resulted in the government schools having fewer enrollments.

""If parents want to send their children to government schools, they will. Why is the government forcing this upon parents ?"" asks B N Yogananda (General Secretary, RTE Students and Parents Association). He says the private school lobby who don't want children from disadvantaged communities to study in their schools, are pushing for this. While there has been the mention of following the Kerala model with these proposed amendments, Yoganand says that the governments schools in Karnataka aren't at the same level compared to Kerala, and parents in Karnataka aren't willing to send their children to government schools.

In terms of next steps, the association plans to meet the Principal Secretary (Primary and Secondary Education) and demand that the proposed amendments be withdrawn. If not they plan on staging wide protests, and as a last resort would file a petition in the court.

G Nagasimha Rao ( Director, Child Rights Trust ) and convener of the RTE Task Force highlighted the lack of consultations in the process od changing rules. He says that after the RTE rules have not been reviewed even once after being notified in 2012, and amendments were directly called for. The RTE Task Force in their letter to the Principal Secretary, demands that the plan for the proposed amendments be halted; and recommends consulting civil society organisations working in the field of education, concerned parents and children while formulating recommendation to amend RTE rules. The RTE task force too plans on holding protests if the governments goes ahead with the proposed amendments.

This is not the first time that there have been proposals to amend the RTE rules in Karnataka. In January 2018 similar amendment to the rules were proposed by the Education Department but were rejected after coming under severe opposition.

What the government is proposing isn't something outside the law, says Niranjan Aradhya (Centre for Child and Law, NLSIU). He says that section 3 of the RTE Act provides fundamental right to free and compulsory education in the neighborhood school, and there is nothing wrong if the state decides to admit children in a government school available in the neighbourhood.

He adds that other options - aided and unaided schools come in when there are no government schools in the neighbourhood. As a member of the committee by Karnataka Development Authority working to strengthen government schools, Niranjan opines that section 3 of the act must be implemented in letter and spirit and several concrete steps are to be taken in order to strengthen state government schools so that they are on par with central government schools.

The average RTE reimbursement for a child stood at Rs 6871 during the year 2017, compared to the maximum ceiling of Rs 11,848 (cost per child in government schools). This indicates that a large section of the private unaided schools charge a low fee, and come under the low fee paying category schools (LFP). While there are several private schools that provide quality education, the same can't be said about LFPs. Research has pointed to how they even fall short in providing English education, which is one of the reasons parents from marginalised groups are attracted to them in the first place. ""LFP schools can't be thought of as an alternative to government schools "" says Rishikesh Shanker, Associate Professor, Azim Premji University, who advocates for the strengthening of the public education system.

Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh had previously attempted to modify the RTE rules along the same lines that the Education Department of Karnataka has proposed. In a notification by the Department of Elementary Education (Government of Himachal Pradesh) dated June 6th, 2015, guidelines were provided for admission and reimbursement of children under section 12 of the RTE Act.

Under these guidelines the government schools and private unaided schools in the neighborhood would initiate the process of 25 percent reservation in private unaided schools only if the minimum number of students (25) have been filled in the entry standard of the government school. This notification was challenged in the High court in Smt Namikta vs State of HP and others. The grievance of the petitioner was that the notification is contrary to the provisions of section 12(1)(c) of RTE Act which doesn't contain any inhibition and therefore restricts the scope of the Act.

The High Court struck down the notification stating that the notification creates a hierarchy in availing the benefits under section 12(1)(c), and is being read in a contrary manner where importing"" an obligation to admit students from the weaker section and disadvantaged groups only where seats are not available in the state run schools and aided institutions would be to defeat the object of the provisions."" The court concluded that there is no hierarchy in the parent Act and therefore the state government is in violation of the provision of the Act.

A petition regarding similar concerns was raised in the Allahabad High Court in Ajay Kumar Patel vs State of UP where the court stated that a policy of hierarchy can't be laid down by the government as it is contrary to the Parliamentary Act.

While the proposed amendment in RTE act is not supported by parents, the idea of prioritising the government schools may not be bad, after all. The parents and several civil society organisations opposing the amendment think that the condition of government schools in Karnataka is abysmal, including the poor learning levels of students. However, available research shows that there is no difference in learning levels between both groups of students.

A study by Azim Premji Foundation between 2008 and 2013 conducted in Andhra Pradesh examines the difference in learning levels of students (randomly selected from government schools) who were provided a scholarship and attended private schools, and students who didn't receive the scholarship and continued attending government schools.

The private schools who were part of the study had to admit a maximum of 25 percent students from disadvantaged groups, in line with the current 25 percent quota under the RTE. The students were tested at the end of every year for five years on their learning outcomes in Telugu, Mathematics, English and EVS.

The results showed that there was no difference between the learning levels of the different groups of students, and that private schools didn't add any value to the learning levels of the students from disadvantaged groups who had hitherto been in government schools and had joined them. The author of the paper notes that worldwide research is divided on student achievements after obtaining choice to study in private schools, and currently there is no consensus on this matter."

""The meeting will be a reminder for schools to ensure safety and security measures, including speed governors in buses, CCTV cameras on school premises, preparations to tackle natural as well as man-made disasters among other facilities,"" he said and added that a number of schools were still careless about the safety of kids.

They aren't sure if the authorities would do all that is needed to enhance the quality of government schools and bring them on a par with private ones.

Notably, Section 3 of the Act, which is considered the core of the legislation, provides children the fundamental right to free and compulsory education in a neighbourhood school.

According to the proposal, if there's a government school in neighbourhood of a child -- within 1km for primary education and 3km for higher primary -- he/she should get admitted to that instead of a private school.

Nagasimha G Rao, state convener of the RTE task force, said, ""The government is citing the example of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where government schools are in high demand. We're in touch with RTE activists there too. But the Karnataka scenario is different. Parents prefer English medium schools over government institutions.""

Mohammed Yousuf, a Marappa Garden resident and parent of a child who's an RTE beneficiary, said, ""I don't think government schools are up to the mark. They don't have good English teachers and lack infrastructure. Moreover, the nearest government school in our area is located on defence land, can be accessed by every passerby and has a dumpsite too. My son will not be safe.""

Education department officials admit that no new government school has been opened in the state in the past three years.

Citing a 2017 study by the RTE Forum, a national organization, which states that 90% of RTE students paid fees to private schools,Y Mariswamy, chairperson (in charge), Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights said, ""We get a lot of complaints from parents. It is sad that students are still made to pay fees at private schools despite being admitted under RTE.

Niranjan Aradhya, senior fellow and programme head, Universalisation of Equitable Quality Education Programme, Centre for Child and the Law, NLSIU, said: ""This is a chance for government schools to improve. The government just needs to do a few basic things like recruit more English teachers and upgrade schools to the level of Kendriya Vidyalayas. To make RTE effective, they need to implement section 12(2) of the RTE Act which mandates private unaided schools receiving government largesse to reserve seats for weaker sections from their neighbourhood without the state having the obligation to reimburse them.

The State Cabinet's nod to amend the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act quota rules has come as a blow to families from lower socio-economic backgrounds.

Many parents have decided to protest the Cabinet's decision which stated that children from weaker sections and disadvantaged communities can get admission in private schools under the RTE quota only if there are no government schools in their neighbourhood.

A majority of neighbourhoods already have a government school. In other words, the probability of getting children admitted into private schools is almost nil.

The Department of Primary and Secondary Education is planning to amend three clauses under the Karnataka Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2012.

However, experts point out that amending the State rules alone is not adequate as the RTE Act mandates that 25% of the seats in private schools are reserved from children from weaker sections and disadvantaged communities.

The Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, which is supposed to be the monitoring body for all aspects concerning the RTE Act, was reportedly not consulted.

Shruthi R., who is hoping her son gets a seat under the RTE quota in a private school for 2019-2020, said: ""I live in the Kamakshipalya ward and there is a government school in the ward. But I do not want to send my child there. The government is denying our right to free English-medium education.""

Many parent support groups have decided to challenge this move legally. B.N. Yogananda, general secretary of RTE Students and Parents' Association, said that they had written to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights asking of legal possibilities to challenge this move.

""The State government is doing this to appease the private management lobby. This is against the interest of lakhs of parents and children,"" he said.

Nagasimha G. Rao, convener of the RTE task force, said that the State government had taken up a drastic step without consulting different stakeholders.

""The government is saying they will follow the Kerala model, but the quality of education imparted in government schools here cannot be compared to that of Kerala's,"" he said.

For admissions under the RTE quota, a 'neighbourhood' is considered as a revenue village in rural areas, a ward within city corporation limits, and the entire jurisdiction for urban local bodies."

""Don't expect miracles"" in a huge country like India, the Supreme Court said Friday, refusing to further hear a PIL seeking implementation of the Right to Education Act to bring 35 million poor kids into the formal schooling system.

The apex court had earlier asked petitioner 'Akhil Delhi Prathmik Shikshak Sangh', a registered society, to give a representation to the Centre on implementation of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, also known as RTE.

Refusing to monitor the RTE implementation in the country, a bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said, ""Don't expect miracles. India is a huge, huge country. Priorities are many and certainly, education is one of the priorities.""

The bench, also comprising Justices S K Kaul and K M Joseph, took note of the fact that the Centre has given the response after taking note of the representation.

""Heard counsel for the petitioner and perused the relevant material. We are not inclined to interfere. The writ petition is accordingly dismissed,"" it noted in the order.

It had earlier asked senior lawyer Colin Gonsalves, appearing for the organisation, to give representation to the Centre and had said that the government would ""assist the court with regard to the implementation"" of the RTE.

The apex court had also asked the Centre to apprise it of decision taken on the issue. However, it today declined further hearing on the PIL.

The teachers' body, in its PIL, had sought implementation of the right to education of children aged between six to 14 years.

The plea had said the children are suffering as government schools are shutting down and around 9.5 lakh posts of teachers are vacant in these schools.

It had referred to reports ""showing systematic and widespread violations of children's right to education across the country, including violations of numerous specific requirements of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009"".

As things stand, as many as 51,849 seats are yet to be filled despite the long-drawn process.

Activists have pointed out that lack of awareness among parents belonging to the disadvantaged category, lack of a competent grievance redressal cell, and an arduous process of obtaining eligibility documents are some of the reasons for not achieving the 100% admission target.

Komalbai, who works as a maid in Pashan has two of her children living in the city. ""I don't know anything about RTE. My elder daughter is in class I and my son in KG. When I tried to admit my son to an aided school, but they refused admission. So I have admitted him in a Zilla Parishad school.""

While lack of awareness is one issue, another problem is that the migrant population may not have required documents. ""We have a voter ID and Aadhaar card but we don't have the income certificate. The agent asked for a lot of money for it. Hence, we just left it at that,"" said Komalbai.

Matin Mujawar of Shikshan Hakka Manch said, ""Awareness is the first step. The government needs to conduct massive awareness programmes about the RTE Act in slums and other areas. The polio drive is a success because of the massive awareness campaign. On similar lines, there should be an awareness drive about RTE Act so that everybody knows what needs to be done so that their children can get admission.""

Grievance redressal is another major problem that is hampering even NGOs and other activists working to help disadvantaged students get admission. The education department had announced a grievance redressal department with a helpline number. However, none of it was implemented.

""Currently, just one person talks to people with grievances. When a parent complains, this person would tell them to go to the school. Why would the school entertain the parents? Even letters from the education officer were hardly of any use because there were no follow ups,"" said Mukund Kirdat, an education activist.

Education commissioner Vishal Solanki said, ""We are working on various aspects of RTE admission. We would improve the present system from next year onward."""

The petitioner, civil society organisation Justice for All, challenged a May 20, 2014, circular by the Directorate of Education (DoE) laying down the working hours of teachers in government and government-aided schools in Delhi at six-and-a-half hours for single-shift schools and six hours for double-shift schools.

A bench of Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice Kameshwar Rao took cognizance of the matter and sought responses from the respondents -- the civic bodies, the Delhi government's education secretary and the Government Schools Teachers' Association. The next hearing is on January 30.

According to point number four of the schedule, under sections 19 and 25 of the RTE Act on ""norms and standards for a school"", the minimum working for teachers should be 45 hours per week, including preparation time -- seven-and-a-half hours per day for a working week of six days.

A fresh order was issued in May 2014, increasing work hours of teachers from six hours to six-and-a-half hours in single-shift schools and from five-and-a-half hours to six hours in double-shift schools. The petitioner stated that the work hours, as laid down by the May 2014 order, ""defeat the aim"" of the RTE Act ""to provide equitable quality education... as well as minimum working hours for teachers""."

The education official also claimed the provision of not reimbursing schools that are built on government land has always been in place, although its mention has been formalised thanks to the government resolution.

She was talking to The Hindu on the sidelines of a workshop on inclusive education at the State Council of Educational Research and Training here recently. Ms. Julka said talks had been held with the Ministry of Social Justice on amending the RTE Act, as special schools had been made a legislative option for students under the Rights of Persons With Disabilities (RPWD) Act, 2016. The RPWD Act, she said, promoted inclusive education and gave a child the option of studying in regular or special schools or have home-based education. Inclusion, she said, did not mean in the physical sense alone. It meant that the education system had to accommodate the requirements of a child rather than child having to fit the system.

Therefore, if a neighbourhood school was not ready to accept a child with high-support needs or its teachers were not equipped enough for that or parents felt that their children needed full-day attention or had many learning gaps, then special schools were an option in the initial years before shifting them to regular schools.

Home-based education should be the last resort, and was preferable only for children with profound disabilities, Ms. Julka said.

Inclusion, in an optimal sense, would mean providing all support in school, but it was difficult in the country. So, if at all a child was attending a special school, it should be only till the child caught up, she said. However, even if special schools were to be treated as resource centres for inclusion, it would not work till they were brought under a single umbrella, she said. Taking parents' choice into consideration was also important.

Attitude changes were possible only if everyone worked together. The earlier differently abled children went to regular school, the more they would be be accepted by other students and teachers."

They feel the private ones are more conducive and safer, found a recent study 'Adversarial Parental Perceptions About Government Schools in Ahmedabad'. The study was conducted by Right To Education Resource Centre (RTERC) of Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIMA).

Many parents have a poor impression about the government schools because they've had bad experiences, RTERC researchers said. However, their opinion slightly changed after they visited several government schools.

The study, supported by UNICEF was conducted by professor Ankur Sarin of IIMA and a research associate Nisha Warnekar found flaws with issues such as lack of teachers, non-teaching staff loaded with too much work, principals and administrators lacking authority over teachers, among others. The findings come at a crucial time when around 40,000 seats under the RTE Act remain vacant this year.

""We interviewed several parents belonging to a particular geographical area comprising 34 schools. We wanted to compare their responses. We investigated the extent of information asymmetry amongst the households on the lines of parental perceptions. Our researchers also visited ten schools,"" professor Sarin's team said.

The parents feel that schools should have CCTV cameras, students should have uniforms, identity cards, and regular parent-teacher meets.

The parents suggested that government schools usually were large open spaces where anyone could walk in because the gates are always open. On the contrary, the private schools are ""bandh killas"" or fortresses.

For this reason, parents said, their wards often leave the premises during school hours.

In contrast, the parents whose wards made it to the private ones feel the gates are locked and the students can't leave the premises during school hours.

Many government schools are cleaner and more spacious than the private ones. Some say many have walls that are nicely done or boards displaying letters and numbers in different languages, maps and prayers. The infrastructure in these schools are also better and focus on extracurricular activities.

However, many parents cited the new focus of government schools on extracurricular activity and participation in competitions as being a waste of time.

""Private schools, in contrast, were incredibly cramped with almost 60- 65 students sitting on benches, which is double its capacity. Another private school was located in the middle of a marketplace and reels under tremendous noise. To solve this, the authorities have put up boards on the windows. This has made the classrooms dark and dingy,"" professor Sarin said.

""We found mixed results inside the classrooms. For example, in one government school, a teacher was very strict. But, even many private schools had the same rules. Also, in one of the private schools, we found a teacher spending a lot of time during the class on the phone. The students silently sneaked out without taking any permission,"" Sarin added.

The report found that all five government schools had at least one teacher short. As one school explained, a recent mandate on the qualification of teachers had led to a shortage of subject teachers in secondary classes.

This led to an excess of primary grade teachers and a shortage of secondary-level teachers. The two Urdu medium schools said it was a major problem as very few with higher degrees required to teach in the secondary classes. The report concluded laying a map for the state government which can help parents change their perception. They included highlighting achievements of government schools, ensuring more accountability, etc."

The State govt. is again planning to tweak the criteria for admission under the reservation quota of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, which will prioritise government schools over their private counterparts.

The move has been criticised by parents' groups and education experts, among other stakeholders, who believe that the government is diluting the reservation clause. The Dept. of Primary and Secondary Education is proposing that the changes be applicable in the 2019-20 academic year.

The RTE Act states that 25% of seats be reserved for students of weaker sections and disadvantaged groups in private schools. However, as per the department's plan, a child must be admitted to government or aided schools in the neighbourhood.""Only if government or aided schools are not in the neighbourhood, should the child be allotted seats in a private school,"" said a source privy to the latest proposal.

Experts point out that the proposal will ensure that the reservation quota is scrapped as almost all neighbourhoods have a government school in the vicinity. (For admissions under the RTE quota, a 'neighbourhood' is considered as a revenue village in rural areas, a ward within city corporation limits, and the entire jurisdiction for urban local bodies.)Other sources confirmed that the department was planning to amend three clauses under the Karnataka Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2012.

""This move has been proposed as officials in the department feel that reimbursements to private schools for the RTE quota caused a huge burden to the State exchequer,"" the source added. This academic year alone, the State government is estimated to have reimbursed around ₹500 crore.

This January, a similar proposal was submitted by the department, but was not approved by the former Primary and Secondary Education Minister Tanveer Sait after widespread criticism. The State department's own analysis pointed out the rate of decline in government school enrolments for class one got steeper in the years following implementation of the RTE Act. It had also pointed out that only a small percentage (1.2%) of the overall budget of the Department of Primary and Secondary Education was spent as reimbursement for 2015-2016. Parents are unhappy with this proposal as they enrol their children in private schools in the hope they would become well-versed in English.

Shashikala K., a domestic help whose son studies under the RTE quota in a private school in North Bengaluru, said: ""When we applied for admissions this year, there were more than a dozen private schools that we could apply to. We were very happy as we could get English-medium education free of cost. If the rules are changed, it would mean that English-medium education is no longer accessible to us as every locality has a govt. school."""

Over 4,700 such children in the city have not yet secured a seat, but Friday's lottery made allotments only to 402 of them. This lottery was the final round of admissions for the current academic year.

BMC conducts online admissions for 25% seats reserved under RTE Act, 2009, at unaided non-minority schools in the city. This year, 347 schools were eligible for the process, and on offer were 8,341 seats. However, through three rounds of admissions, only 3,168 out of the 11,343 applicants secured admission. As many as 3,209 did not report for admission despite being allotted a seat.

Over the past few days, several parents came to BMC's education department with requests for another chance at admissions. ""Since there were vacant seats, we decided to hold another round of admissions for those who had not been allotted a seat in the entire process. But those who have rejected a seat will not get another chance,"" said a BMC official.

In this round, out of the 402 allotments, 352 got a seat in state board schools. The rest of the students will, however, now not get a chance. ""Many students have been left out because of demand-supply mismatch. While there are some schools which have applications exceeding their capacity, some schools have no takers,"" said the civic official.

Parents will have until October 20 to confirm admissions at the respective schools. In case schools do not admit students, parents can approach the local education officials for help."

The order came in connection with a Public Interest Litigation filed by Sandip Munjyasara, who had sought that students who were yet to be admitted under RTE be allowed to make changes in the school of choice mentioned in the original RTE application form.

The petition has also sought that the number of vacant seats in each school be made available to the students so that they can revise their choice.

The court said in its order that the state needs to publicise the number of seats available and the number of students who are yet to get admission after the first round is over. It also said that this details be made available school wise.

The court clarified that the option to modify and expand their choice of schools will not be available to students who had already accepted the schools assigned and those who had been offered their choice of schools but had chosen not to take admission in the same.

The court, however, said that no changes will be made to admissions this year as the process is more or less complete. Thus, the option of modifying their choice of schools will not be available to students who are left out under RTE this year.

The court observed that since it is already the end of September, if students get admission they would end up attending classes from the second session, which would affect their education.

It also directed the government to ensure that widest publicity be given to ensure that parents and students are aware about the form filling exercise.

It said that they should be encouraged to indicate as many choices of school as possible while filling up the form.The court observed that the guardians of students who apply under RTE are often themselves handicapped by poverty and illiteracy and the state needs to be sensitive about it.

It also did not entertain the government's view that permitting changes in choice even after first round was not possible since the entire system was online. The court observed that it would not be impossible to implement. ""It will ensure that more students secure admission under RTE. System must realise that we are dealing with a sensitive issue,"" said the court."

The Kailash Satyarthi Children's Foundation, in association with Delhi Legal Services Authority (DLSA) and Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) organised a national conference on Combating Trafficking through Education at Constitution Club of India in Delhi.

Priyank Kanoongo, member, National Commission for Protection of Child Rights pointed that children who do not attend school are often the most susceptible to perpetrators of trafficking. ""They often come from poor families who are unable to afford the academic fee. Education can be a source of empowerment steering their future away from the ugliness of trafficking. Free and compulsory education to girls of 15- 18 years of age is the first step towards achieving this reality, "" Kanoongo said.

The National Crime Records Bureau reported that in 2016 alone, 9,034 children were trafficked, a figure that had risen dramatically by 131 per cent from 3,905 in 2015. Given such alarming data, there is an urgent need of a comprehensive approach to combat the organised crime of trafficking.

Geetanjali Goel, special secretary, Delhi Legal Services Authority said, ""There are gaps which need to be identified. When I was at the Juvenile Justice Board I would see many cases of children who had been trafficked from states like Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh for executing thefts. So it is not just trafficking for prostitution or labour. More research into the causes and purpose behind trafficking needs to be done to find specific solutions."" She emphasised on the need to identify and map children who are school drop outs as they are more vulnerable. ""We are working on the module to educate children in schools in Delhi to prevent offences and protect them,"" Goel added.

Bhuwan Ribhu, lawyer and child rights activist stressed on the need to take ownership of the issue to combat trafficking. ""When a child is trafficked every fundamental right of that child is snatched. Let us pledge to make this a public movement so that every child is free, safe and educated,"" he added."

In a report tabled in the Assembly, the CAG has revealed that 12.80 to 15.11 per cent of children in the age group of 6-14 years were not enrolled in any school in the state during 2012-17. But the state government could only identify between 2.72 to 6.12 per cent of children as ""out of school children"" during the same five years.

These deficiencies, the report said, include failure to provide basic facilities in schools and setting admission targets without taking into consideration the availability of seats as per the RTE quota. ""The state government could not provide basic infrastructure facilities in majority of government schools even after seven years of implementation of the RTE Act,"" the CAG report mentioned. The Government of India and the Gujarat government's share of Rs 3635.57 crore (34 per cent) was short due to under utilisation of funds for implementation of the RTE Act, the report noted.

The CAG also expressed dissatisfaction about the state government's monitoring mechanism to ensure the proper implementation of the Act, also known as the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act of 2009. The CAG noted that the ""monitoring mechanism was weak as Block Resource Centre Coordinators or Cluster Coordinators had not conducted the prescribed number of inspections of schools"".

On RTE Act's clause for establishment of neighbourhood schools and transportation facility, the CAG report stated that the state government mapped schools in 2011-12 and found the requirement of 201 schools to meet the neighbourhood school norm. ""Of these, only 25 schools have been established and made functional as of March 2017. As a result, the number of students identified to be provided transportation facilities due to non-availability of schools in the neighbourhood increased three times from 51,653 in 2012-13 to 1,41,854 students in 2016-17,"" the report stated.

Further, during the audit, it was revealed that several primary and upper primary government schools were functioning without any teacher during 2012-17 as against the minimum requirement, it stated.

On the other hand, in the ""test-checked"" districts, the audit found surplus teachers in 275 primary schools (349 teachers) and 924 upper primary schools (1105 teachers). ""The state government could have utilised these surplus teachers in schools which did not have or which had less number of teachers. Thus, even after a lapse of more than seven years since implementation of the RTE Act the state government failed in ensuring maintenance of pupil- teacher ratio as mandated by the Act,"" the report pointed out.

The report pointed out that the prescribed pupil-teacher ratio in Gujarat was not achieved in 1,156 out of 10,531 primary schools and 3,098 out of 22,234 upper primary schools as on March 2017. As per the pupil-teacher ratio prescribed under the RTE Act, there should be at least two teachers in a primary school and three teachers in upper primary schools.

Further, the audit found that the local authorities had not provided training to 90,789 (27 per cent) of the 3,41,157 out-of-school children during 2012-17. ""Thus the objectives of the Act of increasing the competency level of out of school children for their mainstreaming in appropriate class remained unachieved,"" the report stated.

It also observed that the State Advisory Council met only ""twice"" against 16 meetings to be held during 2013-17.

In its annual compliance report of Gujarat Education Department on implementation of Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2009, the CAG noted that the targets for admission to economically weaker section and disadvantaged groups under the Right to Education Act have been fixed by the Gujarat government without considering the mandated provision of the Act.

""The process of fixation of a target was erroneous. The target fixed was much less than the mandated 25 per cent of the seats reserved as per RTE Act. As per DISE (District Information System for Education) data (2016-17), there are total 4,26,510 seats available for admission in Class I of unaided schools in Gujarat. However, against 1,06,628 seats (25 per cent of total seats) available for admission to children from economically weaker and disadvantaged groups, the target fixed was only 46,000 (43 per cent). This indicates that the targets have been allotted by the state government without considering the mandated provision of the Act,"" the report stated.

Citing the case of Ahmedabad city, the report stated that the District Education Officer received 17,866 applications as against the target of 18,950 seats during 2013-17. Of these only 13,126 children have been given admission.

Of the remaining 4,740 applications, 2,178 applications were rejected for want of supporting documents, while 2562 children did not join the school due to-allotment of admission is a school other than the one chosen, the schools being far away from residence and allotment in other medium than chosen.

Pertaining to reimbursement of fees (Rs 10,000 or actual fee charged by the school whichever is less) to the private schools against these 25 per cent reserved seats, the report pointed out a delay of six to twelve months by the district authorities.

""In test-checked districts (Ahmedabad and Banaskantha), the district authorities had not reimbursed as of June 2017 fees of Rs 91.28 lakh payable to 377 private schools against 2,121 students admitted under RTE Act during 2014-17. Further, seven talukas -- Dhandhuka in Ahmedabad, Anand in Anand district, Radhanpur, Harij, Santalpur, Saraswati and Shankheshwar in Patan district -- have not even calculated the fee to be reimbursed to 59 schools for 770 students admitted during 2014-17,"" the report stated.

The reason cited by the District Primary Education Officers (DPEOs) of these districts for this delay is ""due to late receipt of grant from the Director of Primary Education"".

While on one hand, the state government, this year kept boasting of making provision for more seats for RTE children, but not getting children for admission, the report clearly states that the admission targets were much lower than the actual seats available.

The report stated, ""The department allotted targets to all districts and Municipal corporations for admission under 25% RTE quota without considering the total number of seats available for admission in class 1. The targets allotted were observed to be much lower than the actual seats available for admission.

As per the pupil-teacher ratio prescribed under the RTE Act, there should be at least two teachers in a primary school and three teachers in upper primary schools.

Commenting on the admission targets, the CAG has observed that the education department allotted targets to the district and municipal corporations for admission under 24 per cent RTE quota without considering the total number of seats available for admission in Class 1.

""The targets allotted were observed to be much lower than the actual seats available for admission in the state"" the report said.

The CAG also came across instances of ""denial of admission to eligible children"" during its scrutiny.

During scrutiny, the CAG found that in Surendranagar district alone, 359 eligible children of ""weaker sections and disadvantaged groups"" were denied admission during 2016-17 by the district authorities ""stating that the reserved seats of the schools opted by the applicants had been filled up"".

""Allotment of admission in different medium or school not opted for by the applicants were also noticed"", the central auditor said in its report.

The CAG also took note that 27 per cent identified Out of School Children (OoSC) were not given training for their ""mainstreaming to regular schooling in appropriate class"" during 2012-17.

""The above deficiencies indicated that the key objectives of the RTE Act of universalisation of elementary education could not be fully achieved,"" the CAG observed.

The CAG recommended that the state government should conduct an annual survey to identify children in the age group of 6-14 years and enrol them in schools.

Despite receiving record number of applications from candidates across Tamil Nadu, only 70,000 managed to get admissions in private schools under the 25% RTE quota, according to official data.

""This is because the admission guidelines were revised this year. Only those residing within 1km radius of the schools were considered for the admission process,"" a state school education department official told TOI on condition of anonymity.

Until last year, applications from those within 3km or 5km radius were considered during the second or subsequent rounds of admissions.

Explaining the rationale behind this decision, the official said the Centre had not only denied reimbursement claims made for admissions made under the said act in kindergarten sections but also delayed releasing the promised funds.

""Every year, the state had to spend over and above its allocated budget to bridge this funding gap,"" he said.

Corroborating this, minutes of the recent Samagara Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) project approval board meeting suggest that the state had sought Rs 99 crore as total reimbursement towards expenditure incurred for 25 % admission under RTE quota in 2015-16.

But the central government (HRD ministry) has sanctioned only Rs 27.6 crore approximately one-fourth of the proposal, show records.

Commenting on this, V Eswaran from MDMK party, also an RTE activist, said, ""Other states including Maharashtra increase the radius to 3km or 5km if the seats remain vacant. So when there is a provision to do so, the government can't cite shortage of funds as a reason to revise guidelines.""

""Instead, the government can fix the loopholes in admitting students from disadvantaged groups (SC/ST/BC/MBC) to make the scheme more efficient. These students become eligible only by submitting a community certificate. So, even the affluent managed to study for free,"" he told.

According to section 12 (1)(c) of the act, 25 % seats in private schools are reserved for students aged between 8 to 14, belonging to weaker sections (with an annual income of less than Rs 2 lakh) and disadvantaged groups.

Eswaran added if the RTE Act doesn't accept KG admissions, then the state should instruct private schools to readmit them in Class I and submit these applications for reimbursement."

The Uttarakhand Commission for Protection of Child Rights (UCPCR) has received over 70 complaints this year against private schools allegedly violating provisions of the Right to Education (RTE) Act.

Usha Negi, chairman of UCPCR, said, ""We have received many complaints against private schools of the state flouting the RTE Act. Many schools are demanding fees from students admitted under RTE. Several students are harassed by the school authorities as well.""

The commission has received complaints against prominent private schools, including Scholars Home, Moravian Institute, Doon World School and Doon Sarla Academy. In the various complaints, all four schools have been accused of demanding money from students enrolled under RTE Act.

While complaint against Scholars Home and Doon Sarla Academy stated that they were demanding a monthly fee ranging from Rs 500-1,000 from students under RTE and not giving a receipt of the same, parents of a student from Doon World School produced a 'Fee Card' issued by the school which recorded the monthly charges taken from the child.

As per a complaint registered by the parents of a student from Moravian Institute, the school had been demanding fees from the Class 5 student. Unable to pay the fees, the parents asked the school for the transfer certificate (TC) of their ward. The complaint said that the school refused to issue the TC until the parents cleared the pending dues. The child had been admitted to the school in Class 1 in May 2014.

A hearing was held between both the parties, following which the commission demanded an affidavit from the school stating their version. ""The school granted the TC without charging the parents,"" said Kamal Gupta, spokesperson of the commission.

The commission has also received complaints where private schools refuse to give admission to students under RTE Act. ""We got some complaints from Haridwar where private schools like Shivam Academy English Medium School refused to give admission to students under RTE Act. There have been reports of children being manhandled by teachers or school authorities in Haridwar,"" Gupta said.

Usha Negi said that while the commission is acting upon the grievances that are raised with them, in many cases, parents are too scared to even file a complaint. ""We have got to know that a prominent private school of Dehradun has given special identity cards to students admitted under RTE Act. The card has 'RTE student' written on it and the child is supposed to wear it all the time.

""We will reach out to the high court for the clearance of pending dues by next week. Running schools has become a liability especially in times when the government has failed to clear the bills. Many schools aren't able to pay salaries to their staff,"" Prem Kashyap, president of the association, said.

Approximately Rs 90 crore is to be paid to over 4,000 private schools in the state under RTE. In Dehradun alone, Rs 50 lakh was distributed in July and August while nearly Rs 7 crore is still pending.

The number of students admitted under RTE in unaided schools rose from 80,000 in 2015-16 to 1.7 lakh in 2016-17. But people close to the matter claim that from the current financial year 2018-19, admissions under RTE were restricted.

Under the RTE Act, Centre gives states 65% of the cost of providing free primary education. For north-eastern states, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Uttarakhand, it is 90%. The state government selects students and allots them private schools, where they are granted free admission. The state government reimburses the schools at a fixed rate.

As per the provisions of the RTE Act, the Centre pays to school a monthly fee not exceeding Rs 1,383 and an annual fee of Rs 2,100 for uniform, meal and textbooks per child. Some schools even charge a nominal fee from such students.

""The central government hasn't paid dues pending before 2015-16 which is a burden on the state exchequer,"" Bhupinder Kaur Aulakh, secretary, school education, said.

As per the data available with the school education department, central government paid Rs 39.80 crore against the total expenditure of Rs 49.55 crore for the academic session 2015-16.

In 2016-17, R 81.89 crore was spent on providing education to children from underprivileged families. The Union government didn't provide funds that year, said officials who did not want to be named.

Citing low prevalence rates where girls have completed secondary education, the report by National Commission for Protection of Child Rights and voluntary organisation Young Lives makes a pitch for making secondary level schooling a fundamental right.

Findings show the completion rate of secondary schooling is considerably higher among unmarried girls aged 15-19 years in almost all states. Even National Human Rights Commission secretary general Ambuj Sharma emphasised the need to extend the right to education from Class VIII to the secondary level.

The NHRC is also planning to recommend to the ministry of women and child development a uniform age for marriage for both men and women. In 140 countries, age of marriage is 18 for both men and women. Last month the law commission in a consultative paper on family laws suggested the legal age for marriage for both men and women across religions should be recognised at 18 years, the universal age for majority.

The study based on NFHS-4 data shows that of the 15 to 19 year old girls, who at the time of the survey reported to have been married before the legal age of marriage, 30.8% had never been to a school and 21.09 % had education up to the primary level. The percentage of girls who had secondary education and were married before 18 was 10.2%.

Those with higher levels of education were further down to 2.4%. While overall prevalence of child marriage declined from 26.5% in 2005-06 to 11.9% in 2015-16. Bihar is a case in point. The state recorded a significant decline in child marriages from 47.8% in 2005-06 to 19.7% in 2015-16.

The study also reveals that amongst the married girls aged 15 to 19 years, 31.5% girls were found to be have babies. Almost a quarter of the married girls in the age group of 15 to 16 years had at least one child."

The NHRC has based its recommendation on research that shows a strong correlation between a girl child's education level and age of marriage, with better education levels showing lesser likelihood of her being married early.

A report released by the apex child rights body National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) on Tuesday shows that being out of school at 15 years is a strong predictor of early marriage. The finding is based on analysis of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 4 data (2015-16) for determining prevalence of child marriage among girls in the 15-19 years age group.

NHRC Secretary General Ambuj Sharma, who released the report on Tuesday, said, ""The NHRC had recently formed a core group on child marriage. In our report, we have noted that a necessary step to prevent early marriage is to make education free and compulsory for all children up to the age of 18 years. Accordingly, the Right to Education Act must be amended so that it is applicable up to class 14 instead of class 8 right now.""

The report, 'India child marriage and teenage pregnancy', compiled by NCPCR and the NGO Young Lives India, shows that in almost all states, the completion rate of secondary schooling is significantly higher among unmarried girls in the 15-19 years age group. The report shows that in the 15-19 age group of married girls, 30 per cent have never received any education, 21.9 per cent have got primary education, 10 per cent have secondary schooling while only 2.4 per cent have higher education.

Among states, in Bihar, which has a child marriage prevalence far above the national average, the completion rate of secondary education among girls who married before 18 years is 51 per cent, followed by Delhi and Rajasthan at 54 per cent and 57 per cent, respectively. ""There is a strong correlation between educational attainment of girls and early child marriage. There is also a strong association between parents' low aspirations for child's education and teenage marriage,"" said Renu Singh from Young Lives. The data also showed that 32 per cent of married girls aged 13 to 19 years had their first child when they were still in their teenage. NCPCR Chairperson Stuti Kacker cited the example of Karnataka, which has made child marriage null and void.

The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006 doesn't invalidate child marriage but only gives the contracting parties the option of annulling it within two years of becoming adult or through a guardian in case they are still minors. The WCD ministry's proposal, seeking to make make child marriage 'void ab initio', is pending approval of the Union cabinet for a while now.

Can the RTE achieve its stated goal of providing 'free and compulsory education for all'?

How does one describe a hair oil, which is designed to help hair grow, but after actual use causes the remaining hair to fall? Or, how does one describe a potency drug, which is prescribed to cure impotency but which, when used, makes someone permanently impotent?

There is no single word or phrase, at present, in the English language that can accurately describe such a behaviour or effect - wherein, the result yielded is the exact opposite of the one intended. But thanks to RTE (Right to Education Act), which is having a similar effect of destroying education instead of improving it, we might soon be able to describe all such contrarian effects with a simple phrase - ""doing an RTE!"" For instance, it may be fair to say that ""the hair oil did an RTE on its user"" to indicate that the hair oil caused hair fall instead of hair growth or that the ""potency drug did an RTE on the patient"", to indicate that the potency drug increased impotency instead of curing it.

The present write up, seeks to capture the some of the dangerous implications of RTE and thereby justify the usage of the phrase ""doing an RTE!""

The RTE Act was passed by Parliament in 2009 with the 'intended' objective of providing 'free and compulsory education to all' children between the age of six and 14. Let us evaluate how 'successful' RTE has been in achieving exactly the opposite. Let's look at its impact on a few of the critical parameters:

1. Has RTE Succeeded In Providing ""Free Education For All?""

The answer is a big no.

RTE has neither provided nor will it ever be able to provide ""free education for all"" because it is just not designed to do so. In fact, ""free education for all"", seems more like a homily thrown in to silence any likely opposition, than like a statement of serious intent. Look at the table below:

- At the time of enactment of RTE in 2009-10, around 5.73 crore children were studying in private schools but they were all left in the lurch, with RTE having nothing positive to offer them.

- A huge 13 crore plus children were studying in government schools but surprisingly, RTE offers nothing positive for them too.

So, if RTE totally ignores all the 19 crore (approximately) school-going children, who on earth does it seek to benefit?

- RTE seeks to benefit only a tiny fraction of these 19 crore students, based not on any 'economic' criteria, as is made out to be, but on the criteria of sheer luck (lottery conducted to give RTE admissions) or rampant corruption (rigging of RTE lottery).

- This tiny fraction of students, who are said to be benefitting from RTE is as tiny as 0.31 per cent or just 6.71 lakh students (for the year 2013-14). Sadly, even this number is found to be highly over estimated in several studies.

Another critical question to be asked is - what if most of the beneficiaries, who are now said to be getting the benefit of free education under RTE, would already have been getting the same benefit in government schools under the non-RTE regime?

2. Has RTE Improved The Condition Of The Nearly 12 Crore Students Studying In Government Schools?

The answer again is a resounding no.

- RTE gives the government a great excuse to not do anything significant for the government schools and dangle the carrot of RTE to anyone who complains.

- The government schools will never ever improve and will only continue to further deteriorate as the entire game plan of RTE, seems to be, to systematically destroy the government schools by sequentially pushing more and more students from government schools to private schools.

- Telangana Chief Minister Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao has in fact cited the same reason, on the floor of the state assembly, for not implementing RTE in the state. He termed RTE as a ""durmargamaina chattam"" (a draconian act).

3. If The Government Wants To Shift More And More Children To Private Schools, Has It Enabled A Rapid Expansion Of Private Education Capacity?

The answer, yet again, is no.

Look at the table below, clearly showing the decreasing trend in the number of schools:

- There is hardly any addition to the number of schools in the country. The number of schools, in fact, decreased in 2014 and 15 and increased by only 0.1 per cent in 2015 and 16

- While the number of government schools, as expected, continued to decrease, the rate of growth in private schools also registered a rapid decline from highs of 13.1 per cent in 2011 and 12 to just around 1.2 per cent in 2015 and 16.

Let's look at it realistically - who in the right frame of his/her mind, would want to open a shop (read school) where 25 per cent of the goods (25 per cent seats reserved under RTE) have to be sold at a huge loss - that too in a market where this rule applies only to his/her shop (Hindu-run schools) and not to the shops of others (minority schools)?

4. Has RTE Succeeded In Educating More Children By Bringing More Of Them To Schools?

The answer, once again, is no.

This is the stark reality of RTE - it seems to have 'successfully' managed to reduce the number of school-going children. Look at the trend of enrollment in Classes I to V.

- The number of students in Classes I to V reduced from 13.52 crore in year 2010-11 to 12.91 crore in year 2015-16.

- The number of students in government schools reduced rapidly from 9.41 crore in 2010-11 to 7.81 crore in 2015-16.

- The rate of growth in enrollment in private schools also declined from a high of 9.5 per cent in 2011-12 to just around 1.2 per cent in 2015-16.

The population of India, for sure, has not declined. What then could have led to the reduction in the number of school-going children?

5. Has The Condition Of More Than 7 Crore Children Studying In Private Schools, Improved?

The simple answer is that - it has never been worse!

Ironically, while these 7 crore plus students are totally excluded from benefits of RTE, they are covertly included while sharing the costs of RTE.

- People have been falsely led to believe, by the government and by most prominent RTE activists, that the government reimburses, to the schools, the full amount of fees for the 25 per cent seats allotted under RTE.

- The fact is that the government reimburses only a fraction of this fees and not the full fee charged by the schools. Look at the amounts reimbursed in some states and compare them with the fees charged by private schools in these states:

- The amount of reimbursement varies from a low of Rs 5,400 in UP to a high of Rs 18,311 in Uttarakhand. Sadly, even these amounts are rarely paid on time and some never paid at all.

- Who is to foot the bill for the difference between the amount paid by the government and the actual fee charged by the schools? Who, for instance, is to pay the deficit of Rs 90,000 per RTE seat in a school, that may be charging 1 lakh as its fees but would be getting only Rs 10,000 per seat as the reimbursement?

- This deficit, unfortunately, is being paid by common folks - the worthless ""unreserved"" category - making their children study in private schools.

Hope that the deceit, sham and irony of it all sinks into the peoples' minds - that the government, vide RTE, has fixed, for itself, an MRP (maximum retail price) on school fees when it 'buys' education from the private schools but refuses to similarly fix any MRP for private citizens when they buy the same education from the same set of schools.

It is, perhaps, the only one-of-its-kind case in the entire world where - the citizens subsidise the government instead of the government subsidising the citizens! (Read this article for a more detailed discussion)

6. Has RTE Succeeded, At The Very Least, In Improving The Overall Quality Of Education?

The answer to this too, unfortunately, is no.

Look at the trend of learning outcomes given in the ASER - Annual Survey of Education Report 2016:

- The number of students in Class V who can read a Class 2 level text was already at an abysmal 50.7 per cent in 2010. However, with RTE, instead of improving, it fell further down to 41.6 per cent in 2016.

- Similarly, the number of students in Class VIII who could read a Class II level text fell from 83.5 per cent in 2010 to 73.1 per cent in 2016.

Look at the data on the level of math that the students can do:

Just like in basic reading, a drastic drop can also be seen in the number of students who can do basic division - all thanks to this great panacea for all education ills of India - RTE!

Thus, the summary of this remarkable legislation called RTE, is that:

1. It will never ever succeed in achieving its stated goal of providing 'free and compulsory education for all' because it is just not designed to do so.

2. It completely neglects the nearly 10 crore students studying in government schools and provides the government a great excuse to not do anything much for them.

3. It seeks to push the government school students to private schools but does nothing to increase the private school capacity. On the contrary, RTE does everything to constrict the growth of private schools - leading to a reduction not only in the number of schools but also in the number of school-going students.

4. It seeks to give the benefit of 'free education' to around five to 10 lakh students (most of whom might already have been getting free education in government schools) by making nearly 19 crore other students suffer.

5. Even these five to 10 lakh students don't really benefit because of the drastic drop in the quality of learning and education of all students.

6. It has, additionally, made education so unaffordable for more than 8 crore students studying in private schools that the school fee has now become a top means of birth control and is even leading to suicides of parents and students. (Read for more details)

With 'achievements' as great as the ones listed above, what other than destroying India and its education, can we say, is the objective of RTE?

One can only hope and pray that all the learned souls of India - in the media, in the think-tanks and in the government - see through this charade of RTE and immediately stop RTE from ""doing an RTE"" on India."

The second round was delayed for a few months and was held after getting a nod from Gujarat High Court; 4,642 students were allotted seats. However, of the 4,642, only 2,091 confirmed their admissions. Another 1,810 children were allotted seats after the third round.

When DNA asked state Education Minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama about the same, he said, ""If there are seats vacant as per 25% reservation and there are eligible students, only then we will conduct the fourth round.

Speaking about the academic loss, Manan Choksi, Executive director, Udgam School for Children and President, Association of Progressive Schools, said, ""As per RTE Act, a student needs to attend 200 days of schooling. However, in the present scenario, half of the year has gone. Especially for CBSE schools, where the new session starts in April, RTE children getting admitted in September may face lot of difficulties in coping up. During the pendency of the cases, provisional admission of these children should have been allowed so that their education would not have suffered."""

The Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka said the money should be used by the government for rehabilitation of victims, rebuilding of houses and schools in affected areas.

Shalini Rajneesh, principal secretary, education department, has forwarded a proposal to the chief secretary, seeking approval to open a joint account of the education department and private unaided schools, where schools can deposit the money they raise.

""There are a lot of organizations who have been collecting relief materials and sending them to affected areas. But we don't know if they are reaching the needy.

Despite waiting for many months to start schooling, with pending RTE related cases in high court, all that students were expecting was a fair process after the high court's nod of starting second round of admissions. However, last week, the state government allotted seats to only 4642 students in second round despite over 35000 vacant seats in schools.

The state government this year had almost doubled up the total number of seats for RTE children in the state and had assured smooth admission process. For a total of 112000 seats, the state government had approved 125000 applications. However in the first round, only 80000 seats were allotted out of which nearly 72000 confirmed their admission. The announcement came as a shock to many as state government cited reasons like school preference to be a reason for less seat allotment.

After round 2, Sandeep Munjyasaraa, one of the petitioner in the case wrote to the directorate of primary education demanding clarity on the issue. Speaking with dna, he said, ""Minimum 40,000 students are waiting for admission, how can state only allot 4642 students. Why did they not allow children to make changes in school preference if school the preferred school had gone full in terms of seats? In engineering and medical admissions also, students are given a chance to modify their choices in reshuffling.""

In his letter, Sandeep has stated, ""The second round of admission has been done without application of mind and as a result of it only 4642 children have been given admission out of around 45000 children who were eagerly waiting for the second round admission process. The grave mistake is done by your department and second round of admission has been proceeded without giving any opportunity to the children to modify their choice of schools. You are supposed to provide the opportunity regarding same so that children can modify the same based on the vacancy of the seats available in schools and as a result children maybe successful in getting admission. If the facts and circumstances are other than the mentioned in the complaint, then the same should be communicated in writing within a day of this complaint.""

Further commenting on the issue, Ishu Gupta, a research associate at IIMA's RTE Resource centre said, ""We cannot call it second round and the way it is carried out highlights the intentions of the implementors. This does not give people even a chance to edit their application form, correct theur mistakes and hence it is not a round.""

(File) Register for RTE or face de-recognition: Education departmentState lags in implementing RTE quota: IIM reportRTE quota: 63 pc seats yet to be filled across MMR

The state government has closed the second round of admissions under the Right to Education (RTE) Act quota, absorbing only 4,642 of the 53,480 students (about 9.5 per cent) who were left out in the first round of admission. For the remaining 48,838 children from the economically and socially disadvantaged groups, who have been waiting for four months to start school, the wait only gets longer, even as there is a week's window period for the second round of online admissions to conclude. This comes as most of the non-Gujarat board affiliated schools are wrapping up their first semesters.

In the beginning of this academic session, the state Education Department had announced that 1.20 lakh seats in 9,744 private schools across the state have been set aside for admission of students from economically weaker sections under RTE Act's 25 per cent reservation rule. Of the 1.87 lakh applicants, the government after scrutiny approved 1.25 lakh. The first list of 80,199 students was released on April 19. After the admission of the first list closed on May 30, it was found that 71,520 students had taken admissions.

Now after a gap of four months, the government has released the second list of only 4,642 students. This despite the fact that 48,480 seats are still vacant in private schools across the state. ""The reason for this huge number of seats still lying vacant is that these schools do not fit under the RTE rule of a maximum distance of 6 km. All these seats are either in schools that are beyond 6 km (from the place of residence of the child seeking admissions) or there is no school within 6 km-radius of the applicant,"" Director (Primary Education) M I Joshi, who is heading the RTE admissions, said.

The reason cited for the delay in announcing the second list was the ongoing hearing of a PIL filed in the Gujarat High Court for admission under RTE Act in the minority schools. ""Since the minority schools were denying admission to students under the RTE Act and with the PIL we could not go ahead with admissions till the time there was a decision on these seats allotted to these minority schools,"" Joshi added.

Nearly 600 students were denied admissions by 100 schools that claimed to be 'minority institutions', but did not have a valid certificate from the state government. Granting interim relief to the minority schools till August 13, the High Court on July 30 passed an order, stating that schools lacking minority certificate from competent authority could not deny admission to students under the RTE Act, thus clearing the deck for the Education Department to announce the second round of admissions.

According to the Education Department, they waited till August 13 before announcing the second list. ""As no representation from these minority schools was received by the Department till August 13, we went ahead and announced the second round,"" Joshi said. However, sources said that the minority schools have challenged the High Court ruling in the Supreme Court and had given a letter to the Education Department informing about it on Tuesday.

This year, the Education Department did not accept objections from applicants who claimed to be aggrieved by either incorrect school allotment or by an inadvertent error committed by them at the time of filing online applications. ""We did not allow objections this time as it was a foolproof transparent online admission process. Only a few did not get schools of their choice,"" Joshi said.

This year, in a major decision, the state government raised the income bar for both rural and urban residents under the RTE Act by more than 100 per cent -- from the previous annual family income limit of Rs 47,000 for rural areas it was increased to Rs 1.2 lakh, a hike of more than 2.5 times. Similarly, the limit for urban areas was increased by more than double -- from existing Rs 68,000 to Rs 1.5 lakh per annum.

There had been already two previous revisions pertaining to RTE admissions. As per the rule modified by the Education Department and notified on March 4 last year, if seats remained vacant in private schools after admitting students under the 25 per cent quota seats, children belonging to general category with a family income below Rs 68,000 in urban areas and Rs 47,000 in rural areas will be eligible for admissions in these vacant seats.

The percentage increase from the academic year 2015-16 till 2018-19 has been steadily increasing from a mere 9.96 percent to 21.32 per cent.The officials from the department point fingers at the seats available at private aided schools added under the quota for the first time this year.For the first time, the department of public instruction added 25 percent of the seats available at private aided schools in the state in the present academic year.

""This has been done considering the demand for seats under RTE quota, but after completion of the seat allotment, we realised that many seats were left vacant and when analysed, we realised that there were very few takers for seats offered at private aided schools,"" mentioned a senior official of the department.

""Another reason for increase in vacant seats is that schools are with poor infrastructure. And as per our observation, all parents target getting admissions for their wards in private schools which are popular. Another reason is parents preferring schools offering English medium and affiliated to CBSE/ICSE boards rather than the state board schools,"" an official pointed out."

For RTE's online lottery software, the biggest problems that came to fore were connected with distance mapping. NGO RTE Action Committee has filed a complaint with the education department and is even mulling legal action.

Shahid Sharif, the NGO's founder, said, ""The distance mapping is done through Google maps with the applicant placing the marker balloon at their residence, after which the software calculates the distance to school. But the balloon's placing is not happening properly and causing major chaos during admissions.""

He added that even the Std XI CAP software is facing multiple glitches. ""In the bifocal round itself, which was the first one, names of a few colleges did not reflect in the software's database. Due to this, these colleges lost out in the initial round,"" said Sharif.

An education department employee, however, did not agree with the assessment. ""The balloon placing is done by the applicant and it's working perfectly well.

(File Photo)

Six months after the management of Old Sangvi's National English School told the education department that they had decided to shut down the school due to non-payment of Right to Education (RTE) dues, parents and activists said the management continues to operate on the premises but has not continued RTE quota admissions. Parents and activists have accused the education department of turning a blind eye to the situation.

Activists wrote to Primary Education Director Dinkar Temkar, demanding an inquiry against the school management and also action against local education officer Jyotsna Shinde. In February 2018, parents of RTE quota students had complained to the education department that their children were allegedly not allowed to use the playground or participate in school events. School chairman Dominic Lobo had denied all allegations and had told the primary education department that he was shutting down the school from the next academic year.

But according to parents, Lobo continued to accept fees from students for the next academic year. Parents had complained to the education department, and the Pimpri-Chinchwad education officer was directed to inquire into the matter.

Mukund Kirdat, an AAP activist, said the school is now under a new management, which has kept all the old students except RTE quota ones. ""Without physically inspecting the school, the officer has written that it has shut down and that the RTE students should be placed in other schools. The parents submitted both photo and video proof that the school was running for all old students, except RTE students. Later, we saw boards stating that Priyadarshini Group of Schools had taken over the school, but government officials said they have no record about this. So basically, the old management has handed over the school to a new management and kept all paying students and removed RTE students. How is this legal?"" asked Kirdat.

One of the parents said they have written to the education department demanding to know the current legal status of the school being run on the premises. ""Assuming that the school is shut down, the education department gave our children alternate schools. The school allotted to my child was a semi-government school, where not more than 10 students were studying in Class IV because teaching was not up to the mark. If I wanted to put my child in such a school, why would I take admission in RTE quota? Many of us have taken loans and got our children admitted to private schools. But if the old school is still running, we demand action against them,"" said the parent on condition of anonymity.

Neither Lobo nor Shinde responded to calls or messages. But Jitendra Singh, CEO, Priyadarshini Schools, which has put up a board outside the National School saying it has taken over, said his group had not yet taken over the school.

According to Singh, Lobo approached them in June to take over the school but by then, many students had taken admission elsewhere. ""We ... have not formally taken over the school as the paperwork given by Lobo is not complete. Currently, only one of my administration officials is posted at the school. Until now, it is Lobo who has taken fees from students for this year. The old staff is still teaching there and they are being paid by him,"" he said.

Asked why only fee-paying students were continued and not RTE quota ones, and also if the education department was informed of the takeover, Singh said, ""We have not denied any such parents, maybe they took admissions elsewhere. We are not aware of who the RTE students are ... we agreed to run the school on humanitarian grounds so that students do not have to suffer. But since the paperwork is not done until now, the school is not being run by Priyadarshini Schools. Also, we have not written to the education department since nothing is formalised."""

Justice Sidhharth Mridul directed the Centre to inform the court about the amount it has paid for this year after the Delhi government claimed it has received only Rs 160 crore from the overall corpus of Rs 2,100 crore earmarked by the Centre for improving Delhi government schools.

Appearing for AAP government, standing counsel Ramesh Singh told the court that education directorate is facing problems in providing quality education and proper infrastructure partly because of lack of funds from the Centre even though these funds were approved for release.

The court is hearing a batch of petitions filed by children from various government-run schools complaining about the absence of infrastructure and violation of the Right to Education Act.

Appearing for the students, advocate Khagesh Jha highlighted a CAG report that had found last year that the central government disburses the amount almost at the end of the financial year and then utilisation is delayed by the Delhi government, and as a result, fund for education of the children lapses every year.

Jha also cited an RTI reply that said Centre has only dispatched roughly Rs 160 crore which is even less than 10% of their obligation and for this year the central government's obligation was Rs 2,100 crore, which is statutory requirement for the education of children and implementation of the provisions of Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009.

Students told HC in their plea that some of them are studying in schools that run in two shifts as the building is not able to accommodate children of the locality in one shift due to lack of facilities.

The petitioner students added that parents of most students are uneducated and even illiterate and when they had approached the Delhi government, they had been assured that the government is going to construct 1,200 classrooms and 30 new schools in the current financial year, ""but the process is slow due to non-disbursement of funds by the Centre."""

Incidentally, none of the primary schools, out of over 400 claiming to be of minority status, has got the NOC for exemption under RTE according to the provisions of the National Commission for Minority Education Institution (NCMEI) Act. However, the HC earlier had granted a stay in cases of some of these schools, and the stay will continue till August 13 allowing them time to approach the Supreme Court.

There are 39,914 seats available for RTE admissions in the second round and the state government was not moving ahead with admissions due to the logjam over legalities as over 400 schools claiming minority status refused to grant admission under RTE norms.

A bench of Justice M R Shah and Justice A Y Kogje made it clear that no school can claim minority status without an NOC from a competent authority either of the state or the Centre under the NCMEI Act. The judges upheld arguments by petitioner Sandip Munjyasara that a school does not attain minority status merely by having members of minority communities in trusts of the institutions. With these observations, the judges ordered all schools not having minority status to admit kids under RTE.

The HC ordered for the second round admission on a plea by another petitioner Chandravadan Dhruv.

This issue first reached the high court in May when the education department threatened action against schools run by religious minorities for not admitting poor kids under RTE. These schools had then approached the HC, which had stayed authorities from taking action.

Later, two PILs were filed complaining that denial by these schools to admissions had blocked the second round of admissions under RTE and there were more than 45,000 children from the unprivileged class waiting for admission."

The court also asked the state to ensure that students, who were left out of admission under RTE, are considered. This could pave the way for second round of admission under RTE.

The court's order came in connection with several petitions related to RTE. One involved minority schools moving the court on the grounds that their minority status exempted them from RTE while another petition had sought direction to the state government to begin second round of admission under RTE as over 40,000 students were yet to get admission.

The court, in its order, said article 30 allowed for religious minorities and linguistic minorities to establish minority institution of choice. ""As per an SC ruling they are exempted from RTE but such institutions need to get NOC from the competent authorities. They cannot automatically claim minority status,"" the court observed.

It said that the DEO's order directing the minority schools to admit students under RTE was not illegal and arbitrary.

It also directed the state to ensure that the students who were yet to be admitted under RTE were given admission as per their choice of schools but subject to the 25% limit for each school. The court also asked the government to consider those RTE applications that were rejected on technical grounds.

Meanwhile, some of the schools sought continuation of the interim order -- which prevented the state from carrying out penal action against schools that had refused admission to students under RTE -- so that they can appeal the matter in the Supreme Court. The high court granted them time of a fortnight.

The state had opposed the move on the grounds that over 1,000 children, who were given admission to minority schools, were still waiting to be admitted and they had already lost two precious months and granting a stay would only further the waiting period."

The court while disposing off a public interest litigation (PIL) and a set of special civil applications held that minority schools are however exempted from the 2009 Act, under which private schools have to keep 25 per cent of seats for children from ""disadvantaged and weaker sections"".

The Division Bench of Justice M R Shah and Justice A Y Kogje pronounced the judgment on a set of petitions moved by over 170 schools, run by minority trusts, including Mar Gregorious Othodox Syrian Church, Vadodara; Ayyappa Education Centre, Vadodara; Rajkot Kelavani Samaj, among others.

During the hearing, the state government had submitted that petitioner schools don't have certificates of minority primary schools. The state's contention was that trusts of these schools have acquired minority status for secondary and higher secondary schools, but not for primary schools. It said that the competent authority never granted minority status to the primary schools.

The state submitted that only those schools are exempted from the RTE Act that have minority school certificates. In its affidavits, the state said that communication issued from the Director of Primary Education specifically stated that ""any school which is claiming to have status of minority is required to produce a valid certificate of status of minority qua primary section issued by the office of Director of Primary Education...under the provisions of The National Commission for Minority Educational Institution"".

The schools have decided to challenge the High Court order in Supreme Court.

This year, the percentage of vacant seats under the RTE quota in both aided and unaided schools has increased compared to the previous year.

Seats up

Officials attribute this to an increase in the number of seats, and the fact that very few parents choose to admit their children under RTE quota in aided schools as the medium of instruction in primary classes is in Kannada.

This year, 21.32% of the total 1.52 lakh seats are vacant, a marked increase from the 2017-18 academic year where only 15.2% of the total 1.28 lakh seats were vacant.

The number of vacant seats has increased from 19,647 last year to 32,440 this year. Statistics provided by the department show that 73% of the total 14,281 seats under the RTE quota in aided schools were vacant, while for unaided schools 15% of the 1.37 lakh seats were not filled.

Earlier only unaided schools had to reserve at least 25% of their seats to students belonging to weaker and disadvantaged sections in the neighbourhood. According Section 12 (1) (b) of the RTE Act, aided schools have to provide free and compulsory elementary education to the children admitted based on the annual recurring aid or grants, subject to a minimum of 25%.

""All parents want their children to study in English medium. So even if they do not have to pay for education in an aided school, they prefer to pay by taking a loan and admit their child in an unaided school that imparts English-medium education,"" an official said.

Sources in the department also pointed out that although 1.43 lakh seats were allotted in three rounds under the RTE quota, there were no takers for 24,599 seats that were allotted.

Parents more aware

Nagasimha G. Rao, convener of the RTE task force, said the awareness among parents had increased prompting them to avoid admitting their children in schools that do not have adequate infrastructure or good teachers.

""As a result, although they have been allotted seats, they do not admit their children in these schools,"" he said."

On the issue of RTE, the participants collectively blamed corporate colleges, which they said were conniving with private schools to stall its implementation for fear of it reducing their probability of getting more ranks in competitive exams. Advocate Yogesh Tandava, who filed a PIL in the Hyderabad high court over the non-implementation of RTE in the two Telugu states, said that enforcing RTE would make the state better as it would promote communal harmony and social integration.

""This is not just about admitting economically backward children into private schools.

Not implementing it is not just affecting poor people, but also students from middle and rich classes who are being deprived of the opportunity of studying in an inclusive environment,"" said Tandava, adding that there is no question of private schools running into losses because of RTE as education is meant to be a non-profitable profession.

Pointing out how just about 10% of schools in the state, who collects lakhs of rupees in fees, are against RTE, the participants said it is time the government makes private schools redundant.

As per the schedule, parents had time till June 30 to complete the admission process but out of the 2,382 allotted seats, only 737 have been confirmed.

The question arose when one of the petitioners, Sandip Munjyasara, submitted that none of the schools, claiming to be run by minority institutions, have the certificate showing their minority status, which is required to be obtained from either the director of primary education or the National Commission for Minority Education Institutions (NCMEI). There is a provision under the NCMEI Act that the minority run education institute must obtain certificate of its status.

Earlier, a single-judge bench has stayed the state government to take any action against nearly 400 schools for denying RTE admissions on their claims to be minority institutions.

In reply, the advocates representing schools submitted that the trusts running the schools were formed by people from minority communities. They are not required to obtain any certificate in this regard.

The petitioner stated that if the government had granted funds in time, parents would not have faced harassment. If schools are demanding money, they are liable for action, according to the petitioner."

The Lok Sabha on Saturday, passed an amendment to the Right to Education Act, revoking the no-detention policy. It is likely that given the support across parties, it will pass through the Rajya Sabha too. Even so, it is necessary to continue this conversation and inform both the public and policy-makers about the potential damage of this reversal.

Section 16 of the RTE Act that earlier prohibited from holding back a child in any class cannot be read in isolation, and no detention did not ever mean no assessment. Section 16 should have been read in conjunction with Section 29 that talks about Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation and ""making the child free of fear, trauma and anxiety"".

The revised Section 16 has the provision for having examinations in classes 5 and 8, and sub-section 3 also allows ""schools to hold back a child... if he fails in the re-examination"". Going by ASER data, roughly half of the children in classes 5 and 8 are a few classes lower in terms of learning outcomes than the class they study in, and hence, would fail their exams. Re-examination is an important element of the amendment. The additional instruction will have some associated costs too - it may require additional training, special curricula, and if regular teachers are not available during the two-month window, some honorarium for part-time or volunteer teachers may need to disbursed. Additional remedial interventions like these can cost Rs 800 - 1,000 per child, but even the most cost-efficient program will have an average cost of Rs 2501. Assuming 30 per cent of children in classes 5 and 8 fail their first attempt and have to undergo the additional instruction. This would translate to 61 lakh children in rural government schools, and the cost of providing such programs would be Rs 150 crore.

Now, this does not seem much given the scale of the public education system in India. But while some children may pass this re-examination and some may drop-out, others will repeat the same class. Let us say 25 per cent of the 61 lakh children have to repeat a year. Assuming an average expenditure of Rs 12,700 per child, this would mean an additional financial burden of over Rs 1,900 crore. To put this in perspective, this equates to 8 per cent of the Rs 26,129 crore Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) budget for 2018-19.

The question is wouldn't it be better to invest in Early Childhood Development (more Anganwadis, better training) to ensure that children have the right start before class 1?"

He said what was happening was that a child would score zero in a subject but he would still be promoted. ""As long as he made it to the next class, there was no fear of lagging behind literally even if he was lagging behind in his studies,""said the teacher.

Sukhdev Patel, who has worked on RTE since it was first conceptualised, said the 'detention' policy being proposed shows that the Indian psyche can't think beyond exams. ""I am not against evaluating children. Let there be exams in secondary and higher secondary schools. World over, children in primary schools are evaluated and when found lacking, the teachers work on their weaknesses. It is only in India that we are obsessed with 'failing' a student,"" said Patel.

He said the argument that students do not take studies seriously if there are no exams is rubbish. ""It is nothing but an excuse for the state government and teachers to hide their failure. Everyone is talking of how the no detention policy was affecting education but no one is breathing a word about an earlier amendment that talked of comprehensive and continuous evaluation,"" said Patel. He said the evaluation was meant to address the deficiencies of no detention policy. ""But the state government did not bother to implement continuous and comprehensive evaluation,"" said Patel.

He said the statements by the education minister that the no detention was affecting the education outcomes in Gujarat was nothing but an excuse.

With the Lok Sabha passing the amendment to the Right to Education Act (2009), the Delhi government has decided to do away with the ""No Detention Policy"". With the amendment, states can scrap the policy wherein children, from classes III to VIII, were not detained even if they failed the examination.

""It is yet to be passed in the Rajya Sabha, so we are waiting for it. Once it is passed, we will be working to bring back detention,"" said Atishi Marlena, former advisor to Education Minister Manish Sisodia.

From the very beginning, when the proposal for the amendment was moved by the Ministry of Human Resource and Development (MHRD), Sisodia has voiced support to scrap the policy.

The government justified the stand, stating that no detention policy leads to children being promoted without learning, and that scrapping the policy would lead to improved learning levels.

According to a source, the government will work to bring back detention from the next academic session, and consult parents and teachers on the same.

Sisodia has also been in favour of scrapping the policy as he received complaints from teachers about its negative impact on learning, said the source.

""It's a good thing that the amendment to the RTE Act has been passed. As children could not be detained, parents and children did not take the process seriously, thinking they will be promoted anyway. Now, the process is going to get better,"" said Sapna Singh, a government school teacher.

However, experts argued against the removal of the policy, claiming that it would lead to an increase in the number of dropouts.

""It is the poor quality of education, lack of infrastructure, teacher vacancies and the presence of untrained teachers that may have an effect on learning outcomes. The no detention clause, one of the most critical parts of the RTE Act that has been pulled out, has put the entire RTE Act at risk of disintegration. The greatest negative impact will be on disadvantaged groups, first generation learners and Adivasi students, as well as girls,"" said Ambarish Rai, national convenor, Right to Education Forum."

""It is a broken education system. We have to rebuild our education system,"" he added.

Under the current provisions of the RTE Act, no student can be detained till Class VIII and all students are promoted to the next grade.

The minister said that in some of the states like Sikkim , Kerala and Telangana, the students, who were studying in private schools, have come back to government schools.

""Teacher training, quality and accountability are most important,"" Javadekar said.

Stating that there was no shortages of teachers, the minister, however, added that the deployment of teachers was not right.

While moving the bill in the Lok Sabha, the minister said, ""It is a very important legislation and a majority of state governments supported this Centre's proposal. It brings accountability in our elementary education system.""

Referring to the no-detention policy in the Act, the minister said ""schools have become only schools for mid-day meal as education and learning are missing"".

This bill has also been analysed by the standing committee and the panel also recommended bringing back the concept of detention in schools, the minister added.

The policy had been brought as it was felt that compelling children to repeat a class was demotivating, often forcing them to abandon school, he said.

This bill provides for a regular examination in Classes V and VIII and if the child fails, he or she shall be given additional opportunity for re-examination in two months' time, Javadekar said.

Speaking on the bill, Congress MP KC Venugopal said that the proposed legislation lacks ""clarity"".

""This bill needs clarity. It should be clarified that whether the Centre or the states will conduct the exams,"" Venugopal said.

He also demanded a hike in the allocation for Centre's flagship programme Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan.

Echoing similar sentiments, BJD MP Bhartruhari Mahtab said the government should form uniform guidelines for conducting exams and leave it to the state on how the exams should be conducted.

Arvind Sawant of Shiv Sena and Saugat Roy of the TMC also lent support to the bill.

Sawant asked the government to focus on primary education.

Roy praised Javadekar for his ""non-confrontationist"" approach as he supported the bill.

Children often do not study if there are no exams, he said, adding that education system is currently in a bad shape and learning outcomes were going down due to non-detention policy.

""The education system is like an inverted pyramid and adequate focus has not been given to primary education,"" he said.

Supriya Sule of NCP also supported the bill and said introduction of exams was necessary.

Prem Singh Chandumajra of Akali Dal and Sanjay Jaiswal of BJP also spoke in support of the Bill.

Several members demanded that teachers should also be made accountable for learning outcomes.

The amendment allows states to hold a regular examination at the end of Classes 5 and 8. According to the amendment bill, a child who fails in the examination held after Classes 5 and 8 will be given additional instruction and the opportunity to appear for a re-examination.

This examination must be held within a period of two months from the date of the declaration of the result. If the child still does not pass the exam, the state government may decide to detain them. However, no child can be expelled from school before they complete elementary education, the amendment bill states.

The proposed amendment was introduced in August last year and referred to a Standing Committee of the Rajya Sabha. The committee submitted its report to both the Houses of Parliament in February, endorsing the amendment bill ""in its present form"".

The no-detention policy of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, banned the practice of making under-performing children repeat classes in elementary school - Classes 1 to 8 - to ensure they do not drop out of school. It was meant to reduce the emphasis on year-end examinations and replace it with a form of evaluation that would track students' progress through the year.

However, the present government feels that the lack of ""pass-fail"" system has led to deterioration in quality of learning in schools as evident in the poor results of the National Assessment Survey carried out by the Union Human Resources Development Ministry and NCERT."

States in turn are to reimburse a certain amount of money for every RTE admission.

However, it turns out that the Maharashtra government is looking around for ways to not pay these schools the money it owes them.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Maharashtra, led by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, can claim credit for many successes, especially with the irrigation project Jalyukt Shivar and an impressive infrastructure upgrade topping the list. However, its record on one front has been abysmal, i.e., in fulfilling its responsibility under the Right to Education (RTE) Act.

According to Section 12 of the RTE, non-minority unaided private schools are required to reserve 25 per cent of the seats in entry-level classes (either primary level or Class 1) for students belonging to disadvantaged groups (DGs) [Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), etc] and economically weaker sections (EWS) [income less than a certain amount]. The state in return is supposed to pay these schools, for every RTE admission, an amount fixed by the government or the tuition fee of a school, whichever is less. Maharashtra has fixed an amount of Rs 17,000 a year for RTE students.

But it goes to great lengths to avoid reimbursing this amount to schools. Though the schools have been reserving seats under RTE since 2012, the government tried to get out of its commitment by simply agreeing to pay dues for only one academic year. Then, there was disagreement over the actual amount due and how it should be calculated. The government said it owed Rs 300 crore while the schools said the amount was more than 1,000 crore.

This mismatch in estimates came about because the government wanted to pay only for fresh RTE admissions while the schools were asking to be compensated for all RTE admissions (new and repeat/old students - explained in detail here).

Even to date, the dues of past academic years have not been fully released to all the private schools. Now, the Maharashtra government has come up with a new plan to avoid paying the money it owes to these institutions. In a government resolution released recently, it has modified the norms for RTE reimbursement stating that ""if a private school is using any government land and benefiting from the same then the school would not receive reimbursement for students who have been admitted in 25 per cent RTE quota,"" Mumbai Mirror reported.

Through this order, the government has effectively imposed a retrospective binding of sorts in an agreement that is in force for years and it has done so in a one-sided manner. This is a textbook definition of ""breach of contract"". When the government leased out land, it didn't impose a condition that schools will have to reserve 25 per cent seats for EWS/DG category students. Nor does the RTE Act mandate that those schools that have received land from the government at concessional rates will not be compensated for fulfilling the RTE quota. Hence, both from the RTE Act and the leasing agreement, the government's action is prima facie illegal. Less said about the ethical aspect of its action, the better.

Independent English Schools Association (IESA) secretary Rajendra Singh told Swarajya that ""the government's action is not just illogical but outright illegal. The RTE and land leasing are two separate contracts. In any case, under the RTE Act, the government gives reimbursement for only tuition fees and not for infrastructure costs the school has to bear. Land comes under the latter category. How can the two be clubbed? If the government was paying per student reimbursement for infrastructure costs also, then they had a case. In such a scenario, they could have deducted this from total reimbursement, but how can they not reimburse the tuition fees?""

Singh further explained that the government simply ""doesn't have the data to ascertain how many schools have the land leasing agreement with the government. Nor it has the manpower to determine this number. It will take anywhere between one to two years to collect the data. This is nothing but their latest attempt to delay payments to private schools."""

Parents allege that it has been done to discourage poor families who want good education for their children. ""Not just the forms, even the guidelines and admission notice were printed in English.

Right To Education (RTE) helpline was launched recently by the Social Welfare Department of Karnataka, which allows one to lodge complaints and get information on the Act. The Executive Director of the Child Rights Trust, Vasudeva Sharma, spoke to RadioActive about how the helpline could be used effectively.

Vasudeva Sharma explained that the RTE Act had been introduced way back in 2009 in Karnataka, and a lot of calls used to be received by the Child Rights Trust members on their personal numbers seeking clarifications. Even though there were no instructions available regarding RTE at that time, they used to clarify or give information in a comprehensible way. Of late, the calls had been about more specific and less common information.

He said they had attempted to set up a hotline back then, which failed because their personal numbers were still popular. The new helpline would have to have employees well-versed in the intricacies of RTE - the national Act as well as the rules for Karnataka and section (12)(1)(C), because (12)(1)(C) was often misused.

He spoke about the dangers of (12)(1)(C) being misused and despite it having popular aspects like forbidding corporal punishment, or stating the kinds of facilities an institution must have, how that could cause people to lose trust in it. It gave the impression that (12)(1)(C) was introduced as an attempt to control private institutions, as the condition laid down for availing this provision spoke only of what was expected of the institutions without placing any responsibility on the government. With the rampant misuse of this section, private institutions became richer but could not be brought under the control - and that such situations would lead to mistrust in the RTE Act itself.

Vasudeva Sharma said that he used to find a lot of children in government schools, but of late the number had been dwindling because they had moved to private schools. However, over time, parents were faced with demands for multiple additional payments. This at times forced the children back into government schools, and other times, they continued education there despite the heavy expenditure.

He also proposed some solutions:

On the move to make 8th standard the equivalent of 10th standard, Vasudeva Sharma said that though there had been discussions, the Central Government was yet to make a decision. He opined that it could not be taken without thorough discussions and analysis but was apprehensive about the imbalance a positive answer would create.

Vasudeva Sharma said that ignorance among activists and officials will deprive the children of the rights extended to them by the government. He suggested that guidelines be prepared wherein the responsibilities of each official is clearly mentioned and that such clarity would enable effective implementation of the Act.

He added that ignorance causes lack of coordination between the concerned departments and organisations, which could lead to failure of the programme."

""The data so collected will not be shared or retained at the school/zonal/district level for personal or any other use and it will be collected in strict compliance with guidelines,"" the reply read.

On Tuesday, the court was informed that on November 27, a circular was issued by the Directorate of Education (DoE) where it is specifically mentioned that, ""except DoE, no outside agency' has been hired or engaged for data collection or verification"".

Members of the southern unit of Right to Education (RTE) Forum have urged the government to withdraw the Bill tabled in Parliament seeking amendment to Section 16 of the RTE Act which aims at bringing back the detention policy in school education system.

In a resolution unanimously adopted at the first southern regional consultation on RTE, organised by the National RTE Forum and facilitated by Save the Children in Vijayawada, they alleged that it was an attempt to dilute the most progressive section of the Act through 'backdoor' methods. ""This is an ill-conceived move aimed at victimising children from the marginalised communities such as Dalits, adivasis, the urban poor, persons with disabilities and other disadvantaged sections. We strongly demand that the government drop this Bill and create an enabling condition in the classroom,"" said Ambarish Rai, convener, National RTE Forum.

The resolution demanded that the Centre allocate 6 % of the GDP and the State Governments 25 % of their respective budgets to ensure care, protection and equal right to quality education for all children.

The members said they would urge political parties to include 'right to equitable quality education for all children' in their political agenda in the 2019 elections.

Constitution of School Management Committees/School Development and Monitoring Committees in all schools to ensure effective implementation of the RtE Act, establishment of government-funded neighbourhood schools and ultimately move towards Common School System and to strengthen grievance redressal mechanism were among the other demands.

The resolution also called for effective measures to make all schools RTE-compliant, steps to stop closure of government schools in the name of rationalisation, put an end to privatisation and commercialisation of education, imparting adequate training on teachers to make the classroom space more interesting, timely supply of textbooks, uniforms and other learning equipment to students and improvement of infrastructure facilities in schools.

Lakshmi works as a domestic help with a few families in Bengaluru. Her daughter during the academic year 2018-2019 had been admitted to LKG in a private school through the Right to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act 2009, section 12(1)(c). The Act promises 25 percent reservation in private unaided schools for weaker sections and disadvantaged groups.

Lakshmi chose to avail this choice as she felt that in government schools, children are left to themselves and aren't provided adequate attention. She says that she wants to educate her daughter, and felt private school was the best option.

There are several other parents from marginalised groups who would like to avail free education in private unaided schools, during the academic year 2019-2020. But that might not be a possibility if proposed amendments to the RTE rules, for which the cabinet has given the nod, come through. The proposed amendment gives government schools the priority, and the choice of availing admission in a private unaided school will be applicable only if there are no government schools in the neighbourhood. The Minister for Law and Parliamentary affairs Krishna Byregowda in his brief to the media said that preference to private schools has resulted in the government schools having fewer enrollments.

""If parents want to send their children to government schools, they will. Why is the government forcing this upon parents ?"" asks B N Yogananda (General Secretary, RTE Students and Parents Association). He says the private school lobby who don't want children from disadvantaged communities to study in their schools, are pushing for this. While there has been the mention of following the Kerala model with these proposed amendments, Yoganand says that the governments schools in Karnataka aren't at the same level compared to Kerala, and parents in Karnataka aren't willing to send their children to government schools.

In terms of next steps, the association plans to meet the Principal Secretary (Primary and Secondary Education) and demand that the proposed amendments be withdrawn. If not they plan on staging wide protests, and as a last resort would file a petition in the court.

G Nagasimha Rao ( Director, Child Rights Trust ) and convener of the RTE Task Force highlighted the lack of consultations in the process od changing rules. He says that after the RTE rules have not been reviewed even once after being notified in 2012, and amendments were directly called for. The RTE Task Force in their letter to the Principal Secretary, demands that the plan for the proposed amendments be halted; and recommends consulting civil society organisations working in the field of education, concerned parents and children while formulating recommendation to amend RTE rules. The RTE task force too plans on holding protests if the governments goes ahead with the proposed amendments.

This is not the first time that there have been proposals to amend the RTE rules in Karnataka. In January 2018 similar amendment to the rules were proposed by the Education Department but were rejected after coming under severe opposition.

What the government is proposing isn't something outside the law, says Niranjan Aradhya (Centre for Child and Law, NLSIU). He says that section 3 of the RTE Act provides fundamental right to free and compulsory education in the neighborhood school, and there is nothing wrong if the state decides to admit children in a government school available in the neighbourhood.

He adds that other options - aided and unaided schools come in when there are no government schools in the neighbourhood. As a member of the committee by Karnataka Development Authority working to strengthen government schools, Niranjan opines that section 3 of the act must be implemented in letter and spirit and several concrete steps are to be taken in order to strengthen state government schools so that they are on par with central government schools.

The average RTE reimbursement for a child stood at Rs 6871 during the year 2017, compared to the maximum ceiling of Rs 11,848 (cost per child in government schools). This indicates that a large section of the private unaided schools charge a low fee, and come under the low fee paying category schools (LFP). While there are several private schools that provide quality education, the same can't be said about LFPs. Research has pointed to how they even fall short in providing English education, which is one of the reasons parents from marginalised groups are attracted to them in the first place. ""LFP schools can't be thought of as an alternative to government schools "" says Rishikesh Shanker, Associate Professor, Azim Premji University, who advocates for the strengthening of the public education system.

Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh had previously attempted to modify the RTE rules along the same lines that the Education Department of Karnataka has proposed. In a notification by the Department of Elementary Education (Government of Himachal Pradesh) dated June 6th, 2015, guidelines were provided for admission and reimbursement of children under section 12 of the RTE Act.

Under these guidelines the government schools and private unaided schools in the neighborhood would initiate the process of 25 percent reservation in private unaided schools only if the minimum number of students (25) have been filled in the entry standard of the government school. This notification was challenged in the High court in Smt Namikta vs State of HP and others. The grievance of the petitioner was that the notification is contrary to the provisions of section 12(1)(c) of RTE Act which doesn't contain any inhibition and therefore restricts the scope of the Act.

The High Court struck down the notification stating that the notification creates a hierarchy in availing the benefits under section 12(1)(c), and is being read in a contrary manner where importing"" an obligation to admit students from the weaker section and disadvantaged groups only where seats are not available in the state run schools and aided institutions would be to defeat the object of the provisions."" The court concluded that there is no hierarchy in the parent Act and therefore the state government is in violation of the provision of the Act.

A petition regarding similar concerns was raised in the Allahabad High Court in Ajay Kumar Patel vs State of UP where the court stated that a policy of hierarchy can't be laid down by the government as it is contrary to the Parliamentary Act.

While the proposed amendment in RTE act is not supported by parents, the idea of prioritising the government schools may not be bad, after all. The parents and several civil society organisations opposing the amendment think that the condition of government schools in Karnataka is abysmal, including the poor learning levels of students. However, available research shows that there is no difference in learning levels between both groups of students.

A study by Azim Premji Foundation between 2008 and 2013 conducted in Andhra Pradesh examines the difference in learning levels of students (randomly selected from government schools) who were provided a scholarship and attended private schools, and students who didn't receive the scholarship and continued attending government schools.

The private schools who were part of the study had to admit a maximum of 25 percent students from disadvantaged groups, in line with the current 25 percent quota under the RTE. The students were tested at the end of every year for five years on their learning outcomes in Telugu, Mathematics, English and EVS.

The results showed that there was no difference between the learning levels of the different groups of students, and that private schools didn't add any value to the learning levels of the students from disadvantaged groups who had hitherto been in government schools and had joined them. The author of the paper notes that worldwide research is divided on student achievements after obtaining choice to study in private schools, and currently there is no consensus on this matter."

They aren't sure if the authorities would do all that is needed to enhance the quality of government schools and bring them on a par with private ones.

Notably, Section 3 of the Act, which is considered the core of the legislation, provides children the fundamental right to free and compulsory education in a neighbourhood school.

According to the proposal, if there's a government school in neighbourhood of a child -- within 1km for primary education and 3km for higher primary -- he/she should get admitted to that instead of a private school.

Nagasimha G Rao, state convener of the RTE task force, said, ""The government is citing the example of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where government schools are in high demand. We're in touch with RTE activists there too. But the Karnataka scenario is different. Parents prefer English medium schools over government institutions.""

Mohammed Yousuf, a Marappa Garden resident and parent of a child who's an RTE beneficiary, said, ""I don't think government schools are up to the mark. They don't have good English teachers and lack infrastructure. Moreover, the nearest government school in our area is located on defence land, can be accessed by every passerby and has a dumpsite too. My son will not be safe.""

It is sad that students are still made to pay fees at private schools despite being admitted under RTE.

Niranjan Aradhya, senior fellow and programme head, Universalisation of Equitable Quality Education Programme, Centre for Child and the Law, NLSIU, said: ""This is a chance for government schools to improve. The government just needs to do a few basic things like recruit more English teachers and upgrade schools to the level of Kendriya Vidyalayas. To make RTE effective, they need to implement section 12(2) of the RTE Act which mandates private unaided schools receiving government largesse to reserve seats for weaker sections from their neighbourhood without the state having the obligation to reimburse them.

The State Cabinet's nod to amend the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act quota rules has come as a blow to families from lower socio-economic backgrounds.

Many parents have decided to protest the Cabinet's decision which stated that children from weaker sections and disadvantaged communities can get admission in private schools under the RTE quota only if there are no government schools in their neighbourhood.

A majority of neighbourhoods already have a government school. In other words, the probability of getting children admitted into private schools is almost nil.

The Department of Primary and Secondary Education is planning to amend three clauses under the Karnataka Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2012.

However, experts point out that amending the State rules alone is not adequate as the RTE Act mandates that 25% of the seats in private schools are reserved from children from weaker sections and disadvantaged communities.

The Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, which is supposed to be the monitoring body for all aspects concerning the RTE Act, was reportedly not consulted.

Shruthi R., who is hoping her son gets a seat under the RTE quota in a private school for 2019-2020, said: ""I live in the Kamakshipalya ward and there is a government school in the ward. But I do not want to send my child there. The government is denying our right to free English-medium education.""

Many parent support groups have decided to challenge this move legally. B.N. Yogananda, general secretary of RTE Students and Parents' Association, said that they had written to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights asking of legal possibilities to challenge this move.

""The State government is doing this to appease the private management lobby. This is against the interest of lakhs of parents and children,"" he said.

Nagasimha G. Rao, convener of the RTE task force, said that the State government had taken up a drastic step without consulting different stakeholders.

""The government is saying they will follow the Kerala model, but the quality of education imparted in government schools here cannot be compared to that of Kerala's,"" he said.

For admissions under the RTE quota, a 'neighbourhood' is considered as a revenue village in rural areas, a ward within city corporation limits, and the entire jurisdiction for urban local bodies."

Briefing the reporters, Parliamentary affairs minister Krishna Byre Gowda said, under the proposed change, the child would be eligible for a RTE fee reimbursement from a private school only if there is no government school within the 5 kms radius or if he failed to get a seat in the government school.

The minister justifying the changes has said, we need to improve the student enrolment in government schools as we are neglecting it, added that priority should be given to improve standard of education in government schools."

Now, children seeking admission in private schools under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act quota will get the seat only if there are no government schools in their neighbourhood. The State Cabinet on Wednesday granted permission to amend certain rules related to admission procedures under the RTE Act which will now give priority to government schools over the private ones in admissions.

The RTE Act provides for reservation of 25% of seats for students of weaker sections and disadvantaged communities in private schools. But the State Cabinet on Tuesday decided to amend the rules to add a rider that such children would get admission under the RTE Act in private schools only if there are no government schools in their neighbourhood.

Briefing reporters after the Cabinet meeting, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Krishna Byre Gowda said the preference being given to private schools under the RTE Act had resulted in fewer enrolments in government schools.

Stressing the need for giving importance to government schools, he said the original spirit of the Act was to provide admission in private schools in areas where there were no government schools.

The government would notify private schools for admission under the Act in the areas where there are no government schools, he said."

Emulating models of neighbouring states like Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the state government plans to amend the Act allowing parents to enrol children in private schools only if there are no government schools in the vicinity. The Act defines vicinity as a radius of 1km.

Briefing mediapersons after the cabinet meeting, state minister for law Krishna Byregowda said: ""The primary intention of RTE is to provide education to all class of students. For students from BPL families it is free of cost. Till date, Karnataka had allowed parents to admit children in private schools despite having government schools in the same neighbourhood. This has resulted in the enrolment ratio dropping drastically. We have decided to amend the RTE Act allowing parents to admit children in a private school only if there are no government schools in the vicinity.""

States like Kerala and Tamil Nadu already have such a law in place and it is said to have yielded positive results in terms of the number of students enroling in government schools.

The move to reduce admissions in private schools under RTE was first initiated in 2017 when then education minister Tanveer Sait had said the cost of educating children in private schools was a huge burden on the exchequer.

""In the past five years (2013-2017), the Karnataka government has spent over Rs 800 crore to educate children in private schools,"" Sait had said. ""It means we have lost so many students to private schools, who otherwise would have studied in our schools. We want to promote government schools."""

As things stand, as many as 51,849 seats are yet to be filled despite the long-drawn process.

Activists have pointed out that lack of awareness among parents belonging to the disadvantaged category, lack of a competent grievance redressal cell, and an arduous process of obtaining eligibility documents are some of the reasons for not achieving the 100% admission target.

Komalbai, who works as a maid in Pashan has two of her children living in the city. ""I don't know anything about RTE. My elder daughter is in class I and my son in KG. When I tried to admit my son to an aided school, but they refused admission. So I have admitted him in a Zilla Parishad school.""

While lack of awareness is one issue, another problem is that the migrant population may not have required documents. ""We have a voter ID and Aadhaar card but we don't have the income certificate. The agent asked for a lot of money for it. Hence, we just left it at that,"" said Komalbai.

Matin Mujawar of Shikshan Hakka Manch said, ""Awareness is the first step. The government needs to conduct massive awareness programmes about the RTE Act in slums and other areas. The polio drive is a success because of the massive awareness campaign. On similar lines, there should be an awareness drive about RTE Act so that everybody knows what needs to be done so that their children can get admission.""

Grievance redressal is another major problem that is hampering even NGOs and other activists working to help disadvantaged students get admission. The education department had announced a grievance redressal department with a helpline number. However, none of it was implemented.

""Currently, just one person talks to people with grievances. When a parent complains, this person would tell them to go to the school. Why would the school entertain the parents? Even letters from the education officer were hardly of any use because there were no follow ups,"" said Mukund Kirdat, an education activist.

Education commissioner Vishal Solanki said, ""We are working on various aspects of RTE admission. We would improve the present system from next year onward."""

The directions state that schools present on government land and give admissions to students under the RTE's 25 per cent quota have to do so for free without charging them any fees, and nor can they claim reimbursements for this from the government,"" a high-ranking official from the BMC's education department said."

She was talking to The Hindu on the sidelines of a workshop on inclusive education at the State Council of Educational Research and Training here recently. Ms. Julka said talks had been held with the Ministry of Social Justice on amending the RTE Act, as special schools had been made a legislative option for students under the Rights of Persons With Disabilities (RPWD) Act, 2016. The RPWD Act, she said, promoted inclusive education and gave a child the option of studying in regular or special schools or have home-based education. Inclusion, she said, did not mean in the physical sense alone. It meant that the education system had to accommodate the requirements of a child rather than child having to fit the system.

Therefore, if a neighbourhood school was not ready to accept a child with high-support needs or its teachers were not equipped enough for that or parents felt that their children needed full-day attention or had many learning gaps, then special schools were an option in the initial years before shifting them to regular schools.

Home-based education should be the last resort, and was preferable only for children with profound disabilities, Ms. Julka said.

Inclusion, in an optimal sense, would mean providing all support in school, but it was difficult in the country. So, if at all a child was attending a special school, it should be only till the child caught up, she said. However, even if special schools were to be treated as resource centres for inclusion, it would not work till they were brought under a single umbrella, she said. Taking parents' choice into consideration was also important.

Attitude changes were possible only if everyone worked together. The earlier differently abled children went to regular school, the more they would be be accepted by other students and teachers."

They feel the private ones are more conducive and safer, found a recent study 'Adversarial Parental Perceptions About Government Schools in Ahmedabad'. The study was conducted by Right To Education Resource Centre (RTERC) of Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIMA).

Many parents have a poor impression about the government schools because they've had bad experiences, RTERC researchers said. However, their opinion slightly changed after they visited several government schools.

The study, supported by UNICEF was conducted by professor Ankur Sarin of IIMA and a research associate Nisha Warnekar found flaws with issues such as lack of teachers, non-teaching staff loaded with too much work, principals and administrators lacking authority over teachers, among others. The findings come at a crucial time when around 40,000 seats under the RTE Act remain vacant this year.

""We interviewed several parents belonging to a particular geographical area comprising 34 schools. We wanted to compare their responses. We investigated the extent of information asymmetry amongst the households on the lines of parental perceptions. Our researchers also visited ten schools,"" professor Sarin's team said.

The parents feel that schools should have CCTV cameras, students should have uniforms, identity cards, and regular parent-teacher meets.

The parents suggested that government schools usually were large open spaces where anyone could walk in because the gates are always open. On the contrary, the private schools are ""bandh killas"" or fortresses.

For this reason, parents said, their wards often leave the premises during school hours.

In contrast, the parents whose wards made it to the private ones feel the gates are locked and the students can't leave the premises during school hours.

Many government schools are cleaner and more spacious than the private ones. Some say many have walls that are nicely done or boards displaying letters and numbers in different languages, maps and prayers. The infrastructure in these schools are also better and focus on extracurricular activities.

However, many parents cited the new focus of government schools on extracurricular activity and participation in competitions as being a waste of time.

""Private schools, in contrast, were incredibly cramped with almost 60- 65 students sitting on benches, which is double its capacity. Another private school was located in the middle of a marketplace and reels under tremendous noise. To solve this, the authorities have put up boards on the windows. This has made the classrooms dark and dingy,"" professor Sarin said.

""We found mixed results inside the classrooms. For example, in one government school, a teacher was very strict. But, even many private schools had the same rules. Also, in one of the private schools, we found a teacher spending a lot of time during the class on the phone. The students silently sneaked out without taking any permission,"" Sarin added.

The report found that all five government schools had at least one teacher short. As one school explained, a recent mandate on the qualification of teachers had led to a shortage of subject teachers in secondary classes.

This led to an excess of primary grade teachers and a shortage of secondary-level teachers. The two Urdu medium schools said it was a major problem as very few with higher degrees required to teach in the secondary classes. The report concluded laying a map for the state government which can help parents change their perception. They included highlighting achievements of government schools, ensuring more accountability, etc."

The State govt. is again planning to tweak the criteria for admission under the reservation quota of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, which will prioritise government schools over their private counterparts.

The move has been criticised by parents' groups and education experts, among other stakeholders, who believe that the government is diluting the reservation clause. The Dept. of Primary and Secondary Education is proposing that the changes be applicable in the 2019-20 academic year.

The RTE Act states that 25% of seats be reserved for students of weaker sections and disadvantaged groups in private schools. However, as per the department's plan, a child must be admitted to government or aided schools in the neighbourhood.""Only if government or aided schools are not in the neighbourhood, should the child be allotted seats in a private school,"" said a source privy to the latest proposal.

Experts point out that the proposal will ensure that the reservation quota is scrapped as almost all neighbourhoods have a government school in the vicinity. (For admissions under the RTE quota, a 'neighbourhood' is considered as a revenue village in rural areas, a ward within city corporation limits, and the entire jurisdiction for urban local bodies.)Other sources confirmed that the department was planning to amend three clauses under the Karnataka Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2012.

""This move has been proposed as officials in the department feel that reimbursements to private schools for the RTE quota caused a huge burden to the State exchequer,"" the source added. This academic year alone, the State government is estimated to have reimbursed around ₹500 crore.

This January, a similar proposal was submitted by the department, but was not approved by the former Primary and Secondary Education Minister Tanveer Sait after widespread criticism. The State department's own analysis pointed out the rate of decline in government school enrolments for class one got steeper in the years following implementation of the RTE Act. It had also pointed out that only a small percentage (1.2%) of the overall budget of the Department of Primary and Secondary Education was spent as reimbursement for 2015-2016. Parents are unhappy with this proposal as they enrol their children in private schools in the hope they would become well-versed in English.

Shashikala K., a domestic help whose son studies under the RTE quota in a private school in North Bengaluru, said: ""When we applied for admissions this year, there were more than a dozen private schools that we could apply to. We were very happy as we could get English-medium education free of cost. If the rules are changed, it would mean that English-medium education is no longer accessible to us as every locality has a govt. school."""

Over 4,700 such children in the city have not yet secured a seat, but Friday's lottery made allotments only to 402 of them. This lottery was the final round of admissions for the current academic year.

BMC conducts online admissions for 25% seats reserved under RTE Act, 2009, at unaided non-minority schools in the city. This year, 347 schools were eligible for the process, and on offer were 8,341 seats. However, through three rounds of admissions, only 3,168 out of the 11,343 applicants secured admission. As many as 3,209 did not report for admission despite being allotted a seat.

Over the past few days, several parents came to BMC's education department with requests for another chance at admissions. ""Since there were vacant seats, we decided to hold another round of admissions for those who had not been allotted a seat in the entire process. But those who have rejected a seat will not get another chance,"" said a BMC official.

In this round, out of the 402 allotments, 352 got a seat in state board schools. The rest of the students will, however, now not get a chance. ""Many students have been left out because of demand-supply mismatch. While there are some schools which have applications exceeding their capacity, some schools have no takers,"" said the civic official.

Parents will have until October 20 to confirm admissions at the respective schools. In case schools do not admit students, parents can approach the local education officials for help."

The order came in connection with a Public Interest Litigation filed by Sandip Munjyasara, who had sought that students who were yet to be admitted under RTE be allowed to make changes in the school of choice mentioned in the original RTE application form.

The petition has also sought that the number of vacant seats in each school be made available to the students so that they can revise their choice.

The court said in its order that the state needs to publicise the number of seats available and the number of students who are yet to get admission after the first round is over. It also said that this details be made available school wise.

The court clarified that the option to modify and expand their choice of schools will not be available to students who had already accepted the schools assigned and those who had been offered their choice of schools but had chosen not to take admission in the same.

The court, however, said that no changes will be made to admissions this year as the process is more or less complete. Thus, the option of modifying their choice of schools will not be available to students who are left out under RTE this year.

The court observed that since it is already the end of September, if students get admission they would end up attending classes from the second session, which would affect their education.

It also directed the government to ensure that widest publicity be given to ensure that parents and students are aware about the form filling exercise.

It said that they should be encouraged to indicate as many choices of school as possible while filling up the form.The court observed that the guardians of students who apply under RTE are often themselves handicapped by poverty and illiteracy and the state needs to be sensitive about it.

It also did not entertain the government's view that permitting changes in choice even after first round was not possible since the entire system was online. The court observed that it would not be impossible to implement. ""It will ensure that more students secure admission under RTE. System must realise that we are dealing with a sensitive issue,"" said the court."

The Kailash Satyarthi Children's Foundation, in association with Delhi Legal Services Authority (DLSA) and Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) organised a national conference on Combating Trafficking through Education at Constitution Club of India in Delhi.

Priyank Kanoongo, member, National Commission for Protection of Child Rights pointed that children who do not attend school are often the most susceptible to perpetrators of trafficking. ""They often come from poor families who are unable to afford the academic fee. Education can be a source of empowerment steering their future away from the ugliness of trafficking. Free and compulsory education to girls of 15- 18 years of age is the first step towards achieving this reality, "" Kanoongo said.

The National Crime Records Bureau reported that in 2016 alone, 9,034 children were trafficked, a figure that had risen dramatically by 131 per cent from 3,905 in 2015. Given such alarming data, there is an urgent need of a comprehensive approach to combat the organised crime of trafficking.

Geetanjali Goel, special secretary, Delhi Legal Services Authority said, ""There are gaps which need to be identified. When I was at the Juvenile Justice Board I would see many cases of children who had been trafficked from states like Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh for executing thefts. So it is not just trafficking for prostitution or labour. More research into the causes and purpose behind trafficking needs to be done to find specific solutions."" She emphasised on the need to identify and map children who are school drop outs as they are more vulnerable. ""We are working on the module to educate children in schools in Delhi to prevent offences and protect them,"" Goel added.

Bhuwan Ribhu, lawyer and child rights activist stressed on the need to take ownership of the issue to combat trafficking. ""When a child is trafficked every fundamental right of that child is snatched. Let us pledge to make this a public movement so that every child is free, safe and educated,"" he added."

In a report tabled in the Assembly, the CAG has revealed that 12.80 to 15.11 per cent of children in the age group of 6-14 years were not enrolled in any school in the state during 2012-17. But the state government could only identify between 2.72 to 6.12 per cent of children as ""out of school children"" during the same five years.

These deficiencies, the report said, include failure to provide basic facilities in schools and setting admission targets without taking into consideration the availability of seats as per the RTE quota. ""The state government could not provide basic infrastructure facilities in majority of government schools even after seven years of implementation of the RTE Act,"" the CAG report mentioned. The Government of India and the Gujarat government's share of Rs 3635.57 crore (34 per cent) was short due to under utilisation of funds for implementation of the RTE Act, the report noted.

The CAG also expressed dissatisfaction about the state government's monitoring mechanism to ensure the proper implementation of the Act, also known as the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act of 2009. The CAG noted that the ""monitoring mechanism was weak as Block Resource Centre Coordinators or Cluster Coordinators had not conducted the prescribed number of inspections of schools"".

On RTE Act's clause for establishment of neighbourhood schools and transportation facility, the CAG report stated that the state government mapped schools in 2011-12 and found the requirement of 201 schools to meet the neighbourhood school norm. ""Of these, only 25 schools have been established and made functional as of March 2017. As a result, the number of students identified to be provided transportation facilities due to non-availability of schools in the neighbourhood increased three times from 51,653 in 2012-13 to 1,41,854 students in 2016-17,"" the report stated.

Further, during the audit, it was revealed that several primary and upper primary government schools were functioning without any teacher during 2012-17 as against the minimum requirement, it stated.

On the other hand, in the ""test-checked"" districts, the audit found surplus teachers in 275 primary schools (349 teachers) and 924 upper primary schools (1105 teachers). ""The state government could have utilised these surplus teachers in schools which did not have or which had less number of teachers. Thus, even after a lapse of more than seven years since implementation of the RTE Act the state government failed in ensuring maintenance of pupil- teacher ratio as mandated by the Act,"" the report pointed out.

The report pointed out that the prescribed pupil-teacher ratio in Gujarat was not achieved in 1,156 out of 10,531 primary schools and 3,098 out of 22,234 upper primary schools as on March 2017. As per the pupil-teacher ratio prescribed under the RTE Act, there should be at least two teachers in a primary school and three teachers in upper primary schools.

Further, the audit found that the local authorities had not provided training to 90,789 (27 per cent) of the 3,41,157 out-of-school children during 2012-17. ""Thus the objectives of the Act of increasing the competency level of out of school children for their mainstreaming in appropriate class remained unachieved,"" the report stated.

It also observed that the State Advisory Council met only ""twice"" against 16 meetings to be held during 2013-17.

In its annual compliance report of Gujarat Education Department on implementation of Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2009, the CAG noted that the targets for admission to economically weaker section and disadvantaged groups under the Right to Education Act have been fixed by the Gujarat government without considering the mandated provision of the Act.

""The process of fixation of a target was erroneous. The target fixed was much less than the mandated 25 per cent of the seats reserved as per RTE Act. As per DISE (District Information System for Education) data (2016-17), there are total 4,26,510 seats available for admission in Class I of unaided schools in Gujarat. However, against 1,06,628 seats (25 per cent of total seats) available for admission to children from economically weaker and disadvantaged groups, the target fixed was only 46,000 (43 per cent). This indicates that the targets have been allotted by the state government without considering the mandated provision of the Act,"" the report stated.

Citing the case of Ahmedabad city, the report stated that the District Education Officer received 17,866 applications as against the target of 18,950 seats during 2013-17. Of these only 13,126 children have been given admission.

Of the remaining 4,740 applications, 2,178 applications were rejected for want of supporting documents, while 2562 children did not join the school due to-allotment of admission is a school other than the one chosen, the schools being far away from residence and allotment in other medium than chosen.

Pertaining to reimbursement of fees (Rs 10,000 or actual fee charged by the school whichever is less) to the private schools against these 25 per cent reserved seats, the report pointed out a delay of six to twelve months by the district authorities.

""In test-checked districts (Ahmedabad and Banaskantha), the district authorities had not reimbursed as of June 2017 fees of Rs 91.28 lakh payable to 377 private schools against 2,121 students admitted under RTE Act during 2014-17. Further, seven talukas -- Dhandhuka in Ahmedabad, Anand in Anand district, Radhanpur, Harij, Santalpur, Saraswati and Shankheshwar in Patan district -- have not even calculated the fee to be reimbursed to 59 schools for 770 students admitted during 2014-17,"" the report stated.

The reason cited by the District Primary Education Officers (DPEOs) of these districts for this delay is ""due to late receipt of grant from the Director of Primary Education"".

As per the pupil-teacher ratio prescribed under the RTE Act, there should be at least two teachers in a primary school and three teachers in upper primary schools.

Commenting on the admission targets, the CAG has observed that the education department allotted targets to the district and municipal corporations for admission under 24 per cent RTE quota without considering the total number of seats available for admission in Class 1.

""The targets allotted were observed to be much lower than the actual seats available for admission in the state"" the report said.

The CAG also came across instances of ""denial of admission to eligible children"" during its scrutiny.

During scrutiny, the CAG found that in Surendranagar district alone, 359 eligible children of ""weaker sections and disadvantaged groups"" were denied admission during 2016-17 by the district authorities ""stating that the reserved seats of the schools opted by the applicants had been filled up"".

""Allotment of admission in different medium or school not opted for by the applicants were also noticed"", the central auditor said in its report.

The CAG also took note that 27 per cent identified Out of School Children (OoSC) were not given training for their ""mainstreaming to regular schooling in appropriate class"" during 2012-17.

""The above deficiencies indicated that the key objectives of the RTE Act of universalisation of elementary education could not be fully achieved,"" the CAG observed.

The CAG recommended that the state government should conduct an annual survey to identify children in the age group of 6-14 years and enrol them in schools.

""The state government may ensure that the provisions of the RTE Act regarding admission under 25 per cent quota in all the unaided schools are adhered to in letter and spirit"" the CAG recommended."

Despite receiving record number of applications from candidates across Tamil Nadu, only 70,000 managed to get admissions in private schools under the 25% RTE quota, according to official data.

""This is because the admission guidelines were revised this year. Only those residing within 1km radius of the schools were considered for the admission process,"" a state school education department official told TOI on condition of anonymity.

Until last year, applications from those within 3km or 5km radius were considered during the second or subsequent rounds of admissions.

Explaining the rationale behind this decision, the official said the Centre had not only denied reimbursement claims made for admissions made under the said act in kindergarten sections but also delayed releasing the promised funds.

""Every year, the state had to spend over and above its allocated budget to bridge this funding gap,"" he said.

Corroborating this, minutes of the recent Samagara Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) project approval board meeting suggest that the state had sought Rs 99 crore as total reimbursement towards expenditure incurred for 25 % admission under RTE quota in 2015-16.

But the central government (HRD ministry) has sanctioned only Rs 27.6 crore approximately one-fourth of the proposal, show records.

Commenting on this, V Eswaran from MDMK party, also an RTE activist, said, ""Other states including Maharashtra increase the radius to 3km or 5km if the seats remain vacant. So when there is a provision to do so, the government can't cite shortage of funds as a reason to revise guidelines.""

""Instead, the government can fix the loopholes in admitting students from disadvantaged groups (SC/ST/BC/MBC) to make the scheme more efficient. These students become eligible only by submitting a community certificate. So, even the affluent managed to study for free,"" he told.

According to section 12 (1)(c) of the act, 25 % seats in private schools are reserved for students aged between 8 to 14, belonging to weaker sections (with an annual income of less than Rs 2 lakh) and disadvantaged groups.

Eswaran added if the RTE Act doesn't accept KG admissions, then the state should instruct private schools to readmit them in Class I and submit these applications for reimbursement."

The commission has recommended that the ECI take into account during the discussion on ""one nation one election"" the need to secure the Right to Education of children.

Quoting research conducted by National Institute of Educational Planning and Administration in 2017, the child rights body pointed out that in 2015-16, 15.14% of the teachers in four states, Gujarat, Karnataka, Odisha and Uttarakhand, worked as booth level officers as part of election duty.

The commission in its representation to the EC also cited a desk analysis of data and complaints to say that during the period of election duties, midday meal is not served in the schools depriving them of the nutrition and their fundamental right to development. Also schools are converted to polling stations resulting in a loss of 10 days in preparations, security and inspection.

The court observed that despite two rounds of admission for allotting eligible students to neighbourhood schools as per the choices indicated by parents, around 33,000 seats under the RTE are yet to be filled.

The court observed that against the vacant seats 41,000 students who had applied for the admission were yet to be granted one.

The Uttarakhand Commission for Protection of Child Rights (UCPCR) has received over 70 complaints this year against private schools allegedly violating provisions of the Right to Education (RTE) Act.

Usha Negi, chairman of UCPCR, said, ""We have received many complaints against private schools of the state flouting the RTE Act. Many schools are demanding fees from students admitted under RTE. Several students are harassed by the school authorities as well.""

The commission has received complaints against prominent private schools, including Scholars Home, Moravian Institute, Doon World School and Doon Sarla Academy. In the various complaints, all four schools have been accused of demanding money from students enrolled under RTE Act.

While complaint against Scholars Home and Doon Sarla Academy stated that they were demanding a monthly fee ranging from Rs 500-1,000 from students under RTE and not giving a receipt of the same, parents of a student from Doon World School produced a 'Fee Card' issued by the school which recorded the monthly charges taken from the child.

As per a complaint registered by the parents of a student from Moravian Institute, the school had been demanding fees from the Class 5 student. Unable to pay the fees, the parents asked the school for the transfer certificate (TC) of their ward. The complaint said that the school refused to issue the TC until the parents cleared the pending dues. The child had been admitted to the school in Class 1 in May 2014.

A hearing was held between both the parties, following which the commission demanded an affidavit from the school stating their version. ""The school granted the TC without charging the parents,"" said Kamal Gupta, spokesperson of the commission.

The commission has also received complaints where private schools refuse to give admission to students under RTE Act. ""We got some complaints from Haridwar where private schools like Shivam Academy English Medium School refused to give admission to students under RTE Act. There have been reports of children being manhandled by teachers or school authorities in Haridwar,"" Gupta said.

Usha Negi said that while the commission is acting upon the grievances that are raised with them, in many cases, parents are too scared to even file a complaint. ""We have got to know that a prominent private school of Dehradun has given special identity cards to students admitted under RTE Act.

""We will reach out to the high court for the clearance of pending dues by next week. Running schools has become a liability especially in times when the government has failed to clear the bills. Many schools aren't able to pay salaries to their staff,"" Prem Kashyap, president of the association, said.

Approximately Rs 90 crore is to be paid to over 4,000 private schools in the state under RTE. In Dehradun alone, Rs 50 lakh was distributed in July and August while nearly Rs 7 crore is still pending.

The number of students admitted under RTE in unaided schools rose from 80,000 in 2015-16 to 1.7 lakh in 2016-17. But people close to the matter claim that from the current financial year 2018-19, admissions under RTE were restricted.

Under the RTE Act, Centre gives states 65% of the cost of providing free primary education. For north-eastern states, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Uttarakhand, it is 90%. The state government selects students and allots them private schools, where they are granted free admission. The state government reimburses the schools at a fixed rate.

As per the provisions of the RTE Act, the Centre pays to school a monthly fee not exceeding Rs 1,383 and an annual fee of Rs 2,100 for uniform, meal and textbooks per child. Some schools even charge a nominal fee from such students.

""The central government hasn't paid dues pending before 2015-16 which is a burden on the state exchequer,"" Bhupinder Kaur Aulakh, secretary, school education, said.

As per the data available with the school education department, central government paid Rs 39.80 crore against the total expenditure of Rs 49.55 crore for the academic session 2015-16.

In 2016-17, R 81.89 crore was spent on providing education to children from underprivileged families. The Union government didn't provide funds that year, said officials who did not want to be named.

Citing low prevalence rates where girls have completed secondary education, the report by National Commission for Protection of Child Rights and voluntary organisation Young Lives makes a pitch for making secondary level schooling a fundamental right.

Findings show the completion rate of secondary schooling is considerably higher among unmarried girls aged 15-19 years in almost all states. Even National Human Rights Commission secretary general Ambuj Sharma emphasised the need to extend the right to education from Class VIII to the secondary level.

The NHRC is also planning to recommend to the ministry of women and child development a uniform age for marriage for both men and women. In 140 countries, age of marriage is 18 for both men and women. Last month the law commission in a consultative paper on family laws suggested the legal age for marriage for both men and women across religions should be recognised at 18 years, the universal age for majority.

The study based on NFHS-4 data shows that of the 15 to 19 year old girls, who at the time of the survey reported to have been married before the legal age of marriage, 30.8% had never been to a school and 21.09 % had education up to the primary level. The percentage of girls who had secondary education and were married before 18 was 10.2%.

Those with higher levels of education were further down to 2.4%. While overall prevalence of child marriage declined from 26.5% in 2005-06 to 11.9% in 2015-16. Bihar is a case in point. The state recorded a significant decline in child marriages from 47.8% in 2005-06 to 19.7% in 2015-16.

The study also reveals that amongst the married girls aged 15 to 19 years, 31.5% girls were found to be have babies. Almost a quarter of the married girls in the age group of 15 to 16 years had at least one child."

The NHRC has based its recommendation on research that shows a strong correlation between a girl child's education level and age of marriage, with better education levels showing lesser likelihood of her being married early.

A report released by the apex child rights body National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) on Tuesday shows that being out of school at 15 years is a strong predictor of early marriage. The finding is based on analysis of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 4 data (2015-16) for determining prevalence of child marriage among girls in the 15-19 years age group.

NHRC Secretary General Ambuj Sharma, who released the report on Tuesday, said, ""The NHRC had recently formed a core group on child marriage. In our report, we have noted that a necessary step to prevent early marriage is to make education free and compulsory for all children up to the age of 18 years. Accordingly, the Right to Education Act must be amended so that it is applicable up to class 14 instead of class 8 right now.""

The report, 'India child marriage and teenage pregnancy', compiled by NCPCR and the NGO Young Lives India, shows that in almost all states, the completion rate of secondary schooling is significantly higher among unmarried girls in the 15-19 years age group. The report shows that in the 15-19 age group of married girls, 30 per cent have never received any education, 21.9 per cent have got primary education, 10 per cent have secondary schooling while only 2.4 per cent have higher education.

Among states, in Bihar, which has a child marriage prevalence far above the national average, the completion rate of secondary education among girls who married before 18 years is 51 per cent, followed by Delhi and Rajasthan at 54 per cent and 57 per cent, respectively. ""There is a strong correlation between educational attainment of girls and early child marriage. There is also a strong association between parents' low aspirations for child's education and teenage marriage,"" said Renu Singh from Young Lives. The data also showed that 32 per cent of married girls aged 13 to 19 years had their first child when they were still in their teenage. NCPCR Chairperson Stuti Kacker cited the example of Karnataka, which has made child marriage null and void.

The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006 doesn't invalidate child marriage but only gives the contracting parties the option of annulling it within two years of becoming adult or through a guardian in case they are still minors. The WCD ministry's proposal, seeking to make make child marriage 'void ab initio', is pending approval of the Union cabinet for a while now.

The White House in August announced that Trump would travel to Ireland for the first time as president as part of a trip to attend the Nov. 11 commemoration in Paris of the 100th anniversary of the armistice that ended World War One.

The White House, the Irish Foreign Ministry and the office of Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar all declined immediate comment on reports of the cancellation from Irish state broadcaster RTE and the Irish Independent newspaper.

Can the RTE achieve its stated goal of providing 'free and compulsory education for all'?

How does one describe a hair oil, which is designed to help hair grow, but after actual use causes the remaining hair to fall? Or, how does one describe a potency drug, which is prescribed to cure impotency but which, when used, makes someone permanently impotent?

There is no single word or phrase, at present, in the English language that can accurately describe such a behaviour or effect - wherein, the result yielded is the exact opposite of the one intended. But thanks to RTE (Right to Education Act), which is having a similar effect of destroying education instead of improving it, we might soon be able to describe all such contrarian effects with a simple phrase - ""doing an RTE!"" For instance, it may be fair to say that ""the hair oil did an RTE on its user"" to indicate that the hair oil caused hair fall instead of hair growth or that the ""potency drug did an RTE on the patient"", to indicate that the potency drug increased impotency instead of curing it.

The present write up, seeks to capture the some of the dangerous implications of RTE and thereby justify the usage of the phrase ""doing an RTE!""

The RTE Act was passed by Parliament in 2009 with the 'intended' objective of providing 'free and compulsory education to all' children between the age of six and 14. Let us evaluate how 'successful' RTE has been in achieving exactly the opposite. Let's look at its impact on a few of the critical parameters:

1. Has RTE Succeeded In Providing ""Free Education For All?""

The answer is a big no.

RTE has neither provided nor will it ever be able to provide ""free education for all"" because it is just not designed to do so. In fact, ""free education for all"", seems more like a homily thrown in to silence any likely opposition, than like a statement of serious intent. Look at the table below:

- At the time of enactment of RTE in 2009-10, around 5.73 crore children were studying in private schools but they were all left in the lurch, with RTE having nothing positive to offer them.

- A huge 13 crore plus children were studying in government schools but surprisingly, RTE offers nothing positive for them too.

So, if RTE totally ignores all the 19 crore (approximately) school-going children, who on earth does it seek to benefit?

- RTE seeks to benefit only a tiny fraction of these 19 crore students, based not on any 'economic' criteria, as is made out to be, but on the criteria of sheer luck (lottery conducted to give RTE admissions) or rampant corruption (rigging of RTE lottery).

- This tiny fraction of students, who are said to be benefitting from RTE is as tiny as 0.31 per cent or just 6.71 lakh students (for the year 2013-14). Sadly, even this number is found to be highly over estimated in several studies.

Another critical question to be asked is - what if most of the beneficiaries, who are now said to be getting the benefit of free education under RTE, would already have been getting the same benefit in government schools under the non-RTE regime?

2. Has RTE Improved The Condition Of The Nearly 12 Crore Students Studying In Government Schools?

The answer again is a resounding no.

- RTE gives the government a great excuse to not do anything significant for the government schools and dangle the carrot of RTE to anyone who complains.

- The government schools will never ever improve and will only continue to further deteriorate as the entire game plan of RTE, seems to be, to systematically destroy the government schools by sequentially pushing more and more students from government schools to private schools.

- Telangana Chief Minister Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao has in fact cited the same reason, on the floor of the state assembly, for not implementing RTE in the state. He termed RTE as a ""durmargamaina chattam"" (a draconian act).

3. If The Government Wants To Shift More And More Children To Private Schools, Has It Enabled A Rapid Expansion Of Private Education Capacity?

The answer, yet again, is no.

Look at the table below, clearly showing the decreasing trend in the number of schools:

- There is hardly any addition to the number of schools in the country. The number of schools, in fact, decreased in 2014 and 15 and increased by only 0.1 per cent in 2015 and 16

- While the number of government schools, as expected, continued to decrease, the rate of growth in private schools also registered a rapid decline from highs of 13.1 per cent in 2011 and 12 to just around 1.2 per cent in 2015 and 16.

Let's look at it realistically - who in the right frame of his/her mind, would want to open a shop (read school) where 25 per cent of the goods (25 per cent seats reserved under RTE) have to be sold at a huge loss - that too in a market where this rule applies only to his/her shop (Hindu-run schools) and not to the shops of others (minority schools)?

4. Has RTE Succeeded In Educating More Children By Bringing More Of Them To Schools?

The answer, once again, is no.

This is the stark reality of RTE - it seems to have 'successfully' managed to reduce the number of school-going children. Look at the trend of enrollment in Classes I to V.

- The number of students in Classes I to V reduced from 13.52 crore in year 2010-11 to 12.91 crore in year 2015-16.

- The number of students in government schools reduced rapidly from 9.41 crore in 2010-11 to 7.81 crore in 2015-16.

- The rate of growth in enrollment in private schools also declined from a high of 9.5 per cent in 2011-12 to just around 1.2 per cent in 2015-16.

The population of India, for sure, has not declined. What then could have led to the reduction in the number of school-going children?

5. Has The Condition Of More Than 7 Crore Children Studying In Private Schools, Improved?

The simple answer is that - it has never been worse!

Ironically, while these 7 crore plus students are totally excluded from benefits of RTE, they are covertly included while sharing the costs of RTE.

- People have been falsely led to believe, by the government and by most prominent RTE activists, that the government reimburses, to the schools, the full amount of fees for the 25 per cent seats allotted under RTE.

- The fact is that the government reimburses only a fraction of this fees and not the full fee charged by the schools. Look at the amounts reimbursed in some states and compare them with the fees charged by private schools in these states:

- The amount of reimbursement varies from a low of Rs 5,400 in UP to a high of Rs 18,311 in Uttarakhand. Sadly, even these amounts are rarely paid on time and some never paid at all.

- Who is to foot the bill for the difference between the amount paid by the government and the actual fee charged by the schools? Who, for instance, is to pay the deficit of Rs 90,000 per RTE seat in a school, that may be charging 1 lakh as its fees but would be getting only Rs 10,000 per seat as the reimbursement?

- This deficit, unfortunately, is being paid by common folks - the worthless ""unreserved"" category - making their children study in private schools.

Hope that the deceit, sham and irony of it all sinks into the peoples' minds - that the government, vide RTE, has fixed, for itself, an MRP (maximum retail price) on school fees when it 'buys' education from the private schools but refuses to similarly fix any MRP for private citizens when they buy the same education from the same set of schools.

It is, perhaps, the only one-of-its-kind case in the entire world where - the citizens subsidise the government instead of the government subsidising the citizens! (Read this article for a more detailed discussion)

6. Has RTE Succeeded, At The Very Least, In Improving The Overall Quality Of Education?

The answer to this too, unfortunately, is no.

Look at the trend of learning outcomes given in the ASER - Annual Survey of Education Report 2016:

- The number of students in Class V who can read a Class 2 level text was already at an abysmal 50.7 per cent in 2010. However, with RTE, instead of improving, it fell further down to 41.6 per cent in 2016.

- Similarly, the number of students in Class VIII who could read a Class II level text fell from 83.5 per cent in 2010 to 73.1 per cent in 2016.

Look at the data on the level of math that the students can do:

Just like in basic reading, a drastic drop can also be seen in the number of students who can do basic division - all thanks to this great panacea for all education ills of India - RTE!

Thus, the summary of this remarkable legislation called RTE, is that:

1. It will never ever succeed in achieving its stated goal of providing 'free and compulsory education for all' because it is just not designed to do so.

2. It completely neglects the nearly 10 crore students studying in government schools and provides the government a great excuse to not do anything much for them.

3. It seeks to push the government school students to private schools but does nothing to increase the private school capacity. On the contrary, RTE does everything to constrict the growth of private schools - leading to a reduction not only in the number of schools but also in the number of school-going students.

4. It seeks to give the benefit of 'free education' to around five to 10 lakh students (most of whom might already have been getting free education in government schools) by making nearly 19 crore other students suffer.

5. Even these five to 10 lakh students don't really benefit because of the drastic drop in the quality of learning and education of all students.

6. It has, additionally, made education so unaffordable for more than 8 crore students studying in private schools that the school fee has now become a top means of birth control and is even leading to suicides of parents and students. (Read for more details)

With 'achievements' as great as the ones listed above, what other than destroying India and its education, can we say, is the objective of RTE?

One can only hope and pray that all the learned souls of India - in the media, in the think-tanks and in the government - see through this charade of RTE and immediately stop RTE from ""doing an RTE"" on India."

The petitioner has asked the court to order a third round of the admission process and allow applicants to modify their choice of schools in such a way that children should be able to add and delete the schools as well as set priority with the knowledge about vacant seats in particular school.

Giving 'preferred schools not available' as the reason for the discrepancy in numbers, state government officials said, ""Even if there are vacancies, parents want only 'certain schools', which is why 11,000 children are yet to get admitted. If need be, we will be conducting another round of admissions to accommodate them,"" said an official from the Education Department.

The state government this year had surprised everyone when they nearly doubled the total number of seats under RTE to 1,12,000. In the first round, nearly 80,000 students were allotted seats out of which 71,000 took admission. The second round was delayed for a few months and was held after getting a nod from Gujarat High Court; 4,642 students were allotted seats. However, of the 4,642, only 2,091 confirmed their admissions. Another 1,810 children were allotted seats after the third round.

When DNA asked state Education Minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama about the same, he said, ""If there are seats vacant as per 25% reservation and there are eligible students, only then we will conduct the fourth round.

Speaking about the academic loss, Manan Choksi, Executive director, Udgam School for Children and President, Association of Progressive Schools, said, ""As per RTE Act, a student needs to attend 200 days of schooling. However, in the present scenario, half of the year has gone. Especially for CBSE schools, where the new session starts in April, RTE children getting admitted in September may face lot of difficulties in coping up. During the pendency of the cases, provisional admission of these children should have been allowed so that their education would not have suffered."""

However, last week, the state government allotted seats to only 4642 students in second round despite over 35000 vacant seats in schools.

The state government this year had almost doubled up the total number of seats for RTE children in the state and had assured smooth admission process. For a total of 112000 seats, the state government had approved 125000 applications. However in the first round, only 80000 seats were allotted out of which nearly 72000 confirmed their admission.

The state government has closed the second round of admissions under the Right to Education (RTE) Act quota, absorbing only 4,642 of the 53,480 students (about 9.5 per cent) who were left out in the first round of admission. For the remaining 48,838 children from the economically and socially disadvantaged groups, who have been waiting for four months to start school, the wait only gets longer, even as there is a week's window period for the second round of online admissions to conclude. This comes as most of the non-Gujarat board affiliated schools are wrapping up their first semesters.

In the beginning of this academic session, the state Education Department had announced that 1.20 lakh seats in 9,744 private schools across the state have been set aside for admission of students from economically weaker sections under RTE Act's 25 per cent reservation rule. Of the 1.87 lakh applicants, the government after scrutiny approved 1.25 lakh. The first list of 80,199 students was released on April 19. After the admission of the first list closed on May 30, it was found that 71,520 students had taken admissions.

Now after a gap of four months, the government has released the second list of only 4,642 students. This despite the fact that 48,480 seats are still vacant in private schools across the state. ""The reason for this huge number of seats still lying vacant is that these schools do not fit under the RTE rule of a maximum distance of 6 km. All these seats are either in schools that are beyond 6 km (from the place of residence of the child seeking admissions) or there is no school within 6 km-radius of the applicant,"" Director (Primary Education) M I Joshi, who is heading the RTE admissions, said.

The reason cited for the delay in announcing the second list was the ongoing hearing of a PIL filed in the Gujarat High Court for admission under RTE Act in the minority schools. ""Since the minority schools were denying admission to students under the RTE Act and with the PIL we could not go ahead with admissions till the time there was a decision on these seats allotted to these minority schools,"" Joshi added.

Nearly 600 students were denied admissions by 100 schools that claimed to be 'minority institutions', but did not have a valid certificate from the state government. Granting interim relief to the minority schools till August 13, the High Court on July 30 passed an order, stating that schools lacking minority certificate from competent authority could not deny admission to students under the RTE Act, thus clearing the deck for the Education Department to announce the second round of admissions.

According to the Education Department, they waited till August 13 before announcing the second list. ""As no representation from these minority schools was received by the Department till August 13, we went ahead and announced the second round,"" Joshi said. However, sources said that the minority schools have challenged the High Court ruling in the Supreme Court and had given a letter to the Education Department informing about it on Tuesday.

This year, the Education Department did not accept objections from applicants who claimed to be aggrieved by either incorrect school allotment or by an inadvertent error committed by them at the time of filing online applications. ""We did not allow objections this time as it was a foolproof transparent online admission process. Only a few did not get schools of their choice,"" Joshi said.

This year, in a major decision, the state government raised the income bar for both rural and urban residents under the RTE Act by more than 100 per cent -- from the previous annual family income limit of Rs 47,000 for rural areas it was increased to Rs 1.2 lakh, a hike of more than 2.5 times. Similarly, the limit for urban areas was increased by more than double -- from existing Rs 68,000 to Rs 1.5 lakh per annum.

There had been already two previous revisions pertaining to RTE admissions. As per the rule modified by the Education Department and notified on March 4 last year, if seats remained vacant in private schools after admitting students under the 25 per cent quota seats, children belonging to general category with a family income below Rs 68,000 in urban areas and Rs 47,000 in rural areas will be eligible for admissions in these vacant seats.

The committee, in which 28 members which included education experts member of National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, principals of some schools, representatives from Centre and states and civil society, had participated has suggested that section 15 (5) of the act under which minority institutions enjoy exemption should be amended.

For RTE's online lottery software, the biggest problems that came to fore were connected with distance mapping. NGO RTE Action Committee has filed a complaint with the education department and is even mulling legal action.

Shahid Sharif, the NGO's founder, said, ""The distance mapping is done through Google maps with the applicant placing the marker balloon at their residence, after which the software calculates the distance to school. But the balloon's placing is not happening properly and causing major chaos during admissions.""

He added that even the Std XI CAP software is facing multiple glitches. ""In the bifocal round itself, which was the first one, names of a few colleges did not reflect in the software's database. Due to this, these colleges lost out in the initial round,"" said Sharif.

(File Photo)

Six months after the management of Old Sangvi's National English School told the education department that they had decided to shut down the school due to non-payment of Right to Education (RTE) dues, parents and activists said the management continues to operate on the premises but has not continued RTE quota admissions. Parents and activists have accused the education department of turning a blind eye to the situation.

Activists wrote to Primary Education Director Dinkar Temkar, demanding an inquiry against the school management and also action against local education officer Jyotsna Shinde. In February 2018, parents of RTE quota students had complained to the education department that their children were allegedly not allowed to use the playground or participate in school events. School chairman Dominic Lobo had denied all allegations and had told the primary education department that he was shutting down the school from the next academic year.

But according to parents, Lobo continued to accept fees from students for the next academic year. Parents had complained to the education department, and the Pimpri-Chinchwad education officer was directed to inquire into the matter.

Mukund Kirdat, an AAP activist, said the school is now under a new management, which has kept all the old students except RTE quota ones. ""Without physically inspecting the school, the officer has written that it has shut down and that the RTE students should be placed in other schools. The parents submitted both photo and video proof that the school was running for all old students, except RTE students. Later, we saw boards stating that Priyadarshini Group of Schools had taken over the school, but government officials said they have no record about this. So basically, the old management has handed over the school to a new management and kept all paying students and removed RTE students. How is this legal?"" asked Kirdat.

One of the parents said they have written to the education department demanding to know the current legal status of the school being run on the premises. ""Assuming that the school is shut down, the education department gave our children alternate schools. The school allotted to my child was a semi-government school, where not more than 10 students were studying in Class IV because teaching was not up to the mark. If I wanted to put my child in such a school, why would I take admission in RTE quota? Many of us have taken loans and got our children admitted to private schools. But if the old school is still running, we demand action against them,"" said the parent on condition of anonymity.

Neither Lobo nor Shinde responded to calls or messages. But Jitendra Singh, CEO, Priyadarshini Schools, which has put up a board outside the National School saying it has taken over, said his group had not yet taken over the school.

According to Singh, Lobo approached them in June to take over the school but by then, many students had taken admission elsewhere. ""We ... have not formally taken over the school as the paperwork given by Lobo is not complete. Currently, only one of my administration officials is posted at the school. Until now, it is Lobo who has taken fees from students for this year. The old staff is still teaching there and they are being paid by him,"" he said.

Asked why only fee-paying students were continued and not RTE quota ones, and also if the education department was informed of the takeover, Singh said, ""We have not denied any such parents, maybe they took admissions elsewhere. We are not aware of who the RTE students are ... we agreed to run the school on humanitarian grounds so that students do not have to suffer. But since the paperwork is not done until now, the school is not being run by Priyadarshini Schools. Also, we have not written to the education department since nothing is formalised."""

Justice Sidhharth Mridul directed the Centre to inform the court about the amount it has paid for this year after the Delhi government claimed it has received only Rs 160 crore from the overall corpus of Rs 2,100 crore earmarked by the Centre for improving Delhi government schools.

Appearing for AAP government, standing counsel Ramesh Singh told the court that education directorate is facing problems in providing quality education and proper infrastructure partly because of lack of funds from the Centre even though these funds were approved for release.

The court is hearing a batch of petitions filed by children from various government-run schools complaining about the absence of infrastructure and violation of the Right to Education Act.

Appearing for the students, advocate Khagesh Jha highlighted a CAG report that had found last year that the central government disburses the amount almost at the end of the financial year and then utilisation is delayed by the Delhi government, and as a result, fund for education of the children lapses every year.

Jha also cited an RTI reply that said Centre has only dispatched roughly Rs 160 crore which is even less than 10% of their obligation and for this year the central government's obligation was Rs 2,100 crore, which is statutory requirement for the education of children and implementation of the provisions of Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009.

Students told HC in their plea that some of them are studying in schools that run in two shifts as the building is not able to accommodate children of the locality in one shift due to lack of facilities.

The petitioner students added that parents of most students are uneducated and even illiterate and when they had approached the Delhi government, they had been assured that the government is going to construct 1,200 classrooms and 30 new schools in the current financial year, ""but the process is slow due to non-disbursement of funds by the Centre."""

Incidentally, none of the primary schools, out of over 400 claiming to be of minority status, has got the NOC for exemption under RTE according to the provisions of the National Commission for Minority Education Institution (NCMEI) Act. However, the HC earlier had granted a stay in cases of some of these schools, and the stay will continue till August 13 allowing them time to approach the Supreme Court.

There are 39,914 seats available for RTE admissions in the second round and the state government was not moving ahead with admissions due to the logjam over legalities as over 400 schools claiming minority status refused to grant admission under RTE norms.

A bench of Justice M R Shah and Justice A Y Kogje made it clear that no school can claim minority status without an NOC from a competent authority either of the state or the Centre under the NCMEI Act. The judges upheld arguments by petitioner Sandip Munjyasara that a school does not attain minority status merely by having members of minority communities in trusts of the institutions. With these observations, the judges ordered all schools not having minority status to admit kids under RTE.

The HC ordered for the second round admission on a plea by another petitioner Chandravadan Dhruv.

This issue first reached the high court in May when the education department threatened action against schools run by religious minorities for not admitting poor kids under RTE. These schools had then approached the HC, which had stayed authorities from taking action.

Later, two PILs were filed complaining that denial by these schools to admissions had blocked the second round of admissions under RTE and there were more than 45,000 children from the unprivileged class waiting for admission."

The court also asked the state to ensure that students, who were left out of admission under RTE, are considered. This could pave the way for second round of admission under RTE.

The court's order came in connection with several petitions related to RTE. One involved minority schools moving the court on the grounds that their minority status exempted them from RTE while another petition had sought direction to the state government to begin second round of admission under RTE as over 40,000 students were yet to get admission.

The court, in its order, said article 30 allowed for religious minorities and linguistic minorities to establish minority institution of choice. ""As per an SC ruling they are exempted from RTE but such institutions need to get NOC from the competent authorities. They cannot automatically claim minority status,"" the court observed.

It said that the DEO's order directing the minority schools to admit students under RTE was not illegal and arbitrary.

It also directed the state to ensure that the students who were yet to be admitted under RTE were given admission as per their choice of schools but subject to the 25% limit for each school. The court also asked the government to consider those RTE applications that were rejected on technical grounds.

Meanwhile, some of the schools sought continuation of the interim order -- which prevented the state from carrying out penal action against schools that had refused admission to students under RTE -- so that they can appeal the matter in the Supreme Court. The high court granted them time of a fortnight.

The state had opposed the move on the grounds that over 1,000 children, who were given admission to minority schools, were still waiting to be admitted and they had already lost two precious months and granting a stay would only further the waiting period."

The Gujarat High Court on Monday held that primary schools that run by minority trusts but don't have certificate for being minority schools will have to admit students under the Right To Education Act (RTE). The court while disposing off a public interest litigation (PIL) and a set of special civil applications held that minority schools are however exempted from the 2009 Act, under which private schools have to keep 25 per cent of seats for children from ""disadvantaged and weaker sections"".

The Division Bench of Justice M R Shah and Justice A Y Kogje pronounced the judgment on a set of petitions moved by over 170 schools, run by minority trusts, including Mar Gregorious Othodox Syrian Church, Vadodara; Ayyappa Education Centre, Vadodara; Rajkot Kelavani Samaj, among others.

During the hearing, the state government had submitted that petitioner schools don't have certificates of minority primary schools. The state's contention was that trusts of these schools have acquired minority status for secondary and higher secondary schools, but not for primary schools. It said that the competent authority never granted minority status to the primary schools.

The state submitted that only those schools are exempted from the RTE Act that have minority school certificates. In its affidavits, the state said that communication issued from the Director of Primary Education specifically stated that ""any school which is claiming to have status of minority is required to produce a valid certificate of status of minority qua primary section issued by the office of Director of Primary Education...under the provisions of The National Commission for Minority Educational Institution"".

The schools have decided to challenge the High Court order in Supreme Court.

This year, the percentage of vacant seats under the RTE quota in both aided and unaided schools has increased compared to the previous year.

Seats up

Officials attribute this to an increase in the number of seats, and the fact that very few parents choose to admit their children under RTE quota in aided schools as the medium of instruction in primary classes is in Kannada.

This year, 21.32% of the total 1.52 lakh seats are vacant, a marked increase from the 2017-18 academic year where only 15.2% of the total 1.28 lakh seats were vacant.

The number of vacant seats has increased from 19,647 last year to 32,440 this year. Statistics provided by the department show that 73% of the total 14,281 seats under the RTE quota in aided schools were vacant, while for unaided schools 15% of the 1.37 lakh seats were not filled.

Earlier only unaided schools had to reserve at least 25% of their seats to students belonging to weaker and disadvantaged sections in the neighbourhood. According Section 12 (1) (b) of the RTE Act, aided schools have to provide free and compulsory elementary education to the children admitted based on the annual recurring aid or grants, subject to a minimum of 25%.

""All parents want their children to study in English medium. So even if they do not have to pay for education in an aided school, they prefer to pay by taking a loan and admit their child in an unaided school that imparts English-medium education,"" an official said.

Sources in the department also pointed out that although 1.43 lakh seats were allotted in three rounds under the RTE quota, there were no takers for 24,599 seats that were allotted.

Parents more aware

Nagasimha G. Rao, convener of the RTE task force, said the awareness among parents had increased prompting them to avoid admitting their children in schools that do not have adequate infrastructure or good teachers.

""As a result, although they have been allotted seats, they do not admit their children in these schools,"" he said."

Advocate Yogesh Tandava, who filed a PIL in the Hyderabad high court over the non-implementation of RTE in the two Telugu states, said that enforcing RTE would make the state better as it would promote communal harmony and social integration.

""This is not just about admitting economically backward children into private schools. By doing so, people from different classes will get to study in the same place thereby promoting brotherhood and inclusiveness among them. Not implementing it is not just affecting poor people, but also students from middle and rich classes who are being deprived of the opportunity of studying in an inclusive environment,"" said Tandava, adding that there is no question of private schools running into losses because of RTE as education is meant to be a non-profitable profession.

Pointing out how just about 10% of schools in the state, who collects lakhs of rupees in fees, are against RTE, the participants said it is time the government makes private schools redundant. They also asked the state to make sure that students are enrolled in 'age-appropriate' classes as it is of no use if a child completes his/her Class 10 at the age of 20."

According to the civic education department, only 45 per cent students have confirmed their seats till now. There is no word yet on when the admission process under the RTE quota will be complete even as civic officials say the process is lagging behind as there are not enough students seeking the allotted seats.

A senior official of the department said, ""Even after the second lottery round, very few students showed interest in securing admissions. We will not be able to proceed till the minimum required seats are filled.""

As per the schedule, parents had time till June 30 to complete the admission process but out of the 2,382 allotted seats, only 737 have been confirmed.

A bench of Justice M R Shah and Justice A Y Kogje questioned so during the hearing of various petitions as well as two PILs on provisions of admission under the Right to Education (RTE) Act in primary schools being run by the minority education institutions. The question arose when one of the petitioners, Sandip Munjyasara, submitted that none of the schools, claiming to be run by minority institutions, have the certificate showing their minority status, which is required to be obtained from either the director of primary education or the National Commission for Minority Education Institutions (NCMEI). There is a provision under the NCMEI Act that the minority run education institute must obtain certificate of its status.

Earlier, a single-judge bench has stayed the state government to take any action against nearly 400 schools for denying RTE admissions on their claims to be minority institutions. This has left nearly 8,000 poor children stranded in the first round of RTE admissions when minority institutes refused them admissions. This dispute has practically delayed the second round of RTE admission, where there are 45,000 applicants against 39,914 seats available, according to the state government.

In reply, the advocates representing schools submitted that the trusts running the schools were formed by people from minority communities. They are not required to obtain any certificate in this regard.

The state government submitted that after it contemplated action against these schools for denying RTE admissions, some of these schools have filed applications for the certification.

Petitioner Munjyasara also submitted that if the schools can prove their minority status, it is not his demand that poor students should be granted admission in these schools. But, their status is required to be verified and it is possible by scrutiny of trust deeds.

The HC has posted further hearing on the subject on Wednesday."

Earlier, the petitioner had spoken against such schools and said that under the National Commission for Minorities Institution Act, the state and central government were to nominate a competent authority. Such an authority was to give a no objection certificate to the minority institution for it to be declared one. The petitioner argued that in the present case the institutions were 'self declaring' themselves as minority without following the due process of law.

The court, after hearing arguments from both the sides, asked the institutions if the certificates were not required, why would such a rule be in place? Further hearing on the case is scheduled for Tuesday.

The Lok Sabha on Saturday, passed an amendment to the Right to Education Act, revoking the no-detention policy. It is likely that given the support across parties, it will pass through the Rajya Sabha too. Even so, it is necessary to continue this conversation and inform both the public and policy-makers about the potential damage of this reversal.

Section 16 of the RTE Act that earlier prohibited from holding back a child in any class cannot be read in isolation, and no detention did not ever mean no assessment. Section 16 should have been read in conjunction with Section 29 that talks about Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation and ""making the child free of fear, trauma and anxiety"".

The revised Section 16 has the provision for having examinations in classes 5 and 8, and sub-section 3 also allows ""schools to hold back a child... if he fails in the re-examination"". Going by ASER data, roughly half of the children in classes 5 and 8 are a few classes lower in terms of learning outcomes than the class they study in, and hence, would fail their exams. Re-examination is an important element of the amendment. The additional instruction will have some associated costs too - it may require additional training, special curricula, and if regular teachers are not available during the two-month window, some honorarium for part-time or volunteer teachers may need to disbursed. Additional remedial interventions like these can cost Rs 800 - 1,000 per child, but even the most cost-efficient program will have an average cost of Rs 2501. Assuming 30 per cent of children in classes 5 and 8 fail their first attempt and have to undergo the additional instruction. This would translate to 61 lakh children in rural government schools, and the cost of providing such programs would be Rs 150 crore.

Now, this does not seem much given the scale of the public education system in India. But while some children may pass this re-examination and some may drop-out, others will repeat the same class. Let us say 25 per cent of the 61 lakh children have to repeat a year. Assuming an average expenditure of Rs 12,700 per child, this would mean an additional financial burden of over Rs 1,900 crore. To put this in perspective, this equates to 8 per cent of the Rs 26,129 crore Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) budget for 2018-19.

The question is wouldn't it be better to invest in Early Childhood Development (more Anganwadis, better training) to ensure that children have the right start before class 1?"

With the Lok Sabha passing the amendment to the Right to Education Act (2009), the Delhi government has decided to do away with the ""No Detention Policy"". With the amendment, states can scrap the policy wherein children, from classes III to VIII, were not detained even if they failed the examination.

""It is yet to be passed in the Rajya Sabha, so we are waiting for it. Once it is passed, we will be working to bring back detention,"" said Atishi Marlena, former advisor to Education Minister Manish Sisodia.

From the very beginning, when the proposal for the amendment was moved by the Ministry of Human Resource and Development (MHRD), Sisodia has voiced support to scrap the policy.

The government justified the stand, stating that no detention policy leads to children being promoted without learning, and that scrapping the policy would lead to improved learning levels.

According to a source, the government will work to bring back detention from the next academic session, and consult parents and teachers on the same.

Sisodia has also been in favour of scrapping the policy as he received complaints from teachers about its negative impact on learning, said the source.

""It's a good thing that the amendment to the RTE Act has been passed. As children could not be detained, parents and children did not take the process seriously, thinking they will be promoted anyway. Now, the process is going to get better,"" said Sapna Singh, a government school teacher.

However, experts argued against the removal of the policy, claiming that it would lead to an increase in the number of dropouts.

""It is the poor quality of education, lack of infrastructure, teacher vacancies and the presence of untrained teachers that may have an effect on learning outcomes. The no detention clause, one of the most critical parts of the RTE Act that has been pulled out, has put the entire RTE Act at risk of disintegration. The greatest negative impact will be on disadvantaged groups, first generation learners and Adivasi students, as well as girls,"" said Ambarish Rai, national convenor, Right to Education Forum."

""It is a broken education system. We have to rebuild our education system,"" he added.

Under the current provisions of the RTE Act, no student can be detained till Class VIII and all students are promoted to the next grade.

The minister said that in some of the states like Sikkim , Kerala and Telangana, the students, who were studying in private schools, have come back to government schools.

""Teacher training, quality and accountability are most important,"" Javadekar said.

Stating that there was no shortages of teachers, the minister, however, added that the deployment of teachers was not right.

While moving the bill in the Lok Sabha, the minister said, ""It is a very important legislation and a majority of state governments supported this Centre's proposal. It brings accountability in our elementary education system.""

Referring to the no-detention policy in the Act, the minister said ""schools have become only schools for mid-day meal as education and learning are missing"".

This bill has also been analysed by the standing committee and the panel also recommended bringing back the concept of detention in schools, the minister added.

The policy had been brought as it was felt that compelling children to repeat a class was demotivating, often forcing them to abandon school, he said.

This bill provides for a regular examination in Classes V and VIII and if the child fails, he or she shall be given additional opportunity for re-examination in two months' time, Javadekar said.

Speaking on the bill, Congress MP KC Venugopal said that the proposed legislation lacks ""clarity"".

""This bill needs clarity. It should be clarified that whether the Centre or the states will conduct the exams,"" Venugopal said.

He also demanded a hike in the allocation for Centre's flagship programme Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan.

Echoing similar sentiments, BJD MP Bhartruhari Mahtab said the government should form uniform guidelines for conducting exams and leave it to the state on how the exams should be conducted.

Arvind Sawant of Shiv Sena and Saugat Roy of the TMC also lent support to the bill.

Sawant asked the government to focus on primary education.

Roy praised Javadekar for his ""non-confrontationist"" approach as he supported the bill.

Children often do not study if there are no exams, he said, adding that education system is currently in a bad shape and learning outcomes were going down due to non-detention policy.

""The education system is like an inverted pyramid and adequate focus has not been given to primary education,"" he said.

Supriya Sule of NCP also supported the bill and said introduction of exams was necessary.

Prem Singh Chandumajra of Akali Dal and Sanjay Jaiswal of BJP also spoke in support of the Bill.

Several members demanded that teachers should also be made accountable for learning outcomes.

BJD MP Bhartruhari Mahtab said the Centre should form uniform guidelines for conducting examinations and leave it to states on how the exams should be conducted.

Arvind Sawant of Shiv Sena and Saugata Roy of TMC lent support to the Bill. Sawant asked the government to focus on primary education. Praising Javadekar's ""non-confrontationist"" approach, Roy said children often do not study if there are no exams. He said the education system is currently in a bad shape and learning outcomes were going down due to the non-detention policy.

Supriya Sule of NCP also supported the Bill and said introduction of exams is necessary."

The amendment allows states to hold a regular examination at the end of Classes 5 and 8. According to the amendment bill, a child who fails in the examination held after Classes 5 and 8 will be given additional instruction and the opportunity to appear for a re-examination.

This examination must be held within a period of two months from the date of the declaration of the result. If the child still does not pass the exam, the state government may decide to detain them. However, no child can be expelled from school before they complete elementary education, the amendment bill states.

The proposed amendment was introduced in August last year and referred to a Standing Committee of the Rajya Sabha. The committee submitted its report to both the Houses of Parliament in February, endorsing the amendment bill ""in its present form"".

The no-detention policy of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, banned the practice of making under-performing children repeat classes in elementary school - Classes 1 to 8 - to ensure they do not drop out of school. It was meant to reduce the emphasis on year-end examinations and replace it with a form of evaluation that would track students' progress through the year.

However, the present government feels that the lack of ""pass-fail"" system has led to deterioration in quality of learning in schools as evident in the poor results of the National Assessment Survey carried out by the Union Human Resources Development Ministry and NCERT."

States in turn are to reimburse a certain amount of money for every RTE admission.

However, it turns out that the Maharashtra government is looking around for ways to not pay these schools the money it owes them.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Maharashtra, led by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, can claim credit for many successes, especially with the irrigation project Jalyukt Shivar and an impressive infrastructure upgrade topping the list. However, its record on one front has been abysmal, i.e., in fulfilling its responsibility under the Right to Education (RTE) Act.

According to Section 12 of the RTE, non-minority unaided private schools are required to reserve 25 per cent of the seats in entry-level classes (either primary level or Class 1) for students belonging to disadvantaged groups (DGs) [Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), etc] and economically weaker sections (EWS) [income less than a certain amount]. The state in return is supposed to pay these schools, for every RTE admission, an amount fixed by the government or the tuition fee of a school, whichever is less. Maharashtra has fixed an amount of Rs 17,000 a year for RTE students.

But it goes to great lengths to avoid reimbursing this amount to schools. Though the schools have been reserving seats under RTE since 2012, the government tried to get out of its commitment by simply agreeing to pay dues for only one academic year. Then, there was disagreement over the actual amount due and how it should be calculated. The government said it owed Rs 300 crore while the schools said the amount was more than 1,000 crore.

This mismatch in estimates came about because the government wanted to pay only for fresh RTE admissions while the schools were asking to be compensated for all RTE admissions (new and repeat/old students - explained in detail here).

Even to date, the dues of past academic years have not been fully released to all the private schools. Now, the Maharashtra government has come up with a new plan to avoid paying the money it owes to these institutions. In a government resolution released recently, it has modified the norms for RTE reimbursement stating that ""if a private school is using any government land and benefiting from the same then the school would not receive reimbursement for students who have been admitted in 25 per cent RTE quota,"" Mumbai Mirror reported.

Through this order, the government has effectively imposed a retrospective binding of sorts in an agreement that is in force for years and it has done so in a one-sided manner. This is a textbook definition of ""breach of contract"". When the government leased out land, it didn't impose a condition that schools will have to reserve 25 per cent seats for EWS/DG category students. Nor does the RTE Act mandate that those schools that have received land from the government at concessional rates will not be compensated for fulfilling the RTE quota. Hence, both from the RTE Act and the leasing agreement, the government's action is prima facie illegal. Less said about the ethical aspect of its action, the better.

Independent English Schools Association (IESA) secretary Rajendra Singh told Swarajya that ""the government's action is not just illogical but outright illegal. The RTE and land leasing are two separate contracts. In any case, under the RTE Act, the government gives reimbursement for only tuition fees and not for infrastructure costs the school has to bear. Land comes under the latter category. How can the two be clubbed? If the government was paying per student reimbursement for infrastructure costs also, then they had a case. In such a scenario, they could have deducted this from total reimbursement, but how can they not reimburse the tuition fees?""

Singh further explained that the government simply ""doesn't have the data to ascertain how many schools have the land leasing agreement with the government. Nor it has the manpower to determine this number. It will take anywhere between one to two years to collect the data. This is nothing but their latest attempt to delay payments to private schools."""

Right To Education (RTE) helpline was launched recently by the Social Welfare Department of Karnataka, which allows one to lodge complaints and get information on the Act. The Executive Director of the Child Rights Trust, Vasudeva Sharma, spoke to RadioActive about how the helpline could be used effectively.

Vasudeva Sharma explained that the RTE Act had been introduced way back in 2009 in Karnataka, and a lot of calls used to be received by the Child Rights Trust members on their personal numbers seeking clarifications. Even though there were no instructions available regarding RTE at that time, they used to clarify or give information in a comprehensible way. Of late, the calls had been about more specific and less common information.

He said they had attempted to set up a hotline back then, which failed because their personal numbers were still popular. The new helpline would have to have employees well-versed in the intricacies of RTE - the national Act as well as the rules for Karnataka and section (12)(1)(C), because (12)(1)(C) was often misused.

He spoke about the dangers of (12)(1)(C) being misused and despite it having popular aspects like forbidding corporal punishment, or stating the kinds of facilities an institution must have, how that could cause people to lose trust in it. It gave the impression that (12)(1)(C) was introduced as an attempt to control private institutions, as the condition laid down for availing this provision spoke only of what was expected of the institutions without placing any responsibility on the government. With the rampant misuse of this section, private institutions became richer but could not be brought under the control - and that such situations would lead to mistrust in the RTE Act itself.

Vasudeva Sharma said that he used to find a lot of children in government schools, but of late the number had been dwindling because they had moved to private schools. However, over time, parents were faced with demands for multiple additional payments. This at times forced the children back into government schools, and other times, they continued education there despite the heavy expenditure.

He also proposed some solutions:

On the move to make 8th standard the equivalent of 10th standard, Vasudeva Sharma said that though there had been discussions, the Central Government was yet to make a decision. He opined that it could not be taken without thorough discussions and analysis but was apprehensive about the imbalance a positive answer would create.

Vasudeva Sharma said that ignorance among activists and officials will deprive the children of the rights extended to them by the government. He suggested that guidelines be prepared wherein the responsibilities of each official is clearly mentioned and that such clarity would enable effective implementation of the Act.

He added that ignorance causes lack of coordination between the concerned departments and organisations, which could lead to failure of the programme."

Lakshmi works as a domestic help with a few families in Bengaluru. Her daughter during the academic year 2018-2019 had been admitted to LKG in a private school through the Right to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act 2009, section 12(1)(c). The Act promises 25 percent reservation in private unaided schools for weaker sections and disadvantaged groups.

Lakshmi chose to avail this choice as she felt that in government schools, children are left to themselves and aren't provided adequate attention. She says that she wants to educate her daughter, and felt private school was the best option.

There are several other parents from marginalised groups who would like to avail free education in private unaided schools, during the academic year 2019-2020. But that might not be a possibility if proposed amendments to the RTE rules, for which the cabinet has given the nod, come through. The proposed amendment gives government schools the priority, and the choice of availing admission in a private unaided school will be applicable only if there are no government schools in the neighbourhood. The Minister for Law and Parliamentary affairs Krishna Byregowda in his brief to the media said that preference to private schools has resulted in the government schools having fewer enrollments.

""If parents want to send their children to government schools, they will. Why is the government forcing this upon parents ?"" asks B N Yogananda (General Secretary, RTE Students and Parents Association). He says the private school lobby who don't want children from disadvantaged communities to study in their schools, are pushing for this. While there has been the mention of following the Kerala model with these proposed amendments, Yoganand says that the governments schools in Karnataka aren't at the same level compared to Kerala, and parents in Karnataka aren't willing to send their children to government schools.

In terms of next steps, the association plans to meet the Principal Secretary (Primary and Secondary Education) and demand that the proposed amendments be withdrawn. If not they plan on staging wide protests, and as a last resort would file a petition in the court.

G Nagasimha Rao ( Director, Child Rights Trust ) and convener of the RTE Task Force highlighted the lack of consultations in the process od changing rules. He says that after the RTE rules have not been reviewed even once after being notified in 2012, and amendments were directly called for. The RTE Task Force in their letter to the Principal Secretary, demands that the plan for the proposed amendments be halted; and recommends consulting civil society organisations working in the field of education, concerned parents and children while formulating recommendation to amend RTE rules. The RTE task force too plans on holding protests if the governments goes ahead with the proposed amendments.

This is not the first time that there have been proposals to amend the RTE rules in Karnataka. In January 2018 similar amendment to the rules were proposed by the Education Department but were rejected after coming under severe opposition.

What the government is proposing isn't something outside the law, says Niranjan Aradhya (Centre for Child and Law, NLSIU). He says that section 3 of the RTE Act provides fundamental right to free and compulsory education in the neighborhood school, and there is nothing wrong if the state decides to admit children in a government school available in the neighbourhood.

He adds that other options - aided and unaided schools come in when there are no government schools in the neighbourhood. As a member of the committee by Karnataka Development Authority working to strengthen government schools, Niranjan opines that section 3 of the act must be implemented in letter and spirit and several concrete steps are to be taken in order to strengthen state government schools so that they are on par with central government schools.

The average RTE reimbursement for a child stood at Rs 6871 during the year 2017, compared to the maximum ceiling of Rs 11,848 (cost per child in government schools). This indicates that a large section of the private unaided schools charge a low fee, and come under the low fee paying category schools (LFP). While there are several private schools that provide quality education, the same can't be said about LFPs. Research has pointed to how they even fall short in providing English education, which is one of the reasons parents from marginalised groups are attracted to them in the first place. ""LFP schools can't be thought of as an alternative to government schools "" says Rishikesh Shanker, Associate Professor, Azim Premji University, who advocates for the strengthening of the public education system.

Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh had previously attempted to modify the RTE rules along the same lines that the Education Department of Karnataka has proposed. In a notification by the Department of Elementary Education (Government of Himachal Pradesh) dated June 6th, 2015, guidelines were provided for admission and reimbursement of children under section 12 of the RTE Act.

Under these guidelines the government schools and private unaided schools in the neighborhood would initiate the process of 25 percent reservation in private unaided schools only if the minimum number of students (25) have been filled in the entry standard of the government school. This notification was challenged in the High court in Smt Namikta vs State of HP and others. The grievance of the petitioner was that the notification is contrary to the provisions of section 12(1)(c) of RTE Act which doesn't contain any inhibition and therefore restricts the scope of the Act.

The High Court struck down the notification stating that the notification creates a hierarchy in availing the benefits under section 12(1)(c), and is being read in a contrary manner where importing"" an obligation to admit students from the weaker section and disadvantaged groups only where seats are not available in the state run schools and aided institutions would be to defeat the object of the provisions."" The court concluded that there is no hierarchy in the parent Act and therefore the state government is in violation of the provision of the Act.

A petition regarding similar concerns was raised in the Allahabad High Court in Ajay Kumar Patel vs State of UP where the court stated that a policy of hierarchy can't be laid down by the government as it is contrary to the Parliamentary Act.

While the proposed amendment in RTE act is not supported by parents, the idea of prioritising the government schools may not be bad, after all. The parents and several civil society organisations opposing the amendment think that the condition of government schools in Karnataka is abysmal, including the poor learning levels of students. However, available research shows that there is no difference in learning levels between both groups of students.

A study by Azim Premji Foundation between 2008 and 2013 conducted in Andhra Pradesh examines the difference in learning levels of students (randomly selected from government schools) who were provided a scholarship and attended private schools, and students who didn't receive the scholarship and continued attending government schools.

The private schools who were part of the study had to admit a maximum of 25 percent students from disadvantaged groups, in line with the current 25 percent quota under the RTE. The students were tested at the end of every year for five years on their learning outcomes in Telugu, Mathematics, English and EVS.

The results showed that there was no difference between the learning levels of the different groups of students, and that private schools didn't add any value to the learning levels of the students from disadvantaged groups who had hitherto been in government schools and had joined them. The author of the paper notes that worldwide research is divided on student achievements after obtaining choice to study in private schools, and currently there is no consensus on this matter."

""The meeting will be a reminder for schools to ensure safety and security measures, including speed governors in buses, CCTV cameras on school premises, preparations to tackle natural as well as man-made disasters among other facilities,"" he said and added that a number of schools were still careless about the safety of kids.

They aren't sure if the authorities would do all that is needed to enhance the quality of government schools and bring them on a par with private ones.

Notably, Section 3 of the Act, which is considered the core of the legislation, provides children the fundamental right to free and compulsory education in a neighbourhood school.

According to the proposal, if there's a government school in neighbourhood of a child -- within 1km for primary education and 3km for higher primary -- he/she should get admitted to that instead of a private school.

Nagasimha G Rao, state convener of the RTE task force, said, ""The government is citing the example of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where government schools are in high demand. We're in touch with RTE activists there too. But the Karnataka scenario is different. Parents prefer English medium schools over government institutions.""

Mohammed Yousuf, a Marappa Garden resident and parent of a child who's an RTE beneficiary, said, ""I don't think government schools are up to the mark. They don't have good English teachers and lack infrastructure. Moreover, the nearest government school in our area is located on defence land, can be accessed by every passerby and has a dumpsite too. My son will not be safe.""

Education department officials admit that no new government school has been opened in the state in the past three years.

Citing a 2017 study by the RTE Forum, a national organization, which states that 90% of RTE students paid fees to private schools,Y Mariswamy, chairperson (in charge), Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights said, ""We get a lot of complaints from parents. It is sad that students are still made to pay fees at private schools despite being admitted under RTE. As we are the monitoring body for RTE and as well as child protection laws, I feel this move will give a boost to government schools and put in place systems required in these institutions.""

Niranjan Aradhya, senior fellow and programme head, Universalisation of Equitable Quality Education Programme, Centre for Child and the Law, NLSIU, said: ""This is a chance for government schools to improve. The government just needs to do a few basic things like recruit more English teachers and upgrade schools to the level of Kendriya Vidyalayas. To make RTE effective, they need to implement section 12(2) of the RTE Act which mandates private unaided schools receiving government largesse to reserve seats for weaker sections from their neighbourhood without the state having the obligation to reimburse them.

The State Cabinet's nod to amend the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act quota rules has come as a blow to families from lower socio-economic backgrounds.

Many parents have decided to protest the Cabinet's decision which stated that children from weaker sections and disadvantaged communities can get admission in private schools under the RTE quota only if there are no government schools in their neighbourhood.

A majority of neighbourhoods already have a government school. In other words, the probability of getting children admitted into private schools is almost nil.

The Department of Primary and Secondary Education is planning to amend three clauses under the Karnataka Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2012.

However, experts point out that amending the State rules alone is not adequate as the RTE Act mandates that 25% of the seats in private schools are reserved from children from weaker sections and disadvantaged communities.

The Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, which is supposed to be the monitoring body for all aspects concerning the RTE Act, was reportedly not consulted.

Shruthi R., who is hoping her son gets a seat under the RTE quota in a private school for 2019-2020, said: ""I live in the Kamakshipalya ward and there is a government school in the ward. But I do not want to send my child there. The government is denying our right to free English-medium education.""

Many parent support groups have decided to challenge this move legally. B.N. Yogananda, general secretary of RTE Students and Parents' Association, said that they had written to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights asking of legal possibilities to challenge this move.

""The State government is doing this to appease the private management lobby. This is against the interest of lakhs of parents and children,"" he said.

Nagasimha G. Rao, convener of the RTE task force, said that the State government had taken up a drastic step without consulting different stakeholders.

""The government is saying they will follow the Kerala model, but the quality of education imparted in government schools here cannot be compared to that of Kerala's,"" he said.

For admissions under the RTE quota, a 'neighbourhood' is considered as a revenue village in rural areas, a ward within city corporation limits, and the entire jurisdiction for urban local bodies."

Briefing reporters after the Cabinet meeting, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Krishna Byre Gowda said the preference being given to private schools under the RTE Act had resulted in fewer enrolments in government schools.

Emulating models of neighbouring states like Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the state government plans to amend the Act allowing parents to enrol children in private schools only if there are no government schools in the vicinity. The Act defines vicinity as a radius of 1km.

Briefing mediapersons after the cabinet meeting, state minister for law Krishna Byregowda said: ""The primary intention of RTE is to provide education to all class of students. For students from BPL families it is free of cost. Till date, Karnataka had allowed parents to admit children in private schools despite having government schools in the same neighbourhood. This has resulted in the enrolment ratio dropping drastically. We have decided to amend the RTE Act allowing parents to admit children in a private school only if there are no government schools in the vicinity.""

States like Kerala and Tamil Nadu already have such a law in place and it is said to have yielded positive results in terms of the number of students enroling in government schools.

The move to reduce admissions in private schools under RTE was first initiated in 2017 when then education minister Tanveer Sait had said the cost of educating children in private schools was a huge burden on the exchequer.

""In the past five years (2013-2017), the Karnataka government has spent over Rs 800 crore to educate children in private schools,"" Sait had said. ""It means we have lost so many students to private schools, who otherwise would have studied in our schools. We want to promote government schools."""

The plea had said the children are suffering as government schools are shutting down and around 9.5 lakh posts of teachers are vacant in these schools.

It had referred to reports ""showing systematic and widespread violations of children's right to education across the country, including violations of numerous specific requirements of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009"".

The petition had said that according to data, there were 14,45,807 government and registered private schools imparting elementary education in the country and as on 2015-16, there were approximately 3.68 crore children who were not in school.

It had sought a direction to all the states and UTs to identify the children, as mandated under the RTE Act, within six months to ascertain as to how many of them should be brought in the formal schooling system.

The plea had also sought a direction to identify ""all schools whether government, private, aided or unaided"" which did not have proper infrastructure such as ""all-weather building with at least one classroom for every teacher, barrier-free access, separate toilets for boys and girls, teaching staff and teaching learning material (TLM).

It had asked for a direction ""to ensure that unaided private primary recognised schools admit the children of economically weaker section (EWS) category in their first level to the tune of 25 per cent quota as enshrined in the RTE Act"".

The states and the UTs should recruit, train and employ 9.5 lakh additional teachers fill the vacancies within two years, the plea had said.

As things stand, as many as 51,849 seats are yet to be filled despite the long-drawn process.

Activists have pointed out that lack of awareness among parents belonging to the disadvantaged category, lack of a competent grievance redressal cell, and an arduous process of obtaining eligibility documents are some of the reasons for not achieving the 100% admission target.

Komalbai, who works as a maid in Pashan has two of her children living in the city. ""I don't know anything about RTE. My elder daughter is in class I and my son in KG. When I tried to admit my son to an aided school, but they refused admission. So I have admitted him in a Zilla Parishad school.""

While lack of awareness is one issue, another problem is that the migrant population may not have required documents. ""We have a voter ID and Aadhaar card but we don't have the income certificate. The agent asked for a lot of money for it. Hence, we just left it at that,"" said Komalbai.

Matin Mujawar of Shikshan Hakka Manch said, ""Awareness is the first step. The government needs to conduct massive awareness programmes about the RTE Act in slums and other areas. The polio drive is a success because of the massive awareness campaign. On similar lines, there should be an awareness drive about RTE Act so that everybody knows what needs to be done so that their children can get admission.""

Grievance redressal is another major problem that is hampering even NGOs and other activists working to help disadvantaged students get admission. The education department had announced a grievance redressal department with a helpline number. However, none of it was implemented.

""Currently, just one person talks to people with grievances. When a parent complains, this person would tell them to go to the school. Why would the school entertain the parents? Even letters from the education officer were hardly of any use because there were no follow ups,"" said Mukund Kirdat, an education activist.

Education commissioner Vishal Solanki said, ""We are working on various aspects of RTE admission. We would improve the present system from next year onward."""

The education official also claimed the provision of not reimbursing schools that are built on government land has always been in place, although its mention has been formalised thanks to the government resolution. Moreover, different directives have been given to the education department after a meeting held in September of higher officials from education and sports departments.

This apart, education officers have also been asked to visit schools to check if audit reports have mentioned the school fees, to hold meetings with parents and ask them about the fees charged by the schools, and to check for schools that were given government land on a lease for minimal charges.

She was talking to The Hindu on the sidelines of a workshop on inclusive education at the State Council of Educational Research and Training here recently. Ms. Julka said talks had been held with the Ministry of Social Justice on amending the RTE Act, as special schools had been made a legislative option for students under the Rights of Persons With Disabilities (RPWD) Act, 2016. The RPWD Act, she said, promoted inclusive education and gave a child the option of studying in regular or special schools or have home-based education. Inclusion, she said, did not mean in the physical sense alone. It meant that the education system had to accommodate the requirements of a child rather than child having to fit the system.

Therefore, if a neighbourhood school was not ready to accept a child with high-support needs or its teachers were not equipped enough for that or parents felt that their children needed full-day attention or had many learning gaps, then special schools were an option in the initial years before shifting them to regular schools.

Home-based education should be the last resort, and was preferable only for children with profound disabilities, Ms. Julka said.

Inclusion, in an optimal sense, would mean providing all support in school, but it was difficult in the country. So, if at all a child was attending a special school, it should be only till the child caught up, she said. However, even if special schools were to be treated as resource centres for inclusion, it would not work till they were brought under a single umbrella, she said. Taking parents' choice into consideration was also important.

Attitude changes were possible only if everyone worked together. The earlier differently abled children went to regular school, the more they would be be accepted by other students and teachers."

They feel the private ones are more conducive and safer, found a recent study 'Adversarial Parental Perceptions About Government Schools in Ahmedabad'. The study was conducted by Right To Education Resource Centre (RTERC) of Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIMA).

Many parents have a poor impression about the government schools because they've had bad experiences, RTERC researchers said. However, their opinion slightly changed after they visited several government schools.

The study, supported by UNICEF was conducted by professor Ankur Sarin of IIMA and a research associate Nisha Warnekar found flaws with issues such as lack of teachers, non-teaching staff loaded with too much work, principals and administrators lacking authority over teachers, among others. The findings come at a crucial time when around 40,000 seats under the RTE Act remain vacant this year.

""We interviewed several parents belonging to a particular geographical area comprising 34 schools. We wanted to compare their responses. We investigated the extent of information asymmetry amongst the households on the lines of parental perceptions. Our researchers also visited ten schools,"" professor Sarin's team said.

The parents feel that schools should have CCTV cameras, students should have uniforms, identity cards, and regular parent-teacher meets.

The parents suggested that government schools usually were large open spaces where anyone could walk in because the gates are always open. On the contrary, the private schools are ""bandh killas"" or fortresses.

For this reason, parents said, their wards often leave the premises during school hours.

In contrast, the parents whose wards made it to the private ones feel the gates are locked and the students can't leave the premises during school hours.

Many government schools are cleaner and more spacious than the private ones. Some say many have walls that are nicely done or boards displaying letters and numbers in different languages, maps and prayers. The infrastructure in these schools are also better and focus on extracurricular activities.

However, many parents cited the new focus of government schools on extracurricular activity and participation in competitions as being a waste of time.

""Private schools, in contrast, were incredibly cramped with almost 60- 65 students sitting on benches, which is double its capacity. Another private school was located in the middle of a marketplace and reels under tremendous noise. To solve this, the authorities have put up boards on the windows. This has made the classrooms dark and dingy,"" professor Sarin said.

""We found mixed results inside the classrooms. For example, in one government school, a teacher was very strict. But, even many private schools had the same rules. Also, in one of the private schools, we found a teacher spending a lot of time during the class on the phone. The students silently sneaked out without taking any permission,"" Sarin added.

The report found that all five government schools had at least one teacher short. As one school explained, a recent mandate on the qualification of teachers had led to a shortage of subject teachers in secondary classes.

This led to an excess of primary grade teachers and a shortage of secondary-level teachers. The two Urdu medium schools said it was a major problem as very few with higher degrees required to teach in the secondary classes. The report concluded laying a map for the state government which can help parents change their perception. They included highlighting achievements of government schools, ensuring more accountability, etc."

The State govt. is again planning to tweak the criteria for admission under the reservation quota of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, which will prioritise government schools over their private counterparts.

The move has been criticised by parents' groups and education experts, among other stakeholders, who believe that the government is diluting the reservation clause. The Dept. of Primary and Secondary Education is proposing that the changes be applicable in the 2019-20 academic year.

The RTE Act states that 25% of seats be reserved for students of weaker sections and disadvantaged groups in private schools. However, as per the department's plan, a child must be admitted to government or aided schools in the neighbourhood.""Only if government or aided schools are not in the neighbourhood, should the child be allotted seats in a private school,"" said a source privy to the latest proposal.

Experts point out that the proposal will ensure that the reservation quota is scrapped as almost all neighbourhoods have a government school in the vicinity. (For admissions under the RTE quota, a 'neighbourhood' is considered as a revenue village in rural areas, a ward within city corporation limits, and the entire jurisdiction for urban local bodies.)Other sources confirmed that the department was planning to amend three clauses under the Karnataka Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2012.

""This move has been proposed as officials in the department feel that reimbursements to private schools for the RTE quota caused a huge burden to the State exchequer,"" the source added. This academic year alone, the State government is estimated to have reimbursed around ₹500 crore.

This January, a similar proposal was submitted by the department, but was not approved by the former Primary and Secondary Education Minister Tanveer Sait after widespread criticism. The State department's own analysis pointed out the rate of decline in government school enrolments for class one got steeper in the years following implementation of the RTE Act. It had also pointed out that only a small percentage (1.2%) of the overall budget of the Department of Primary and Secondary Education was spent as reimbursement for 2015-2016. Parents are unhappy with this proposal as they enrol their children in private schools in the hope they would become well-versed in English.

Shashikala K., a domestic help whose son studies under the RTE quota in a private school in North Bengaluru, said: ""When we applied for admissions this year, there were more than a dozen private schools that we could apply to. We were very happy as we could get English-medium education free of cost. If the rules are changed, it would mean that English-medium education is no longer accessible to us as every locality has a govt. school."""

Over 4,700 such children in the city have not yet secured a seat, but Friday's lottery made allotments only to 402 of them. This lottery was the final round of admissions for the current academic year.

BMC conducts online admissions for 25% seats reserved under RTE Act, 2009, at unaided non-minority schools in the city. This year, 347 schools were eligible for the process, and on offer were 8,341 seats. However, through three rounds of admissions, only 3,168 out of the 11,343 applicants secured admission. As many as 3,209 did not report for admission despite being allotted a seat.

Over the past few days, several parents came to BMC's education department with requests for another chance at admissions. ""Since there were vacant seats, we decided to hold another round of admissions for those who had not been allotted a seat in the entire process. But those who have rejected a seat will not get another chance,"" said a BMC official.

In this round, out of the 402 allotments, 352 got a seat in state board schools. The rest of the students will, however, now not get a chance. ""Many students have been left out because of demand-supply mismatch. While there are some schools which have applications exceeding their capacity, some schools have no takers,"" said the civic official.

Parents will have until October 20 to confirm admissions at the respective schools. In case schools do not admit students, parents can approach the local education officials for help."

The order came in connection with a Public Interest Litigation filed by Sandip Munjyasara, who had sought that students who were yet to be admitted under RTE be allowed to make changes in the school of choice mentioned in the original RTE application form.

The petition has also sought that the number of vacant seats in each school be made available to the students so that they can revise their choice.

The court said in its order that the state needs to publicise the number of seats available and the number of students who are yet to get admission after the first round is over. It also said that this details be made available school wise.

The court clarified that the option to modify and expand their choice of schools will not be available to students who had already accepted the schools assigned and those who had been offered their choice of schools but had chosen not to take admission in the same.

The court, however, said that no changes will be made to admissions this year as the process is more or less complete. Thus, the option of modifying their choice of schools will not be available to students who are left out under RTE this year.

The court observed that since it is already the end of September, if students get admission they would end up attending classes from the second session, which would affect their education.

It also directed the government to ensure that widest publicity be given to ensure that parents and students are aware about the form filling exercise.

It said that they should be encouraged to indicate as many choices of school as possible while filling up the form.The court observed that the guardians of students who apply under RTE are often themselves handicapped by poverty and illiteracy and the state needs to be sensitive about it.

It also did not entertain the government's view that permitting changes in choice even after first round was not possible since the entire system was online. The court observed that it would not be impossible to implement. ""It will ensure that more students secure admission under RTE. System must realise that we are dealing with a sensitive issue,"" said the court."

The Kailash Satyarthi Children's Foundation, in association with Delhi Legal Services Authority (DLSA) and Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) organised a national conference on Combating Trafficking through Education at Constitution Club of India in Delhi.

Priyank Kanoongo, member, National Commission for Protection of Child Rights pointed that children who do not attend school are often the most susceptible to perpetrators of trafficking. ""They often come from poor families who are unable to afford the academic fee. Education can be a source of empowerment steering their future away from the ugliness of trafficking. Free and compulsory education to girls of 15- 18 years of age is the first step towards achieving this reality, "" Kanoongo said.

The National Crime Records Bureau reported that in 2016 alone, 9,034 children were trafficked, a figure that had risen dramatically by 131 per cent from 3,905 in 2015. Given such alarming data, there is an urgent need of a comprehensive approach to combat the organised crime of trafficking.

Geetanjali Goel, special secretary, Delhi Legal Services Authority said, ""There are gaps which need to be identified. When I was at the Juvenile Justice Board I would see many cases of children who had been trafficked from states like Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh for executing thefts. So it is not just trafficking for prostitution or labour. More research into the causes and purpose behind trafficking needs to be done to find specific solutions."" She emphasised on the need to identify and map children who are school drop outs as they are more vulnerable. ""We are working on the module to educate children in schools in Delhi to prevent offences and protect them,"" Goel added.

Bhuwan Ribhu, lawyer and child rights activist stressed on the need to take ownership of the issue to combat trafficking. ""When a child is trafficked every fundamental right of that child is snatched. Let us pledge to make this a public movement so that every child is free, safe and educated,"" he added."

In a report tabled in the Assembly, the CAG has revealed that 12.80 to 15.11 per cent of children in the age group of 6-14 years were not enrolled in any school in the state during 2012-17. But the state government could only identify between 2.72 to 6.12 per cent of children as ""out of school children"" during the same five years.

These deficiencies, the report said, include failure to provide basic facilities in schools and setting admission targets without taking into consideration the availability of seats as per the RTE quota. ""The state government could not provide basic infrastructure facilities in majority of government schools even after seven years of implementation of the RTE Act,"" the CAG report mentioned. The Government of India and the Gujarat government's share of Rs 3635.57 crore (34 per cent) was short due to under utilisation of funds for implementation of the RTE Act, the report noted.

The CAG also expressed dissatisfaction about the state government's monitoring mechanism to ensure the proper implementation of the Act, also known as the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act of 2009. The CAG noted that the ""monitoring mechanism was weak as Block Resource Centre Coordinators or Cluster Coordinators had not conducted the prescribed number of inspections of schools"".

On RTE Act's clause for establishment of neighbourhood schools and transportation facility, the CAG report stated that the state government mapped schools in 2011-12 and found the requirement of 201 schools to meet the neighbourhood school norm. ""Of these, only 25 schools have been established and made functional as of March 2017. As a result, the number of students identified to be provided transportation facilities due to non-availability of schools in the neighbourhood increased three times from 51,653 in 2012-13 to 1,41,854 students in 2016-17,"" the report stated.

Further, during the audit, it was revealed that several primary and upper primary government schools were functioning without any teacher during 2012-17 as against the minimum requirement, it stated.

On the other hand, in the ""test-checked"" districts, the audit found surplus teachers in 275 primary schools (349 teachers) and 924 upper primary schools (1105 teachers). ""The state government could have utilised these surplus teachers in schools which did not have or which had less number of teachers. Thus, even after a lapse of more than seven years since implementation of the RTE Act the state government failed in ensuring maintenance of pupil- teacher ratio as mandated by the Act,"" the report pointed out.

The report pointed out that the prescribed pupil-teacher ratio in Gujarat was not achieved in 1,156 out of 10,531 primary schools and 3,098 out of 22,234 upper primary schools as on March 2017. As per the pupil-teacher ratio prescribed under the RTE Act, there should be at least two teachers in a primary school and three teachers in upper primary schools.

Further, the audit found that the local authorities had not provided training to 90,789 (27 per cent) of the 3,41,157 out-of-school children during 2012-17. ""Thus the objectives of the Act of increasing the competency level of out of school children for their mainstreaming in appropriate class remained unachieved,"" the report stated.

It also observed that the State Advisory Council met only ""twice"" against 16 meetings to be held during 2013-17.

In its annual compliance report of Gujarat Education Department on implementation of Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2009, the CAG noted that the targets for admission to economically weaker section and disadvantaged groups under the Right to Education Act have been fixed by the Gujarat government without considering the mandated provision of the Act.

""The process of fixation of a target was erroneous. The target fixed was much less than the mandated 25 per cent of the seats reserved as per RTE Act. As per DISE (District Information System for Education) data (2016-17), there are total 4,26,510 seats available for admission in Class I of unaided schools in Gujarat. However, against 1,06,628 seats (25 per cent of total seats) available for admission to children from economically weaker and disadvantaged groups, the target fixed was only 46,000 (43 per cent). This indicates that the targets have been allotted by the state government without considering the mandated provision of the Act,"" the report stated.

Citing the case of Ahmedabad city, the report stated that the District Education Officer received 17,866 applications as against the target of 18,950 seats during 2013-17. Of these only 13,126 children have been given admission.

Of the remaining 4,740 applications, 2,178 applications were rejected for want of supporting documents, while 2562 children did not join the school due to-allotment of admission is a school other than the one chosen, the schools being far away from residence and allotment in other medium than chosen.

Pertaining to reimbursement of fees (Rs 10,000 or actual fee charged by the school whichever is less) to the private schools against these 25 per cent reserved seats, the report pointed out a delay of six to twelve months by the district authorities.

""In test-checked districts (Ahmedabad and Banaskantha), the district authorities had not reimbursed as of June 2017 fees of Rs 91.28 lakh payable to 377 private schools against 2,121 students admitted under RTE Act during 2014-17. Further, seven talukas -- Dhandhuka in Ahmedabad, Anand in Anand district, Radhanpur, Harij, Santalpur, Saraswati and Shankheshwar in Patan district -- have not even calculated the fee to be reimbursed to 59 schools for 770 students admitted during 2014-17,"" the report stated.

The reason cited by the District Primary Education Officers (DPEOs) of these districts for this delay is ""due to late receipt of grant from the Director of Primary Education"".

While on one hand, the state government, this year kept boasting of making provision for more seats for RTE children, but not getting children for admission, the report clearly states that the admission targets were much lower than the actual seats available.

The report stated, ""The department allotted targets to all districts and Municipal corporations for admission under 25% RTE quota without considering the total number of seats available for admission in class 1.

As per the pupil-teacher ratio prescribed under the RTE Act, there should be at least two teachers in a primary school and three teachers in upper primary schools.

Commenting on the admission targets, the CAG has observed that the education department allotted targets to the district and municipal corporations for admission under 24 per cent RTE quota without considering the total number of seats available for admission in Class 1.

""The targets allotted were observed to be much lower than the actual seats available for admission in the state"" the report said.

The CAG also came across instances of ""denial of admission to eligible children"" during its scrutiny.

During scrutiny, the CAG found that in Surendranagar district alone, 359 eligible children of ""weaker sections and disadvantaged groups"" were denied admission during 2016-17 by the district authorities ""stating that the reserved seats of the schools opted by the applicants had been filled up"".

""Allotment of admission in different medium or school not opted for by the applicants were also noticed"", the central auditor said in its report.

The CAG also took note that 27 per cent identified Out of School Children (OoSC) were not given training for their ""mainstreaming to regular schooling in appropriate class"" during 2012-17.

""The above deficiencies indicated that the key objectives of the RTE Act of universalisation of elementary education could not be fully achieved,"" the CAG observed.

The CAG recommended that the state government should conduct an annual survey to identify children in the age group of 6-14 years and enrol them in schools.

""The state government may ensure that the provisions of the RTE Act regarding admission under 25 per cent quota in all the unaided schools are adhered to in letter and spirit"" the CAG recommended."

Despite receiving record number of applications from candidates across Tamil Nadu, only 70,000 managed to get admissions in private schools under the 25% RTE quota, according to official data.

""This is because the admission guidelines were revised this year. Only those residing within 1km radius of the schools were considered for the admission process,"" a state school education department official told TOI on condition of anonymity.

Until last year, applications from those within 3km or 5km radius were considered during the second or subsequent rounds of admissions.

Explaining the rationale behind this decision, the official said the Centre had not only denied reimbursement claims made for admissions made under the said act in kindergarten sections but also delayed releasing the promised funds.

""Every year, the state had to spend over and above its allocated budget to bridge this funding gap,"" he said.

Corroborating this, minutes of the recent Samagara Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) project approval board meeting suggest that the state had sought Rs 99 crore as total reimbursement towards expenditure incurred for 25 % admission under RTE quota in 2015-16.

But the central government (HRD ministry) has sanctioned only Rs 27.6 crore approximately one-fourth of the proposal, show records.

Commenting on this, V Eswaran from MDMK party, also an RTE activist, said, ""Other states including Maharashtra increase the radius to 3km or 5km if the seats remain vacant. So when there is a provision to do so, the government can't cite shortage of funds as a reason to revise guidelines.""

""Instead, the government can fix the loopholes in admitting students from disadvantaged groups (SC/ST/BC/MBC) to make the scheme more efficient. These students become eligible only by submitting a community certificate. So, even the affluent managed to study for free,"" he told.

According to section 12 (1)(c) of the act, 25 % seats in private schools are reserved for students aged between 8 to 14, belonging to weaker sections (with an annual income of less than Rs 2 lakh) and disadvantaged groups.

Eswaran added if the RTE Act doesn't accept KG admissions, then the state should instruct private schools to readmit them in Class I and submit these applications for reimbursement."

The commission has recommended that the ECI take into account during the discussion on ""one nation one election"" the need to secure the Right to Education of children.

The commission in its representation to the EC also cited a desk analysis of data and complaints to say that during the period of election duties, midday meal is not served in the schools depriving them of the nutrition and their fundamental right to development. Also schools are converted to polling stations resulting in a loss of 10 days in preparations, security and inspection.

The court observed that against the vacant seats 41,000 students who had applied for the admission were yet to be granted one.

The Uttarakhand Commission for Protection of Child Rights (UCPCR) has received over 70 complaints this year against private schools allegedly violating provisions of the Right to Education (RTE) Act.

Usha Negi, chairman of UCPCR, said, ""We have received many complaints against private schools of the state flouting the RTE Act. Many schools are demanding fees from students admitted under RTE. Several students are harassed by the school authorities as well.""

The commission has received complaints against prominent private schools, including Scholars Home, Moravian Institute, Doon World School and Doon Sarla Academy. In the various complaints, all four schools have been accused of demanding money from students enrolled under RTE Act.

While complaint against Scholars Home and Doon Sarla Academy stated that they were demanding a monthly fee ranging from Rs 500-1,000 from students under RTE and not giving a receipt of the same, parents of a student from Doon World School produced a 'Fee Card' issued by the school which recorded the monthly charges taken from the child.

As per a complaint registered by the parents of a student from Moravian Institute, the school had been demanding fees from the Class 5 student. Unable to pay the fees, the parents asked the school for the transfer certificate (TC) of their ward. The complaint said that the school refused to issue the TC until the parents cleared the pending dues. The child had been admitted to the school in Class 1 in May 2014.

A hearing was held between both the parties, following which the commission demanded an affidavit from the school stating their version. ""The school granted the TC without charging the parents,"" said Kamal Gupta, spokesperson of the commission.

The commission has also received complaints where private schools refuse to give admission to students under RTE Act. ""We got some complaints from Haridwar where private schools like Shivam Academy English Medium School refused to give admission to students under RTE Act. There have been reports of children being manhandled by teachers or school authorities in Haridwar,"" Gupta said.

Usha Negi said that while the commission is acting upon the grievances that are raised with them, in many cases, parents are too scared to even file a complaint. ""We have got to know that a prominent private school of Dehradun has given special identity cards to students admitted under RTE Act.

Approximately Rs 90 crore is to be paid to over 4,000 private schools in the state under RTE. In Dehradun alone, Rs 50 lakh was distributed in July and August while nearly Rs 7 crore is still pending.

The number of students admitted under RTE in unaided schools rose from 80,000 in 2015-16 to 1.7 lakh in 2016-17. But people close to the matter claim that from the current financial year 2018-19, admissions under RTE were restricted.

Under the RTE Act, Centre gives states 65% of the cost of providing free primary education. For north-eastern states, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Uttarakhand, it is 90%. The state government selects students and allots them private schools, where they are granted free admission. The state government reimburses the schools at a fixed rate.

As per the provisions of the RTE Act, the Centre pays to school a monthly fee not exceeding Rs 1,383 and an annual fee of Rs 2,100 for uniform, meal and textbooks per child. Some schools even charge a nominal fee from such students.

""The central government hasn't paid dues pending before 2015-16 which is a burden on the state exchequer,"" Bhupinder Kaur Aulakh, secretary, school education, said.

As per the data available with the school education department, central government paid Rs 39.80 crore against the total expenditure of Rs 49.55 crore for the academic session 2015-16.

In 2016-17, R 81.89 crore was spent on providing education to children from underprivileged families. The Union government didn't provide funds that year, said officials who did not want to be named.

Total number of private unaided schools in state: 4,441

Number of private unaided schools that admitted students under RTE quota: 3,803

Total admissions under RTE in 2017-18 academic session: 1.7 lakh"

Citing low prevalence rates where girls have completed secondary education, the report by National Commission for Protection of Child Rights and voluntary organisation Young Lives makes a pitch for making secondary level schooling a fundamental right.

Findings show the completion rate of secondary schooling is considerably higher among unmarried girls aged 15-19 years in almost all states. Even National Human Rights Commission secretary general Ambuj Sharma emphasised the need to extend the right to education from Class VIII to the secondary level.

The NHRC is also planning to recommend to the ministry of women and child development a uniform age for marriage for both men and women. In 140 countries, age of marriage is 18 for both men and women. Last month the law commission in a consultative paper on family laws suggested the legal age for marriage for both men and women across religions should be recognised at 18 years, the universal age for majority.

The study based on NFHS-4 data shows that of the 15 to 19 year old girls, who at the time of the survey reported to have been married before the legal age of marriage, 30.8% had never been to a school and 21.09 % had education up to the primary level. The percentage of girls who had secondary education and were married before 18 was 10.2%.

Those with higher levels of education were further down to 2.4%. While overall prevalence of child marriage declined from 26.5% in 2005-06 to 11.9% in 2015-16. Bihar is a case in point. The state recorded a significant decline in child marriages from 47.8% in 2005-06 to 19.7% in 2015-16.

The study also reveals that amongst the married girls aged 15 to 19 years, 31.5% girls were found to be have babies. Almost a quarter of the married girls in the age group of 15 to 16 years had at least one child."

Even as a Bill to make child marriage void in India is pending before the cabinet, the National Human Rights Commission's (NHRC) core group on child marriage has, in its report to be submitted to the Ministry of Women and Child Development this week, recommended that the Right to Education must be extended to all students up to the age of 18 years so as to prevent child marriage. The NHRC has based its recommendation on research that shows a strong correlation between a girl child's education level and age of marriage, with better education levels showing lesser likelihood of her being married early.

A report released by the apex child rights body National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) on Tuesday shows that being out of school at 15 years is a strong predictor of early marriage. The finding is based on analysis of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 4 data (2015-16) for determining prevalence of child marriage among girls in the 15-19 years age group.

NHRC Secretary General Ambuj Sharma, who released the report on Tuesday, said, ""The NHRC had recently formed a core group on child marriage. In our report, we have noted that a necessary step to prevent early marriage is to make education free and compulsory for all children up to the age of 18 years. Accordingly, the Right to Education Act must be amended so that it is applicable up to class 14 instead of class 8 right now.""

The report, 'India child marriage and teenage pregnancy', compiled by NCPCR and the NGO Young Lives India, shows that in almost all states, the completion rate of secondary schooling is significantly higher among unmarried girls in the 15-19 years age group. The report shows that in the 15-19 age group of married girls, 30 per cent have never received any education, 21.9 per cent have got primary education, 10 per cent have secondary schooling while only 2.4 per cent have higher education.

Among states, in Bihar, which has a child marriage prevalence far above the national average, the completion rate of secondary education among girls who married before 18 years is 51 per cent, followed by Delhi and Rajasthan at 54 per cent and 57 per cent, respectively. ""There is a strong correlation between educational attainment of girls and early child marriage. There is also a strong association between parents' low aspirations for child's education and teenage marriage,"" said Renu Singh from Young Lives. The data also showed that 32 per cent of married girls aged 13 to 19 years had their first child when they were still in their teenage. NCPCR Chairperson Stuti Kacker cited the example of Karnataka, which has made child marriage null and void.

The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006 doesn't invalidate child marriage but only gives the contracting parties the option of annulling it within two years of becoming adult or through a guardian in case they are still minors. The WCD ministry's proposal, seeking to make make child marriage 'void ab initio', is pending approval of the Union cabinet for a while now.

The White House in August announced that Trump would travel to Ireland for the first time as president as part of a trip to attend the Nov. 11 commemoration in Paris of the 100th anniversary of the armistice that ended World War One.

The White House, the Irish Foreign Ministry and the office of Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar all declined immediate comment on reports of the cancellation from Irish state broadcaster RTE and the Irish Independent newspaper.

An correspondent for RTE said it understood that no formal communication had yet been made to the Irish government and that a statement from the U.S. State Department or the White House was expected in the coming hours.

A number of groups announced they would stage protests during the Trump visit, in which the president had been expected to visit the capital Dublin and his golf resort in the west coast village of Doonbeg.

Varadkar, who as a cabinet minister opposed extending an invitation to Trump before changing his mind when he became prime minister, described the trip as coming ""a little bit out of the blue"", but said the office of the U.S. president must be respected."

Can the RTE achieve its stated goal of providing 'free and compulsory education for all'?

How does one describe a hair oil, which is designed to help hair grow, but after actual use causes the remaining hair to fall? Or, how does one describe a potency drug, which is prescribed to cure impotency but which, when used, makes someone permanently impotent?

There is no single word or phrase, at present, in the English language that can accurately describe such a behaviour or effect - wherein, the result yielded is the exact opposite of the one intended. But thanks to RTE (Right to Education Act), which is having a similar effect of destroying education instead of improving it, we might soon be able to describe all such contrarian effects with a simple phrase - ""doing an RTE!"" For instance, it may be fair to say that ""the hair oil did an RTE on its user"" to indicate that the hair oil caused hair fall instead of hair growth or that the ""potency drug did an RTE on the patient"", to indicate that the potency drug increased impotency instead of curing it.

The present write up, seeks to capture the some of the dangerous implications of RTE and thereby justify the usage of the phrase ""doing an RTE!""

The RTE Act was passed by Parliament in 2009 with the 'intended' objective of providing 'free and compulsory education to all' children between the age of six and 14. Let us evaluate how 'successful' RTE has been in achieving exactly the opposite. Let's look at its impact on a few of the critical parameters:

1. Has RTE Succeeded In Providing ""Free Education For All?""

The answer is a big no.

RTE has neither provided nor will it ever be able to provide ""free education for all"" because it is just not designed to do so. In fact, ""free education for all"", seems more like a homily thrown in to silence any likely opposition, than like a statement of serious intent. Look at the table below:

- At the time of enactment of RTE in 2009-10, around 5.73 crore children were studying in private schools but they were all left in the lurch, with RTE having nothing positive to offer them.

- A huge 13 crore plus children were studying in government schools but surprisingly, RTE offers nothing positive for them too.

So, if RTE totally ignores all the 19 crore (approximately) school-going children, who on earth does it seek to benefit?

- RTE seeks to benefit only a tiny fraction of these 19 crore students, based not on any 'economic' criteria, as is made out to be, but on the criteria of sheer luck (lottery conducted to give RTE admissions) or rampant corruption (rigging of RTE lottery).

- This tiny fraction of students, who are said to be benefitting from RTE is as tiny as 0.31 per cent or just 6.71 lakh students (for the year 2013-14). Sadly, even this number is found to be highly over estimated in several studies.

Another critical question to be asked is - what if most of the beneficiaries, who are now said to be getting the benefit of free education under RTE, would already have been getting the same benefit in government schools under the non-RTE regime?

2. Has RTE Improved The Condition Of The Nearly 12 Crore Students Studying In Government Schools?

The answer again is a resounding no.

- RTE gives the government a great excuse to not do anything significant for the government schools and dangle the carrot of RTE to anyone who complains.

- The government schools will never ever improve and will only continue to further deteriorate as the entire game plan of RTE, seems to be, to systematically destroy the government schools by sequentially pushing more and more students from government schools to private schools.

- Telangana Chief Minister Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao has in fact cited the same reason, on the floor of the state assembly, for not implementing RTE in the state. He termed RTE as a ""durmargamaina chattam"" (a draconian act).

3. If The Government Wants To Shift More And More Children To Private Schools, Has It Enabled A Rapid Expansion Of Private Education Capacity?

The answer, yet again, is no.

Look at the table below, clearly showing the decreasing trend in the number of schools:

- There is hardly any addition to the number of schools in the country. The number of schools, in fact, decreased in 2014 and 15 and increased by only 0.1 per cent in 2015 and 16

- While the number of government schools, as expected, continued to decrease, the rate of growth in private schools also registered a rapid decline from highs of 13.1 per cent in 2011 and 12 to just around 1.2 per cent in 2015 and 16.

Let's look at it realistically - who in the right frame of his/her mind, would want to open a shop (read school) where 25 per cent of the goods (25 per cent seats reserved under RTE) have to be sold at a huge loss - that too in a market where this rule applies only to his/her shop (Hindu-run schools) and not to the shops of others (minority schools)?

4. Has RTE Succeeded In Educating More Children By Bringing More Of Them To Schools?

The answer, once again, is no.

This is the stark reality of RTE - it seems to have 'successfully' managed to reduce the number of school-going children. Look at the trend of enrollment in Classes I to V.

- The number of students in Classes I to V reduced from 13.52 crore in year 2010-11 to 12.91 crore in year 2015-16.

- The number of students in government schools reduced rapidly from 9.41 crore in 2010-11 to 7.81 crore in 2015-16.

- The rate of growth in enrollment in private schools also declined from a high of 9.5 per cent in 2011-12 to just around 1.2 per cent in 2015-16.

The population of India, for sure, has not declined. What then could have led to the reduction in the number of school-going children?

5. Has The Condition Of More Than 7 Crore Children Studying In Private Schools, Improved?

The simple answer is that - it has never been worse!

Ironically, while these 7 crore plus students are totally excluded from benefits of RTE, they are covertly included while sharing the costs of RTE.

- People have been falsely led to believe, by the government and by most prominent RTE activists, that the government reimburses, to the schools, the full amount of fees for the 25 per cent seats allotted under RTE.

- The fact is that the government reimburses only a fraction of this fees and not the full fee charged by the schools. Look at the amounts reimbursed in some states and compare them with the fees charged by private schools in these states:

- The amount of reimbursement varies from a low of Rs 5,400 in UP to a high of Rs 18,311 in Uttarakhand. Sadly, even these amounts are rarely paid on time and some never paid at all.

- Who is to foot the bill for the difference between the amount paid by the government and the actual fee charged by the schools? Who, for instance, is to pay the deficit of Rs 90,000 per RTE seat in a school, that may be charging 1 lakh as its fees but would be getting only Rs 10,000 per seat as the reimbursement?

- This deficit, unfortunately, is being paid by common folks - the worthless ""unreserved"" category - making their children study in private schools.

Hope that the deceit, sham and irony of it all sinks into the peoples' minds - that the government, vide RTE, has fixed, for itself, an MRP (maximum retail price) on school fees when it 'buys' education from the private schools but refuses to similarly fix any MRP for private citizens when they buy the same education from the same set of schools.

It is, perhaps, the only one-of-its-kind case in the entire world where - the citizens subsidise the government instead of the government subsidising the citizens! (Read this article for a more detailed discussion)

6. Has RTE Succeeded, At The Very Least, In Improving The Overall Quality Of Education?

The answer to this too, unfortunately, is no.

Look at the trend of learning outcomes given in the ASER - Annual Survey of Education Report 2016:

- The number of students in Class V who can read a Class 2 level text was already at an abysmal 50.7 per cent in 2010. However, with RTE, instead of improving, it fell further down to 41.6 per cent in 2016.

- Similarly, the number of students in Class VIII who could read a Class II level text fell from 83.5 per cent in 2010 to 73.1 per cent in 2016.

Look at the data on the level of math that the students can do:

Just like in basic reading, a drastic drop can also be seen in the number of students who can do basic division - all thanks to this great panacea for all education ills of India - RTE!

Thus, the summary of this remarkable legislation called RTE, is that:

1. It will never ever succeed in achieving its stated goal of providing 'free and compulsory education for all' because it is just not designed to do so.

2. It completely neglects the nearly 10 crore students studying in government schools and provides the government a great excuse to not do anything much for them.

3. It seeks to push the government school students to private schools but does nothing to increase the private school capacity. On the contrary, RTE does everything to constrict the growth of private schools - leading to a reduction not only in the number of schools but also in the number of school-going students.

4. It seeks to give the benefit of 'free education' to around five to 10 lakh students (most of whom might already have been getting free education in government schools) by making nearly 19 crore other students suffer.

5. Even these five to 10 lakh students don't really benefit because of the drastic drop in the quality of learning and education of all students.

6. It has, additionally, made education so unaffordable for more than 8 crore students studying in private schools that the school fee has now become a top means of birth control and is even leading to suicides of parents and students. (Read for more details)

With 'achievements' as great as the ones listed above, what other than destroying India and its education, can we say, is the objective of RTE?

One can only hope and pray that all the learned souls of India - in the media, in the think-tanks and in the government - see through this charade of RTE and immediately stop RTE from ""doing an RTE"" on India."

The petitioner has asked the court to order a third round of the admission process and allow applicants to modify their choice of schools in such a way that children should be able to add and delete the schools as well as set priority with the knowledge about vacant seats in particular school. The petitioner further suggested that enough attempts should be made to fill up all vacant seats under the RTE Act.

Giving 'preferred schools not available' as the reason for the discrepancy in numbers, state government officials said, ""Even if there are vacancies, parents want only 'certain schools', which is why 11,000 children are yet to get admitted. If need be, we will be conducting another round of admissions to accommodate them,"" said an official from the Education Department.

The state government this year had surprised everyone when they nearly doubled the total number of seats under RTE to 1,12,000. In the first round, nearly 80,000 students were allotted seats out of which 71,000 took admission. The second round was delayed for a few months and was held after getting a nod from Gujarat High Court; 4,642 students were allotted seats. However, of the 4,642, only 2,091 confirmed their admissions. Another 1,810 children were allotted seats after the third round.

When DNA asked state Education Minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama about the same, he said, ""If there are seats vacant as per 25% reservation and there are eligible students, only then we will conduct the fourth round.

Speaking about the academic loss, Manan Choksi, Executive director, Udgam School for Children and President, Association of Progressive Schools, said, ""As per RTE Act, a student needs to attend 200 days of schooling. However, in the present scenario, half of the year has gone. Especially for CBSE schools, where the new session starts in April, RTE children getting admitted in September may face lot of difficulties in coping up. During the pendency of the cases, provisional admission of these children should have been allowed so that their education would not have suffered."""

The Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka said the money should be used by the government for rehabilitation of victims, rebuilding of houses and schools in affected areas.

Shalini Rajneesh, principal secretary, education department, has forwarded a proposal to the chief secretary, seeking approval to open a joint account of the education department and private unaided schools, where schools can deposit the money they raise.

Private unaided schools get about Rs 6,000 to 18,000 per child as RTE annual reimbursement.

However, last week, the state government allotted seats to only 4642 students in second round despite over 35000 vacant seats in schools.

The state government this year had almost doubled up the total number of seats for RTE children in the state and had assured smooth admission process.

Academic experts suggest that due to an abysmal delay in completing the admission process, which lasted nearly two months, several students went on to take admissions on their own. After the first phase of admissions were completed in May, the second phase began only in August.

Sharing more details, M I Joshi, director, state primary education, said, ""The list of students who secured admissions under the second phase of admissions under RTE Act was announced on Tuesday. Some 4,642 students have been allotted admissions and have been intimated about the details. Students are required to submit their documents in the respective schools by August 31 and thus, secure admission.""

This time around, the state government's target was to give 1.05 lakh students, admissions under RTE."

MI Joshi, Director, Primary Education, said, ""Of those who were to be admitted after round two, we have given admission to 4,642 students; they will need to confirm their admissions by August 21.""

Sources privy to the development said, ""We had got 1,25,000 applications for a total of 1,12,000 seats in the states.

(File) Register for RTE or face de-recognition: Education departmentState lags in implementing RTE quota: IIM reportRTE quota: 63 pc seats yet to be filled across MMR

The state government has closed the second round of admissions under the Right to Education (RTE) Act quota, absorbing only 4,642 of the 53,480 students (about 9.5 per cent) who were left out in the first round of admission. For the remaining 48,838 children from the economically and socially disadvantaged groups, who have been waiting for four months to start school, the wait only gets longer, even as there is a week's window period for the second round of online admissions to conclude. This comes as most of the non-Gujarat board affiliated schools are wrapping up their first semesters.

In the beginning of this academic session, the state Education Department had announced that 1.20 lakh seats in 9,744 private schools across the state have been set aside for admission of students from economically weaker sections under RTE Act's 25 per cent reservation rule. Of the 1.87 lakh applicants, the government after scrutiny approved 1.25 lakh. The first list of 80,199 students was released on April 19. After the admission of the first list closed on May 30, it was found that 71,520 students had taken admissions.

Now after a gap of four months, the government has released the second list of only 4,642 students. This despite the fact that 48,480 seats are still vacant in private schools across the state. ""The reason for this huge number of seats still lying vacant is that these schools do not fit under the RTE rule of a maximum distance of 6 km. All these seats are either in schools that are beyond 6 km (from the place of residence of the child seeking admissions) or there is no school within 6 km-radius of the applicant,"" Director (Primary Education) M I Joshi, who is heading the RTE admissions, said.

The reason cited for the delay in announcing the second list was the ongoing hearing of a PIL filed in the Gujarat High Court for admission under RTE Act in the minority schools. ""Since the minority schools were denying admission to students under the RTE Act and with the PIL we could not go ahead with admissions till the time there was a decision on these seats allotted to these minority schools,"" Joshi added.

Nearly 600 students were denied admissions by 100 schools that claimed to be 'minority institutions', but did not have a valid certificate from the state government. Granting interim relief to the minority schools till August 13, the High Court on July 30 passed an order, stating that schools lacking minority certificate from competent authority could not deny admission to students under the RTE Act, thus clearing the deck for the Education Department to announce the second round of admissions.

According to the Education Department, they waited till August 13 before announcing the second list. ""As no representation from these minority schools was received by the Department till August 13, we went ahead and announced the second round,"" Joshi said. However, sources said that the minority schools have challenged the High Court ruling in the Supreme Court and had given a letter to the Education Department informing about it on Tuesday.

This year, the Education Department did not accept objections from applicants who claimed to be aggrieved by either incorrect school allotment or by an inadvertent error committed by them at the time of filing online applications. ""We did not allow objections this time as it was a foolproof transparent online admission process. Only a few did not get schools of their choice,"" Joshi said.

This year, in a major decision, the state government raised the income bar for both rural and urban residents under the RTE Act by more than 100 per cent -- from the previous annual family income limit of Rs 47,000 for rural areas it was increased to Rs 1.2 lakh, a hike of more than 2.5 times. Similarly, the limit for urban areas was increased by more than double -- from existing Rs 68,000 to Rs 1.5 lakh per annum.

There had been already two previous revisions pertaining to RTE admissions. As per the rule modified by the Education Department and notified on March 4 last year, if seats remained vacant in private schools after admitting students under the 25 per cent quota seats, children belonging to general category with a family income below Rs 68,000 in urban areas and Rs 47,000 in rural areas will be eligible for admissions in these vacant seats.

Speaking to Express, All India Muslim Personal Law Board secretary Khalid Saifullah Rahmani said, ""It is an attack on the sovereignty of madrasas.

For RTE's online lottery software, the biggest problems that came to fore were connected with distance mapping. NGO RTE Action Committee has filed a complaint with the education department and is even mulling legal action.

Shahid Sharif, the NGO's founder, said, ""The distance mapping is done through Google maps with the applicant placing the marker balloon at their residence, after which the software calculates the distance to school.

Six months after the management of Old Sangvi's National English School told the education department that they had decided to shut down the school due to non-payment of Right to Education (RTE) dues, parents and activists said the management continues to operate on the premises but has not continued RTE quota admissions. Parents and activists have accused the education department of turning a blind eye to the situation.

Activists wrote to Primary Education Director Dinkar Temkar, demanding an inquiry against the school management and also action against local education officer Jyotsna Shinde. In February 2018, parents of RTE quota students had complained to the education department that their children were allegedly not allowed to use the playground or participate in school events. School chairman Dominic Lobo had denied all allegations and had told the primary education department that he was shutting down the school from the next academic year.

But according to parents, Lobo continued to accept fees from students for the next academic year. Parents had complained to the education department, and the Pimpri-Chinchwad education officer was directed to inquire into the matter.

Mukund Kirdat, an AAP activist, said the school is now under a new management, which has kept all the old students except RTE quota ones. ""Without physically inspecting the school, the officer has written that it has shut down and that the RTE students should be placed in other schools. The parents submitted both photo and video proof that the school was running for all old students, except RTE students. Later, we saw boards stating that Priyadarshini Group of Schools had taken over the school, but government officials said they have no record about this. So basically, the old management has handed over the school to a new management and kept all paying students and removed RTE students. How is this legal?"" asked Kirdat.

One of the parents said they have written to the education department demanding to know the current legal status of the school being run on the premises. ""Assuming that the school is shut down, the education department gave our children alternate schools. The school allotted to my child was a semi-government school, where not more than 10 students were studying in Class IV because teaching was not up to the mark. If I wanted to put my child in such a school, why would I take admission in RTE quota? Many of us have taken loans and got our children admitted to private schools. But if the old school is still running, we demand action against them,"" said the parent on condition of anonymity.

Neither Lobo nor Shinde responded to calls or messages. But Jitendra Singh, CEO, Priyadarshini Schools, which has put up a board outside the National School saying it has taken over, said his group had not yet taken over the school.

According to Singh, Lobo approached them in June to take over the school but by then, many students had taken admission elsewhere. ""We ... have not formally taken over the school as the paperwork given by Lobo is not complete. Currently, only one of my administration officials is posted at the school. Until now, it is Lobo who has taken fees from students for this year. The old staff is still teaching there and they are being paid by him,"" he said.

Asked why only fee-paying students were continued and not RTE quota ones, and also if the education department was informed of the takeover, Singh said, ""We have not denied any such parents, maybe they took admissions elsewhere. We are not aware of who the RTE students are ... we agreed to run the school on humanitarian grounds so that students do not have to suffer. But since the paperwork is not done until now, the school is not being run by Priyadarshini Schools. Also, we have not written to the education department since nothing is formalised."""

Appearing for the students, advocate Khagesh Jha highlighted a CAG report that had found last year that the central government disburses the amount almost at the end of the financial year and then utilisation is delayed by the Delhi government, and as a result, fund for education of the children lapses every year.

Jha also cited an RTI reply that said Centre has only dispatched roughly Rs 160 crore which is even less than 10% of their obligation and for this year the central government's obligation was Rs 2,100 crore, which is statutory requirement for the education of children and implementation of the provisions of Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009.

Students told HC in their plea that some of them are studying in schools that run in two shifts as the building is not able to accommodate children of the locality in one shift due to lack of facilities.

The petitioner students added that parents of most students are uneducated and even illiterate and when they had approached the Delhi government, they had been assured that the government is going to construct 1,200 classrooms and 30 new schools in the current financial year, ""but the process is slow due to non-disbursement of funds by the Centre."""

Incidentally, none of the primary schools, out of over 400 claiming to be of minority status, has got the NOC for exemption under RTE according to the provisions of the National Commission for Minority Education Institution (NCMEI) Act. However, the HC earlier had granted a stay in cases of some of these schools, and the stay will continue till August 13 allowing them time to approach the Supreme Court.

There are 39,914 seats available for RTE admissions in the second round and the state government was not moving ahead with admissions due to the logjam over legalities as over 400 schools claiming minority status refused to grant admission under RTE norms.

A bench of Justice M R Shah and Justice A Y Kogje made it clear that no school can claim minority status without an NOC from a competent authority either of the state or the Centre under the NCMEI Act. The judges upheld arguments by petitioner Sandip Munjyasara that a school does not attain minority status merely by having members of minority communities in trusts of the institutions. With these observations, the judges ordered all schools not having minority status to admit kids under RTE.

The HC ordered for the second round admission on a plea by another petitioner Chandravadan Dhruv.

This issue first reached the high court in May when the education department threatened action against schools run by religious minorities for not admitting poor kids under RTE. These schools had then approached the HC, which had stayed authorities from taking action.

Later, two PILs were filed complaining that denial by these schools to admissions had blocked the second round of admissions under RTE and there were more than 45,000 children from the unprivileged class waiting for admission."

The court also asked the state to ensure that students, who were left out of admission under RTE, are considered. This could pave the way for second round of admission under RTE.

The court's order came in connection with several petitions related to RTE. One involved minority schools moving the court on the grounds that their minority status exempted them from RTE while another petition had sought direction to the state government to begin second round of admission under RTE as over 40,000 students were yet to get admission.

The court, in its order, said article 30 allowed for religious minorities and linguistic minorities to establish minority institution of choice. ""As per an SC ruling they are exempted from RTE but such institutions need to get NOC from the competent authorities. They cannot automatically claim minority status,"" the court observed.

It said that the DEO's order directing the minority schools to admit students under RTE was not illegal and arbitrary.

It also directed the state to ensure that the students who were yet to be admitted under RTE were given admission as per their choice of schools but subject to the 25% limit for each school. The court also asked the government to consider those RTE applications that were rejected on technical grounds.

Meanwhile, some of the schools sought continuation of the interim order -- which prevented the state from carrying out penal action against schools that had refused admission to students under RTE -- so that they can appeal the matter in the Supreme Court. The high court granted them time of a fortnight.

The state had opposed the move on the grounds that over 1,000 children, who were given admission to minority schools, were still waiting to be admitted and they had already lost two precious months and granting a stay would only further the waiting period."

The Gujarat High Court on Monday held that primary schools that run by minority trusts but don't have certificate for being minority schools will have to admit students under the Right To Education Act (RTE). The court while disposing off a public interest litigation (PIL) and a set of special civil applications held that minority schools are however exempted from the 2009 Act, under which private schools have to keep 25 per cent of seats for children from ""disadvantaged and weaker sections"".

The Division Bench of Justice M R Shah and Justice A Y Kogje pronounced the judgment on a set of petitions moved by over 170 schools, run by minority trusts, including Mar Gregorious Othodox Syrian Church, Vadodara; Ayyappa Education Centre, Vadodara; Rajkot Kelavani Samaj, among others.

During the hearing, the state government had submitted that petitioner schools don't have certificates of minority primary schools. The state's contention was that trusts of these schools have acquired minority status for secondary and higher secondary schools, but not for primary schools. It said that the competent authority never granted minority status to the primary schools.

The state submitted that only those schools are exempted from the RTE Act that have minority school certificates. In its affidavits, the state said that communication issued from the Director of Primary Education specifically stated that ""any school which is claiming to have status of minority is required to produce a valid certificate of status of minority qua primary section issued by the office of Director of Primary Education...under the provisions of The National Commission for Minority Educational Institution"".

The schools have decided to challenge the High Court order in Supreme Court.

This year, the percentage of vacant seats under the RTE quota in both aided and unaided schools has increased compared to the previous year.

Seats up

Officials attribute this to an increase in the number of seats, and the fact that very few parents choose to admit their children under RTE quota in aided schools as the medium of instruction in primary classes is in Kannada.

This year, 21.32% of the total 1.52 lakh seats are vacant, a marked increase from the 2017-18 academic year where only 15.2% of the total 1.28 lakh seats were vacant.

The number of vacant seats has increased from 19,647 last year to 32,440 this year. Statistics provided by the department show that 73% of the total 14,281 seats under the RTE quota in aided schools were vacant, while for unaided schools 15% of the 1.37 lakh seats were not filled.

Earlier only unaided schools had to reserve at least 25% of their seats to students belonging to weaker and disadvantaged sections in the neighbourhood. According Section 12 (1) (b) of the RTE Act, aided schools have to provide free and compulsory elementary education to the children admitted based on the annual recurring aid or grants, subject to a minimum of 25%.

""All parents want their children to study in English medium. So even if they do not have to pay for education in an aided school, they prefer to pay by taking a loan and admit their child in an unaided school that imparts English-medium education,"" an official said.

Sources in the department also pointed out that although 1.43 lakh seats were allotted in three rounds under the RTE quota, there were no takers for 24,599 seats that were allotted.

Parents more aware

Nagasimha G. Rao, convener of the RTE task force, said the awareness among parents had increased prompting them to avoid admitting their children in schools that do not have adequate infrastructure or good teachers.

""As a result, although they have been allotted seats, they do not admit their children in these schools,"" he said."

Advocate Yogesh Tandava, who filed a PIL in the Hyderabad high court over the non-implementation of RTE in the two Telugu states, said that enforcing RTE would make the state better as it would promote communal harmony and social integration.

""This is not just about admitting economically backward children into private schools.

Not implementing it is not just affecting poor people, but also students from middle and rich classes who are being deprived of the opportunity of studying in an inclusive environment,"" said Tandava, adding that there is no question of private schools running into losses because of RTE as education is meant to be a non-profitable profession.

Pointing out how just about 10% of schools in the state, who collects lakhs of rupees in fees, are against RTE, the participants said it is time the government makes private schools redundant.

According to the civic education department, only 45 per cent students have confirmed their seats till now. There is no word yet on when the admission process under the RTE quota will be complete even as civic officials say the process is lagging behind as there are not enough students seeking the allotted seats.

A senior official of the department said, ""Even after the second lottery round, very few students showed interest in securing admissions. We will not be able to proceed till the minimum required seats are filled.""

As per the schedule, parents had time till June 30 to complete the admission process but out of the 2,382 allotted seats, only 737 have been confirmed.

The question arose when one of the petitioners, Sandip Munjyasara, submitted that none of the schools, claiming to be run by minority institutions, have the certificate showing their minority status, which is required to be obtained from either the director of primary education or the National Commission for Minority Education Institutions (NCMEI). There is a provision under the NCMEI Act that the minority run education institute must obtain certificate of its status.

Earlier, a single-judge bench has stayed the state government to take any action against nearly 400 schools for denying RTE admissions on their claims to be minority institutions.

This dispute has practically delayed the second round of RTE admission, where there are 45,000 applicants against 39,914 seats available, according to the state government.

In reply, the advocates representing schools submitted that the trusts running the schools were formed by people from minority communities. They are not required to obtain any certificate in this regard.

Petitioner Munjyasara also submitted that if the schools can prove their minority status, it is not his demand that poor students should be granted admission in these schools. But, their status is required to be verified and it is possible by scrutiny of trust deeds.

The Lok Sabha on Saturday, passed an amendment to the Right to Education Act, revoking the no-detention policy. It is likely that given the support across parties, it will pass through the Rajya Sabha too. Even so, it is necessary to continue this conversation and inform both the public and policy-makers about the potential damage of this reversal.

Section 16 of the RTE Act that earlier prohibited from holding back a child in any class cannot be read in isolation, and no detention did not ever mean no assessment. Section 16 should have been read in conjunction with Section 29 that talks about Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation and ""making the child free of fear, trauma and anxiety"".

The revised Section 16 has the provision for having examinations in classes 5 and 8, and sub-section 3 also allows ""schools to hold back a child... if he fails in the re-examination"". Going by ASER data, roughly half of the children in classes 5 and 8 are a few classes lower in terms of learning outcomes than the class they study in, and hence, would fail their exams. Re-examination is an important element of the amendment. The additional instruction will have some associated costs too - it may require additional training, special curricula, and if regular teachers are not available during the two-month window, some honorarium for part-time or volunteer teachers may need to disbursed. Additional remedial interventions like these can cost Rs 800 - 1,000 per child, but even the most cost-efficient program will have an average cost of Rs 2501. Assuming 30 per cent of children in classes 5 and 8 fail their first attempt and have to undergo the additional instruction. This would translate to 61 lakh children in rural government schools, and the cost of providing such programs would be Rs 150 crore.

Now, this does not seem much given the scale of the public education system in India. But while some children may pass this re-examination and some may drop-out, others will repeat the same class. Let us say 25 per cent of the 61 lakh children have to repeat a year. Assuming an average expenditure of Rs 12,700 per child, this would mean an additional financial burden of over Rs 1,900 crore. To put this in perspective, this equates to 8 per cent of the Rs 26,129 crore Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) budget for 2018-19.

The question is wouldn't it be better to invest in Early Childhood Development (more Anganwadis, better training) to ensure that children have the right start before class 1?"

World over, children in primary schools are evaluated and when found lacking, the teachers work on their weaknesses. It is only in India that we are obsessed with 'failing' a student,"" said Patel.

He said the argument that students do not take studies seriously if there are no exams is rubbish. ""It is nothing but an excuse for the state government and teachers to hide their failure. Everyone is talking of how the no detention policy was affecting education but no one is breathing a word about an earlier amendment that talked of comprehensive and continuous evaluation,"" said Patel. He said the evaluation was meant to address the deficiencies of no detention policy. ""But the state government did not bother to implement continuous and comprehensive evaluation,"" said Patel.

He said the statements by the education minister that the no detention was affecting the education outcomes in Gujarat was nothing but an excuse. ""You can look at the education indices of the state before 2009 when RTE was not in place. Gujarat has not improved much. The no detention policy is an excuse to hide our poor performance,"" said Patel.

Detention is a must. What had happened on account of RTE's no detention policy is that children no more feared exams and did not bother to study, said a teacher."

With the Lok Sabha passing the amendment to the Right to Education Act (2009), the Delhi government has decided to do away with the ""No Detention Policy"". With the amendment, states can scrap the policy wherein children, from classes III to VIII, were not detained even if they failed the examination.

""It is yet to be passed in the Rajya Sabha, so we are waiting for it. Once it is passed, we will be working to bring back detention,"" said Atishi Marlena, former advisor to Education Minister Manish Sisodia.

From the very beginning, when the proposal for the amendment was moved by the Ministry of Human Resource and Development (MHRD), Sisodia has voiced support to scrap the policy.

The government justified the stand, stating that no detention policy leads to children being promoted without learning, and that scrapping the policy would lead to improved learning levels.

According to a source, the government will work to bring back detention from the next academic session, and consult parents and teachers on the same.

Sisodia has also been in favour of scrapping the policy as he received complaints from teachers about its negative impact on learning, said the source.

""It's a good thing that the amendment to the RTE Act has been passed. As children could not be detained, parents and children did not take the process seriously, thinking they will be promoted anyway. Now, the process is going to get better,"" said Sapna Singh, a government school teacher.

However, experts argued against the removal of the policy, claiming that it would lead to an increase in the number of dropouts.

""It is the poor quality of education, lack of infrastructure, teacher vacancies and the presence of untrained teachers that may have an effect on learning outcomes. The no detention clause, one of the most critical parts of the RTE Act that has been pulled out, has put the entire RTE Act at risk of disintegration. The greatest negative impact will be on disadvantaged groups, first generation learners and Adivasi students, as well as girls,"" said Ambarish Rai, national convenor, Right to Education Forum."

Replying to the debate in the Lok Sabha on The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (second amendment) Bill, 2017, Union Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar said that it will be at the discretion of the states whether to continue with no detention or not.

The states, he said, will decide at what level and who will conduct the examination, the minister said.

""It is a broken education system. We have to rebuild our education system,"" he added.

Under the current provisions of the RTE Act, no student can be detained till Class VIII and all students are promoted to the next grade.

The minister said that in some of the states like Sikkim , Kerala and Telangana, the students, who were studying in private schools, have come back to government schools.

""Teacher training, quality and accountability are most important,"" Javadekar said.

Stating that there was no shortages of teachers, the minister, however, added that the deployment of teachers was not right.

While moving the bill in the Lok Sabha, the minister said, ""It is a very important legislation and a majority of state governments supported this Centre's proposal. It brings accountability in our elementary education system.""

Referring to the no-detention policy in the Act, the minister said ""schools have become only schools for mid-day meal as education and learning are missing"".

This bill has also been analysed by the standing committee and the panel also recommended bringing back the concept of detention in schools, the minister added.

The policy had been brought as it was felt that compelling children to repeat a class was demotivating, often forcing them to abandon school, he said.

This bill provides for a regular examination in Classes V and VIII and if the child fails, he or she shall be given additional opportunity for re-examination in two months' time, Javadekar said.

Speaking on the bill, Congress MP KC Venugopal said that the proposed legislation lacks ""clarity"".

""This bill needs clarity. It should be clarified that whether the Centre or the states will conduct the exams,"" Venugopal said.

He also demanded a hike in the allocation for Centre's flagship programme Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan.

Echoing similar sentiments, BJD MP Bhartruhari Mahtab said the government should form uniform guidelines for conducting exams and leave it to the state on how the exams should be conducted.

Arvind Sawant of Shiv Sena and Saugat Roy of the TMC also lent support to the bill.

Sawant asked the government to focus on primary education.

Roy praised Javadekar for his ""non-confrontationist"" approach as he supported the bill.

Children often do not study if there are no exams, he said, adding that education system is currently in a bad shape and learning outcomes were going down due to non-detention policy.

""The education system is like an inverted pyramid and adequate focus has not been given to primary education,"" he said.

Supriya Sule of NCP also supported the bill and said introduction of exams was necessary.

Prem Singh Chandumajra of Akali Dal and Sanjay Jaiswal of BJP also spoke in support of the Bill.

Several members demanded that teachers should also be made accountable for learning outcomes.

The Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed a Bill to amend the Right to Education (RTE) Act to abolish the ""no-detention"" policy in schools. No student can be detained up to class VIII under current provisions of the Act.

The amendment allows states to hold a regular examination at the end of Classes 5 and 8. According to the amendment bill, a child who fails in the examination held after Classes 5 and 8 will be given additional instruction and the opportunity to appear for a re-examination.

This examination must be held within a period of two months from the date of the declaration of the result. If the child still does not pass the exam, the state government may decide to detain them. However, no child can be expelled from school before they complete elementary education, the amendment bill states.

The proposed amendment was introduced in August last year and referred to a Standing Committee of the Rajya Sabha. The committee submitted its report to both the Houses of Parliament in February, endorsing the amendment bill ""in its present form"".

The no-detention policy of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, banned the practice of making under-performing children repeat classes in elementary school - Classes 1 to 8 - to ensure they do not drop out of school. It was meant to reduce the emphasis on year-end examinations and replace it with a form of evaluation that would track students' progress through the year.

However, the present government feels that the lack of ""pass-fail"" system has led to deterioration in quality of learning in schools as evident in the poor results of the National Assessment Survey carried out by the Union Human Resources Development Ministry and NCERT."

The state said in the affidavit, that on verification it was found that 2,208 applicants had provided an income certificate that was not issued by the Mamlatdar. The state also said that it was in the process of taking action against such applicants.

The affidavit said that to ensure a level playing field for children from weaker sections of society who were admitted to schools under RTE, it had directed the DEO and the DPEOs to hold a meeting with schools under its jurisdiction. The officials were to hold a meeting with the school authorities to provide a proper environment to the students and to also carry out counselling sessions for both the students and the parents. It also advised the schools to carry out a pre-meeting with parents whose children were admitted to the schools under RTE.

The state also informed the court that that of the 80,165 students who were granted admission, the admission of only 72, 294 were confirmed. The remaining would be given admission during the second round.
