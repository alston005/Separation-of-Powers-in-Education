The process to introduce the NCERT syllabus to replace the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) syllabus is under operation by the Department of Education.

Education Minister Ratan Lal Nath was quoted as saying by India Today. ""The change in curriculum will take the state's education system to the national level,"" said Nath. He has also informed that almost 2 lakh new NCERT books were procured by the department.

The BJP-Indigenous People's Front of Tripura (IPFT) government had set up an expert committee for reviewing school syllabus after coming into power. The panel had recommended the adoption of the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) curriculum in schools run by the state.

Nath said that the government has decided to bring an ordinance to constitute a state-level higher education board in accordance with the directives of the Ministry of Human Resource Development.

""The MHRD may curtail outlay under the Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) if the board is not put in place,"" he said."

About 14 private-aided Marathi language schools had requested the municipal corporation to give the premises on rent, as their own buildings were in a dilapidated state.

In the last five years, more than 100 BMC schools have been shut down owing to dwindling student numbers.

""We got applications from 14 such aided schools, seeking municipal schools' premises on rent. Their own buildings are in ruins.

Though eager to outsource it to SHGs, schools do have apprehensions about accountability in the way the system will be run. TOI has learnt that the issue will be discussed in the principals' association meet in January.

A principal of an aided school told TOI on condition of anonymity that the idea of outsourcing was not a bad one considering the hassles schools have to deal with. ""We have to coordinate with the officials who deal with MDM and maintain records of each and every transaction plus students fed.

TOI has been told many schools are being urged by MDM officials to select SHG as their vendors. The principal, added "" I hope the money and raw materials are properly accounted for. Pilferage can happen very easily with the school not being directly involved.""

The current set up for aided schools is such that schools get rice directly from the government. The rice sacks are delivered every month straight to the campus from Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns, with no monetary exchange happening between schools and FCI. The quantity of rice sacks to be delivered is conveyed by the school to the education department, which then informs FCI about it. This is the only part of the purchasing process that is common for both urban and rural schools.

Vegetables, pulses and other cooking materials have to be purchased by urban schools which then get reimbursed within two or three months. In rural areas, schools have to simply pick up the ingredients from designated shops and the education department takes care of the payment.

Almost all rural schools have cultivated kitchen gardens and use fresh vegetables in their MDM. Apart from SHG, even NGO Akshay Patra is providing MDM to certain schools as pilot project."

Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanasamy on Thursday criticised Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi for declining to approve the release of funds for aided schools, saying she has no authority in such matters, The Hindu.

Narayanasamy said that his government had sent a file to Bedi seeking her approval to release funds to 35 aided schools in the Union Territory. Bedi, however, returned the file recommending that the government scrap the release of funds to the schools in a phased manner.

""Such a sudden stand on the part of the lieutenant governor causes embarrassment [to the government],"" Narayanasamy told reporters, according to PTI. ""The lieutenant governor has no authority to question the pattern of grants and also has no right to interfere and direct slashing of grants in a phased manner as done now,"" he said.

Narayanasamy said the government had framed guidelines to release grants to privately-managed aided schools and the rate of grants was fixed in 1957. He said that the funds enable such school managements to pay salaries of teachers and pension for retired staff.

The chief minister termed Bedi's move ""utterly unjustified"", adding that the directions to stop funds to such schools will affect around 27,000 students.

A total of Rs 44 crore had been approved for aided schools in the Budget tabled in the Assembly. This included Rs 2.92 crore as subsidy towards salaries to teachers and Rs 58 lakh as pension for retired staff.

Narayanasamy has often accused Bedi of overstepping her constitutional role in the Union Territory of Puducherry. In July, Narayanasamy said his government was struggling to carry out its routine administration because of hurdles caused by the Centre and the lieutenant governor.

On April 28, Bedi had issued an order that said distribution of free rice to villagers in the Union territory will be made ""conditional to the certification that the village is open defecation free and free of strewn garbage and plastics"". After it triggered criticism from Opposition parties and several people on social media, she suspended it."

A single-judge bench of Justice Suresh Gupte said, ""Merely because the BMC performs certain duties and exercises certain powers under a regulatory framework of law vis-a-vis private primary aided schools and provides grant in aid to such schools, it cannot be said that it has ultimate control over the affairs of these schools.""

""Many institutes, especially junior colleges, charge students very high fees in spite of being aided. Students have to pay between Rs 2,000 and Rs 10,000,"" said Vaishali Bafna, director, SYSCOM.

According to responses sought under the Right to Information Act by SYSCOM, the fee structure was last determined in 1978. While fees per annum for classes V to X in the Mumbai region are between Rs 75 and Rs 140, for junior college, they are in the range of Rs 150 and Rs 375.

Education commissioner Vishal Solanki told TOI, ""We understand that the fees haven't been revised in a long time.

This year, the percentage of vacant seats under the RTE quota in both aided and unaided schools has increased compared to the previous year.

Seats up

Officials attribute this to an increase in the number of seats, and the fact that very few parents choose to admit their children under RTE quota in aided schools as the medium of instruction in primary classes is in Kannada.

This year, 21.32% of the total 1.52 lakh seats are vacant, a marked increase from the 2017-18 academic year where only 15.2% of the total 1.28 lakh seats were vacant.

The number of vacant seats has increased from 19,647 last year to 32,440 this year. Statistics provided by the department show that 73% of the total 14,281 seats under the RTE quota in aided schools were vacant, while for unaided schools 15% of the 1.37 lakh seats were not filled.

Earlier only unaided schools had to reserve at least 25% of their seats to students belonging to weaker and disadvantaged sections in the neighbourhood.

Tamil Nadu in 1990-91 allowed government aided schools, administered by private management, to open English medium sections only for high and higher secondary students studying under the self-financing stream. Their counterparts studying in aided sections were not provided with this option.

In 2008-09, the method of collecting special fees from English medium students was abolished and schools were allowed to collect only a tuition fee of Rs.250-500 per year.

Against this backdrop, the state government in 2012-13 announced that English medium sections would be started in selected government schools located at rural areas. Accordingly, 22,400 students from 320 schools were enrolled in these sections in the particular year.

From then on, more and more students opted for English medium and at present more than 6.6 lakh government school students in Tamil Nadu study in English medium classes.

Against this backdrop, the state school education department has decided to extend this benefit to aided schools as well in order to reduce the migration to private matriculation schools.

The government, in its order dated July 20, has framed admission guidelines thereby restricting aided schools from creating new English medium sections. Instead they are allowed to divide the existing Tamil medium sections into two.

After division, the ratio between number of English and Tamil medium students in a school should be 50:50 and no additional fees should be collected from English medium students.

Experts say that this order would have a positive impact on aided schools which are managed by the government itself.

On the other hand, most aided schools, administered by private managements, already have English medium classes functional in their own institutions. These are administered either by using money from their own pockets or funds allocated towards Tamil medium sections, said Annamalai, a retired aided school teacher.

The government in its recent order has categorically said that funds will not be allocated for existing English medium sections under the self-financing stream and it will bear the cost incurred towards sections separated from Tamil medium.

Pradeep Yadav, state school education secretary, has directed all the District Elementary Education Officers (DEEOs) to inspect aided schools and verify whether they have adequate number of teachers to handle English medium sections and other necessary facilities before according permission to admit students."

The number of excess teachers did not match with the impressive increase in the number of students at public schools. The reason, according to officials, is that the spike in student enrolment was mostly limited to schools with impressive track records.

At present, Akshara Kaithotas exist in 407 schools of the district, most of which was raised last year. This year, they have planted them in 1,000 schools, which means almost all Akshara Dasoha schools have been covered.

Dr V P Niranjanaradhya, an expert at school education, said the Chief Minister will be known in the history for ""destroying public education"" by shutting down schools.

Another expert said, ""Instead of announcing this move, the Chief Minister should have announced a ban on permitting new private schools or disallowing private schools within a 5-6 km radius of government schools"".

MLC Arun Shahapura was equally caustic in his reaction, saying the fund earmarked for repairing state-run schools is too meagre. ""It looks like a budget to close down government schools. The CM thinks he can repair buildings of state government schools and PU colleges with '150 crore. I request him to visit over 78,000 government schools which are in pathetic conditions and later calculate the amount needed to repair them"".

Educationists working to strengthen government schools and improve the quality of education, have decided to launch a protest against the chief minister's announcement.

However, the department of primary and secondary education plans to provide transport facility to affected students after ""merger"" schools to help them reach the nearest functioning schools. ""There will be common points to pick up kids and drop them to schools and back,"" said a senior official. But there is now word about what will happen to the infrastructure of the schools which are going to be closed down.

Allocation to education goes down

The allocation to the education sector has gone down by a percentage point compared to the last budget presented by CM Siddaramaiah. Kumaraswamy has allocated 11 of the total budget outlay to the sector as against 12 per cent by Siddaramaiah. As most of the allocation goes to salaries of teachers, the department needs more funds for various schemes and projects.

What's new and what's old

Though opening of LKG/UKG classes in government schools is proposed in the budget, it is already being done at select schools on a pilot basis"

The court also directed the deputy education director to conduct .. a physical inspection of Alok Punj Senior Secondary School at Karawal Nagar in northeast Delhi to ascertain its other infrastructural inadequacies. The school was run earlier by a society, but was taken over by the Delhi government later.

The bench ordered the education department official to file a status report within 10 days after carrying out the inspection and listed the matter for further hearing on July 30.

With sufficient vacant land available in more than 95 per cent of the 1,423 Akshara Dasoha schools in the district, Dakshina Kannada Zilla Panchayat has planned to put the hitherto unused patches of land into better use by creating 'Akshara Kaithota' (kitchen gardens) in all schools that in turn will not only make mid-day meals more nutritious but will also help students connect with nature through education on farming.

At present, Akshara Kaithotas exist in 407 schools of the district, most of which was raised last year. This year, they have planted them in 1,000 schools, which means almost all Akshara Dasoha schools have been covered. The initiative has got a shot in the arm as it will be implemented under MGNREGA scheme by converging some programmes of the horticulture department.

ZP CEO M R Ravi said under MGNREGA, pits will be dug up and saplings of fruits and vegetables will be planted. Then the students and teachers will take care of them. A model is being worked out on the saplings to be planted. ""There is provision for papaya, mango, lemon and other plants under MNREGA. Apart from this, vegetables like drumstick, ladies finger, bottle guard, ridge gourd and so on will be planted,"" said the CEO.

Out of 1,000 schools where Akshara Kaithota has been planned this year, there is a vacant land of minimum one acre each in 730 schools. Some of the schools that are already growing vegetables and fruits are not only self-sufficient but are also generating income out of it. Schools in Madhya, Keddalike in Bantwal taluk and Devarakanna and Thodikanna in Sullia taluk among others are doing well.

Sources in Akshara Dasoha said the vegetable component in mid-day meal is very minimal and hence the Akshara Kaithota will be really helpful as it will ensure nutrition in mid-day meal plates."

Among Scheduled Caste (SC) communities, just nine students from government and government-aided schools seem to have a chance to get an MBBS seat, either in a government college or in government-quota seats in private colleges.

The analysis has been made with data Express obtained from sources in the School Education Department and by considering 2017 cut-off marks. In 2017, five students from government schools could secure MBBS seats. Government schools cater mainly to students in rural, financially and socially backward families. The main reason attributed is lack of access to resources to prepare for the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET), which is largely based on Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) syllabus. Specialised coaching, crucial to prepare for any competitive exam, is also beyond the geographical and economic reach of most students in rural areas, say educationists.

Data released by the State shows 1,344 students from government and government-aided schools qualified by scoring more than the minimum eligible marks. But only 10 scored over 300 and only 42 scored over 200, reliable School Education department sources said. Among the 42 who scored above 200, nine belong to SC communities. In 2017 medical admissions, the cut-off mark in SC category was 210. So, these nine students may stand a chance to get a seat in either government colleges or government quota seats in private colleges. However, given that most of them hail from poor families, affordability of private college fees may be a barried. In the ST category also, last year's cut-off was 210 marks.

Not a single student from ST communities who studied in a government or government-aided school scored over 200.Overall caste-wise data on NEET-qualified students in TN could not be accessed as officials said they did not prepare such data. But, CBSE data paints a similar picture nation-wide.

Classes hold the key as coaching centres make NEET profit

Mehrunisa Ahmed (name changed) is not very different from Anitha or Pradeepa - the two Dalit students from villages of Tamil Nadu who committed suicide after not getting a medical seat since the introduction of National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET).

All three are medical aspirants who are considered meritorious by their schools, but hail from poor families from marginalised communities. Mehrunisa was selected to be the cream of students from government schools and sent for a free month-long residential coaching before she attempted NEET. This was her only formal training for the exam.

Mehrunisa, finds herself in the cross-roads, just like how Pradeepa was last year. She scored 1,128 in her Class 12 State Board exam, and 175 in NEET, which puts her eligible for an MBBS seat. But with this marks she can get a management quota seat in a private college. ""But my parents will never be able to pay the fees,"" she rues. She has decided to take a gap of one year and attempt NEET again in 2019.

K Keerthana, the Tamil Nadu topper in NEET 2018, scored an All India Rank of 12, the highest for a student from Tamil Nadu till now. However, she comes from a socio-economic background that has given her a huge advantage when compared with her contemporaries like Mehrunisa in government schools.

Keerthana's parents could easily afford her a leading CBSE school in the heart of Chennai and special coaching classes since she was in Class IX. ""My coaching centre did all the planning, I just followed the schedule,"" she told Express. In JIPMER entrance too, she secured 5th rank. Even before NEET was introduced, students who went to private schools had an advantage in securing MBBS seats. But the numbers suggests that NEET is making an MBBS seat almost at unreachable levels for students from rural areas.

For example, in 2016 (the last year when admissions were made using Class XII board exam marks), 30 students from government schools could get a seat in government medical colleges. This is besides those who may get seats in government quota in private colleges. But in 2017, when the admissions were made based on NEET score, just two students from government schools could get a seat in government medical colleges.But this did not mean that academic excellence was overlooked when the admissions were made based on Class XII board exam marks. To get into any top government medical college, students had to meet the rough cut-off of at least 198 out of 200. Even students from marginalised communities will have to score over 98 per cent marks in Maths and Science subjects to secure a government seat.

""I scored 198 in biology, 199 in physics and centum in chemistry. I couldn't get into any government college in Chennai, but I found a seat in Tiruchy Government Medical College,"" said Naveen Kumaresan, a third-year medical student who was from the last batch of students who used board exam scores to get into medical courses.

Naveen's teachers saw a promising student in him when he scored 470 in Standard X State Board exam. He claimed that his school in Dharmapuri even funded half his higher secondary education, which came much to the relief of his family. His father is a cable operator and his mother does not work.""About 10 students from my school got into various medical colleges across the State. We were ambitious and we knew we had a fair chance at it. We had to compete with students in the syllabus we'd studied all our lives,"" he said. He added that many students in his batch were from districts across the State. ""Now, we have to search for village students among our juniors (who were admitted based on NEET score),"" he says adding that he could visibly see his junior class more dominated by students from affluent families, mainly from Chennai.

Educationalists too opine that introduction of NEET has mandated the need for coaching classes and destroys the social justice built in the Tamil Nadu education system.""A rich student who scored 190 has more chance of getting into a medical college over a poor one who scored 230,"" said educationalist Prince Gajendrababu, adding that NEET is boosting mediocrity in the name of bringing uniformity. Both schools and students will undermine the value of school education and give importance to clearing NEET or other exams alone, he said.

""This would mean that students will no longer find it relevant to question fundamentals in class if it's not going to feature in their competitive exam,"" he said.An exam like this which centres around urban students with access to NCERT text books would cut off access to Dalits in particular said D Ravikumar, from VCK.

""At least two-thirds of Dalit population lives in the rural areas and an exam that deprives rural students will affect Dalit students twice as much,"" he said. Most of these students cannot afford go to coaching classes to prepare for NEET, he claimed. Poor students from marginalised backgrounds will have to prove their merit over and over again, only to not succeed, he said.

While NEET on one side seems to exclude students who don't have access to coaching centres, it has also generated a massive commercial network that profits from it. About 1.4 lakh students from Tamil Nadu qualified in the exam. Even if half of them took coaching that cost them Rs 10,000, the industry is worth Rs 70 crore.

However, the calculation used here is far simplified as leading coaching centres charge even up to a lakh per student per year and students have started taking training from Class IX.""A few popular leading CBSE school in Chennai have increased their fees from Rs 1.1 lakh to nearly Rs two lakh promising parents that their children will be trained for NEET,"" said GR Ravindranath from Doctor's Association for Social Equality.

A Riaz, a NEET aspirant from a government school in North Chennai is adamant about pursuing MBBS. He too, like Mehrunisa was selected for government residential NEET coaching. While he scored 1155 in Class XII, his two-digit score in NEET has destabilised his confidence.""I don't know what I'll do. I came to take a year off to study as my parents can't afford it. I need to finish my education quick to start earning and I don't see myself becoming a doctor through any other way except NEET,"" he said.

Even as the enrolment figures at three major districts are still awaited, the number of students who newly joined the government and aided schools in the rest of the state has touched 1. 6 lakh.

The number of new admissions at government and aided schools are decided by considering the classroom attendance on the sixth working day after the school reopening. The sixth working day of the year was on Friday. Schools in Malappuram, Kozhikode and Wayanad districts and Thalassery education district in Kannur are yet to be reopened following Nipah virus threat. Once schools in these districts also open on June 12, the number of students who have freshly joined the government and aided schools would further increase. Last year, the total number of students turned up for fresh admission in government/aided schools was 1.46 lakh.

Meanwhile, the campaign to set up 45,000 smart classrooms is also nearing completion. Kerala infrastructure and technology for education (KITE) vice-chairman and executive director K Anvar Sadath said the smart classroom project has almost completed. As many as 39,000 smart classrooms have already been set up and the work of the rest would also be completed in two months, he said.

According to sources in the School Education department, 9,154 students from various government and government-aided schools appeared for the exam. This means that only 14.60 per cent of students from these schools cleared the exam as opposed to 41.72 per cent (45,336 students of 1,05,448 students) from private schools including CBSE schools. Less than 25 students cleared the exam, from almost half the districts. The highest number of students who cleared the exam came from Tirunelveli (195 students) and Kanniyakumari (173) and the least number of students came from Villupuram (9) and Thanjavur (3).

Were the coaching classes run by government not useful at all then? Students disagree. A Riaz, a student, who took up the residential course given by the government, scored 153 in NEET-2018. He claimed that coaching was the only reason why he qualified in the exam. ""We were made to write at least 10 mock tests and they simulated the exam environment so well that we didn't panic during the exam,"" he said.

While he is uncertain if he will get a medical seat, he said that if he had had extra training, he would have been able to score more.

""The coaching centre set out a schedule that I promptly followed for two years,"" she said adding that last-minute preparations would barely help score well in competitive exams.

Due to this, we have to travel to far off schools as there has not been a streamlined adequate process of appointment."" In addition, teachers have also demanded for the old pension scheme to be applicable for all and 100 per cent aid to be given to all teachers who are serving in government aided schools.

This negligence by the state government has forced teachers to shift to private unaided schools, international schools or move to other states. Akansha Japtap, a teacher said, ""We are compelled to try other opportunities like working for private schools or other international schools due to this reluctant attitude of the state. In private schools we can at least get our due salaries, benefits and financial help on time. Some of us have even shifted abroad or to other states as the facilities provided for teachers are better and lucrative.""

Also, they have demanded an inquiry of all education officers, management, schools and educational institutes involved in corrupt activities. Pandya added, ""A strict inquiry should be done of all officers and personnel involved in halting the processes of appointment of teachers, issuing salaries and pension plans. We cannot be victims of corruption any more."" Teachers claimed they want their demands to be fulfilled before this academic year begins in June as corruption needs to be wiped out."

This is the second article of a multi-part series on state versus private school enrolment across the country.

The union Ministry of Human Resource Development conducted a National Achievement Survey (NAS) across the nation in November 2017. Focussing on four subjects which included Language, Mathematics (for classes 3, 5 and 8), Environmental Sciences (for classes 3 and 5), Science and Social Sciences (for class 8), the survey was carried out in government-aided schools. Text booklets with 45 questions for classes 3 and 5, and 60 questions for class 8 were prepared. The questions developed for these booklets were curated taking into consideration the learning outcomes incorporated in the central rules for Right To Education Act by the Government of India.

Touted as one of the largest surveys to be conducted across the world, it inculcated over 2.2 million students from over 100,000 schools across 700 districts. In all states and Union Territories.

Currently, the states of Assam, Bihar, Odisha, Maharashtra, West Bengal, and Gujarat have the highest percentage of students enrolled in government schools. On the other end of the scale, we have Haryana, Rajasthan, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, and Punjab with lowest percentage of enrolments in government schools.

Assam: With over 85 per cent of its students enrolled in government schools, the state of Assam had the participation of 27 districts with over 4,000 schools and 80,000 students. As per the data derived from the website of NAS, the performance from class 3 to 8 presents a visible decline. For instance, students of class 3 were able to answer 72 per cent of the language questions correctly. However, the number declined to 60 per cent for class 5 and 54 per cent for class 8. However, the state has fared well against the national average, even though the performance of students in class 8 must be looked at with concern. Compared to over 50 per cent students of class 3, merely 16.4 per cent students of class 8 were able to secure over 75 per cent in the language questions.

Bihar: With over 75 per cent of its students enrolled in government schools, Bihar makes for an interesting case study, given the social factors in play. Given the state's obsession with the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) and other public service exams, the performance in mathematics must be deliberated. Students of class 3 were able to answer 63 per cent of the questions. The percentage fell to 52 and 45 for class 5 and 8 respectively. In the language section, a decline was seen from 67 to 57 and eventually, 58 per cent for class 8. While 41.1 per cent students in class 3 secured in excess of 75 per cent in language, the number fell to 23 per cent for class 8. Sadly, merely 8.6 per cent of the students of class 8 were able to secure more than 75 per cent for questions in science with one-third not being able to secure even 33 per cent for the questions asked. Compared to the national average, the story of Bihar is more or less the story of India.

Gujarat: The catalyst in the ascent of Narendra Modi, Gujarat, with over 75 per cent enrolments in government schools fares better than the national average when it comes to learning outcomes. However, it finds itself in the same declining performance trap as Assam and Bihar. The students of class 8, as the data shows, were only able to answer 47 per cent questions pertaining to mathematics, 52 per cent pertaining to science, and 54 per cent pertaining to social science. With a majority of students from classes 3, 5, and 8 being able to secure 50-75 per cent for the questions asked, the state has a low percentage of students securing less than 30 per cent in the performance slab, signifying the healthy state of government schools across the state. However, a lot of critical ends are still required to be fixed.

Gujarat in Numbers: National Achievement Survey 2017 Gujarat in Numbers: National Achievement Survey 2017 (Data Sourced from http://mhrd.gov.in/NAS/)

Maharashtra: The financial mitochondria of India, Maharashtra, had almost 80 per cent students enrolled in government schools during 2014-15. While the students of class 3 and 5 fared better than the national average, a sharp slump was witnessed in the performance of class 8 students. Students of class 8 were able to answer only 40 per cent questions in mathematics and science, and 42 in social science. The situation grows even more deplorable if one looks at the distribution of students achievements. Over 37 per cent of the class 8 students could not secure 33 per cent in maths and science. Merely 7 and 6.5 per cent students of the same class could secure over 75 per cent for questions in maths and science respectively. For a state that has a huge dependency on government schools, the situation of its senior students is alarming indeed.

Maharashtra in Numbers: National Achievement Survey 2017 Maharashtra in Numbers: National Achievement Survey 2017

West Bengal and Odisha, the two other states with government school enrolments exceeding 84 per cent, the situation is no better. Over 42 per cent students of class 8 in West Bengal were not able to secure 33 per cent in maths and science. The situation reverses for the worse from class 3 to 8, as the data from NAS shows, in West Bengal. Merely 5 per cent of the students were able to secure over 75 per cent in the social science exam. The numbers for Odisha are also on the same lines.

Clearly, Punjab and Haryana, with their increased urbanisation and enhanced standards of living have lesser number of students in government schools. However, the assessment results from Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh offer some more insights.

Punjab: The state of Punjab falters against the national average. While this could be attributed to the lack of infrastructure in the rural areas and other social factors in play, it does warrant urgent attention. Class 8 students were only able to answer 31 per cent of the questions pertaining to mathematics, 37 for science, and 35 for social science. The situation is a little better for students for class 3 and 5, yet far below what the national average is. With over 55 per cent of the students still enrolled in government schools, the state must rethinking its education strategy or risk falling behind. A shocking 56.7 per cent of class 8 students were not able to secure one-third of the marks in maths. Merely 2 per cent of class 8 students examined could secure more than 75 per cent in the same subject.

Punjab in Numbers: National Achievement Survey 2017 Punjab in Numbers: National Achievement Survey 2017

Haryana: A state that should have its own Olympics team, Haryana has seen government school enrolments drop in recent years with the current percentage at 48.8. Quite like Punjab, the state falters against the national average with a visible performance decline from class 3 to class 8. With merely 4.2 per cent of class 8 students securing over 75 per cent in mathematics, 6.4 per cent in social science, and 7.1 per cent in science, the state, like its neighbour, warrants urgent rethinking of education. Located in the vicinity of the national capital, the state must look to benefit from the resources available. Interestingly, Chandigarh, the capital of both Punjab and Haryana, fared well against the national average. The variation within this region alone depicts the education quality gap that must be bridged between the rural and urban areas.

Haryana in Numbers: National Achievement Survey 2017 Haryana in Numbers: National Achievement Survey 2017

Rajasthan: With government school enrolments less than 50 per cent, the state, surprisingly, fares far better than the national outcome. The performance decline from class 3 to 8 is present, but not as significant as it is in other states. For all tests and classes, the students were able to answer more than 55 per cent of the questions asked in any subject. For students of class and securing over 75 per cent in the subjects, the numbers look quite strong. Clearly, the state presents an interesting case study for its contemporaries to replicate if they intend to fix their houses.

Rajasthan in Numbers: National Achievement Survey 2017 Rajasthan in Numbers: National Achievement Survey 2017

Uttar Pradesh: The state with the highest population, it warrants a thriving educational setup under government control for it ensures accessibility, affordability, and to some extent, accountability. However, the numbers from the state do not fare well against the national average, as the data shows. The performance decline from class 3 to 8 is again visible. For class 8, the percentage of students securing over 75 per cent in maths, science, and social science, is in a single digit. On the other side, close to 40 per cent of the students from the same class could not secure 33 per cent in maths, science, and social science.

Uttar Pradesh in Numbers: National Achievement Survey 2017 Uttar Pradesh in numbers: National Achievement Survey 2017

The survey presents some observations. One of them is that the RTE Act is a failure of mammoth proportions. Given that the government schools follow the syllabus prescribed by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and have NCERT books, one cannot attribute the performance decline from class 3 to 8 to tougher syllabus. Also, it is not possible for states to have better teachers in class 3 or 5 alone.

Given that the RTE mandates not failing a student till class 8, the performance decline has to be attributed to this practice of not holding students back. Clearly, the pressure keeps on piling up, and adds to the weakening numbers in senior classes. This also adds to the dropout numbers, as students, unable to cope up after class 8, give up on their education. The national average further proves this point, as there is a visible performance decline from class 3 to 8. In an essential subject like mathematics alone, the percentage of questions answered decreases from 64 per cent in class 3 to 42 per cent in class 8.

The affordability of private schools continues to remain a distant dream for many, even in urban areas, and therefore, for years to come, the health of our government schools will reflect the learning potential of our nation. A student can definitely do more by repeating a class in his early years than by dropping out of school at the age of 14. And getting rid of the RTE can prove to be the essential giant leap in order to fix this problem."

However, her salary is nowhere near the one paid to those teaching at government schools. While a teacher with a government pre-primary draws a salary of '19,000, the amount that a teacher at an aided school gets varies from '1,000 to '4,500. Santhi finds this disparity a gross injustice. Even the ayahs at these schools are a deprived lot.

According to All Kerala Pre-primary Teachers and Helpers Organisation secretary Vijaya Shoma, the government is yet to recognise the pre-primary sections in aided schools as part of the institutions. ""Because of this, no pay scale exists for pre-primary teachers in aided schools. This is a huge injustice,"" she said.

Shoma said when the division fall began to affect schools, both government and aided, the authorities decided to begin pre-primary sections. ""The government even gave funds to carry out mid-day meal schemes at these schools,"" she said.

Hence, it becomes very evident that the government is well aware of the existence of these pre-primary sections, she said.

""The pre-primary sections that came into being before 2012 have been recognised by the government and they are provided with funds for the mid-day meal scheme. But the unlucky ones are those that were set up after 2012. Teachers at these schools have to share funds allotted for the primary section in order to feed students,"" she said.

The teachers are ruing their plight.

""Many of us don't even get the honorarium that we used to receive earlier. The paltry amount that ranges from Rs 1,000 to Rs 4,000 nowhere covers our expenses. The plight of the ayahs or helpers is even worse. In many schools, there are no ayahs at all. The teachers have to do that job too,"" she said.

According to Shoma, these pre-primary teachers who have qualifications at par with those who have been appointed through PSC are worthy of and eligible to draw the salary stipulated by the government.

""But alas, nobody hears our plea. We had time and again petitioned the government. We even went before the commission that was formed to study the problems faced by the pre-primary section. But all have come to nought,"" she said.

According to the teachers, when they filed an RTI query seeking the report filed by the commission, they were told it is not ready. ""The entire thing is confusing. The commission was to file the report in June last year. But they filed it only in February this year. When we tried to gain access to the report via RTI, we were told it was yet to be filed. So, we approached the Education Minister, who said the report has been filed but can't be published since the government has to study it in detail,"" she said.

Training is also becoming a problem for them. ""Recently, the SCERT had issued a circular that a textbook published by them has be taught at pre-primary classes in government schools.

They had even organised a training camp for the teachers at these schools. But now they have issued another circular saying the book has to be used by pre-primary sections in aided schools too.

We don't know anything about the book nor have been given any training. The entire thing is a big jolt for us. Hence, we want the government to organise a training camp for us too. We don't want to be kept in the dark,"" she said.

Shoma and her colleagues are at a loss as to whom they should turn to, and are planning to go on a strike after May 20. Meanwhile, repeated attempts to contact the authorities concerned didn't bear fruit."

The saving grace for these management schools is that they can source the government share from the Asset Management Fund of the local legislator if the budget allocation is not available under the Challenge Fund.

The Challenge Fund was originally mooted by the Finance Minister in his 2017 budget speech promising to earmark ₹50 crore as its corpus. According to the guidelines, the Challenge Fund will be available for the construction or repair of school buildings, renovating or establishing library or laboratory, smart classrooms, renovation of school stadiums, toilet construction, noon meal kitchen and dining hall and drinking water facilities as per an approved master plan.

Single-management schools from lower primary to higher secondary schools are eligible for funding subject to a limit of ₹1 core, including the government and management share, depending on the school category. The government has also fixed the minimum number of students needed for each of these categories in the rural and urban areas to be eligible for assistance.

The Challenge Fund will be available for schools in the coastal and tribal belts, welfare schools, but single management schools will get the first priority. Schools which had been selected for funding under the Public Education Rejuvenation Campaign (PERC), another scheme aimed at upgrading 1,000 schools as Centres of Excellence, will not be eligible for the Challenge Fund. Around 100 schools have already been selected under the PERC.

The State is in the midst of a controversy over closure of uneconomic schools, including aided. There is no data available on the number of aided schools under single management, but it is common knowledge that a large number of single management institutions are reeling under drop in enrolment of students owing to poor facilities and competition from indiscriminate sanctioning of schools in the unaided sector. Owners of single management schools say many of them did not have the ability to mobilise their share and had expressed their reservations about the operation of the Challenge Fund."

The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) survey-2017 released on Friday revealed that school students in the district were below state average in learning outcomes.

However, there is a reason to rejoice as Coimbatore students have scored way above their counterparts in several other districts.

According to the survey, the average performance of Class III students in Mathematics was 55% against the state average of 61 %. Class V students too lag a little behind the state average. In the case of Class VIII students, the downward fall in learning outcomes was more stark as they fared even bad at 33 %, two percentage points lower than the state average.

This trend of fall in learning outcomes as the students progressed from Class III to VIII was seen across the state in Mathematics. But there was reversal of this trend when it came to language studies as the students showed significant increase in learning outcomes as they grew up the ladder. While Class III students of Coimbatore was below the state average of 61.48 %, they seemed to improve as they reached Class VIII, up by almost five percentage points from the state average of 57.66%.

The National Achievement Survey, as NCERT calls it, was conducted for Class III, V and VIII of government and aided schools in November last for language, maths, environmental studies and social science.

The move was aimed at checking corruption in the appointments to schools, he said while replying to a submission moved by M. Swaraj. The proposed online system would be introduced for appointments to aided schools from pre-primary to higher-secondary level.

Rules to be amended

Applications for appointment would be accepted and processed online, he said, adding that the Kerala Education Rules would be suitably amended for the new system. Earlier, raising the issue, Mr. Swaraj said the appointment of teachers and non teaching staff to aided schools was mired in corruption.

Mr. Ravindranath told the House that 141 schools across the State would be equipped with hi-tech classrooms by June this year. The tendering process for the government-funded project was expected to be completed soon, he said, replying to a submission moved by Mons Joseph.

Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac said the treasury network in the State was being upgraded to make transactions possible through any bank.

Replying to a submission by T.V. Ibrahim, he said the system would obviate the need to open new sub-treasuries.

Dams to be de-silted

Water Resources Minister Mathew T. Thomas said the government had embarked on a project to construct more check-dams and ensure capacity utilisation of water-treatment plants, under plans to tackle water scarcity during the summer months ahead."

This will see nearly 3,000 aided schools and over 18,000 additional seats coming within the ambit of the RTE Act, said officials of the Department of Public Instruction (DPI). There are currently over 1.28 lakh seats available in over 11,900 unaided schools.

Until now, only unaided schools were reserving 25% of their seats for students from weaker sections and disadvantaged groups. These schools receive reimbursement based on the students they admit under the quota.

According to Section 12 (1)(b) of the RTE Act, aided schools would have to provide free and compulsory elementary education to the children admitted based on the annual recurring aid or grants, subject to a minimum of 25%. However, aided schools will not receive any reimbursement for admitting the students.

There is mixed response to this move. Some schools feel waiving fees for students under the quota may not work out for them financially as they charge nominal fees from other students. ""By reserving some seats without reimbursement, we may not be able to meet infrastructural requirements,"" said a management representative.

However, for others there is a sense that at least through RTE quota, currently empty classrooms may get a fresh lease of life. ""We are all Kannada-medium schools and are struggling to survive. We will admit students if they opt for seats through the RTE quota,"" said a school representative.

The DPI has announced the calender of events for RTE events, and parents can file online applications for their wards between February 20 and March 21. The first round of seats will be allotted on April 6.

Private school have been asked to fill the remaining 75% of seats only after the three-rounds of RTE admissions are completed by May 30.

However, private schools are unhappy with the move, and said they will defy the order. D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary, Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka (KAMS) said there is always a delay in RTE admissions as seen over the past three years, and they cannot take a risk in admissions over the next academic year."

The provisional results of the first-ever nationwide competency test, conducted by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) over a couple of months ago, indicate that class III students of the sample schools in Karnataka outperformed pupils of the same class in other states.

A total of 75.6% of class III students from Karnataka fared well in the test.

Class V students, too, beat their counterparts from across the country. As many as 69% of the class V students from Karnataka showed a satisfactory level of performance in the test.

The results, however, placed Class VIII students from schools in Karnataka at the second position with 54.8% students showing a satisfactory level of learning achievements.

The Class VIII students from Rajasthan topped the test. A total of 62% students from Rajasthan performed well.

At the national level, the percentage of students who performed well came at 65.7%, 56.5% and 46.8% for classes III, V and VIII, respectively.

The NCERT conducted the test on November 13 to assess the learning outcome of the students in four subjects - Language, Mathematics, Science and Social Science.

About 25 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools across 700 districts in all 29 states and 7 Union Territories took the 120-minute examination.

Students were asked to answer 15 questions in each of the subjects, based on the parameters fixed for assessment of the minimum learning outcome of the pupils under the Right to Education Rules, notified by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD).

The NCERT had initially targeted to cover about 36 lakh students of 1.20 lakh government-run and aided schools in the test to assess the class-wise and subject-wise learning achievement.

""Provisional results indicate that the girls of classes III and V performed better than the boys of same classes in all categories. Class VIII girls performance in the test remained marginal,"" an official said.

By and large, the performance of students from rural areas remained well, the official added.

HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar released the district-wise provisional results. The NCERT is racing against time to come up with a report by March."

This move by the state government is part of a framework of new guidelines for admissions to schools. The admission criteria drawn up is nearly identical to the earlier one issued almost a decade ago, except that students living within a five kilometer radius of a school will now get upto 60% weightage in the admission process. Also, unlike the old guidelines, students of school staff and management, children of single parents and of transferrable employees will no longer get preference in the admission process.

For the Panaji-based schools that recently shifted to the Cujira school complex, the radius will be calculated as per the original location of the school.

School managements have been told that they can allot 20% of the total seats in the school as per their discretion, but cannot collect excess fees for these seats. This is as per the earlier guidelines.

DoE has also worked out different distance criteria for students at the primary, middle and secondary school levels for admissions. At the primary school level, students who live within a kilometer radius of the institute will earn 60% marks in the admission process right away. At the middle school level, children living within three kilometers and, at the secondary school level, those living within five kilometers of the school will get 60% marks in the admission process.

A child will earn an additional 10 marks if his or her sibling is already studying in the same school and if parents are ex-students of the school, this will add another 10 marks to the child's score. Both these criteria were existing as per the old admission guidelines. School managements have also been given the discretion to frame their own specific criteria, which will get upto 20% weightage. This provision was also available as per the old guidelines.

The preference for students who have excelled in sports and at extra-curricular activities and who are children of ex-servicemen will also continue.

'The headmaster of the school has to identify the habitation/localities around the school jurisdiction, of their distance, and announce on the school notice board in advance. A provisional list should be announced calling objections from parents/guardiance before finalising the admission list,' the circular by the director of education, GP Bhat, states.

Parents will have to produce a residence certificate, election card, ration card, telephone bill, property tax receipt of their residence and aadhar card for admissions.

the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). A private-aided school Amarnath high school in Govandi has not received any grants since last ten years.

The school's primary section, which has around 500 students, is facing financial crunch resulting in lack of good quality teachers and poor facilities for its students.

Technically, the grants given by the government are used to pay the salaries of teaching and non-teaching staff. Another type of grant provided to the school is the non-salary grant which is used to maintain infrastructure and pay electricity bill of the school building. However, the school has not been given either of the grants.

""The fees we get from our students are not enough for us to maintain the school's infrastructure, extra activities and the salaries of our teachers. We are somehow managing, but the important thing is the students' education which is now at stake as the teachers' quality is affected because of less salary,"" said Jyoti Patil, the school principal. She has been working in the school for the past 21 years.

Like Ms Patil, 80 per cent of the staff in the school has been working for more than ten years.

""In the year 2007, the BMC gave this school the recognition which means they are supposed to pay grants for the primary section. However, now it's 2018 and still not a single money has come to us,"" said Ms Patil.

An official of the BMC's education department said, ""It is not just this school, but all the private-aided schools are going the same trouble.""

""First of all, we aren't receiving any money from the state, which we are supposed to forward to the schools through us. If we get the funds, we shall provide the money,"" the civic education official explained.

""Not more than '250 is taken from our children as they also belong to financially low-income families but if the state refuses to pay us money, we won't be left with any option but to accept donations,"" said the principal of a Bandra-based school."
