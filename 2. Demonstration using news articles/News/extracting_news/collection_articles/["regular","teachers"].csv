Class 10 students in Kashmir's Pulwama & Shopian districts excelled with highest pass percentage, even though schools there were closed for more than 100 days.

New Delhi: Community schooling and continuous efforts by the locals is what led to excellent Class 10 results in south Kashmir's Pulwama and Shopian districts, the most disturbed region in the Kashmir Valley last year, say local residents and students.

The Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education (JKBOSE) announced the Class 10 results for Kashmir division on Saturday, and Pulwama and Shopian districts in south Kashmir recorded the highest pass percentage. While Pulwama recorded a pass percentage of 84.5 per cent, the pass percentage in Shopian was 83 per cent. Both these figures are higher than that of Srinagar, which recorded a pass percentage of 81.9 per cent.

The overall pass percentage in Kashmir this year was 75.44, compared to 62.94 last year.

According to the state government data, in 2018, schools in Pulwama district were shut for 170 days and, in Shopian they were closed for 118 days by the administration due to fear of disturbance. This shutdown was apart from the number of regular holidays that the students got.

During the 2016 unrest in Kashmir following the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani, 32 school buildings were burnt and most of them were in south Kashmir. In 2017, the HRD Ministry had devised a roadmap for Kashmir to improve the education scenario in the state. Construction of school buildings was also a part of the ministry's plan. However, no construction has happened so far in Pulwama and Shopian districts.

While the district administration credited the government's efforts for the results, school teachers said it was largely because of the intervention by the local residents.

""Schools were shut down for most part of the academic year and there was no way they could have completed their syllabus. It was largely because the locals ran community schools for students in several parts of the districts, that they were able to study,"" said Masood Taing, a teacher at a government school in Shopian.

Community schools are like coaching classes, where a couple of teachers gather to teach students either at somebody's home or a community centre, depending on availability. There are more community schools in rural Kashmir than in urban areas.

""We used to study at home most of the time because schools were shut. We used to write down all the doubts and clarify them with our teachers when schools reopened. Community schools also shut down during curfew in the town, (but) they were mostly open in villages,"" said Abid Hassan, a student from Pulwama district who scored 88 per cent.

Reham Mir, who scored 90 per cent marks, also said he studied at home and with the help of a community school.

Malik Mohammad, a resident of Pulwama, praised the efforts of the students in south Kashmir.

""Schools were closed for more than five months in Pulwama district. How can one expect students to finish their syllabus? Despite all these odds they have managed to study and not just study, get excellent results. All of this is because they are self-motivated and get help from locals who run community schools,"" Mohammad said.

""Students from south Kashmir are traditionally known to be excellent in studies because they know that they will not get support from schools, so they have to be self-dependent,"" he added.

G.N. Itoo, director of school education, gave all the credit to students. ""Despite all the problems students have shown excellent results in Shopian and Pulwama. They are all very hard-working students,"" he said.

Class X students in Pulwama & Shopian excelled with highest pass percentage, even though schools there were closed for more than 100 days

New Delhi: Community schooling and continuous efforts by the locals is what led to excellent Class X results in south Kashmir's Pulwama and Shopian districts, the most disturbed region in the Kashmir Valley last year, say locals and students.

The Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education (JKBOSE) announced the Class X results for Kashmir division on Saturday, and Pulwama and Shopian districts in south Kashmir recorded the highest pass percentage.

According to the state government data, in 2018, schools in Pulwama district were shut down for 170 days and the ones in Shopian were closed for 118 days by the administration due to fear of disturbance. This shutdown was apart from the number of regular holidays that the students got. Despite that, students in both these districts have managed to beat all other districts of Kashmir.

While the district administration credited the government's efforts for the results, school teachers said that it was largely because of the intervention by the locals.

This is a list of ten articles that were read the most on The Wire in 2018. They were on topics as diverse as the depiction of women in Bollywood, media exposés, the PM's Research Fellowship and the realities of the education system in India. And they're worth revisiting on this last day of the year: for a snapshot of 2018's most popular preoccupations.

1. 'At The End of Your Magnum Opus... I Felt Reduced to a Vagina - Only'

In an open letter to director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, actor Swara Bhaskar spelled out how his movie Padmaavat glorified Jauhar and Sati, and reduced women to simply being ""walking talking vaginas"". Condoning such practices at a time when 'honour' killings and the practice of Female Genital Mutilation only aid in propelling patriarchal, misogynist and problematic ideas is a mistake, she argues.

Practices like Sati, Jauhar, FGM, Honour Killings should not be glorified because they don't merely deny women equality, they deny women personhood. They deny women humanity. They deny women the right to life. And that is wrong. One would have assumed that in 2018, this is not a point that even needs to be made; but apparently, it does. Surely, you wouldn't consider making a film glorifying FGM or Honour Killings!

The context of art, any art is the time and place when it was created and consumed. And that's why this gang-rape infested India, this rape condoning mindset, this victim blaming society is the actual context of your film, Sir. Surely in this context, you could have offered some sort of a critique of Sati and Jauhar in your film?

2. Cobrapost Sting: Big Media Houses Say Yes to Hindutva, Black Money, Paid News

Second on the list is a deep dive into the Cobrapost exposé which revealed how some of the biggest names in the Indian media agreed to business proposals by an undercover reporter seeking the promotion of the Hindutva agenda.

For the sting, an undercover journalist, Pushp Sharma, posed as ""Acharya Atal"", a man who identified himself as a representative of an unnamed ""sangathan"", or organisation, but who gave the impression that he was a member of or close to the Nagpur-based Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS).

The biggest name to be stung by Cobrapost was Times Group owner and managing director Vineet Jain. In a number of videotaped conversations, Jain and the group's executive president, Sanjeev Shah, can be seen and heard discussing the proposed deal in which Acharya Atal said he would pay Rs 500 crore in exchange for advertorials and events that that would be presented as programming on Krishna and the Bhagvad Gita but which would serve as a cover for Hindutva and its political agenda.

3. Why I Am Resigning From the BJP

In an open letter to the BJP, Shivam Shankar Singh, who worked on the BJP's election campaigns in the Northeast, broke down why he could not support the BJP any more even though he had believed Narendra Modi was a ray of hope in 2014.

Hindu khatre mein hai - they've ingrained it into the minds of people that Hindus and Hinduism are in danger, and that Modi is the only option to save ourselves. In reality Hindus have been living the same lives much before this government and nothing has changed except people's mindset. Were we Hindus in danger in 2007? At least I didn't hear about it everyday and I see no improvement in the condition of Hindus, just more fear mongering and hatred.

Speak against the government and you're anti-national and more recently, anti-Hindu. Legitimate criticism of the government is shut up with this labelling. Prove your nationalism, sing Vande Mataram everywhere (even though BJP leaders don't know the words themselves, they'll force you to sing it!). I'm a proud nationalist and my nationalism won't allow me to let anyone force me to showcase it. I will sing the national anthem and national song with pride when the occasion calls for it, or when I feel like it, but I won't let anyone force me to sing it based on their whims.

4. With Ministers Like These, Every Day Must Be Science Day

There's a lot that India can do to improve the cause of science within its borders and but doesn't because of the way it thinks about the subject. Perhaps the most notable example is Science Day itself - one day reserved to celebrating science when in fact that should be every day. Its historical basis doesn't inspire much confidence either.

We're not faced with a group of ministers bungling their jobs but a group that knows exactly what it's doing: angle for what they say is the 'national interest', and force everything else to tag along. By cornering our reasons to celebrate science into the confines of a single workday, we're at risk of abetting what our ministers are doing: abdicating responsibilities towards science on other days.

... Science is an everyday endeavour; celebrate it, scrutinise it, share it, demand it on every day of the year. Just the same way marking 'Earth Hour' is doing nothing to help Earth if you're not going to have environmentally conscious daily routines, you might as well not mark 'Science Day' if you're going to mark it on just one day.

5. Why Modi Walked Out in 2007 and the BJP Now Shuns Me

In the fifth spot is an excerpt from Karan Thapar's book Devil's Advocate: The Untold Story that told the complete tale of his infamous interview with Narendra Modi in 2007 where the future prime minister ended the interview abruptly when Thapar raised questions about the 2002 Gujarat riots.

'Why can't you say that you regret the killings that happened? Why can't you say maybe the government should have done more to protect Muslims?'

'What I have to say I have said at that time, and you can find out my statements.'

'Just say it again.'

'Not necessary I have to talk about in 2007 everything you want to talk about.'

'But by not saying it again, by not letting people hear the message repeatedly, you are allowing an image that is contrary to the interest of Gujarat to continue. It's in your hands to change it.'

Right through the two or three minutes this exchange lasted, Narendra Modi's face remained expressionless. But it was also clear he wasn't happy. His eyes were cold and hard. Perhaps he was making an effort to keep his face calm and steady. But now his patience or, perhaps, his resolve snapped. He had had enough and ended the interview. With the words 'I have to rest. I need some water' he started to take the microphone off.

6. Exclusive: Punya Prasun Bajpai Reveals the Story Behind His Exit From ABP News

In an explosive exclusive in August, former ABP News anchor Punya Prasun Bajpai wrote about the circumstances of his departure from the channel and the official diktats which preceded it.

Say, a channel does not confine itself to showing the Modi regime in a positive light at all times but occasionally includes stories with a negative tone or, on the basis of facts, shows the Modi government's truth to be a lie. Immediately, BJP spokespersons are told to stop appearing on those channels; that is, they do not participate in any political discussion conducted by that channel.

This started happening on ABP News from the last week of June this year - BJP spokespersons stopped appearing on its debates. A few days later, BJP leaders stopped giving bytes to the channel. The day the truth of the Prime Minister's 'Mann ki Baat' was outed on Masterstroke, RSS ideologues too were told to stay off the channel.

7. IAS Officer Being 'Taught a Lesson' for Taking on Modi, Says Family

At the seventh position is a story by Gaurav Vivek Bhatnagar that blew the lid off the harassment faced by an IAS officer in Gujarat for having acted against Narendra Modi.

IAS officer Pradeep Sharma spent another day in Sabarmati central jail in Ahmedabad on Friday even as his son is getting married in the United States since a special anti-corruption court in Bhavnagar on March 27 denied him bail - both regular as well as temporary for a week - to view his son's wedding from India via a video link, and the high court too refused an urgent hearing in the matter.

A close relative of Sharma insisted that the family was clear in its mind that Pradeep Sharma - who has seen 10 FIRs being filed against him over the last eight years - has suffered all these years ""because of that girl"" who is at the centre of what has come to be known as the Snoopgate scandal.

8. Can't Find 'Vikas' or #AccheDin? Check Narendra Modi's Twitter Timeline

Next is Karnika Kohli's unravelling of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Twitter feed and his conspicuous silences on issues that took the country by storm.

Like Manmohan Singh, Modi the prime minister has remained conspicuously quiet about issues that make his government look bad. While he is quick to wish his foreign counterparts on their birthdays - and express condolences after minor attacks in their countries - Akhlaq's brutal lynching, people who lost their lives waiting in queues after demonetisation, cow vigilantism, the Una lynching, the brutal rapes in Kathua and Unnao and many other incidents didn't make the cut.

Predictably, the prime minister has maintained a stoic silence on the police firing in which 12 people protesting the Sterlite unit in Thoothukudi were killed on May 22. People in the coastal Tamil Nadu town have been protesting for over 100 days, claiming that the unit is polluting the environment and has resulted in illnesses.

9. One Year On, the PM's Research Fellowship Is off to a Sputtering Start

The first year of the PM's Research Fellowship, already much criticised for severe conceptual issues, didn't help its cause. The MHRD awarded only 135 scholars with the fellowship out of a promised 1,000 and didn't clarify how the money allocated for the unselected 865 would be used. Together with a host of other issues, this only strengthens the impression that the government wanted to rebut in the first place: that the PMRF has been ""designed to pile privilege on privilege"".

The 1,800 students who applied from this pool of candidates were those who had already cleared many levels of implicit selection. An analysis of the student composition of IITs shows that not all economic and social backgrounds have equal representation in these elite institutions. There is a whole chain of filters based on economic and caste status, quality of schooling, the ability to afford the coaching required to clear the various entrance exams, and the ability to pay the prohibitively expensive fees that several of these institutes charge - along with hostel fees, mess fees and peer-pressured booze and pizza fees, which introduce inequality in the opportunity available to Indian students to avail a world-class education. It is only a half-joke that the IISc is often called the ""Iyer-Iyengar Institute of Science"".

10. A Sick Society That Manufactures Failures - the True Face of Education in India

In a scathing attack on the education system in India and how it destroys young minds, Avijit Pathak defines why the idea of 'success' has failed students.

Anyone familiar with school education in India knows how parents and teachers pressurise children to opt for science/commerce even if they are not inclined to it. In fact, many of them are never given the space to look at themselves, and understand their unique traits and aptitudes. This is the beginning of alienation in the child's life. This alienation is further intensified when the societal pressure restricts their imagination, and forces them to believe that life is necessarily dark and bleak without medical science/engineering/management.

In this reckless preparation for 'success' their alienated selves find no joy, no ecstasy; coaching centres have no humour, guide books are devoid of creative imagination, 'success mantras' require war strategies, not the spirit of wonder, and the joy of learning is replaced by the neurotic urge to be a 'topper'.

However, this 'success', as I wish to argue, has its own discontents. The reason is that, for most of them, it is an immensely alienating experience. It kills one's creativity; it makes one one-dimensional; it robs one of the spirit of positive life-energy."

(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). With effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions.

The Samagra Shiksha scheme focuses on improvement of quality of education by providing support for different interventions like; in-service training of teachers and schools heads, conduct of achievement surveys at National and State level, provision of textbooks as per Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, ICT and digital initiatives, vocational education, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment has been increased and from this year provisions for library grants and grants for sports and physical education have also been introduced.

The Government has also launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities.

e PATHSHALA: a single point repository of e ­resources containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-­print materials.

The Central Government, supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme namely 'Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat' (PBBB) in foundational years of schooling.

(iii) MHRD, has launched a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform popularly known as SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) on 9 July, 2017. The portal is offering various online courses for school education and higher education. NCERT has been developing course modules for Massive Open and Online Course (MOOCs) for school education system in 12 subject areas (Accountancy, business studies, biology, chemistry, economic, history, geography, mathematics, physics, political science, psychology and sociology) for classes IX-XII. Twelve (12) courses and twenty one (21) courses have been completed in the first cycle and second cycle (completed on 30 Nov. 2018) on SWAYAM platform (https://swayam.gov.in/) respectively. Nearly 22,000 students and 30,000 students were registered in the first cycle and second cycle respectively.

(iv) CIET-NCERT has been assigned the task of developing e-resources for Master of Education (M.Ed.) course jointly with Allahabad University. One course (Educational Administration, Management and Leadership in School Education) has been completed first cycle on SWAYAM platform in which 2115 were enrolled. The second cycle of this course is offered from 2 July 2018.

Besides, an online course on action research for teachers is conducted in regular intervals in the MOODLE platform (http://ictcurriculum.gov.in/ ). Post Graduate Diploma in Guidance and Counselling for in-service teachers is also offered through the same course portal. Several other online courses are developed for inservice teachers professional development and delivered through the portal https://itpd.ncert.org.in/.

(v) A programme for utilization of satellite communication technologies for transmission of educational e-contents through 32 National Channels i.e. SWAYAM PRABHA DTH-TV has been launched. CIET-NCERT is the national coordinator for one DTH TV channel i.e., Kishore Manch (#31) and has started feeding a 24x7 educational TV channel w.e.f. 09 July, 2018. Everyday four hour fresh slot is telecast and repeated six times in 24 hours to provide learning opportunities for the stake holders, as per their convenience. Besides, NIOS is running 5 channels for teachers, for Secondary and Sr. Secondary levels and for sign language.

(vi) MHRD has launched Diksha Portal for providing digital platform to teachers giving them an opportunity to learn and train themselves and connect with teacher community. The portal envisages to help teachers boost their teaching skills and create their own separate profile with their skills and knowledge, and help in improving quality of education with use of latest technologies in education sector.

From the 187 qualified students from Regular Classroom Programme, 107 students qualified from Kota Study Centre, which is a proud achievement for the region. And 39 students are from Karnataka Base Study Centre; 12 from Udaipur Study Centre; 3 each from Kolkata, Surat and Ahmedabad Study Centre; 5 from Jodhpur; 6 from Nagpur; 2 each from Bhubaneswar and Raipur Study Center and 1 each from Agra, Mumbai, Lucknow, Ranchi and Jaipur Study Centre.

He also informed that JNV Bundi gave magnificent results yet again with 14 students qualified for KVPY Stage 2.

Verma Sir added that Resonance has always served as a major incubator to develop and showcase these talents and help the students prepare for IIT-JEE, NEET, Olympiad, KVPY and other national competitive examinations.

Students of Resonance have been excelling in some of the most challenging examinations in the country that require deep conceptual understanding. KVPY exam is meant for the students of Class XI and XII. Minimum 75% is required for General Category in 10th Boards and 65% for SC, ST and OBC to be eligible for this exam.

The objective of the program (KVPY) is to identify students with talent and aptitude for research; help them realize their academic potential; encourage them to take up research careers in Science, and ensure the growth of the best scientific minds for research and development in the country.

Soon, I got a home teacher, and in a year, we had reached a level where I could practise on my own. One day, while browsing in a bookstore I got my hands on Yoga: A Gem for Women, by Geeta S Iyengar, the youngest daughter of BKS Iyengar. That was the first time I read about a woman yoga teacher talking about the importance of yoga in a woman's life, which is strange, because yoga is done mostly by women, with a predominance of male teachers!

The book is a must-read for all women, as it covers the major stages of life and the changes the body goes through at every age. I began using the book to take me through my daily practice, and within a few months, I felt stronger, both in my mind and body.

Though I have met Geetaji, as she is called by all, I never practised with her, but I have had the opportunity to study under her lifelong student Zarina Kolah. Through her, I got to know of Geetaji's philosophy and teachings. Iyengar yoga uses simple props like a rolled towel, a brick, a chair, a rope, making yoga accessible to all, even to people who have physical disabilities.

Geeta Iyengar showed us that the path of yoga requires dedication: she started teaching at the age of 15 and was dedicated to her father and his way of teaching. In fact, she died just a few days after the centenary celebrations of her father's life. She chose to be a sanyasin, carrying forward the work he had started.

Sit with your legs stretched. Lift the hips a little, off the floor, and place a cushion under the hips.

Inhale; bend the legs towards the chest. Exhale; drop the right knee to the right and the left knee to the left, and allow the feet to touch each other. Place the palm on the floor behind the hips and extend the spine by pressing on the palms. Hold this pose, breathing deeply for 10 breaths.

Inhale; lift the palm and reach forward to hold the toes or feet with both your hands.

Exhale; bend the elbows on the thighs and press them down towards the floor, feeling a stretch on the hips and thighs. If the knees don't touch the floor, do not force them, as this is due to tight hips. Place a block or bolster under the knees to support them. Hold this pose for a few breaths; release.

Benefits: This classic pose benefits the entire body. Apart from being a hip opener, it stimulates the abdominal organs, the ovaries, and kidneys. The regular practice of the pose benefits a woman's body at all stages of her life."

THE national executive committee of Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the students' wing of the RSS, here on Sunday passed a resolution on the ""need of removing Maoist propaganda in academia"", saying ""all the syllabus devised by Urban Maoists should be revised to depict correct history and cultural values of Bharat"".

The resolution also ""defined"" ""Urban Maoists"" as those ""who are not the same Maoists fighting for armed revolution in jungles but people who are very much around us, providing intellectual strength to this fake idea of revolution"".

""They work in the disguise of so called intellectuals, academicians, artists and civil society activists in their NGOs. The strategy of Urban Maoists is to use the resources of the state against the state,"" it added.

""There is a need to stop writers and academicians who are trying to divide the country on the basis of religion, language and caste by commenting on national integration its culture and values. Also, all those who have legal cases against them or have been sentenced, these persons should be banned from visiting campuses and debarred from delivering lectures as faculty in all the educational and training institutes,"" said ABVP's national general secretary Ashish Chauhan.

Meanwhile, in another resolution, the ABVP demanded that the process of appointment of regular teachers on vacant posts should be started immediately, adding that short-term ad hoc and contract-based appointments were atrocities to the long term vision of cosmopolitan education.

The students' outfit also criticised the semester system, claiming that these are the demands that have been received by maximum number of students. ""We will strongly take up these issues with universities and state governments. If needed, we will protest and also sit on dharna against the semester system in states like Gujarat. Already, with the efforts of ABVP, states of Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh has already removed these,"" said Chauhan.

Chauhan demanded that consideration of semester system as a standard system by National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) and mandatory implementation of this semester system in colleges with lack of infrastructure makes it a compulsion and binding should be removed."

The educational landscape in the hilly terrain looked challenging, obviously. On my visit to a government-aided school in Mawsynram, I encountered living example of the fact that 'If you believe, you can bring about change'. Despite the odds that the terrain brings with it, students and teachers are thriving by marching ahead to make transformations in the teaching-learning process.

Intrigued by the cultural processes and atmosphere of teaching-learning in the school, I wondered what makes this school advance with true spirit of the National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, when the rest of the country is grappling with the meaning and implementation of the NCF. To serve my curiosity better, I asked the teachers and the head teacher to help me understand how they are bringing about change in the culture of learning, constructing knowledge, developing professional teachers and creating an atmosphere of inclusive learning.

In response to my questions, I was told that intervention by the Asian Development Bank and the Government of Meghalaya to improve quality of education has been instrumental to this change. Implementing organisation, IPE Global Ltd, has designed and developed Teachers' Professional Development Programme, which was the medium through which teachers were trained for developing critical competencies which have consequences on learning and quality of education. The combination of institutional synergies has induced change that will revolutionise landscape of school education.

At Mawsynram Higher Secondary School, one of the oldest schools, unfolds the story of reviving quality of education by means of redefining pathways to traverse and achieve what actually learning must look like! As reported by a schoolteacher, children travel from distant places, traversing terrains and the weather to come to this school to pursue education. On being asked about the role of schooling, it is worthy to know that teachers talk about the conduciveness of school and classrooms to foster learning which is the basis of positive student engagement in the lessons.

Teachers' concerns before the intervention seemed to be limited around low quality, low learning outcomes and poor performance. This was a deadlock, which seemed to be unbreakable besides commitment, subject expertise and hard work. Lacking in training, teachers struggled hard to remain motivated and confident to bring about change in learning levels of students. The Professional Development Programme has helped teachers to unearth their potentials by well contextualised approach to training and handholding in the form of 'on-the-job training'.

The teachers now have clear understanding of student-centered learning; their implementation of culturally responsive teaching-learning methods, collaborated learning, efficient instruction and assessment strategies have propelled the culture of inclusive quality education. This is further strengthened by means of continuous professional development; teachers are involved extensively in practices such as drafting integrated lesson plans and addressing issues concerning students' learning by forming professional learning communities or communities of learning as they call it. In the whole process of the transformational change, ICT has been seamlessly intertwined.

The foremost challenge to the transformational process is to ensure sustainability. The potential sustainability of this intervention looks positive; attitudinal change, handholding support and cultural shift in the professional development are in place.

However, for the process to continue and flourish, it is important that the school gets regular support, mentoring and handholding to advance to the fullest.

Those from nearby departments are also bearing the brunt.

The humanities classes are being held in the cabins of teachers, other vacant departments or library or whenever space is available.

The works have been undertaken in view of the National Accreditation and Assessment Council (NAAC) inspection slated later next year.

Students have complained of daylong disturbance on the campus and also requested to carry out the works outside their class timings of 10am to 5pm.

However, NU officials said it was difficult to find labourers for early morning or late evening shifts. Students also said that the work has been taken up in all classrooms instead of doing it in a phased manner.

Vice-chancellor SP Kane said instructions were given to ensure academic activities are not hampered or minimum noise is created during teaching hours. ""We haven't received any complaint so far about the disturbance. The works are being done under Rashtriya Uchchtar Shikshan Abhiyan (RUSA). We are converting them into smart classrooms,"" Kane said.

NU engineering section officials said major work is done only on Saturdays and Sundays when the students are not around or there are no classes. ""During week days, minor works take place to keep the process underway. They will be completed in a another month or so. Electrical works, PoP, painting are remaining,"" they said.

Some humanities students said before the renovation work started, the ventilation fans were removed from some classes about two months ago. ""If renovation was planned, what was the hurry to bring down the ventilators? Lots of debris kept falling on the benches during lectures and made the atmosphere dusty for days together,"" the students said.

""The classroom makeover works too have been started without any planning. All of a sudden, there is no room available,"" they added.

Students from other departments said though only the humanities block was under renovation, the noise created by tile-cutting makes concentrating on lectures difficult.

When TOI visited the campus on Saturday, construction material was found dumped haphazardly in the corridor of the humanities block. Loud noise of the tile-cutter could be heard till the physics department, about 100 metres away.

Students of language departments were the worse affected as they are at the receiving end of the construction of the new library just in front of their classes."

The measures are among a series of fresh initiative announced by the Chief Minister to take his government's fight against drugs to the next level, an official spokesperson disclosed after a meeting to review the functioning of the Special Task Force (STF) set up to wipe out the menace of drugs from the state.

Officials posted in the respective police stations from whose jurisdiction drug seizures are made will now be held directly accountable, the Chief Minister further announced at the meeting, which saw a series of directives being issued to strengthen the government's efforts to combat the menace and to facilitate de-addiction and rehabilitation on a bigger scale.

The proposed Advisory Board will be constituted under Prevention of Illicit Traffic (PIT) in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act with the aim of allowing detention of drug smugglers without trial for a year as well as attachment of properties of proclaimed offenders under the said Act. The Chief Minister has asked Additional Chief Secretary Home Nirmal Singh Kalsi to work out the modalities in this regard, according to the official spokesperson.

The Additional Chief Secretary Home has also been asked to convene coordination meetings with all central and neighbouring states' enforcement agencies to effectively check cross-border smuggling of drugs into Punjab.

Stressing the need to centralise and integrate the various functions involved in promoting de-addiction in the state, the Chief Minister said the Drug Division in the Health Department will oversee the opening of new drug centres, issuance of licences to private de-addiction centres and distribution of the necessary drugs in government hospitals. The Division will be headed by a Secretary.

The Chief Minister has further asked Additional Chief Secretary Health Satish Chandra to simplify the licensing procedure for private de-addiction centers to strengthen the framework for weaning youth away from drugs.

The Chief Minister has also directed STF Chief Mohammad Mustafa to regularly update him on the progress of the anti-drug campaign launched by the State Government, while asking his Chief Principal Secretary Suresh Kumar and ACS Home to hold a meeting every fortnight to review the progress in this regard.

Emphasizing the need to create awareness amongst the people about the ongoing efforts to check drug abuse, the Chief Minister asked the Deputy Commissioners, Commissioners of Police, Inspectors General of Police of different ranges & STF and SSPs to undertake regular field visits, especially in rural and border areas, for reviewing the progress of DAPO and Buddy programme, besides seeking feedback and inputs from the common people.

Captain Amarinder has also suggested involvement of the Guardians of Governance to ensure massive public participation to motivate the youth to abstain from drugs. He underlined the need for involvement of people at grassroots level and stressed that unique programmes like DAPO and Buddy would be instrumental in strengthening the state government's efforts to save future generations from the drug menace.

STF Chief Mohammad Mustafa informed the meeting that the STF, District Police and the State Special Operation Cell (SSOC) had successfully ensured strict enforcement, resulting in the arrest of 13756 persons till December 24, 2018, besides massive recovery of narcotics, including heroin 381.2 kg, opium 370.1 kg and poppy husk 38739.4 kg, in addition to seizure of 60805 injections and 76.77 lakh pills/capsules.

Satish Chandra apprised the meeting about the preventive measures taken by the Health Department and disclosed that 166 OOAT clinics were functional across the state. In these, 59,993 patients had been registered, of which as many as 56,380 re-visited the clinics, thus registering a retention rate of 93.97 percent. He said that till date 1.17 crore tablets of Buprenorphine have been given to the patients coming for de-addiction. The number of the OATS centers would be enhanced to 200 by the end of March 2019, he added.

CEO DAPO Rahul Tiwari disclosed that approximately 40 lakh students would be covered under the programme and nearly 3 lakh school teachers/college lecturers would be trained soon by 329 master trainers already trained by STF.

3 Not so secret

NCPA isn't a place that you'd associate immediately with genres like rock music. The iconic cultural space in Nariman Point is known more for jazz and classical concerts. So it came as a bit of a surprise when it launched a new venue called The Secret Garden within its premises, which promised to provide indie acts in the city a platform to play their material.

4 A market for music

Let's face it -- there is a paucity of venues for live music in this city. So we were only too happy when Flea Bazaar Café in Lower Parel started hosting regular gigs. The list of performers there include local acts like Madboy/Mink and outstation ones like Peter Cat Recording Co. There are some issues with the acoustics, but given how little we have in terms of music venues, we'll take it.

The sixth annual review conducted by Pornhub, released recently, showed that Indians love to watch porn, with the country accounting for the third highest daily traffic to the adult video site in 2018, behind only the US and the UK.

The same report suggested that nothing gets Indians quite as excited as seeing other Indians having sex: For the second year in a row, top searches for Indians contained the words 'Indian' or 'Hindi'.

Pari Tomar, a YouTube star, made big bucks off soft-porn videos (a less sexually explicit variant) until March 2016, when significant changes to the portal's monetisation and content policies rendered cleavage shots and heavy panting unprofitable.

""I used to work about 20-25 days a month, sometimes acting in up to eight short films a day,"" she told ThePrint. While it was allowed, Pari charged Rs 15,000 for a day of work. ""But now those films don't get produced anymore, [as] they tell me they were getting too vulgar for the internet. So I do mostly comedy.""

Richa Kaul Padte, author of Cyber Sexy: Rethinking Pornography, said Indians were looking for sexual content featuring Indians online. ""And because we don't have a porn industry in India, this demand is being fulfilled either by brown actors in American/Western porn, and by homemade porn -- which is made, either consensually or non-consensually -- by regular people in India,"" she added.

However, Indian policy, experts say, has often been out of step with this reality.

Despite the fact that the demand for well-produced Indian porn is growing every year, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) banned over 800 websites offering adult content in October, the censor board sanitises sexuality in Bollywood movies, and Section 67 of the IT Act criminalises ""publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form"" with imprisonment of up to five years and a fine of up to Rs 10 lakh.

The reasons span from moral objections, to the belief that porn is a major driver of sexual crime, as evidenced in the Uttarakhand High Court order that led to the TRAI directive.

But experts and industry insiders say such bans deprive the country of a vast revenue source, while potentially turning a willing audience to portals offering illegal content.

""All the money is basically going into the pockets of international companies,"" said Yash Juneja, a Jharkhand-based music store owner who also makes semi-porn films for private clients.

""They come shoot here, or Indians upload porn on their sites, and they earn all the advertisement and subscriber-based revenue,"" he added.

The true potential of porn in India remains unexplored: Some estimates peg the global porn industry's worth at $97 billion. The US, where porn is legal and users accounted for the highest daily traffic to Pornhub in 2018, is said to alone have a porn industry worth $10-12 billion.

Goutham Shivshankar, an advocate-on-record in the Supreme Court, told ThePrint that the ""the primary target in Indian law is 'obscenity' and not 'pornography', except child pornography, which is specifically and separately dealt with under section 67B of the Information Technology Act, 2000"".

While Section 67 of the Act rules ""publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form"" a punishable offence, viewing or storing pornography in India is not illegal.

This means that you can make a sex tape and store it on your phone, and you are clear legally as long as you don't upload it on a website or distribute it via email, WhatsApp or any other digital platform.

""If India legalises porn, we would stand out as the largest consumers of porn in the world,"" Vaibhav, an IT-consultant-turned-director who has worked on porn films, told ThePrint.

Legalising porn, he said, will ensure that India matches international standards, with the ensuing influx of capital and investment likely to bring Indian porn and its local purveyors out of the shadows and help them carve their own niche.

""The actors there (in the West) are doing it out of their own will. There is no desperation for money attached to it,"" he said.

""Jisko bhook lagi hui hai na, voh dhoondhta rahega jab tak uski bhook nahi mitti hai (A person hungering for something will continue to look for it till his desire is not satiated),"" said Vaibhav.

He said legalisation will also help throttle exploitative sex. ""Porn should be legalised... at least in the name of craft and art, because someone will not get molested,"" he added.

One of the most substantial arguments in favour of legalisation rests on consent. At least in perception, the porn industry has been globally linked with human trafficking, rape and assault, and the dehumanisation of women as sex objects.

But Padte argues that decriminalisation will prevent such exploitation.

""There are so many reasons why decriminalisation is a good idea,"" she told ThePrint, ""From distinguishing between consensual and non-consensual content to creating safe spaces for sexuality to developing a range of sexual expressions -- but I guess I would boil it down to the fact that criminalising sexual expression is a really bad idea.""

""It doesn't 'protect' anyone,"" she added. ""All it does is push the whole thing underground, which means that where violence does take place, we don't have mechanisms in place to address it.""

As it stands today, the porn industry in India largely works under the disguise of various ""legitimate"" professions - Several photographers, modelling agencies, massage parlours and smaller production houses supplement their day jobs with the recession-proof padding that porn provides.

Aungshita Chatterjee, 43, has dreams of becoming an international boudoir photographer, and while her aim may be a legal one, she tells ThePrint that ""at some point, a lot of the other photographers discovered that their DSLRs come with an in-built video option"".

""So yes, porn is being made -- in bedrooms and guest houses and studios, and it's uploaded on international servers or sold to clients from Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Russia, and the United Kingdom through brokers,"" she said.

According to Aungshita, who says she was also once offered $75,000 by an American producer named Cedric to shoot a porn film with Indian models, the porn industry is pan-India, with behind-the-scenes producers operating from Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta, and ""especially the south"".

But TRAI bans websites with pornographic content that are hosted on Indian domains -- so where does one upload these films?

According to Sameer, a Chennai-based filmographer who acts as the logistical matchmaker between a porn producer and a model in south India, Indians have found a way to circumvent even that obstacle. ""Everything is uploaded on Twitter, Tumblr and xvideos,"" he told ThePrint. When asked what happens in these movies, he said, ""Direct sex.""

South India is where the money is, added Juneja, because actors are easier to source, more willing to take risk on screen, and ""less likely to throw tantrums or be afraid of backlash from society"".

Sameer said at least a hundred such movies are produced monthly in the south, with actors getting paid up to Rs 50,000 per movie. The films are usually 50 minutes long and the whole production costs between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh.

However, much of Indian porn is defined by hand-held cameras, mobile phones balanced against a wall, mirrors, and low resolution, which doesn't seem to be satisfying viewers increasingly seeking out high-definition content.

According to the Pornhub report, 'HD' or 'high-definition' emerged as a popular keyword in searches keyed in by Indians.

In response to a report on ThePrint about the Pornhub review, a Reddit user claimed he had been ""looking for Desi HD for about ten years. It's just not there"".

""The best you get is a guy/gal with a good mobile phone,"" he wrote.

Everything apart, experts and insiders say the consequences of an underground industry can be severe. Informal productions don't entitle actors to health check-ups, salary standards, or protection from exploitation.

Even someone like Shais, who says that his years in the sex industry had forced him to develop a thick skin, knows everyone cannot be trusted.

He recalls paying a friend Rs 30,000 for a film he was told would be shot with good equipment.

But a few days after the payment, the friend disappeared. His phone was switched off and the money was gone.

Bharathidasan University has issued orders for replacement of principals in six out of 10 constituent colleges.

In the remaining four colleges at Orthanad, Vedaranyam, Nagapattinam and Lalgudi, the university has already seen through the takeover of the administration by its permanent staff.

For the colleges in Aranthangi, Thiruthuraipoondi, Navalurkuttapattu, Nannilam, Veppur and Perambalur manned by guest faculty, the university will be deputing its regular staff for holding the post of Principal for the time being, it is learnt.

The existing principals in the six constituent colleges have been asked to hand over charge to the new appointees on January 7, 2019, official sources said.

A decision to this effect was taken at the meeting of the Syndicate Sub-Committee taking note of the age factor. As per existing rules, the age of principals in the constituent colleges must not exceed 62 years.

Incidentally, by appointing new principals who are its regular staff, the university is spared of the monthly salary expenditure of ₹ 40,000 for each of the 10 principals The monthly salary which was initially fixed at ₹ 25,000 for retired faculties of the university deputed to the constituent colleges was increased a few years back. Subsequently, retired principals and teachers of government colleges were appointed as principals of the constituent colleges.

The university was under compulsion to cut down costs since it could levy only the fee levied in government colleges, in the wake of the decision of the government to take over the constituent colleges and convert them into government arts and science colleges. However, since the government is yet to issue an order for the formal takeover, the constituent colleges continue to be under the administrative control of the university.

Of all the State universities in Tamil Nadu, BDU accounts for the highest number of constituent colleges."

The course will be implemented from the primary education level for which disbursal of funds have already started, he said.

Besides imparting theoretical knowledge, the curriculum would also highlight the practical aspect of tackling obesity such as the necessity of physical activity, regular measurement of certain parameters and eating healthy food, the official said. Teachers will be taught to induce among students the habit of practising yoga to prevent obesity. The teachers in turn will teach the students, he said.

""The lessons will explain the necessity of regularly monitoring certain parameters like blood pressure, blood sugar and body weight. The first two factors have an intimate relation with obesity. ""All these will be explained in the curriculum to raise the awareness level of the students, which will eventually help their parents know about the basic things about obesity,"" the official told PTI.

In fact, measurement of blood pressure, blood sugar and body weight should be regularly done among school students, he said.

""The instruments for measuring these parameters will be bought by the schools from funds provided by the department, mainly meant for this purpose,"" he said.

The department has already purchased sphygmomanometer and stethoscope for measuring blood pressure, he stated.

National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data shows that 2,543 students -- 1,360 below the age of 18 years (school students) and 1,183 in the 18-30 age bracket (pursuing higher education) -- committed suicide in 2015 due to mounting pressure to do well in examinations.

Exam failure, however, saw among the lowest figures for cause of suicide -- 2 per cent, the same as unemployment. It was significantly lower than other factors such as family problems (27 per cent), or poverty, physical abuse and professional issues (26 per cent).

According to the NCRB's Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India 2015 report, the total number of students who committed suicide for various reasons in 2015 was 8,934, up from 8,068 in 2014. In 2016, the number rose again, with 9,474 students ending their lives, shows NCRB data.

The number of student suicides, particularly among those studying in schools, has been high despite various measures adopted by the Human Resources Development (HRD) Ministry.

""Regular counselling sessions are conducted by inviting counsellors in schools where the students are found in a disturbed state. In case of serious psychological problems among the children, psychiatrists are engaged to identify the behavioural changes and the reasons for such behaviour by the specialised counsellors,"" said a senior HRD official.

Further, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), through circulars, has also said that psychological counselling is to be provided to each student in an academic session at the secondary and senior secondary levels. The board highlighted the need for a full-time counsellor at all levels during a child's school education.

During 2017-18, an amount of Rs 46.58 crore was allotted by the central government to states to disburse to government schools to carry out guidance and counselling activities.

The Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti, which runs the Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas, a system of alternate schools for gifted students in rural India, has a training programme for teachers, where a couple of sessions are included to sensitise teachers and principals on the safety and security of the children.

It has been republished from The Quint's archives on the anniversary of the deadly tsunami that hit Chennai in 2004.)

A brown stained building with a roof torn and windows shattered stood in Keechankuppam, a small fishing hamlet in Nagapattinam.

After the tsunami waves had calmed down and people came out of their safe shelters, they were rattled by sight in front of them. It took a long while for families to pick up the broken pieces of their lives and start over. Help poured in from everywhere and people began moving away from the coast into homes built by the government. New utensils and books were bought and memorials were built.

But this school in the village was left abandoned because the building was ruined beyond repair. There was a sense of fear looming over it.

80 children who studied in the school died in the tsunami.

I was 10 when the tsunami struck. We ran away and returned when everything was normal again. I wondered what the school would be like. The then Principal sent word to all friends of the kids who died in the tsunami, so I went to school and my teachers told that most of our friends had died... My best friend Sathyavani too. Even today I cannot forget her face.Kokila, who is now working as a teacher in the same school

Fast forward to 2017 - The school which was once in ruins has been recognised by the Tamil Nadu government as one of the best schools in the state with the highest number of children joining every year.

The Fear Is Real

Situated between the river and the sea, the people in the village feared sending their children to this school again.

The scene of giant waves gobbling up the school haunted them. Gradually, the strength of the school went down to just 92 in 2012, from 428 in 2004.

The school had to be renovated and so a teacher working in a village nearby was called in to give the school a second lease of life.

When the Going Gets Tough

A new school building came up in 2008. But still there were no kids joining school. Balu joined as the Principal of the school in 2013 and he took it upon himself to transform the lives of the children.

People of the village told him that if the school had facilities like no other, then they would fight their fears and send their children to school.

To begin with, he installed a projector and turned one of the classes into a smart classroom. By the next year, the entire school was turned 'smart' and everyone started looking up to Balu's school.

In 2015, 134 kids joined and the school was recognised by the Tamil Nadu state government as the school with the second largest number of children joining school in the state.

To overcome fear, we brought in smart classes and made the school worth coming to. Once the school got the reputation, many children came in. Today, at the cost for 45 lakhs, given by officers and the village, the school has become what it is today.R Balu, Principal

Balu got tsunami ravaged discarded furniture from banks and offices, repaired and polished them. Today, every classroom has tables with drawers and lockers.

Making wealth out of waste, literally, and a small reminder of the hardships they've endured.

Putting Private Schools to Shame

The school today has everything that a private school offers in terms of infrastructure. The classrooms are Wi-Fi enabled, it has science and computer labs, RO drinking water facilities, clean toilets, a huge playground, greenery all around, interactive classes, laptops and even a rooftop garden !

In the book, there will be only one picture, but here we have so much more. We can see places where we can never go in real life. For example, we usually see only one picture of Taj Mahal from the outside, but now we get to see what the roof looks like, what stones it us made of. I want to come to school without bunking a single day. Tamilarasi, Student

They have a recognised Parent Teachers' Association and conduct regular meetings to address grievances. The management works in the way Parliament does - the Principal is the President, teachers are the chief ministers and the children are in charge of departments like sanitation and hygiene.

For the Village, by the Village

The school's transformation was possible owing to the overwhelming support from the villagers, service organisations and government departments.

The village was impressed with the efforts of the Principal and so requested him to give a list of items that they can donate to the school.

Just like a wedding where the family goes on a procession with gifts for their daughter, the villagers prayed at the local temple and walked to the school with fruits, vegetables, tables, chairs, stationery, black boards, skeletons, equipment for the labs and whatever each one could donate.

One of the fisherfolk who didn't have the money to donate, gave a box of chalk pieces as a token of gratitude for building such a remarkable school.

But the Principal has bigger plans - at least five laptops for each classroom, exclusive computer science and physical education teachers, and school buses.

Showering Laurels

The PU school is one among 11 in its category in the State, and 100 in the country, to receive the Swachh Vidyalaya Puraska. The school got the coveted ISO stamp and was honoured with the Kamarajar Best School award by the Tamil Nadu state government.

Balu was awarded the Best Teacher National award by former President Pranab Mukherjee.

Memories Linger On

The school has a memorial set up for remembering those children who lost their lives to the tsunami.

The children who were traumatised by the deaths of their classmates are today serving as teachers in the same school.

Dear children, had you been alive, we would have given you such good education. Today you have not died, you have sowed the seeds of prosperity. Soon the children here will someday become IAS, IFS, IRS officers and you children should bless them all with such big dreams. An ode from Principal R Balu to the children who died in the tsunami

She, however, urged them to withdraw their strike and join the schools, as students have already suffered a lot due to the long agitation.

Yadav, while addressing media at the state secretariat, said, ""State government is serous over para-teachers' issue and ready for dialogue, as it is the only way for solution of any problem. However, para-teachers should withdraw their agitation before the talk, as the ongoing strike has paralysed the education system in schools.""

""It has been increased their remunerations at regular intervals,"" she said.

""Now, government has decided to give them Rs 12000 a month,"" she said. Similarly, a trained teacher for Class-6 to Class-9, who used to get Rs 8,000 before 2015, would now get Rs 10,000.

She further said a TET pass teacher for Class-1 to Class-5 used to get Rs 7,800 per month before 2015. After the talk with para-teachers in 2015, their remuneration increased to Rs 9, 438. Now, government has increased their remuneration to Rs 11,000.

""Untrained teacher did not get any increment. Government is considering on the issue,"" Yadav said, adding, government is also setting up a corpus of Rs 10 crore for welfare of the para-teachers. Besides, their retirement age was also increased to 60.

The minister further said, ""Since it is an issue related to children's education, political parties should not take advantage of it for mere political mileage. It's a serious issue and all have to cooperate in it.""

Office bearers of Ekikrit Para Sikshak Sangharsh Morcha (EPSSM), an umbrella body of all para-teachers' associations, however, said they would not talk to government until it assured of regularization of services on pattern of Chhattisgarh.

Trained in Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi and temple ritual dance, Vyjayanthi has excelled in her various roles of that as a dancer, guru, therapist, researcher, and organiser. She talks about her passion for Kuchipudi, her gurus, young-gen dancers, and rasikas in this chat with us...

From a banker to the stage

I was born in Karnataka and till my mid-20s, I had never watched a Kuchipudi performance. My grandfather, Dr Gubbi Veeranna, was a famous theatre artiste and he used to take his mythological dramas to villages in Andhra Pradesh. He noticed my interest in dance and I started learning Bharatanatyam from the age of six. My life revolved around dance. I was named Vyjayanthi by my dad, who was very fond of actress and danseuse Vyjayanthimala Bali. But, by the time I joined college, I developed a dislike for the art; maybe I had too much exposure to Bharatanatyam. I found theatre more fulfilling and felt that it's a complete art. Later, I completed my studies, chose a career in banking, and got married too. But the life-changing event came when I was 26. I was told that CR Acharya, the famous dance guru, was coming to Bangalore to conduct a workshop on temple rituals. I attended the workshop, wherein using footwork, among other movements, he drew peacock, lion and such vahanas. I was attracted to the technique and impressed by the evolution of the art form. The challenges it posed inspired me to study Kuchipudi. I decided to learn from him. It was providence that he accepted me even though I had not been in touch with dance for about 16 years. He took the effort to come to Karnataka and taught me in the gurukula way.

The challenges

It was a scholarship that changed the course of my life in the dance field. There are 16 families in Andhra who have inherited the art. I went and stayed with them. For them, dance was a way of life. The art resonates with their lifestyles. They lived simple lives and there was no distraction. They had deep knowledge about the dance form and temple rituals. For a city person like me, it was not easy to move out and live this frugal life. But their lives became my lessons and dance seeped into me. It was like, with or without my knowledge, I was imbibing it from my gurus, akin to what a child takes from a mother. And soon, Kuchipudi became part of my lifestyle.

During the early days of my training , understanding Telugu proved to be my biggest challenge. There were no books on Kuchipudi in English. My guru used to write to me in Telugu and I used to wait for the letters like a pining nayika. I would take the letter to those who knew Telugu and get it translated. Similarly, I used their help to reply to him. These letters are my precious treasure as they contain invaluable reflection on Kuchipudi, the result of deep research my guru had done.

I learned from Vedantham Prahalada Sarma, Vedantham Satyanarayana Sharma, Prapoorarna, and Korada Narasimha Rao, among others, to perfect my art form. Meanwhile, I learned Yakshagana, too.

Dancing to bliss

Dance is like meditation for me. I have been a performer for several decades and I have participated in almost all the major festivals in India and abroad. I'm also one of the few dancers to have mastered 'Chitra Natyam', a painting a dancer creates on stage using footwork. There are hardly five to six artistes who can perform this and most of them are Acharya's students. It's highly technical, but very beautiful, too. However, these days, it's not very easy to perform it on stage as the stage and lighting do not lend themselves to the perfection of this art. I was working in a bank for 18 years but it was dance that was always on my mind. For me, dance is like breath; I see dance everywhere-while cooking, walking or travelling. Dance is the energy that fills me.

On Margazhi season

Around 3,000 performances happen in Chennai in this season alone and to me, it's like a miracle. It's unparalleled, and nowhere in the world can one witness such a festival. I have been a regular performer here and I also love the lec-dems and seminars. I have only one concern. Since there are many performances happening simultaneously at various sabhas, people sometimes find it tough to attend their favourite artiste's performance. I wish the season were not restricted to a month, but spread over the year. After all, dance is something the audience should watch from proximity so that they are able to imbibe the emotions and travel with the artiste throughout the performance.

Young generation and Kuchipudi

Our gurus have taken great pains to restore our lost art, de-codify them and give it a regional identity. It was not easy and we had only a few people who dared to take Kuchipudi as a career. Those days, the gurus were much older than their students. My guru, Acharyalu, was about 65 when I started learning. But these days, the age gap is less and the gurus teach as well as perform. I'd say these days we are flooded with dancers. Youngsters these days are very interested in learning classical dances and I have students from abroad, too. I have an open class as well as a gurukula programme in Bangalore, where the students stay with me and learn. The main advantage of gurukula sampradaya is that a student gets to learn the nuances of the art by watching their guru from close quarters. My deep understanding of the art form came from observing my gurus, researching along with them and practising with them. I have so far taught 2,000-plus students and five to six of them are now internationally well known. I think a teacher should be able to identify the student who has the quality to take it forward.

Role of rasikas

I would say that there's been a phenomenal increase in the number of gurus, dancers and rasikas. But there is a drastic need for dance musicians. They still remain very few in numbers and it's a worrying fact. When we talk about young rasikas, I consider it the responsibility of each dancer to contribute by way of his or her performances to create a new set of audience. An artiste should be able to add a new generation of audience for his or her art to survive and thrive. For every dancer, the audience is her energy. Unless those two eyes from the audience are fixed on the dancer asking her to take him or her on a journey, what other joy is there for the dancer?

Tech in dance

It has both advantages and disadvantages. While we had to wait for months or even years to witness the performance of a legend, these days, with the touch of a button, you can watch all of them online. Also, many students now learn online. While tech and social media help create a connection between the artiste and audience, there is also a pitfall. From my experience of being on the selection panel of several festivals, I have seen that on several occasions, a neatly cut slick video of a glamorous dancer can mislead the selectors, thus creating confusion or a possible error of judgment. This is especially critical when you don't have experienced artistes on the selection panel.

Dance as therapy

My guru Acharyalu had discussed with me the healing power of dance. But he never mentioned the word therapy and at that point in time, I didn't understand it fully. He had got the knowledge from Vedic texts and shared how a few karanas have therapeutic value, especially for women. But during my dance journey, I have experienced how dance made me joyful. I explored it further and collaborated with yoga teachers and have held 60 workshops in the UK. Dance is a complete art and the Chaturvida abinaya along with music and its rhythm can definitely make a positive difference in people with disabilities, mental issues, and depression. I had worked with children who have autism, and the results were remarkable. For eg: When given the roles of veera rasa characters, shy and timid people become less inhibited. But it's time-consuming and a highly individualised approach is needed."

You can find everything ranging from simple personalization apps to apps that will help boost your productivity but, in my experience, finding these apps could prove to be a chore as Microsoft Store's search and discovery isn't really all that great. So, if you're on the lookout for some great apps for your PC or laptop, here are the 35 best Windows 10 apps you should use to make the most out of your device:

Note: The apps mentioned in this article are primarily directed at Windows 10 S users who can't install desktop versions of these apps on their device. In almost all cases, the desktop versions offer more features and are more frequently updated than the Microsoft Store apps and in case you're running the regular Windows 10 then you should go ahead and download the desktop versions of these apps on your device. This is obviously not applicable for those apps that don't have a desktop version.

Did you know that the popular VLC media player is also available as a Windows 10 app? Well, it is and it looks a whole lot better than the desktop version - that's one reason why you should get it right away. The app features support for a variety of different video formats, including mp4, mkv, avi, and a lot more. On top of that, the app also includes a bunch of additional features, including the ability to add subtitles, sync audio and video, and use any video as a live wallpaper. VLC is one of the best media players you can get for your Windows 10 device and you should definitely go ahead and download it without thinking twice.

Spotify is also available on the Windows Store, meaning you don't necessarily have to download the desktop version to enjoy listening to some great music. The app includes all the features you'd find on the Spotify app on any other platform, making it a must have for all music (and podcast) lovers, especially those who want to discover great music - Spotify's recommendations are just that great. The app has a really clean user interface, it's simple to use and it syncs all of your data across all platforms, so you can seamlessly switch from your desktop to your mobile device without missing a beat.

Tidal is another great music streaming service you can get, which, although a bit expensive, should be the go to app for audiophiles. Not only does Tidal have a larger music library than Spotify, it also boasts of Hi-Fi audio output which is great for anyone who wants to stream and listen to high-quality music on their Windows 10 device. On the downside, however, Tidal isn't available in as many locations as Spotify, so some of you might not be able to make use of the music streaming service.

In case you're looking to stream videos, and not music, on your device then you'd be glad to hear that Netflix is also available on the Microsoft Store. Now that you know this, there's no need for you to watch Netflix on the web and considering the fact that the Netflix app allows you to download videos for offline viewing, I know I, for one, am not going back to watching Netflix on my browser again. The Netflix app is a must have for anyone with a Windows 10 device, even those who're not Windows 10 S users, and a Netflix subscription.

If you're not much of a ""Netflix and Chill"" person, and swear by Hulu instead, then you'd be happy to know that you can get the Hulu app on Windows as well. With the Hulu app you can watch the latest episodes of your favorite TV show on your device, however, it doesn't offer as great of an experience as the web version of the service and doesn't include quite a few features which is rather disappointing. Another thing worth noting that the Hulu app for Windows 10 doesn't include the option to download videos for offline viewing, which is another major setback for the app.

One of the highest rated language learning apps - Duolingo - is also available on the Microsoft Store, allowing you to pick up a new language from the comfort of your home. The app includes support for a number of languages, including widely used ones like Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, etc, and it gamifies the learning course to help you pick up languages quickly. Duolingo picks up each course right from the basics, but if you're just looking for a refresher on a language you already know, then you can even tackle higher level courses on the app itself.

WeDo 2.0 LEGO Education is a great app for kids that can help them pick up the basics of coding using LEGO bricks. The app has a very simple to user interface which makes it easy for kids to pick it up on their own and it can also be used as a tool by teachers to teach their students simple programming skills. Not only that, the app can also be used to teach students crucial science and engineering practices, including problem solving, modeling, prototyping, investigating, analyzing and interpreting data. WeDo 2.0 LEGO Education is a must have app for anyone with young kids who wishes to teach them coding in a simple and playful manner.

TED is another great educational app which you can install on Windows and keep up to date with the latest TED Talk videos and audio. The app has a really minimal user interface and it categorizes all of its videos in curated lists, making it easy for you to watch all the latest and popular TED Talks. The app features over 1700 TED Talks on a variety of different topics and it keeps adding more, so you'll never run out of cool educational videos to watch. Download the TED app on your system and I'm sure you'll be able to learn a whole lot from the platform.

Do you ever use flash cards while studying? Even if you don't you should definitely check out FlashQuiz on your device as it will allow you to study more efficiently with the help of flash cards. The app features a variety of flash cards which will allow you to memorize things like world flags, world capitals, world currencies, and the periodic table, but if none of the included flash cards are of much use, you can even create flash cards of your own and embed text, images, and sounds to help you memorize whatever topic you want to focus on.

Next up is another great learning app for kids called Reading Trainer which, as its name suggests, serves to improve the reading speed and retention rate in kids using fun exercises. The app claims that you can double your reading speed in just two days of training and that can really come in handy if you've got to complete reading a large volume of material in very little time. The eye-exercises play a major part in improving anyone's reading speed and I'm sure slow readers everywhere will benefit from using this Windows 10 app.

In case you're looking for a great image editing app for Windows, you should definitely consider purchasing Adobe Photoshop Elements 2019. You can use the app for anything from editing images to creating your own memes and thanks to its relatively simple user interface, the app is pretty great for beginners as well. Granted, it doesn't offer all the features you'd find in the full-fledged desktop version of Photoshop, but it's pretty great for a start and it'll really come in handy for Windows 10 users who don't have devices powerful enough to run the desktop version of the app.

Autodesk SketchBook is another great app for creative professionals and artists alike, offering an expansive set of tools to help users create masterpieces on their PC. The app comes with complete touch input support, making it great for users with touch-screen devices and it also includes support for the Microsoft Surface Dial, making it a great app to have in case you have a Surface Studio.

If you're looking for a simple yet functional drawing and image editing software that is geared at casual users, then you should definitely check out Paint.NET.

On top of that, the app has an active online community which provides useful plugins that go a long way in improving user experience.

PhotoDirector 10 Essential is another excellent image editing app that offers a plethora of professional, easy-to-use tools for editing photos.

The app comes with support for several file formats and it allows you to copy video frames, images or text right from the preview. Seer Pro is a handy app which will definitely go a long way in improving the way you interact with files on your PC or laptop.

Even though there are several Windows 10 devices with touch screens in the market these days, not many of these devices comes with handy gestures for you to speed up your workflow. This is exactly where the TouchMe Gesture Studio app comes into play. The Windows 10 app allows you to create personalized touch screen gestures for your system, featuring support for 2/3/4/5 finger gestures. You can customize these gestures to do pretty much everything from launching apps to shutting down your system, however, for these gestures to work on your Windows 10 device you'll need a gesture engine, which is conveniently linked within the app.

Bored of your desktop background? Get the Wallpaper Studio 10 app and get access to thousands of high-quality wallpapers for your desktop. The app not only allows you to set up cool wallpapers on your device, but it can also be used to create Windows themes using a bunch of your photos.

With the app, you can instantly set a new wallpaper for your desktop and lock screen, without messing around with any Windows settings.

With this app you can customize the look of your system's taskbar, with options to adjust the opacity, customize the accent color and combine states which allow you to give your taskbar a dynamic experience that changes depending on your actions. In case you're like me and like to keep your taskbar hidden when not in use you could give TranslucentTB a shot, you might like even more than having the taskbar hidden (I know I did!).

Another great personalization app for Windows, Accent Applicator is fairly self-explanatory. The app allows you to customize the color of the selected text and other UI elements in desktop applications. You can even create brighter and dimmer accents for particular UI elements, which is a great option. The app is fairly simple to use and will help you give your PC or laptop a more unique appearance.

That said, if Dropbox isn't your cup of tea, you can check out some great Dropbox alternatives as well.

Turn your Windows 10 touch screen device into a notebook with Bamboo Paper, a Windows 10 app from Wacom which allows you to take notes or sketch on your Windows device with surprising accuracy. The app includes a wide variety of tools, including different pens and brushes, which will allow you to write, draw, color or annotate documents on the fly. Thanks to its minimal user interface, it's quite easy to get started with the app and I'm sure you'll find it quite handy if you've got a 2-in-1 Windows laptop.

Give your productivity a boost with Microsoft To-Do, a simple yet smart to-do list app that allows you to create to-do lists, set tasks and reminders, and plan out your day to increase your productivity and decrease your stress levels.

I especially like the app for its clean and distraction free user interface, which I'm sure most developers will appreciate.

Ditto Clipboard is a great clipboard manager for your Windows PC that acts like an extension for Windows' in-built clipboard and saves all items placed on the clipboard.

Don't want to depend on a web browser to use WhatsApp on Windows 10? Then download the WhatsApp Desktop app on your device.

The app especially comes in handy at the workplace, when you don't want to be seen using your phone all that often. You can take my word for it.

Even though the web version of Facebook's image sharing platform Instagram is fairly decent, it lacks a couple of crucial features, including the lack of messaging support. So if you've been looking for the complete Instagram experience on your Windows system, you should download the Instagram app from the Microsoft Store. The app, unlike the web version of the platform, includes pretty much all the features you'd find on the mobile app and once again, it can really come in handy at the workplace.

Facebook also has a dedicated Windows app that offers the platform's complete experience on your desktop. No need for you to depend on your smartphone or browser to access Facebook when you can simply open it up on your desktop. The app doesn't offer anything special, it's just convenient.

The Skype app is also one of the few apps that you must have on your device. The app includes support for all of Skype's features, including video calls, voice calls and text chat, along with the share feature which allows you to easily drag and drop files onto the app and share them with friends.

All of you Reddit users out there will definitely love this one. Baconit is a Reddit client which offers a dynamic UI that adapts to your device, features 'flip view' post navigation, and a global navigation menu that makes jumping from one subreddit to another a breeze. Baconit is undoubtedly the best Reddit client for Windows 10 devices and I will highly recommend it to anyone who finds themselves lurking on the platform for a couple of hours every day.

While there are a bunch of great password managers out there, in case you're looking for a reliable password manager app for your Windows 10 device then you should consider installing Keeper. The app not only manages your passwords quite effectively, but it also doubles up as a secure file storage vault in which you can store sensitive documents. Other than that, you can also save your card and payments information on the app and sync the stored information across all your connected devices.

Often find yourself giving in to distractions around you? Not able to focus on work?

The app works by breaking up all the work you need to do into individual tasks separated by short breaks. Try it out, it's surprisingly effective.

Rounding off the list is a handy VPN app that will allow you to browse a free and more open internet. With the Hide.me VPN app, you'll not only be able to access blocked websites, but also protect yourself from surveillance and hackers. The app isn't free to use, but it offers a free trial which offers a 500MB limit for 2 weeks and the trial period can be renewed infinite times, so that pretty much makes it free, in case you don't use it heavily. Just tap on the connect button and you're good to go.

Well, that rounds up our list of the best apps for Windows 10 that you can use right now. The apps cover a wide variety of use cases and I'm sure you'll find something that works for you.

It has been every student's nightmare, yet it is the most scoring subject.

Scoring a perfect 100 might not be that easy, but it is not impossible. Surely, one cannot score this enticing score by studying overnight or a day before the exam. There has to be a full proof strategy and plan, which only be built throughout the year to score a perfect 100 or even above 90.

Like every other student, even I was not sure about clearing the subject until my parents propelled me to take help from a personal tutor.

I appeared for CBSE Class 10 board exam in 2010 and joined a regular coaching centre in June 2009.

After talking to my tutor, school teachers, and a few seniors, I made a study strategy to tackle Maths. Here's how I studied.

1. Self-study NCERT completely

I had a complete insight into the NCERT book, read each chapter like a novel. Yes, it sounds quite weird but once you get into that zone, and you're able to understand and it is really addictiveI carefully looked at all the diagrams, figures, examples.

2. Solve all the exercises

After reading every chapter, take a notebook and solve all the exercises irrespective of what's happening in your school or tuition or anywhere else.

This will be your personal study plan.

Jot down your queries and take help from your seniors or tutor, whoever is available.

3. Solve all the examples

Students generally jump onto the exercises, ignoring the essential examples given before it. However, 40 per cent of the exam includes the NCERT book examplesTake out some time, write all the example questions in a test paper and solve them on your own.

4. If not understood well, repeat this.

For some, this might be the end of learning, but I wasn't contended from whatever I had practised.So, after finishing the entire book by November end, I repeated the above steps again.Obviously, this time, it did not take much of time and gave me a sense of confidence.

5. Come up with questions and take guidance from your teachers

After this entire procedure, it is natural for you to have questions/queries/doubtsThere might be some weak topics, so seek help from your teachers, who can give you better examples and some questions to solve.

6. Solve sample question papers

I'd like to credit my marks to this major step. After Jan 15, I only solved sample question papers every single dayThere are so many sample papers books available in the market, I just bought one by U-LIKEFor the initial 15 days, I didn't take note of how much time it is taking, but after Feb 1, my tutor gave me the exam test paper at 10 am and took it at sharp 1 pm. This helped my increase my speed and create an environment as I was already in my exam hall.

7. Last 20 days of practice - most crucial

From Feb 1 to 20, like a real exam, I practised maths papers from 10 am to 1 pm.

After this, I used to devote my entire day to other subjects.

Other than practice, this is also a period of self-assessment.

It is the best time to discover where have you reached, which topic's taking longer than others, which section you should attempt first.

My strategy was to start from the six marks question, as getting the most difficult ones done, made me feel like half of it is done and I got stress free.

It's quite natural that if your attempt highest scoring section first, you can deal with it with a fresh mind. You can consider it as a hack, but it helps starting from six marks questions, then four, then three and then one.

Other than this, I didn't touch any RD Sharma or other help books. In my experience, you don't need any. Once through with NCERT, be confident, believe in yourself, don't be afraid of self-assessment and asking questions.

Keep last days for only practice. All the best!

Still, we have so many expectations, apprehensions about the 'next year' that will greet us. Many look at it as a new life if the current one didn't go well.

When it comes to realm of Indian politics and government, it was quite an interesting year. Former Chief Justice of India, Dipak Misra delivered historic verdicts including decriminalisation of consensual gay sex, not considering adultery as an offence anymore, recognising an individual's right to privacy in the Aadhaar case, making instant triple talaq a legal offence and most recently giving women the right to enter the Sabrimala temple.

The decriminalisation of IPC's Section 377, which considered consensual sex between homosexuals as 'unnatural' and a 'criminal' offence has significant importance, given the verdict had already been once repealed in 2013.

Members of the LGBTQ+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer) community thronged streets as they rejoiced in colours of love and pride. As we passed this test with rainbow colours, we speak to Mr Gay World India 2016, Anwesh Sahoo to share if things have only changed on paper this year. Here are the key lessons he learnt in 2018:

There has been a drastic change in the corporate culture, believes Anwesh since the verdict has come out. Multinational Corporations have started changing their policies to make them more inclusive for the LGBTQ community. Whenever he goes for a job interview, the only question that he is being asked is, 'When can you join us?'

This is imperative given today's workspace is so fast-paced, where employees are doing a nine-to-nine shift, one could actually discover their LGBTQ partner in office. It opens many avenues and provides them with an opportunity to live a dignified, respected life.

Anwesh is proud to inform that he has a boyfriend, Pance Naumov, who is currently a Radcliffe Fellow at Harvard (Well, we all wish we were gay to have a boyfriend studying at Harvard) who no longer shies away from expressing his love for him in public. ""We met two years ago at a Bombay pride parade and since then we haven't stopped talking. Earlier, he wouldn't hold my hand in public and he was very apprehensive because of the culture here"" but now it isn't the same for the couple.

Though, he adds that it might take years for India to build a society where it would be completely normal for us to have a trans teacher at school and taking children to pride parades, the law does matter. The law sends a clear signal that bigotry against LGBTQ community is unacceptable.

Battling taboos and an archaic law around the binary concept of sexuality hasn't been easy for Anwesh. However, he acknowledges himself to be a headstrong person who has learnt to embrace his uniqueness and continues to experiment with life.

For someone who has worn many hats, Mr Gay India has three things to say to his peers:

Best Memory Of 2018: ""I was on a radio show speaking to a variety of people when the verdict came out (September 06) and my phone was flooded with texts from people congratulating and sending love. That was also the first time I talked about my boyfriend on a public platform and that too on a show I have grown up listening.""

Best Place Visited In 2018: ""We were touring with a UK based dance company in India. They needed language assistance and I got to meet four other gay persons who were a part of the dance group. We travelled from Delhi to Bhopal to Jabalpur and Kurukshetra. I had a gala time in Bhopal and Jabalpur especially, trying everything, their food, culture, places. It was the best experience of the year.""

What Do I Look Forward To In 2019: As I enter the second year of my masters programme, I really want to intern abroad this time.

What We Still Lack In LGBTQ+ Realm: We need introduction of sex education in schools in order to build a system where it is completely normal for teachers to take their students to pride parades and show them the LGBTQ culture. This binary concept where we believe pink is not meant for men and a man cannot be effeminate needs to eliminated. Many people had one bad experience with an LGBTQ member which led to the formation of a public opinion.

The 'danger of a single story' which makes or mars a person's experience also needs to be taken care of. A new LGBTQ chapter is opening up in our country and more and more number of people are finding acceptance in the city.

On Representation Of LGBTQ In Digital Medium: I am still waiting for that day when LGBTQ members are represented in a dignified and empowered manner in regular, mainstream films. The fact that the last movie in which we had a gay couple came out a decade ago speaks volumes about the representation of our community in mainstream media.

On LGBTQ Taking Refuge In Dating Apps: I do not support members taking refuge in dating apps because I believe it crushes your ego and it brings your self-pride down. Though, it can vary from person to person.

The warmth of love harbours relationships

And home is where humanity dwells

Never found respect in that house... but only disrespect

Never had a moment of happiness... but just gloom

So much, so that I begged for my death to the almighty

However, he never let me have that wish

Because our friendship was destined to be

He never let me have that wish

Because I had to see my daughter succeed

The moment had brought back joy in my life

[My daughter cleared the grade VII scholarship exam]

I came across a person on this turn of life

Who gave me a whole new hope to live

And a day came when I forgot everything and dissolved into you

... And I still cherish the memories of that day

-- Jivhala (Translated from Marathi by Vishakha Ghadi)

These are the lines from a thank you note written by Suvarna Maskar who describes it as 'the moment of awakening'. ""Maybe because I didn't know what to do [sic]. I spoke everything,"" she says with a sigh of relief. The note is a conversation from 2008 which the 46-year-old Suvarna had with Jadhav ma'am, a Government school teacher in Shirgaon village of Satara's Wai taluka in Maharashtra.

Suvarna Maskar. All images courtesy of the author.

The note was a build-up of two decades. A farmer and a home-maker, Suvarna always wanted to complete her education. She dropped out after grade X. ""During that time, girls were rarely sent to school and I also faced the same,"" she recollects. ""I felt like I had lost everything in the world.""

Tired of her routine life which had cut her freedom, she would often pray for death. Once while bringing her children back from the school, she conveyed everything to Jadhav ma'am and felt 'liberated'. Later, she wrote a thank you note which became her first ever work of poetry. ""I didn't know what a poem was,"" she remembers.

A week later, she went to the school again for the parents meeting. A school teacher praised the thank you note publicly. Immediately, Jadhav replied saying that Suvarna is a 'big poet'. ""That was the moment when I felt I could achieve something in life,"" she says with the widest grin.

Challenges while writing

After the incident, she started exploring the art form. Within a fortnight she wrote a handful of poems. ""No one believed that I had written them. People used to ask me how a farmer can be a poet?"" she says. A lot of fellow villagers even falsely accused her of plagiarism.

""In the initial days, even my husband didn't believe that I could write poems. Once after coming from the field, I wrote a poem in front of him. From that instant, he has never doubted me,"" she explains. Her husband, Uttam, 53, is a farmer and knows about all her poems. ""I like her poems and enjoy listening to them,"" he says proudly.

Earlier, she was scared of showing the poems to school teachers and editors of the newspapers. ""My husband would proudly show them to the editors,"" she says. This restored her lost confidence and soon Suvarna herself began meeting with the school teachers and editors. ""This happened only when my husband understood the importance of my poems. He would always take me to various poetry competitions in other talukas of [Satara] district,"" she explains.

Some of the awards which Suvarna won in the past eight years

Her first poem was published within a few months in 2008 in a Marathi daily Pudhari. ""That's when people started believing me,"" she asserts. Her mother in law isn't a big fan of Suvarna choosing the path of poetry. ""She would always taunt what you will do by becoming a poet.""

Suvarna is now a regular contributor to Pudhari, Sakal, Gramodhar, Nave Shahar newspapers, and Gumfan, Muktagiri, Amrutgat, Pudcha Paul, Lokjagar, Laxmiputra, Sarvoyda Vichar magazines in Marathi.

Suvarna has maintained an archive of all her poems which have been published in newspapers to date

""Now, people's perspective has changed. They have started recognising me as a woman farmer poet,"" she says proudly. There are still a lot of challenges ahead. ""People aren't very receptive of romantic poems, but I don't pay attention to what they say now."" She loves writing poems on love and is breaking the conservative barriers with her romantic poems now.

It's not just the orthodox society which Suvarna has been battling, she has to complete the majority of the farming work first and then pursue her passion for poetry. Every day she wakes up at five in the morning, completes her household chores, milks her two animals twice and then leaves for farming at 10 am and returns by 6 pm. They own 2.5-acre land where they cultivate sugarcane, jowar, and a few vegetables.

The art of poetry and inspiration

She has a plethora of topics in her repertoire. Some of them include agrarian crisis, alcoholism, addiction, children, rural life, societal issues, women, patriarchy and romantic poems.

In the school days, she was fascinated by the names of authors and poets in the end [of every chapter and poem]. ""I always wanted my name to be published under a story or poem,"" she recalls. ""We live our lives only once and I want to leave behind a legacy.""

""I don't feel like I've to sit back, think and then write poems. It happens naturally,"" she says. All her poems come from the field and personal experiences. Citing one such experience, she narrates her long story titled Gurakhi [Shepherd] from 2017 which was published in the Diwali edition of Laxmiputra magazine. The story is a fictional conversation between the local hill and a shepherd regarding the environment degradation by human beings. Some of her poems are reactions to the wrongdoings and crimes in the society. The Kopardi [2016] rape incident deeply affected her and she expressed the anguish in the form of a poem.

Talking about dealing with criticism, she says, ""Only a poet can understand the happiness behind the written word [in the poem]."" She credits her childhood reading habits for the huge vocabulary she has built now. Her elder brother Suryakant Yadav is a voracious reader. ""He would always get me a lot of books from Mumbai,"" she recalls smilingly. Her father, the late Babanrao Yadav would always read aloud spiritual books. ""Those interesting mythological stories made me fall in love with books,"" she says. ""When I read my poems to him, he had tears in his eyes.""

Her mother, Yashodabai, now in her early 80s, could never see the steps of the school. ""She always supported me and said that one day, these poems will liberate me and take me forward,"" says Suvarna proudly.

Inspiring others

Suvarna is now invited in various gatherings at the schools to recite her poetry. ""I am restricted to places from where I can return the same day,"" she says sadly. ""I've to milk the animals every day."" She is optimist enough to find a solution to this and pursue her passion of poetry full time. Suvarna's dream is to present her poetry in several villages across Maharashtra. ""I want to use poetry as a means of community development,"" she tells me as she talks about the coming poetry competitions and conferences she's looking forward to.

She has won around 30 awards for her poetry in the past eight years. She has also recited her poetry several times on All India Radio, Satara. Suvarna has handwritten more than 500 poems and filled four diaries in eight years penning down her experiences. She has also written 15 long stories.

Hand written stories and poems of Suvarna Maskar

In 2013, her first book titled Suvarngandh [a smell as precious as gold] which is a collection of 46 poems was published by Akshara Publication, Satara. The book covers a wide range of topics like addiction, societal awakening, women's issues, agriculture, romantic poems, etc. 500 copies of the books were printed. ""I can't afford to get any book published right now,"" she says. ""But in a few years my next books will be published,"" she says confidently.

Suvarna likes the work of the late Bahinabai Chaudhari, a woman cotton farmer from Jalgaon district. ""People didn't have confidence in me, but I was self-confident to become a poet,"" she says smilingly.

Her first book Suvarngandh was published in 2013 which is a collection of 46 poems

""I've four teachers at home,"" she says proudly referring to her children and husband who have been inspiring her to keep improving her poems. Her daughter Neelam, and Akshada, both are engineers and are working currently. Her youngest son, Tejas is pursuing his Bachelors in Pharmacy from Karad city in Maharashtra.

""The reading habit amongst people has come down. We would be able to keep our independence only if we are well read and informed,"" she says.

Suvarna and Uttam Maskar

Interesting anecdotes

Her poems transcend books and schools and have now become an inherent part of her life. Once she was seeking a dental treatment in Pachwad village. ""During the times I had to visit the doctor, I used to observe his work carefully and later wrote a poem on him."" This was published in a local newspaper. The dentist loved it and later visited Suvarna to thank her. ""He also used better quality caps for my teeth without charging any extra money,"" she says smilingly.

She met Jagdish Khebudkar, a renowned Marathi littérateur and lyricist in the Akhil Bharatiya Sahitya Parishad's conference in Mumbai in 2010. ""He spoke to me about his struggles writing Lavanis for the Pinjra movie [1972] and how he overcame his fear. He also asked me to keep writing more poems,"" she says. That moment was an inspiring feat for Suvarna. ""Whenever I feel like giving up, I remember moments like these,"" she explains.

Looking back at her struggle, she pauses for a while, smiles, takes a deep breath and says, ""I never imagined that my life will ever change.""

The creation of State Open School Board -- where an array of skill-based subjects and other vocations made a foray into mainstream education -- was exalted by teachers and students alike. Now, in a further boost to this phenomenon, the state education department has given it equivalence to Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE). Every student engaged in open schooling will be considered on a par with those who take the traditional route and will be awarded state board's certificate at the end of it.

A final decision in this regard had been pending since the state announced inclusion of open schooling in 2017, with work on the syllabus underway, being carefully scrutinised by the board. They had ascertained that final certificates will bear no difference, and subsequently, this decision was formalised through a December 21 government resolution.

Kale, chairman of MSBSHSE, said, ""An amendment or resolution was important to impart the equivalent status to open schooling. According to the new diktat, students who will appear for classes X and XII exams through open schooling will get the same certificates from the state board.""

The process of setting up open schools is in its final stages with two centres all set to function -- one each in and jurisdictions. A third centre will be disclosed in the coming week, after which enrolments are expected to commence. Also, students will now be allowed to take up home schooling, for which they will have to attempt exams for classes V, VIII, X and XII.

The syllabus will include Marathi as a compulsory subject with other choices being perched in a wide spectrum of vocations -- like Indian classical music and 13 skill-based subjects -- all approved by NCERT. The catalogue of skill-based subjects boasts of courses on beauty, baking and confectionery, printing, agriculture, water management, computer repair, art and craft among others.

The inclusion of such subjects, deemed the core of open schooling, was done with the objective of favouring those students who cannot go to a regular school due to keen interest in extra-curricular activities or sports. Furthermore, there is no upper age limit for enrolment (minimum being 10), the schooling will benefit children with special needs, senior citizens and others who lagged behind on education. They will be able to bag secondary and higher secondary board degrees through experiential learning.

Nonetheless, this announcement is still snagged with doubts as a handful of parents wonder if open schooling will of higher education for their children. For instance, Yamini Dhopavkar, a parent of fiveyear-old, who has been enrolled in an activity centre and planning for board for final examination, emphasised that these tests matter apart from experiential learning. ""It is important that even after imparting open schooling, the child should be able to apply for various higher education courses. If this open schooling gives equivalence to state board then definitely it will be one of the choices,"" she added."

Chandigarh has been ranked second by Niti Aayog in India's Index for Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) among all the states and Union Territories. It has topped the UTs with an index score of 68, a release by Ministry of Statistics, Government of India, Friday said.

The SDG India Index measures the progress of states and UTs complying with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. The First Baseline Report of SDG India Index for 2018 has been prepared with support from Global Green Growth Institute and the UN.

""Among the UTs, Chandigarh takes the lead because of its exemplary performance in providing clean water and sanitation to its people. It has further made good progress towards providing affordable and clean energy, generating decent work and economic growth, and providing quality education,"" the report stated.

Chandigarh is in the category of ""front runners"", while Himachal Pradesh and Kerala has topped the index with a score of 69. They are also ""front runners"" in achieving the SDG.

""We normalised the raw data on a score of 0-100. The lowest score means worst performing and 100 means best. A state or UT scoring 68 means that it is inching closer to the complete score in terms of accomplishment of the goals,"" said Officer on Special Duty Sanyukta Samaddar from Niti Aayog.

There were 16 SDGs, including sanitation and clean water, poverty eradication, human health, quality education and various others, on which the states/UTs were measured ""to help organise and streamline development actions for greater achievement of human well being"".

In the goal of ""Quality Education"", Chandigarh was among the best performing with 85 index score and ranked in ""front runners""

The goal was measured on adjusted net enrollment ratio at elementary (Class 1-8) and secondary (Class 9-10) schools, percentage of correct responses on learning outcomes in language, mathematics and EVS for Class 5 students, correct responses in language, mathematics, science and social science for Class 8 students and school teachers professionally qualified.

In the goal of ""Gender Equality"", Chandigarh scored 51, second among the states/UTs.

The goal was measured on sex ratio at birth (female per 1,000 male), average female to male ratio of average wages/salaries received per day by regular wage/salaried employees of age 15-59 years for rural and urban and ensuring women's full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision, percentage of seats won by women in the General elections to state legislative Assembly and various others.

However, there are several areas where a lot if improvement is required.

The first goal of ""No Poverty"" had Chandigarh scoring just 39 marks. The index parameters, under which the city was surveyed, included percentage of population living below National Poverty Line, households with any usual member covered by any health scheme or insurance, percentage of persons who demanded employment under MGNREGA, proportion of the population (out of the total eligible) receiving social protection benefits like maternity benefit and number of homeless per 10,000 households.

Chandigarh fell in ""Aspirant"" category, while Tamil Nadu and Mizoram were the best performers with 76 and 71 index score.

In another goal ""Good Health and Well Being"", Chandigarh has an index score of only 23, while Kerala tops with 92. Even Punjab and Haryana scored better than Chandigarh in this with 71 and 57 respectively.

In this category, the city was measured on parameters like maternal mortality ratio, number of government physicians, nurses, midwives per lakh population and under-five mortality rate per 1,000 live births, percentage of children aged 12-23 months fully immunised (BCG, measles and three doses of pentavalent vaccine) and annual notification of tuberculosis cases per lakh population. Chandigarh was found wanting on these criteria and thus scored among the least.

Similarly, in the category of ""Sustainable Cities and Communities"", Chandigarh has an index score of just 40. The parameters included percentage of urban households living in slums, wards with 100 per cent door-to-door waste collection, waste processed and others. Chandigarh has not been able to carry our segregation of waste at household level."

Thirteen generations before the protagonists of The Undoing Dance are born, a king in Tamil Nadu is raising a great tower over his Siva temple. He is thwarted when his engineers fail to raise a great dome over the tower. The god appears in a dream to explain the failure: a dancer dismissed from the king's service happens to be the god's favourite, and only with her aid will the monument be completed. That was the dancer Annakili Naachiyar, and her legend has passed down through her descendants to the the very end of the devadasi tradition of Kalyanikkarai, Tamil Nadu.

In another of Srividya Natarajan's registers this might have been conveyed as Shakespearean double entendre. Natarajan is a vividly irreverent comedian, and no mean Shakespearean, as the title of her previous novel, No Onions Nor Garlic, indicated. But No Onions - a book that many an Indian reviewer believes they alone have read - and The Undoing Dance are also zealously, and perhaps overzealously, careful about choosing their targets. No Onions was a campus satire about the Tamil Brahmin hold over academic life in Chennai, which swiped broadly and prankishly at every target in a poonal (a janeudhari, to employ the North Indianism du jour).

Her second novel is about the Tamil Brahmin hold over artistic life in Chennai, but it is serious, meditative and, in parts, wistful. In narrating a long but intimate drama about families breaking up and mending, it also becomes a story about the brahminical hold over private life. If puritanism is the enemy of art, it suggests, how can a caste system obsessed with purity be anything but art's executioner? Its plot, nimbly woven back and forth through time, is a frame both for Natarajan's argument for revisiting the history of dance, and for her attempts at finding fresh and appealing ways to describe the art itself.

Annakili Naachiyar's twentieth-century descendant Rajayi is a dancer like her mother and grandmother before her. She was brought up to immerse herself in her art. However, the culture of patronage that once sustained dancers like her forebears has given way under the economic and moral blows of British imperialism. Her young daughter Kalyani must be sent away with a do-gooding white woman, eager to save the child from what evangelical Christian missionaries perceive as a life of immorality and exploitation.

Indian independence replaces the British with an upper-caste ruling class. Their own economic and moral interests lie in erasing both the labour and the style of the temple artists, now conveniently derided as deviants, opportunists or simpletons as Brahmins take over their music and dance. Into this busy new Madras, Kalyani emerges, and marries a successful arts promoter. How they navigate their marriage, and how much of her past Kalyani is able to reveal to her husband Balan, forms one tightly-wound thread of the story.

The other unspools as we learn what has happened to Rajayi, who is left behind in rural Kalyanikkarai to eke out a living near the temple where her forebears danced, until a film crew arrives one day to put her in a documentary. A catastrophe sends Kalyani in search of her mother again, and the novel ends with the women reckoning with the aftermath. The novel unfolds almost wholly in the voices of women, from the reserved and courageous Kalyani to her unhappy mother-in-law Vijaya, and Hema, Kalyani and Balan's young daughter.

Natarajan, perhaps a little too aware of the readers most likely to be provoked to distaste by her story, may come on too strongly for the liking of readers who know and sympathise with her argument. The criticism of Bharatanatyam will sound familiar to those with even a passing knowledge of Chennai's performing arts scene. (TM Krishna's regular readers, for example, will know and embrace it.)

The voices of her characters tend to be overriden by their author's penchant for telling rather than showing, and showing rather than concealing. At the very end of the novel, a character likens Rajayi's dancing to the voice of Billie Holliday - a beautiful and charming analogy, but one followed up by the character wondering what connects them: ""the old connection between art and fertility and death?"" A double-meaning joke would have been less sophomorish.

The dance historian Jennifer Homans observed that ballet is ""an art of memory, not history"". With no texts, its tradition is passed down physically. Teachers encode its stories, and their own style, in the bodies of their students. Natarajan's dancers also live and learn in this way. But when a society decides to interrupt this reality, hoping to capture its historical grandeur and social importance while substituting its memory for an artificially sanitised one, the form is violated to its core.

""How did my mother dance so differently from me?"" Kalyani, who's spent her formative years as ""Callie"", studying the Bible and learning the austerities of Protestant evangelism in English, wonders. ""Her dance was part enactment (so remote, so ritualised, her neck flicking lightly from side to side, keeping the beat, no vulgar grasping at the real), and part conversation (so easy, so natural, like talking to one's cook or one's husband). I had to act. All the dancers in the class now were acting their emotions; they had been watching the way actors emoted in the movies; they didn't know how to enact anything.""

The Undoing Dance seems to want not merely to re-evaluate this past, but also to do right by it. It becomes deeply didactic, as discussions about the ""industrialisation"" of classical arts habitually do. This doesn't take away the pleasure of letting us be led by the story, rather than its motivating factors. But it does tend to echo the arguments of real life a little too resonantly. I was left to wonder if it's possible to do justice to the past in fiction without trying to rescue it. (I suppose the answer is no.)

Everything exciting and irritating about Natarajan's style here is also true of No Onions, as well as of her text for the graphic novel Gardener In The Wasteland, a tribute to Jotiba Phule's Ghulamgiri. She is a versatile artist and a staunch moralist, but not understated in either respect. Her books induce laughter and tears the more easily for it. We are fortunate to have them. But in The Undoing Dance, a study of how artistry is boxed up to be consumed as middlebrow culture, I missed, more than in any other instance, the author trying to enact rather than act, herself."

This was revealed at the fourth meeting of the varsity Court, its highest statutory body, at SK Inter­national Convention Centre (SKICC) here on Saturday. The meeting was chaired by the Chancellor, Lt. Gen (Retd) Atta Hasnai. CUK Vice-Chan­cellor, Prof. Mehraj ud Din Mir, Uni­versity of Kashmir, Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Talat Ahmad, Central Universi­ty of Jammu, Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Ashok Aima, Islamic University of Science and Technology (IUST) Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Mushtaq Siddique, former Vice-Chancellor, University of Kashmir, Prof. Jalees Ahmad Khan Tareen, Registrar, Prof. Fayaz A Nik­ka, Controller of Examinations, Prof. Parveen Pandit, Deans, Directors, Heads and Coordinators of different departments and Librarian, senior functionaries of the varsity were also present during the meeting.

Speaking on the occasion, Chan­cellor, Lt. Gen (Retd) Atta Hasnain, said, ""Education plays an important role in restoring, self-esteem, dig­nity and confidence among people anywhere. I have always loved the land and people of Kashmir."" He said the ""poor quality of land coupled with other issues has cre­ated impediments in the establish­ment of the varsity at its designated place."" He asked the faculty mem­bers to remain more ""interactive in order to cultivate the benefits of col­lective wisdom.""

Hasnain said the Central Univer­sity of Kashmir and Jammu should jointly hold academic and sports activities and invite students and scholars of their varsities to par­ticipate in them, adding the faculty members of both the institutions should frequently interact with each other. ""Both the universities should come up as model universities,"" he said. CUK Chancellor also advocated for promotion of mentorship in the institution and asked the students to conduct a research about the concept of mentorship and how can it make a difference in the function­ing of the university. He opined that a competition should be organised to prompt the students to write pa­pers on mentorship for which prizes should be awarded. Vice-Chancel­lor, Prof. Mehraj ud Din Mir, gave a detailed presentation about the university and said the varsity has nine Schools and 18 PG departments with near about 35 programmes in­cluding five year integrated courses and skill based programmes. He said the admission to the pro­grammes including research degree programmes offered by the CUK and other sister universities is jointly conducted by the consortium of 10 Central Universities on the ba­sis of Central Universities Common Entrance Test (CUCET). He said the Examination and Evaluation Wing of the university is always conduct­ing the End Semester Examinations (ESE) and other assessment tests on time and is declaring their results immediately.

""The number of students and scholars receiving education and pursuing research in the university as on date is more than 2300,"" Prof. Mehraj ud Din Mir said. He said the CUK has been able to get the senior qualified faculty on regular basis and the faculty members represent many States of India. Prof. Mir said the CUK has given due preference as far as professional development of the teachers and administrative staff is concerned.

Vice-Chancellor, said the uni­versity has already established an Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC), Directorate of Students Wel­fare, Research Council and other important cells and bodies, adding the university has an efficient stu­dents feedback system. Prof. Mehraj ud Din Mir said the varsity, despite facing infrastructural deficiencies, has organised several international and national seminars, workshops, conferences, guest and extension lectures and other academic activi­ties from time to time. He said the curriculum of all the programmes is upgraded to address the needs of different stakeholders including public and private sector. The uni­versity since recent past has been focusing more on skill based tech­nical courses and integrated pro­grammes to ensure employability of the graduates and to also make them skilled, he said adding the varsity has recently established a Design and Innovation Centre (DIC) to provide skill based training.

He said the university has al­ready shifted some of the teaching departments to Ganderbal and the departments of IT and ITSS are now operating from newly constructed Pre Engineered Building (PEB) at the designated campus site at Tulmulla while as the departments of Zoolo­gy, Biotechnology, Urdu and English are now functioning from Old dis­trict hospital Ganderbal, which has been renamed as the Science block.

He said the university admin­istration has been shifted to DIET building at Nunar Ganderbal, while as CMO building at Old district Hospital is being used as the Girls hostel. He said the university is also functioning from RUSA building in­side the Old Physical Education Col­lege Ganderbal, adding the scores of classrooms are being constructed in the College so that more teaching departments are shifted.

The members discussed several issued threadbare and also suggest­ed measures regarding the overall development of the varsity. Regis­trar, Prof. Fayaz A Nika, conducted the proceedings and also presented the agenda for the meeting."

It was in 2010 that Delhi's Shri Ram School Maths and Computer Science teacher Sujata Sahu first went on a trip to Ladakh. It was a solo trek, and on the third day, she began to face extreme difficulty breathing and walking. The low oxygen in the altitudes as high as 16,100 feet had given her Pulmonary Edema.

She needed to rest, and with the help of two passing trekkers, she decided to spend the night at a remote village --

""A village which has no road access, is reachable only after a day's walk, and one which boasted of just one home with three occupants. I had neither medicines, nor the ability to call my family, nor access to medical care,"" says 50-year-old Sahu, a resident of Gurugram.

In was in these conditions that she saw two tiny schools which totally changed her life.

The first primary school -- Sku-Kaya -- had five students and two teachers. It had two rooms which were being rebuilt. While one teacher had stayed in the village, the other had gone to Leh to get uniforms and mid-day meal supplies for the school.

The second school had eight children and three teachers. It was two of them who had stopped to help Sahu when she was feeling sick. They had been walking back to Leh for textbooks and uniforms

The children were being taught from English books, which was very alien to them as they had no electricity or TV or telephone connectivity and thus, had no idea what the outside world was like. Having never set foot out of their villages, the exposure level of these children was very low.

.In Ladakh, even the summer months were bitingly cold but that didn't stop the kids from coming to school to learn. ""One of the children even brought his little brother along, who was barely two years old and the love and care with which all the children and the teacher took care of the child was a lesson for me,"" says Sahu.

What really hit her on that fateful Ladakh trip was the sheer drive of the Ladakhi people there to keep growing and improving their circumstances.

""Their determination to come to school and learn, the eagerness of the teacher to learn something new to teach his students, and the aspiration of the parents to educate their children was my inspiration to drop everything and help these amazing people,"" says Sahu.

From a regular school teacher to Ladakh's 'Iron Lady'

""My experience with the schools in Ladakh gave me a path to follow, one that I knew I could contribute to,"" says Sujata Sahu, who had spent 12 years in the corporate world before starting to work with children.

But she had been working at the Shri Ram School for just two years at the time, and leaving this job was the hardest decision she had to make in her life.

""I was planning to take on a seemingly herculean task, in possibly one of the toughest terrains of the world. I had no idea about where I would get the funds from and was also not very clear on how much of an impact I alone could make,"" she says.

Moreover, no one had done something like this before her in Ladakh. But thankfully, she found with herself two strong founding partners -- her husband, Sandeep Sahu, who had been trekking in the region for almost 35 years, and Dawa Jora, a Ladakhi businessman, all of whom had the strong conviction that something like this was really needed for the region.

In 2011, unable to find other NGOs to partner with, the three founders went on a three-day trek to one of the most isolated villages in Lingshed (in Ladakh), carrying 1500 kg of education material on 25 horses, and crossing three mountains at extreme temperatures as low as minus 15 degrees.

The treacherous and steep pass they crossed at an altitude of almost 17000 ft inspired the name of the '17000 ft foundation'.

As she started off on her mission to provide Ladakh schools with the right resources to further the education of their students, she realised this wouldn't be very easy.

""One of our biggest challenges was convincing corporates that even remote areas with extremely scattered and small populations needed support,"" says Sahu.

For the first two years, the foundation worked only with the founders' own funds and kind contributions of friends and family members.

""Though no non-profit organisations were willing to take on Ladakh as a region, we were given support in the form of knowledge, pedagogy and even a large donation of books for our first 100 libraries,"" she says.

Sujata Sahu's undying passion to help the people of Ladakh earned her the nickname of the 'Iron Lady'.

How Ladakh poses a unique set of education problems

India is a geographical anomaly as it has every type of topographical setup, each of which comes with its own challenges. This makes it extremely difficult for the government to cater to every type of problem that can arise in this vast country owing to accessibility issues, extreme weather conditions etc.

Ladakh has almost a 1000 schools across Leh and Kargil, spread across 60,000 sq km of harsh mountains. Catering to a school going population of under 40,000 children, the average school strength of these schools is barely 25 students across the two districts, explains Sahu.

Teachers themselves come from remote villages and have to travel long distances for training, school supplies and even basic administrative functions, leading to long absences and shortage of staff, she adds.

Also, ""While teachers are given basic residential training during winters as well as in-service training, most of the trainings are not contextualized for the uniqueness of the Ladakhi education system,"" she says.

The extreme weather also adds to the problems with schools being shut for severe winters for three months in a year when the roads become inaccessible due to thick snow and temperatures as low as minus 35-40 degrees.

""Incredibly, despite the remoteness of the region, every little hamlet which has even 10 school going children has a tiny government school with teachers in attendance, thanks to the local administration. A little wonder then, that 89% of the schools in Ladakh are govt schools with the private schools present in just a handful of the larger villages,"" she says.

""What is commendable is that all these 900 plus schools are functional and have qualified teachers in attendance. What is even more remarkable is that every child in every village goes to school, managing to at least complete middle school,"" Sahu adds

However, it is only the larger villages which have middle schools and after passing class 5, children have to walk around two hours to get to school to continue their education. Public transport isn't available in such terrain and the army provides army vans for commuting.

.Despite the presence of these govt schools, the community here wants a better life and quality education for their children so they can get better jobs. This aspiration makes them send their very young children, often as young as three years old, to be enrolled in private schools, often extremely far away from their homes.

""Cut off from their villages and parents for months in a year, these children grow up in dormitories, hostels or with other families. Lacking the care and guidance they need in their growing up years, this leads to large-scale dropouts and a population of youth who are unable to go back to their villages,"" Sahu explains.

17000 ft works in these remote villages by improving existing govt schools so that parents would have faith in them and stop sending their children away so far that it disconnects them from their roots.

How voluntourism is helping 17000 ft foundation grow

Sujata Sahu started her non-profit organisation with just the founders and a few volunteers who were given the task to survey the entire length and breadth of Ladakh.

The team mapped around 600 schools after a seven-month-long study. Some of these schools had been bomb shelters during the Kargil war and the buildings had to be shifted multiple times.

The success of the volunteer programmes helped the foundation grow and each of these schools has been geo-mapped for travellers to find.

""We, very early on, piloted our volunteering programmes to involve outsiders in the work of our organization and to also understand if people could be encouraged to donate to such a cause. The enthusiasm and support shown by complete strangers told us that we were on the right track,"" says Sahu.

""Our volunteers, who are our brand ambassadors, then carried the story of our work into their workplaces and CSR then became our main source of funding. Voluntourism, as it is called today, still forms a good 25% of our annual budget and helps us maintain our backend costs,"" she adds.

Why playgrounds are so important in Ladakh schools

Though the govt schools all over Ladakh have proper buildings, they lack the proper facilities that make a school a happy, joyous and welcoming place for children. And in a remote location with rugged ground, a playground comes as a blessing.

""In these remote villages, where nothing is available, there are absolutely no options for children to play with. Though these schools have well-qualified teachers and very low pupil-teacher-ratio, parents often judge the performance of a school based just on the facilities they provide,"" says Sahu.

Thus, parents see the existence of a playground in govt schools as a very good incentive to not send away their kids to far-off private schools.

""Today, 17000 ft foundation has setup playgrounds in 140 schools with colourful swings, slides, see saws etc. many of which the team had to carry over horseback for days to reach our remotest schools,"" she says.

Solving the problem of no native language storybooks in Ladakh

A big aspect of Ladakh education that surprised Sujata Sahu was how the kids learned in English medium schools even though they have no exposure to the foreign language. Their native language was Bhoti.

""To add to this burden, children also have to study their local language as well an additional Hindi/Urdu from grade 1,"" says Sahu.

To enable the children to read better and get comfortable with the number of languages they have to deal with, 17000 ft set up libraries in 230 schools with simple and easy to read story books in English, Hindi and Urdu.

""However, sadly, there are absolutely no story books in Bhoti for children to read. Sensing this gap, we undertook a mission to translate storybooks from English to Bhoti.""

""In 2015, we launched our first phase where we translated 21 titles and published 21,000 storybooks for distribution into 300 schools,"" says Sahu.

This year again, the organisation not only translated another 20 titles, but also added illustrations and changed narratives to make them more relatable to the children of Ladakh.

What has 17000 ft foundation achieved so far?

In the span of just six years, Sujata Sahu's organisation has accomplished much.

""Today, 17000 ft works with 250 govt schools across Leh and Kargil and we are already seeing a reverse trend of children coming back from private schools back to the govt schools in their villages,"" says Sahu.

The organisation has set up libraries in 230 schools, playgrounds in 140 schools, and trained over 1500 teachers in various methodologies with a team which is in Ladakh every winter for training teachers.

17000 ft foundation has conducted multiple community workshops in 125 villages with over 10,000 villagers contributing to our workshops and programmes in the schools.

Recently, the organisation electrified and digitized 120 schools in Leh and Kargil, providing solar electricity and tablets with customized digital learning content, a TV, and a server to provide offline data syncing.

The DigiLab project is the non-profit's most ambitious programme bringing offline hybrid digital learning solutions to the remote villages.

The well-furnished digital labs supported by workshops from the team throughout the year can help the students learn independently with guidance from their teachers.

How crowfunding is helping 17000 ft foundation

Crowdfunding is increasingly coming up as a very important resource collection measure.

""17000 ft has been involved with ImpactGuru.com in multiple projects, the latest being the funding of a Playground for a very remote school in Kargil. We had also fundraised for our Bhoti Book Translation project through ImpactGuru.com and managed to raise more than we needed,"" says Sahu.

Fundraising platforms are great for helping nonprofits fund small projects that have tangible goals and timelines. It is an excellent way to help get the word out to potential supporters and garner more support for the non-profit, says the Iron Lady of Ladakh.

Future of 17000 ft foundation

Before 17000 ft was established, there was little or no attention on the remote schools of Ladakh, and today with all our work and efforts and the participation of the local communities, govt schools are looking and performing better and we are seeing a reverse trend of children coming back to their villages and govt schools.

""When we started, one of our biggest challenges was encouraging donors, volunteers, foundations and even corporates to focus on remote regions of Ladakh. Today, however, we are confident that our model is working and we can get the support we need,"" beams Sahu.

Sujata Sahu now wants to take this model to other remote and mountainous regions, like Arunachal Pradesh, or the remote areas of Himachal.

""We feel that we are closer now to our vision of a better life and education for all children, regardless of geography or terrain,"" she says.

Each year on the 22 December, schools and educational institutes around the country observe and celebrate National Mathematics Day.

And while not everyone feels the need to celebrate mathematics, the day is observed not to honour the field as a whole, but a very special Indian mathematician whose trust with mathematics has inspired books, art and our tradition to commemorate the genius of Srinivasa Ramanujan on 22 December each year - his birth anniversary - as National Mathematics Day.

Born in 1887 in the charming city of Erode, Tamil Nadu, Ramanujan's earliest stories begin around the age of 12. He had mastered the dizzying logic of trigonometry and developed theorems on his own without any assistance.

His passion for mathematics and the brilliance of the world it translated to at an early age.

The wiz kid

Turning 10 years old in 1897, he aced his primary school exams in English, Tamil, geography and arithmetic with the best scores in his district. Ramanujan entered Town Higher Secondary School that year, where he encountered formal mathematics for the first time.

By age 11, he had exhausted the mathematical knowledge of two college students lodging at his home, and was lent a book on advanced trigonometry around the same time. He mastered this by age 13, by which time he was discovering sophisticated theorems on his own.

Ramanujan at 14 was being lauded with merit certificates and academic awards in a trend that weaves through his entire school career, where he also assisted the school with logistics of placing 1200 students, each with needs of their own, under the tutelage of its 35-odd teachers.

He would complete mathematical exams in half the allotted time, and unwittingly brought on comments from his peers over the years, who ""rarely understood him"" and ""stood in respectful awe"" of him in the years since.

Awakening the genius

Ramanujan at age 16 in 1903 got access to a library copy of a book - A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics, a collection of 5,000 mathematical theorems, which he reportedly studied in great detail. This book is generally acknowledged by accounts of his life as a key element in awakening his genius.

Towards his schooling's end, this earned him a scholarship to study at the Government Arts College of Kumbakonam in Tamil Nadu. His headmaster in school would introduce Ramanujan as ""the outstanding student who deserved scores higher than the maximum"". But he squandered the opportunity due to his horrendous performance in other important subjects, including English, philosophy and Sanskrit.

Without a formal degree, Ramanujan is said to have dropped out of college and pursued research in mathematics on his own, living in stark poverty, at the brink of starvation. It was in 1910 at age 23 that support from renowned mathematician Ramaswamy Iyer helped him scored a job clerking at the Madras Port Trust.

Cambridge calling

He would work at the office by day, and do what came naturally to him (theoretical mathematics, that is) in his spare time. British mathematician G Hardy wrote Ramanujan a letter in 1913, expressing interest in learning more about his work. It was ""essential that I should see proofs of some of your assertions"", he is said to have added.

Ramanujan responded to Hardy, who eventually became his mentor, on principles of mutual interest to them, saying:

""I beg to introduce myself to you as a clerk in the Accounts Department of the Port Trust Office at Madras... I have no University education but I have undergone the ordinary school course. After leaving school I have been employing the spare time at my disposal to work at Mathematics. I have not trodden through the conventional regular course which is followed in a University course, but I am striking out a new path for myself.""

G Hardy and Ramanujan ended up working together in Cambridge for five years shortly after their first correspondence. Their collaboration was a clash of different cultures, beliefs, and working styles, but his work in Mathematics made a left a deep impression on Hardy for years to come. Hardy was quoted to have said about Ramanujan in a book:

""He could remember the idiosyncrasies of numbers in an almost uncanny way. It was Littlewood (a mutual colleague) who said that every positive integer was one of Ramanujan's personal friends. I remember once going to see him when he was ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an unfavorable omen. ""No,"" he replied, ""it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.""

A self-made luminary

Born to a housewife and a sari clerk, his family home in Kumbakonam was small and modest. The modest thatched-roof house on Saranhapani Sannidhi Street has been turned into a museum in his honour.

Ramanujan was a self-taught mathematician. He contributed inordinately to the world of mathematics, and was globally popular - one of the most influential mathematicians of his time. From compiling over 3900 mathematical theorems and equations to having discoveries and streets named after him, his assertions in mathematics were unshakeable and profound to others researching mathematics."

There is no doubt that the school education sector is beset with huge problems. However, whether the dismal performance is on account of policy gap or there are other factors that are responsible for the current state of affairs is a moot point.

Let us first try to understand what has not happened in the education sector. Why has it not happened? And, how can it happen (whether through policy intervention or otherwise)?

Two things have certainly happened during the current millennium. The infrastructure (school buildings) has shown remarkable improvement though there is still a long way to go. And, thanks to the mid-day-meal, we have managed to get the child to the school.

However, what is appalling is the poor quality of education that is imparted in most of the government schools. This is evidenced by the fact that the learning outcomes have actually come down during the past decade despite enormous amount of investments. The number of teachers has gone up substantially and the average pupil-teacher ratio comes close to the required levels.

However, this does not solve the problem of quality. To begin with, a large number of teachers are not qualified to teach, yet they are teaching. According to a rough estimate, out of eight million teachers around 1.4 million fall in this category. Politics has seeped into this cadre in the most insidious manner resulting in skewed distribution of teachers in most of the States as the tendency is to hang in and around urban areas.

The Right to Education Act did precious little on this front. In fact, the legislation made the task of delivering quality education complex and difficult. The focus of the Act is primarily on 'inputs' (like infrastructure) rather than 'outcomes'. It has created an adversarial role between 'public' and 'private' schools. The Act mandates under Section 12(1)(c) that even private schools ""shall admit in Class I, to the extent of at least 25 per cent of the strength of that class, children belonging to weaker section and disadvantaged group."" The manner in which reimbursement is to be provided has created a number of problems.

The norms and standards prescribed in the schedule for a school are far removed from ground reality. What is perhaps desirable has been made mandatory. This has resulted in a phenomenal increase in the number of teachers. During 2015-16, there were 39,608 government schools that had less than 10 children but each school was mandated to have minimum of two teachers.

The budget private schools, most of whom are doing a great job in imparting education, are under enormous pressure to meet the prescribed standards or face closure. No attempt was made while enacting this legislation to look at the ground reality.

The consequences have been disastrous. On an average, an amount of around ₹10,000 per child gets spent in government schools. The budget schools do it for much less and impart as good, if not better, education. Unfortunately, the focus so far has primarily been on regulation (legislations are perhaps meant for that) and not on development of the private sector. Consequently, even after eight years of enactment, the country is none the better than what it was.

The RTE Act has done more damage to delivery of education. Section 16 of the Act provides that ""No child admitted in a school shall be held back in any class or expelled from school till completion of elementary education.""

The 'expulsion' part can be understood but not holding back a child in a class has meant that a large number of children are getting promoted without acquiring the necessary attributes. The model of 'no detention' was apparently picked up from the West and transplanted in this country without taking into account the objective conditions obtaining here.

Yet again, the consequences have been devastating as there is a huge bottleneck getting created at Class X where the pass percentage has plummeted. The States were not even given freedom to take a call on the issue. The government has subsequently decided to provide an option to the States and the amendment is under consideration of Parliament.

A new Education Policy is round the corner. However, what needs to be understood is whether there is a need for a policy to address the issues that afflict school education. Most of the action relating to education lies in the States. In any case, the country is too diverse to consider a single mandate by way of policy for the entire country. If a teacher does not go to a school in Kerala, he could well be ""lynched"" but in some of the States of northern India, they consider it their right not to go to the school. There are instances of these regular teachers employing a ""substitute"" to represent them and even teach on their behalf.

What is actually required is an action plan clearly outlining: What needs to be done? How it will be done? Who will do it? And, by when it will be done? The roles of respective entities should be clearly defined so that the performance can be assessed. One has often wondered why should only the Centre assess the performance of States? Why can't it be the other way round?

The action plan needs to focus on the teacher who plays a pivotal role in imparting education. The entire value chain needs to be looked at, understood and interventions clearly outlined. Beginning with pre-service training, to selection process, to in-service training, to transfer and posting, to engagement of teachers in non-educational activities, to their promotional avenues and morale will need to be looked at.

An action plan for each State will have to be worked out in detail, clearly outlining the roles of the Centre and the respective State government. Intervention for each State will vary from State to State. Unlike the present dispensation, there will have to be sufficient flexibility in the central schemes to accommodate the differences among States. The whole approach has to be outcome based rather than input based as has been the case so far.

Our country has been obsessed with the western world. We had looked at Finland, England, Scotland, Holland and all the lands of the world but not at motherland. A lot of wonderful work is being done within the country but has so far gone unnoticed. ""Policy"" cannot help in this regard.

What needs to be done is to facilitate identification, understanding and scaling of successful practices. If these home-grown practices have succeeded in the prevalent objective conditions, the chances of their replication and scaling are pretty high as compared to an 'imported' idea or practice.

What is also required is to learn from States, like Rajasthan, that have turned it around through some remarkable State level interventions both administrative and financial.

Policy debates provide food for intellectual stimulation but what matters is what is done on the ground. Hence, the dire need for an action plan."

Thereafter I'll write a TOI blog post on this topic.

Who are these economists?

Thirteen senior economists, including former Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan, IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath and Sajjid Chinoy of JP Morgan. Others are: Abhijit Banerjee, Pranjul Bhandari, Maitreesh Ghatak, Amartya Lahiri, Neelkanth Mishra, Prachi Mishra, Karthik Muralidharan, Rohini Pande, Eswar Prasad and E. Somanathan.

Unfortunately, I've not heard of any of these economists apart from Raghuram Rajan and read none of them before. I read only the world's best economists (with Hayek and Friedman being my benchmark), and no Indian economist comes in that category. And given what these economists have produced in this report, I will not be reading their work anyway.

In this report, they're OK on labour reforms, ordinary on most issues and pretty hopeless on agriculture, education and healthcare. Most importantly, they have totally missed governance reforms although they repeatedly point out the massive failure of government in every field. A major blind spot these economists need to fix.

The Imperative for Strong, Equitable, and Sustainable Growth

India is one of the fastest growing large countries in the world, having grown at an average of almost 7 percent for the last 25 years. There have been many notable reforms over this period - most recently, the co-operative fiscal federalism that has brought the Goods and Services Tax into being, the enactment of the Indian Bankruptcy Code, and the dramatic dis-inflation of recent years, partly as a result of a move to an inflation targeting regime.

While commendable, we should not be satisfied with this. India is still one of the poorest countries in the G-20, and poor countries ought to grow faster because catch-up growth is easier. As important, the benefits of growth in India have been distributed extremely unequally, with top incomes rising much faster than the rest. [Sanjeev: The real issue remains extreme poverty] We have seen new environmental challenges, in the form of sharp increases in both local pollution levels and in CO2 emissions [Sanjeev: CO2 emissions are GOOD, not bad] that, if unchecked, threaten to stall or reverse progress. India is also not creating enough jobs: even though data on employment in India are both low quality and controversial, the recent news that 28 million applied for 90,000 low level railway jobs suggests we are not satisfying the demand for jobs.1 Unfortunately, we are not well-positioned to follow the export-led growth path that allowed many Asian countries to climb out of poverty. Despite abundant cheap labor, we are not part of many global supply chains. Even as global firms seek to diversify away from China so as to reduce political risk, India is rarely seen as an obvious alternative. [That's because socialism has messed up everything in India]

Given India's continental size, it need not follow the export-led path. It will, however, have to ensure that growth generates jobs and incomes across the skill spectrum, in the process

There are tremendous possibilities for reforms that will take us towards faster and more equitable growth, as this report will lay out. However, we have to allocate scarce resources carefully to make sure that there is enough investment in sectors such as infrastructure to create jobs. India's aggregate fiscal deficit (state plus center) is still close to 6.5 percent of GDP, higher than almost any in the G-20, and not significantly lower than levels that existed five years ago. However, our investment rate has fallen sharply in recent years. Despite that, our external financing requirement (as measured by the current account deficit) increased appreciably earlier this year, increasing vulnerability. Moreover, to the extent that India grows while being more reliant on domestic demand than were other Asian emerging markets, it needs a much greater focus on macroeconomic stability than they did. For all these reasons, it needs to prioritize government spending better, focusing on filling clear investment gaps and protecting the vulnerable. It also needs to increase revenues by making the tax system more progressive both in taxes levied as well as through more effective collection from rich non-payers, by bringing more people into the tax net, and by charging users for government services where appropriate.

A key factor in spurring growth will be reforms that alleviate ""supply side"" constraints on growth and job creation. We have to enable both the industrial sector as well as the service sector to operate at larger scale. This involves embracing highly overdue labor reforms including allowing for a rich menu of contracts with workers that allow for more possibilities than just permanent workers and short term contractual labor in firms [Agree]. Such additional contracting possibilities could give workers more job security, give firms the incentive to train and invest in their skilling, even while giving firms more reason to scale up. Similarly, cleaner title to land, as well as a land acquisition process that protects the seller while simplifying acquisition, will reduce the cost of developing land, a critical need if we are to create jobs [Agree, but these economists should ask why Indian governance system can't perform this most basic function]. A more predictable and better regulatory environment - which prunes redundant or unnecessary regulation, carefully sets regulations in new areas necessitated by our development, and enforces regulations effectively and impartially - will create a much better environment for business. We must also improve the capabilities as well as strengthen the independence of our regulatory institutions. [Agree, but why is India's governance in such a mess even today?]

Scale is also key for productivity growth which, in turn, is essential for India to expand its share of world exports. The ongoing reorientation of the United States away from dependence on China provides India with a great opportunity to position itself as a viable alternative for cheap sourcing of goods and parts. But this would require macro and industrial policy reforms of the kind just outlined that remove existing impediments to India becoming a valued partner in global supply chains. Rolling back the recent increases in import tariffs along with a renewed commitment to resisting protective policies would be a good way of signaling this goal. [Agree]

In outlining an economic agenda, we have to recognize government capacity is limited - the number of government employees is often low relative to the tasks they are assigned [Sanjeev: TOTALLY DISAGREE here. The issue is SHEER AND TOTAL INCOMPETENCE AND CORRUPTION]. This is often compounded by low staff motivation and relatedly high absenteeism, as well as inadequate training. Government takes on too much, while delivering too little. Yet for growth to be equitable, a must in our democracy, effective and well-targeted government engagement is essential. [Why are these economists not talking about governance reforms?]

One partial solution is more decentralization, with more powers and funding delegated to the states, and perhaps more importantly, within the states to municipalities and panchayats. It will allow for a much more dynamic decision-making process, resulting in government policies that are more sensitive to local conditions, as well as more local democratic control of officialdom. [This is fine in principle but totally fails to account for the fact that the SAME bureaucracy and political incentives will lead to the SAME outcome.]

The strategic use of technology has the potential to help here as long as we are careful not to make a fetish of technology, are mindful of the human dimension of transactions, and deploy technology with enough safeguards. Technology can make it easier to monitor flows of funds and uses of funding locally, allowing for more devolution of funding, something that has been proposed by previous Finance Commissions. More generally, effective use of technology can also help substitute for government manpower, increase the points of access to government services, help monitor service provision, and reduce leakage in the system.

The debate on whether the public sector should occupy areas that can be done by the private sector will no doubt continue, and there is an obvious case for exiting areas where the public sector contributes little while draining the exchequer and distorting competition. [Sanjeev: Why is government involved in ANY business at all? And this is not a specific recommendation: a motherhood statement] The government should also reconsider its interventions in areas where it adds noise and uncertainty - for instance, the constant fiddling with agricultural import tariffs, the unpredictable closures or opening of export and import windows, and the inability to procure agricultural commodities or release them effectively, does significantly more damage than good to agriculture. While actions are taken in the name of the farmer or the consumer, it is the middleman who often benefits. [Sanjeev: there's nothing wrong with the middleman benefiting in a competitive and open market. But the market is not open. This recommendation fails to recognise the huge blockages on agriculture sector trade.]

Moreover, even when the consumer benefits from high farm production and low agricultural prices, which also help contain inflation, the cost to the farmers can be significant. The case of pulses is revealing. In 2016-17 for example, India witnessed its highest ever domestic production - close to 23 million metric tonnes -- likely reflecting a combination of a normal monsoon after successive droughts and the farmer response to higher market prices and MSPs. This was sufficient to fully satisfy domestic demand. Despite that, India imported a hefty 6.6 million tonnes of pulses (almost a third of total domestic production) at zero import duty - leading to a massive domestic supply glut, and a sharp and sustained fall in pulse prices over the next two years which continues to this day, with prices currently 30% lower than their 2016 peaks.

In addition to getting the government out of areas it should not be in, there is an equally urgent task of strengthening the government in areas it does poorly or is virtually absent in - for instance, regulating and certifying educational or medical service providers, apprehending and successfully prosecuting economic offenders [What about non-economic??!!], or regulating haphazard development and environmental despoliation without blocking growth. [When even murderers like Modi can remain on the loose, then what hope of justice? This was the opportunity to talk about governance reforms.]

For growth to be equitable and sustained, we have to reform our education, skilling, healthcare, and welfare systems significantly. Our record on primary education is dismal, with only about half of the children in class five able to do math or reading at the second-grade level. Parents have responded by increasingly migrating to private schooling, but private schools are only slightly better than government schools, and in their current form will not solve the problem of low education quality. [This is a TERRIBLE comment to make - to downplay private enterprise, the only thing that is working in India for the POOR] It does not get better at higher grades -- our PISA scores were so low that we refused to participate again in that international benchmarking exercise. The poor quality of human capital may already be constraining growth (industry is increasingly concerned about the large and growing skill deficit), limits its inclusiveness and prompt a premature move to replace workers with machines.

Healthcare is another area of major concern. In particular, the public system has largely been abandoned by the patients seeking regular primary care. They prefer paying for private treatment even though many practitioners are unqualified and prescribe the wrong treatment in more than 70% of the cases. This is partly a consequence of the failure of the public sector -- public sector practitioners are often absent, and when present they put very little effort into treatment. It is unclear how the recent Ayushman Bharat insurance scheme, which is the main current effort to deal with healthcare issues, will address this issue. [Sanjeev: with the BLATANT failure of government staring in the face, where is the talk about governance reforms?]

This is especially a problem because dealing with the large growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and the many, only partly-solved, child and maternal health issues, relies heavily on getting frontline providers to lead the charge. Similar concerns apply in the education sector. A failure to ensure high-quality education and health care provision means that a substantial proportion of our future labor force will grow up underequipped with skills needed in the labor market and suffering from the long term consequences of stunting and wasting. Much of the middle-aged population will be dealing with debilitating diseases that could have been prevented or controlled. This obviously limits the sustainability and the inclusiveness of growth.

The environment is, of course, a critical challenge to the continuation of our growth and to the extent to which growth translates into improved quality of life. Many of our cities are increasingly experiencing levels of pollution that border on the toxic. If we cannot manage the environment at our present level of development, greater growth will make matters far worse. [Sanjeev: once again, this points to severe government failure - but no mention of the need for governance reforms] The consequences of environmentally myopic policies are reflected, for example, in the rapidly falling water table in many parts of the country, which threatens the sustainability of our agriculture. Relatedly, climate change is already having very significant effects on productivity and the quality of lives in India and we need to be at the forefront of global efforts to combat it. [Sanjeev: this claim is, of course, CRAP]

That our current policies do not add up to an inclusive and sustainable growth agenda is reflected in growing agitation across our society. Agrarian unrest, and the constant demand for loan waivers, is now compounded by demands for some form of government support from sections of society that are nowhere near the poorest. This reflects Indians' growing anxiety about their future and that of their children in an increasingly winner-take-all society, where they often end up on the losing side. Our welfare schemes like the MGNREGA and Pradhan Mantri Gramin Awas Yojana are mostly directed towards the very poor (the one exception being the public distribution system), so they do not serve the purpose of protecting those outside that group. Without stronger, sustainable, and inclusive growth we simply do not have the resources to expand our welfare schemes significantly, [Sanjeev: BUT WHY SHOULD WELFARE BE EXPANDED?] but if we do generate that growth, not only will there be less demand for welfare but there will be more resources to service any demand.

The bottom line is that while we have performed creditably in the last 25 years across different administrations, we cannot be complacent about our economic challenges. They are mounting. We are a group of economists, each with different specializations and interests, who have come together to offer proposals for the way ahead. Some of us are based in India, some outside, but we are all closely engaged in, and concerned about, India's development. We do not belong to any party, nor are we from the government. We hope this non-partisan analysis of our situation, while not intended to be comprehensive, will help spur debate as India moves to elections. The rest of this note summarizes our proposals, and offers our consensus view on some of the key issues we face. We then append individual notes by members of the group, which offers more details of individual views and proposals. Each note reflects the view of the author(s) in their personal capacity, and does not necessarily represent the institution they are affiliated with.

Macroeconomic stability: a prerequisite to sustainable growth and job creation

India's economic history is replete with the same lesson: preserving and protecting macroeconomic stability is an essential prerequisite to strong and sustained growth. Every time macro stability has been traded off to boost growth, the economy has been pushed towards a crisis, the consequences of which have undermined the very growth that was the initial policy focus.

Ensuring macroeconomic stability has at least three elements to it: maintaining low and stable inflation, ensuring the consolidated fiscal deficit leaves enough space for private investment, and ensuring that the current account deficit is sustainable and can be financed largely through stable capital inflows, to help insulate the economy from sudden swings in global sentiment. High and variable inflation constitutes a regressive tax, with the poor bearing the biggest brunt, since their incomes are typically least indexed to inflation. It also dissuades foreign investors from investing in rupee assets. Similarly, large and unsustainable fiscal/external imbalances impart significant macroeconomic and financial market uncertainty, push up borrowing costs and risk premia in the economy and threaten financial stability. All this impedes private and public investment.

Fiscal consolidation to creating space for more investment

The economy has made significant progress in combating inflation in recent years. Over the last 4 years inflation has averaged just over 4% versus almost 10% in the previous five years, and household inflation expectations are getting progressively anchored. The same, however, cannot be said of the fiscal side.

While the center's fiscal deficit has been steadily brought down, the combined deficit of the states - even after adjusting for UDAY - has continued to widen in recent years and, thereby, largely undone the center's consolidation. Consequently, the consolidated fiscal deficit in 2017-18, stood above 6.5%, not very different from its levels five years ago. Our primary suggestions to make progress on this difficult issue:

De-risking the external sector

India's heavy dependence on oil imports often results in ""boom-bust"" cycles on the balance of payments when crude prices change. For example, the CAD narrowed to 0.7% of GDP in 2016-17 as crude prices fell and was then tracking close to 3% of GDP in 2018 when crude prices bounced back up. This resulted in a large balance of payments surplus in the first instance and a large deficit in the second. These sharp swings complicate monetary policy, as well as exchange rate and liquidity management, and create undue external and fiscal volatility (since oil prices also alter the fiscal math). We should:

Fixing the Stressed Sectors

Careful but quick policy reforms are needed for the sectors/areas that are stressed. These include agriculture, infrastructure (including power), exports and banking. There are common themes in any revival. Typically, we need to redeploy government effort in each of these sectors, focusing it on areas where it is truly needed to play an enabling role, while freeing the sector of excessive bureaucracy and intervention, which results in inadequate access to markets, distorted prices, and poor incentives. While the recent focus on improving India's ranking on the World Bank's Doing Business measures is commendable, we should guard against the temptation to focus on the specifics of the World Bank measures, while neglecting the broader impediments to producing in India. [Agreed] We now consider each of these sectors in more detail.

Agriculture & the rural economy

We need deep rooted transformation of agriculture, treating it not as a sector that has to be propped up through repeated sops, but as an engine of India's job creation and growth. For that, it is imperative that we thoroughly reform agricultural and land policies. In particular, a key source of agrarian distress in recent years has been that the terms-of-trade confronting farmers has turned progressively more adverse, partly as a result of policies to combat food inflation. While low inflation is desirable in itself, the impact on farmers also needs to be taken into account. A policy priority should be to reduce distortions in farm product prices as well as input prices. Another important enabler is technology, both in educating and informing farmers, as well as in opening access to markets. Some specific proposals include

Infrastructure

Accelerating the pace of the infrastructure build-out will help in a number of ways; it will create jobs in construction and new economic activity around the resulting roads, ports, airports, railways, and housing; it will promote inclusion as it connects interior rural areas to markets; it will make our exports (and import-competing manufacturing) more competitive as it reduces input costs such as land (as cheaper areas are connected) and power, as well as improves logistics and reduces transportation costs; it will open up India to both domestic and foreign tourism, which can be a tremendous source of semi- skilled jobs. This will require

Power

Despite having some of the largest reserves of coal, as well as having substantial unutilized power generation capacity, India is both short of coal as well as short of power. These are policy self-goals, arising from both the dominant presence of government in coal mining and power distribution as well as populist impulses in pricing. Nevertheless, our low base allows us to choose a path that is both more energy efficient as well as less polluting as we reform the system for the twenty first century. For this we need:

Exports

India's non-oil, non-gold current account has deteriorated by almost 3% of GDP in the last three years, suggesting an urgent need to improve the underlying competitiveness of the tradable sector. Boosting exports should be the lynchpin of that strategy. [Sanjeev: Any economist who says this is simply not a good economist. Refer to Kautilya, and the best economists who agree that IMPORTS are the key. Let consumption be the focus of economists, and exports are a minor subset of this production process.] The existing constraints in the export sector appear to be reflective of more general problems in manufacturing: low scale of production, low productivity, bureaucratic impediments, high cost of inputs like land and power. We have suggested ways to address these earlier. In addition,

Financial Sector

Given the non-performing asset (NPA) build up in the banking system, it is imperative we make the banking system more robust and well capitalized [Sanjeev: HOW? By taxpayer subsidy??], expand its capacity to extend credit, and improve incentives to lend to the most productive sectors. While the recent travails of the NBFCs are a matter of concern, some of their problems stem from an overly rapid expansion of their balance sheets as they grew to substitute for banks. Stability in the banking system will help spread stability to other parts of the financial system as, of course, will the reverse.

The main challenges for the banking sector are to improve governance, transparency, and incentives in the banking system. Key measures should include

The non-bank financial sector needs a strong banking system as well as deep equity and bond markets, supported by liquid secondary markets and a robust regulatory and legal infrastructure. Key priorities include:

Making growth inclusive and sustainable

A good job is often the most important form of inclusion. In addition, we need to help individuals obtain the human capabilities that will enable them to secure and hold that job, as well as protect those who cannot get jobs. Let us now turn to proposals on inclusion.

Education

The single greatest limitation of the Indian education system is its inability to deliver universal functional literacy and numeracy in primary school. Several studies show that students who fail to achieve basic skills by the end of class 3 learn very little in subsequent years even if they are enrolled in school. Our top education policy priority is therefore:

The Right to Education (RTE) Bill's input-based approach to education quality was unlikely to succeed given the extensive evidence that most school inputs are neither necessary nor sufficient for improving learning outcomes. RTE has led to an unnecessary and disruptive closure of several low-cost private schools that parents were choosing of their own accord. In many cases, even government schools are in violation of these input-based norms. We therefore recommend:

While improvement in schooling is a key building block to education, we cannot neglect either vocational training/skilling or college education. Both will be critical to providing our youth with the wherewithal for the jobs of the future. High quality research universities will be essential, both to train the teachers for our colleges as well as to fuel the innovation needed for the next stage of our growth. [Sanjeev: GET THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF THESE]

Dealing with the skills shortage

There is wide recognition that the current models of publicly subsidized skilling are not performing very well even though skills are extremely scarce. What seems to work better is the skilling provided by private firms that are training their own labor force. However, under current laws, firms can employ workers for up to one year after which they either have to fire them or make them permanent. Since there are significant costs and inflexibilities in making workers permanent, many firms keep workers on short contracts and terminate them before they can become permanent. This state of affairs serves neither the firm, which has to hire new workers frequently and has no incentive to train them, nor the worker, who has no security of employment, and who is not trained. At the same time, since the government is often the only employer that offers secure jobs, young people spend their twenties applying for these jobs rather than working. However, these jobs are extremely expensive thanks partly to the munificence of the Pay Commissions and therefore there are too few of them. As a result, a cynic could argue that the government and the private sector lack manpower, while young people sit at home filling applications and preparing for tests. We propose that:

Women's labor force participation

There are clearly both supply-side issues-families not allowing women to work, women feeling disempowered -- and demand-side issues -- lack of women-friendly jobs in the private sector as well as discrimination. Some useful first steps here:

Healthcare

There is much to be done to reform the healthcare system in India. Increasingly, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer play a much bigger role, so healthcare needs to be reoriented to address these.

Environment

Even while business complains about the difficulty of getting environmental approvals, the quality of our environment leaves much to be desired and with climate change looming we should be thinking in terms of reaching peak emissions within the next decade or so and then sharply reducing them. For all of this we need to get more professional about the environment and climate change, as well as more transparent about the regulatory process.

Social Protection

India has more than 400 separate social protection schemes. A vast majority of them are funded at very low levels and do very little. However, they absorb some amount of bureaucratic capacity. And despite the wide variety of schemes available on paper, as the many protests make clear, people do not feel protected. In particular while MGNREGA provides some support for the rural landless, most other relatively poor people have only the PDS to fall back on. This is one reason that it is so difficult to remove any government scheme, however inefficient. There is a clear need to create a reliable pipeline for providing compensation for losers, as we move towards a more rational system of social protection. The Direct Benefits Transfer is a good starting point and building on it by being credible in compensating losers will be key. Specifically we suggest"

There are 320 students in the Primary School, Pipariya in Bhojipura block of Bareilly district.

To inculcate the concept of banking and savings in children, a teacher in a primary school of Bareilly has set up a 'school bank' that is run by students and is meant to meet their stationery requirements during their stay on the campus.

To run this bank, students voluntarily contribute Rs 2 each while teachers also willingly make donations. There are 320 students in the Primary School, Pipariya in Bhojipura block of Bareilly district.

""This money is used in buying pencils, erasers, sharpeners, rulers, few books and kept in a cupboard in the principal's room, which they call green counter. Earlier, when students forgot to bring stationery, they used to go home to bring it, and in the process, often missed the class,"" explained assistant teacher Saurabh Shukla who has introduced the concept.

But all these are things of past. Now, on a day when students don't bring their pencil box, they don't go home. Instead, they walk into the 'school bank' and are allowed to borrow the same at zero interest for a day, he said.

Due to availability of stock in the 'school bank', the students are able to continue with their studies without any hindrances. The class also does not get disturbed. However, while going home after the school gets over, they are required to deposit the same back in the 'school bank', which is managed by students, said the teacher.

One Nikhil, a Class 5 student, has been appointed as manager of the 'School Bank'. But a teacher will assist him. ""The school teacher explained the concept. Everybody was convinced that it will be of great help for everyone. After whatever little money we could raise, teachers opened their wallet and heart to bridge the deficit. The school bank is now doing wonders,"" said Nikhil.

The 'School Bank' follows simple rules. Students of any class may avail the facilities of this bank. If a student fails to bring any stationery, he is not required to go back home and bring it. He just has to go to the bank, make an entry of the borrowed item in the register and attend class.

In case a student misplaces the borrowed item, he is supposed to give it back to the bank within 30 days. ""But below poverty line students are exempt from this rule. Students will be allowed to borrow things twice a week and seven times a month so that they do not make borrowing a habit,"" said Rinki, a student of the school.

The 'school bank' manager will be appointed from a senior class at regular intervals. Candidates with good academic record will be considered for the job, said the teacher.

The basic education department has appreciated the initiative of the school, and if found feasible, the same can be replicated in other schools too, said an official.

These days, Sagar Singh frets about the academic future of his daughter who studies at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Delhi's Cantonment area.

""There are hardly any teachers there. She often tells me that kids sit clueless as teachers are forced to teach subjects they themselves don't understand well. I wonder if she will remain underprepared for challenges ahead in life, he said.

Singh sums up the crisis in Delhi government schools which have only 35,034 regular teachers against a sanctioned strength of 64,096. A shortage of 29,062 regular hands (45.34 per cent) has left the teachers exhausted and students vulnerable. A total of 15,04,627 students are enrolled in 1,024 schools run by the AAP government.

There are 22,016 guest teachers that take the existing number to 57,050 but they work on daily-wage contracts that must be renewed every year. Even if guest teachers are factored in, Delhi government schools are short of 7,046 (10.99 per cent) teaching hands.

Saroj Sharma, a primary teacher at a Greater Kailash school said, On several occasions, I have had to teach higher-secondary class subjects. We are overworked and stressed. We are filling in for many others. School heads are aware of the crisis, but nothing has been done.

Neeru Loriya, a teacher coordinator at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in RK Puram Sector 4, also said that several subjects are not being taught properly. Barkha Kumari, a Class VI student at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Rohini said, My Class has 50 students. We need more teachers to ensure we're taught well. It's not that the government isn't working at all. After the Aam Aadmi Party came to power in Delhi in 2014, the government has built 48 schools.

But where are the teachers? We have sent several reminders to the government. Nothing has happened, said a teacher at a Pusa Road school. Most regular posts are filled through promotions. But they have not happened since 2013, he said.

Sanjay Goel, head of the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) told Mail Today, We're aware of the problem. Each year, guest teachers are being enrolled to minimise the shortage. Avdhesh Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, also said, There is a problem. But the government is hiring guest teachers to tackle it.

But facts tell a different tale. In July, the Delhi government had announced that schools would get 9,000 guest teachers by mid-August. It did not happen. Hiring guest teachers is anyway no solution to this huge crisis, said Ajay Veer Singh, general secretary of the last Government School Teachers' Association (GSTA) elected in 2014. GSTA elections have not taken place since 2014.

So its demands have not been heard effectively, its office-bearers claim. We have asked for elections. But education department officials have not paid any heed. The future of government school teachers is dark, said Singh. GSTA has a three-year term.

They say the universe conspires to make you what you are. Cynics may dismiss such fanciful thoughts, but once in a while there maybe inexplicable coincidences in someone's life that make you pause. Take well-known Bharatanatyam dancer-abhinaya specialist Bragha Bessell's case -- there was no plan to be a dancer, yet she had the fortune of being trained by four dedicated gurus, two of whom taught and groomed her during childhood, and the other two as gurus for advanced learning. Each of them seemed to have come into her life at the right time to mentor her and to take her art education forward.

Bragha, 64, looks back on her journey as she completes 51 years in dance since her arangetram on December 6, 1967. As any nine-year old, she and her friends were enamoured with the glamour of Bharatanatyam and decided they would learn it. Suddenly, one day she found that she had no playmates as they had all joined dance classes. Not to be left out, she joined Nrithyodaya and learnt all of three thattu adavus from 'Jayakka' before she met Guru Mangudi Dorairaja Iyer in her periappa's home. She was mesmerised by his tejas and his imposing persona, with long, white hair, long, white beard and a big pottu in the middle of his forehead. When he asked her, if she knew how to dance, the young aspirant gave it her all in the basic thattu adavus by sinking into an extreme 'mukkaal mandi' (three-fourth seated stance) for further emphasis.

That show of bravado must have impressed him, because a few days later, there was a knock on their door at 6.30 a.m. It was Guru Dorairaja Iyer saying, 'Today is a good day, I want to start class for the child. Please wake her up, dress her and bring her, I will wait.' For the next one and a half years, Guru Dorairaja Iyer taught Bragha and her little sister Brinda. ""Master was a grandfather-like figure for us. He never lost his temper, so classes were fun. We learnt without realising how big this art is. We celebrated our initiation as dancers with the 'Gaja' pooja, for which Guru Dorairaja Iyer chose every gaja (bell). At the end of the function, he threw a bombshell saying that 'I am 75, and unable to cycle from Kodambakkam to Adyar, almost 12 km, thrice a week. I wanted to bring these girls into the art. Please take it from here.' The ball he set rolling then is still rolling, more than 50 years later,"" says Bragha.

""Guru Chidambaram P.S. Kunchithapadam Pillai, disciple of Kaattumannarkoil Muthukumara Pillai, came into our lives soon after. He was in his forties and much stricter. For 17-and-a-half years, we had no free time, no holidays. From 4 p.m. to 9 p.m., seven days a week, we practised. Imposition was a regular feature. If we came late, imposition. We did not execute an adavu properly, imposition. Or even just like that, we performed an adavu 200 times. Actually, we got used to it, and did not think we were being punished.

""He taught us anga shuddam, how the eyes should follow the arm, the totality of presentation and focus. We understood emotions as he told us stories from the Puranas. Two years after commencing, when our guru told my father we were ready for our debut, my father couldn't believe. My grandfather Ekambaranathar Iyer's friend, the renowned musicologist Professor P. Sambamoorthy, was called in to certify our readiness. He declared that we satisfied the three requisites that he had in mind. What were they? I can only guess. May be talam, anga shuddam and bhavam.""

The guru's only request was that the sisters have their arangetram at the Chidambaram temple. But there was a hurdle; they had to prove their skills to the temple official Nataraja Dikshitar. The test was abhinaya for his padam, 'Kodidu kodidu kopam kollade' (Valachi, Adi). ""He was so impressed that he gave us the sacred space facing the Nataraja sannidhi,"" recalls Bragha.

They began to dance regularly in temples and sabhas, and at home, where their father built a big hall, for visitors from other countries. The young girls learnt to present themselves and the culture to interested foreigners. The guru choreographed many thematic shows such as on Lenin for the Russian Consulate, 'Panchali Sabatham', 'Aarupadai Veedu', 'Thiru Vilayadal' by Nataraja Dikshitar and pieces for Father Schluz of the Leprosy Centre, Madhavaram.

""When our master quit, we felt lost. Someone suggested we teach, but I realised with shock that I knew nothing. I could dance, but not teach. I realised I had been miming and I had no knowledge of the art form. Vadyar had become too old. At 26, I went to Guru Adyar K. Lakshman. I told Lakshman Sir that I wanted to be able to teach and that I needed to learn from the basics. I also told him that since I had an orchestra thatwas dependent on me, I be allowed to do small programmes on my own. He agreed most graciously. Lakshman Sir is one of the most generous gurus I have come across. His words continue to reverberate in my ears, 'Daraalama kathuko, daraalama panniko'.""

Guru Lakshman corrected Bragha's lines and presentation. Subtle corrections such as advising against a flexible elbow and using the wrist to change hastas, enhanced the visual appeal of adavus. He taught her about composers such as Tiger Varadachariar and about vaggeyakaras. He taught her to revere others' vision. ""He would get angry if you messed up someone's choreography. He was very supportive of his students' efforts. I had choreographed a Bharatiyar kavuthuvam on Buddha (Ariya Darisanam) and a Kalakshetra Pasupathi thillana (Simhendra Madhyamam, Adi) for a Natyarangam festival on religion. The next time I performed it, he announced proudly that it was choreographed by me, adding that I had done a good job. It's the greatness of such gurus that they can praise us so wholeheartedly. These values mean more than the dance pieces you learn,"" points out Bragha.

There was more thirst for learning in Bragha. During Sruti Foundation's Bani Festival in the 1980s, she watched Guru V.S. Muthusami Pillai's innovative adavus and was intrigued. Guru Lakshman encouraged her to learn as much as she can. And when Guru Muthusami wanted to teach not just one piece as Bragha had requested, but a full margam, Guru Lakshman had no reservations, 'Please learn whatever he teaches...'.

Bragha heard about Guru Kalanidhi Narayanan from fellow students. With Vadyar's permission, she approached the abhinaya doyenne. Unnerved by her stern façade, she mustered courage to ask for 'just one class.' Fortunately for her, it became three classes per week. This association turned out to be a turning point for Bragha. ""I was awed by the depth of understanding, of bhavam, of characterisations, of situations, of lyrics in Kalanidhi Mami's style. Just as a phrase from the Kamban Ramayana describes Rama's beauty as he entered Mithilapuri, 'Thol kandaar, thole kandaar...', I felt that way about Mami 'Kann kandaar kanne kandaar...' I became mad about the art form. I was constantly thinking about it. No video, no mirror, the practice has to happen within. The mind was the recording machine. That is the video I played and replayed, and prepared myself. To understand mami's depth, I needed 19-20 years of preparation. She stood for beauty, subtlety and dignity.

""You watch, you learn, you grow. The next stage when you show, she would take the cue and develop the abhinaya from your interpretation. It becomes a samvada, a dialogue, at that level. It took me eight years before I could present the javali 'Sarasamu ladetenduku' (Kapi, Adi, Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar). Life teaches you. Anubhavam enlivens art. With age you lose something, you lose your figure, the body is unable to do what it did in your twenties, but you can do so much with your anubhavam, which you could not then. That growth, inner journey, is what is important. You cannot fight nature,"" explains Bragha.

After marriage, She was out of India for about 12 years. She could not dance in Saudi Arabia, and thought her life as a dancer was over. Suddenly one day she got a mail from the then director, Kalakshetra, Leela Samson, inviting her to teach abhinaya for eight weeks. ""My husband and 12-year-old son pushed me to do it. I had been so out of touch, I was thrilled and scared at the same time. I had left my dance notes back in India under lock and key, because they were so precious. I remember the moment I opened that cupboard in Chennai, the past came rushing back. Kalanidhi Mami and my father were both so excited about this offer.""

Bragha has not looked back since. She has become an abhinaya specialist and is much in demand as a teacher and performer. In her words, 'I am at a stage when my students are my gurus. I learn through their questions, performances, mistakes, love and affection. Learning is a never-ending journey.

""My journey in the arts would be incomplete without mentioning two more generous teachers -- Guru Kamalarani, who taught me nattuvangam and looked out for me after my mother died, and scholar V.A.K.

For Komal*, a student of class II at a government school in south Delhi, her pink bag with Barbie doll painted on its front side is not less than a treasure.

Everyday Komal carries the bag on her shoulders, stuffed with at least eight to nine books and copies as she walks up to her school. 'Apart from regular set of books, I carry a diary as well for preparing notes', says Komal as we discuss her daily routine.

Class II Student Carrying a Bag Equivalent to Class IX

With Komal's bag weighing 4.6 kg, she is, unknowingly of course, carrying more than twice the weight that has been prescribed by the Delhi government recently.

In a circular dated 1 December 2018, the Delhi government fixed the weight of school bags for students of classes I to X. For students of classes I and II, the circular states that their bags should not weigh more than 1.5 kg. State governments, including Delhi, have come up with guidelines on the weight of school bags after they were told to do so by the HRD Ministry.

At 4.6 kg, Komal is carrying a bag equivalent to that of a class IX student!

For other classes the maximum weight of school bag, as approved by the state government is as follows:

Classes III to V: 2-3 KgClasses VI to VII: 4 KgClasses VIII to IX: 4.5 KgClass X: 5 Kg

In the same government school in south Delhi, students of class I were sitting on top of a cotton durrie spread across the floor. At 2.1 kg, Leena*, a student of class I, may not be facing any health problem but technically speaking, even she is carrying a bag daily, more than the prescribed weight limit.

Extra Diary Needed for Notes

Himanshi*, a student of class VI in a Rajkiya Kanya Ucch Madhyamik Vidyalaya (government school with classes upto XII) aspires to become a doctor. She doesn't like it when her bag is lighter as compared to other days when it weighs 5.2 kg. A heavy bag gives this sixth grader an assurance that she will do well in exams and fulfill her dream one day.

With five books and an equal number of copies, Himanshi's bag also doesn't comply with the weight limit, as has been suggested by the Delhi government.

""At times, the bag is heavy, but I don't complain as everyone at home will start worrying unnecessarily. After joining a learning center that's being run by an NGO, I prefer carrying an extra copy and diary.""Himanshi (Student, Class VI)

This teaching centre where Himanshi spends an hour daily after school helped in clearing her doubts on LCM (Least Common Multiple) problems in Maths and clarified her doubts regarding identification of a proper noun.

So, that extra diary and copy, meant for preparing notes at the training centre, are something Himanshi can't leave behind at home.

Students in the Dark About New Guidelines

Most of the students that The Quint spoke to were not aware about recent guidelines nor were they told about permissible limit regarding the weight of bags by their respective teachers. Due permission was taken from the principal in south Delhi as well as the mentor of the training centre being run by an NGO after which the interviews of students were recorded.

On being asked how the school will ensure the policy on weight of school bags is implemented in letter and spirit, the principal of an MCD school in south Delhi said:

""We are aware of the recent circular and would be discussing with our staff as to how we can implement the same.""Principal of a govt school in south Delhi

According to an activist associated with an NGO that provides teaching facilities at under-resourced schools, an initiative related to cupboards didn't work out.

'We encouraged students to keep books in a cupboard at TFI-certified classrooms but soon some students started complaining after their books went missing', says the activist who has worked with schools earlier in Ahmedabad and is now managing a training center in Delhi.

Is 'Support Material' to be Blamed for Extra Weight?

For Monalisa*, who would be sitting for board exams in less than three months, it is mandatory to carry books of all the subjects to school daily.

""I have six subjects to study, so, I carry all the notebooks and books along with tiffin and a geometry box. It's actually the Maths and Science books that are quite heavy.""Monalisa, Student (Class X)

On being asked whether her friends also carry books of all subjects to school, Monalisa said, 'it's even worse as other students also carry support material for the subjects of Maths, Science and Social Studies'.

Usually students at government schools prefer NCERT textbooks but some schools also distribute separate books of different subjects, commonly referred to as 'supporting material'.

The supporting material usually has chapters in condensed form with brief pointers and has objective as well as subjective questions in order to give students a sense of the exam paper.

""It's the teachers at our school who suggested that NCERT textbooks are not sufficient and therefore, we prefer 'support material'. When the session began, we were given only textbooks but since exams are drawing near, we have now been given support material as well for all the subjects except Hindi and Sanskrit.""Monalisa, Student (Class X)

Private Schools Fall Prey to Publishers' Demands

While government schools don't mind handing out extra books in the name of 'support material', private schools often fall prey to publishers who offer more lucrative deals.

An educationist who has been working with government schools in Delhi since last two years told The Quint:

""Private schools do follow the syllabus which has been prescribed. However, at times, these schools prescribe books that are not part of the curriculum as they get a commission, and this also results in heavier bags.""

Demand for Re-structuring the Syllabus

For Sharmila, whose children study in class VI, VIII and X respectively, packing bag as per the school time-table is among her foremost priorities.

Compared to the pressure that kids endure these days, measures such as limiting the weight of school bags seem half-hearted to parents like Sharmila.

""They should do something about the syllabus, nothing will happen with just reducing the weight of bags."" Sharmila, Parent

It seems that the policy-makers should have spent more time on the weighty issue of course and figuring out a way of embracing smart classroom instead of merely calibrating bags based on weight!

Some of the collaborations have also addressed issues like the United Nations' sustainability goals, migration and racism.

Imagine your child gets the opportunity to witness the wonders of the world, interact with children from different parts of the globe and learn about current world issues, all while sitting in a room. He or she is given a first-hand experience of the topography of places and their respective socio-cultural make-up beyond what is taught in textbooks, through virtual classes. Express Parenting got in touch with educator Shiva Kumar, a virtual master teacher, to know more about these virtual classes.

Virtual education

More and more children are enrolling in virtual educative tours, which connect them-even those from the remote corners of the country-to educators who make them travel virtual miles to foster learning. One such initiative, from Microsoft, holds virtual tours through Skype whereby children are taught on various topics ranging from history, computer science, mathematics to issues surrounding human rights, cyber security, and inclusiveness, to name a few.

Kumar, Asia's first Skype Master Teacher, who has been conducting the tours for the past four years, quit his corporate job to follow his passion for teaching. ""Education has been my passion from the beginning. After conducting seminars on emerging technologies and being a member of the academic board at prestigious colleges in the country, I soon realised that to bring a real change in the education system, I should begin at the school level. I realised the limitations of school education, given how students are loaded with a huge syllabus followed by examination,"" said Kumar. That's when the opportunity of becoming a Skype master teacher came up. After some reluctance initially, Kumar finally joined the initiative.

This year, the fourth edition of Skype-a-Thon was held in November, which saw participants from 102 countries travel a total of 23 million virtual miles in the span of two days. Nearly 11,000 students from over 300 schools across India took part, covering 4.26 million virtual miles, the most by any country globally.

An attempt towards empowering students and teachers, these tours enable cultural exchange between students across the world, who ask questions and identify one another through their respective traditions, music, dance, and art and craft, informed Kumar. Some of the collaborations have also addressed issues like the United Nations' sustainability goals, migration and racism. They are taught about the latest researches in the field of science, and taken on virtual tours to zoos and historical sites, apart from exploring a host of other areas.

Kumar currently teaches children, between the age of seven and 15, in Andhra Pradesh. ""We started off with only 10 kids. Today, we have around 60,"" Kumar said.

Virtual classes vs regular school

The sessions are usually held once a week. Children are not evaluated through conventional examination. It is majorly based on observation and then guiding and training them accordingly. As healthy as this experiment sounds, convincing parents in India, especially after they have long integrated themselves and their children into the country's conventional education system, has obviously been an arduous task. After all, for many of us, academic curriculum is the pathway to securing a job in future and not merely about the joy of learning.

""Parents were initially worried that it was a waste of time. But once the practical sessions started, they found it to be encouraging. That said, such form of learning is yet to become mainstream. A lot of parents are still unaware or apprehensive. Most of the kids who have enrolled in the virtual classes are those with relatively progressive parents,"" Kumar expressed. In fact, awareness sessions are also held for parents at regular intervals, he asserted.

How to apply

These virtual Skype sessions are mainly held in collaboration with schools although students can also apply individually. ""Anyone applying individually, needs his or her parents or educator to go to the Microsoft education portal, interact with an educator of their choice and filter out the subjects of interest,"" Kumar explained.

Interestingly, schools in rural areas showed better responsiveness compared to their urban counterparts, according to Kumar. ""Children coming from the rural areas are very hardworking and smart, except for their communication skills. But the confidence that these children build through these sessions helps bring down the barrier,"" said the proud teacher. Parents don't really have to worry about affordability. It is accessible as long as one has an internet connection, he stated.

Kumar has also initiated 'Skype2Village', a social drive to assist kids in Indian rural schools to experience learning beyond borders.

Is unschooling the way forward?

Technology may have improved the experience of learning but will it be sensible enough to completely digress from customary educational methods? Isn't the exposure of a regular school as important? Kumar clarified, ""Virtual teaching actually complements regular teaching. Children work on group projects, learn different perspectives, develop insight and are also trained to approach problems better. They get a worldwide exposure.""

According to Kumar, this form of unschooling is a more effective process. For the uninitiated, unschooling is a recent trend in which students lead the way in directing their learning. ""A lot of learning happens when kids are left to explore on their own. With unschooling, there's less rigidity and a better scope of interaction. Creatively, a child tends to lose a lot by going to school, given the kind of curriculum most of them have. One needs to realise that learning is not just about textbooks and marks. Parents shouldn't just be interested in the end product but be interested in the process too,"" he signed off."

Shocked by the incident, the school sent out a flurry of notices to parents warning of strict action if students below the age of 13 (Class VI onwards) are found having their own social media accounts. The notice includes an advisory on how to monitor social media activities of students.

A senior cyber crime officer probing the case said police have sought legal help to understand whether using an open device without the explicit consent of its minor owner can be construed legally as hacking and secondly if it's a cognizable offence if some of the accused are under-age.

However, this is not the first incident where students have used social media to make fun of teachers or post rude comments full of slangs. In fact, as TOI found out, it is quite common among students of city schools to create online communities and pages to disparage teachers and, in some cases, they have openly named their schools.

In a similar incident at another top boys' school, a group of students hacked into a social media account of a student to post offensive comments on certain issues and teachers forcing the school to call in the cyber crimes cops, who identified the culprits.

Schools begin to track students' cyber footprints

The school stopped short of expelling the boys but dealt with them severely. Now the school has set up a secret group of tech-savvy teachers who keep an eye on students' cyber activities.

Rude online activities are not restricted to boys alone. ""We had a girl mentioning an intimate incident involving the school on Facebook. She posted rude comments without mentioning the name of the school, but it was clear which school. We called the parents and took her to task. We are keeping strict vigil,"" said the principal of a leading central Kolkata girls' school.

Concerned by the rise in such online behaviour, city schools are taking steps to keep an eye on their students' cyber footprints.

""We have a vigilance group that is keeping an eye on the social media activity of senior boys. We are holding regular parent-teachers meetings to get the former oriented about the kind of trouble their wards might get into,"" said T H Ireland, principal, St James' School.

Agrees Aruna Gomes, principal of Loreto House. ""We keep ourselves pre-warned and our value education classes are full of advisories,"" she said.

Teachers feel it all starts with the idea of having fun but soon gets out of control. ""Accepting this, we are trying to tell our boys that such negative activity is not fun but a crime. Criticising teachers is an ageold thing but taking it to the level of social publishing is something one never dreamt of. We are organising workshops where we are getting cyber experts to talk to boys,"" said said Mukta Nain, principal, Birla High School for Boys.

Shane Calvert, secretary, La Martiniere schools, advised students to make judicious use of social media.

""Stop, think and connect is what I am asking students to do. They should stop to think every time they get the urge to play pranks on social media. Judicious use of the internet can take them places whereas irresponsible use can bring a lot of harm,"" he said."

In an advisory Tuesday, Surgeon General Jerome Adams said parents, teachers, health professionals and government officials must take ""aggressive steps"" to keep children from using e-cigarettes. Federal law bars the sale of e-cigarettes to those under 18.

For young people, ""nicotine is dangerous and it can have negative health effects,"" Adams said in an interview. ""It can impact learning, attention and memory, and it can prime the youth brain for addiction.""

Federal officials are scrambling to reverse a recent explosion in teen vaping that public health officials fear could undermine decades of declines in tobacco use.

An estimated 3.6 million US teens are now using e-cigarettes, representing 1 in 5 high school students and 1 in 20 middle schoolers, according to the latest federal figures.

Separate survey results released Monday showed twice as many high school students used e-cigarettes this year compared to last year.

E-cigarettes and other vaping devices have been sold in the U.S. since 2007, growing into a USD 6.6 billion business. Most devices heat a flavored nicotine solution into an inhalable vapour.

They have been pitched to adult smokers as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes, though there's been little research on the long-term health effects or on whether they help people quit. Even more worrisome, a growing body of research suggests that teens who vape are more likely to try regular cigarettes.

Adams singled out Silicon Valley startup Juul. The company leapfrogged over its larger competitors with online promotions portraying their small device as the latest high-tech gadget for hip, attractive young people. Analysts now estimate the company controls more than 75 per cent of the US e-cigarette market.

The surgeon general's advisory notes that each Juul cartridge, or pod, contains as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes. Additionally, Adams states that Juul's liquid nicotine mixture is specially formulated to give a smoother, more potent nicotine buzz. That effect poses special risks for young people, Adams says.

""We do know that these newer products, such as Juul, can promote dependence in just a few uses,"" Adams said.

Juul said in a statement that it shares the surgeon general's goal: ""We are committed to preventing youth access of Juul products.""

Adams recommends parents, teachers and health professionals learn about e-cigarettes, talk to children about the risks and set an example by not using tobacco products.

Evidence also suggests that vaping may be linked to an increased risk of heart attacks.

In a rare national advisory, the top US public health official warned Americans of the dangers of e-cigarettes like the Juul, a popular device that lets users inhale nicotine vapor without burning tobacco.

US Surgeon General Jerome Adams said in a new advisory on Tuesday that e-cigs like the Juul are a particular danger to kids and teens, and called for fresh measures to halt their rising popularity.""We need to protect our kids from all tobacco products, including all shapes and sizes of e-cigarettes"" Adams said in a statement. ""We must take action now to protect the health of our nation's young people.""

The advisory singles out Juul by name multiple times, saying that the sleek devices are particularly popular among teens because they're easy to conceal and don't emit much odor. It tells parents, health professionals, and teachers to be on the look out for all forms of nicotine-delivery devices, including e-cigs.

Adams's announcement comes on the heels of warnings from several other federal agencies about an explosion of e-cig use, including from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration.

In November, after new CDC data pointed to a 78% increase in e-cig use among high schoolers, FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb announced moves to further restrict sales of e-cigarettes to ensure they don't get into the hands of young people. That included a crackdown on flavored offerings, which researchers say appeal strongly to youth.

Several days before the FDA's announcement, Juul Labs, the Silicon Valley startup behind the most popular e-cig in the US, temporarily halted sales of its flavored varieties in stores until they agree to adopt the company's new age restrictions and a stronger system for making sure customers are at least 21 years old.

Although smoking conventional cigarettes is uniquely deadly, and vaping appears to be somewhat healthier (especially for adults looking to switch), public health experts are concerned about how e-cigarettes impact young people.

Because of their runaway popularity, e-cigs could create a new generation of Americans hooked on nicotine, one of the world's most addictive substances and the key ingredient in e-cigs like the Juul, these experts warn. Their concern comes in part from a host of studies which suggest that teens who vape are significantly more likely to go on to smoke regular cigarettes, compared to teens who never vape.

Read more: $15 billion startup Juul used 'relaxation, freedom, and sex appeal' to market its creme-brulee-flavored e-cigs on Twitter and Instagram - but its success has come at a big cost

This finding could be related to the way nicotine impacts the developing brains of young people. Although the research on e-cigs is still limited because the devices are so new, researchers have a wealth of data on the negative impacts of nicotine on teens who start smoking early.

In brain-imaging studies of adolescents who start smoking in their teens, researchers have found signs of reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex - the part of the brain tied to planning and decision-making. The same teens perform worse on memory and attention tasks compared with teens who don't smoke.

Nicholas Chadi, a clinical pediatrics fellow at Boston Children's Hospital, spoke about the Juul at the American Society of Addiction Medicine's annual conference this spring. He described some anecdotal effects of nicotine vaping that he'd seen among teens in and around his hospital.

""After only a few months of using nicotine,"" Chadi said, the teens ""describe cravings, sometimes intense ones."" He continued: ""After only a few hundred cigarettes - or whatever the equivalent amount of vaping pods - some start showing irritability or shakiness when they stop.""

This spring, scientists took a look at the compounds in several popular brands of e-cigs aside from the Juul and found some of the same toxic metals found in conventional cigarettes, such as lead.

A study published this month showed that people who vape tend to have high concentrations of some of these toxic chemicals in their bodies.

In another study published this summer, scientists concluded that there was substantial evidence tying daily e-cig use to an increased risk of heart attack. And this fall, a small study in rats suggested that vaping could have a negative effect on wound healing that's similar to the effect of regular cigarettes.

But teens may not be aware of these health risks. Researchers say that could be because so little research has focused specifically on the Juul - the e-cig which currently captures 80% of the market share.

Based on their sample of 445 high-school students, the researchers observed that teens who used the Juul tended to say they vaped more frequently compared with those who used other devices. Juul users also appeared to be less aware of how addictive the devices could be compared with teens who vaped other e-cigs.

""I was surprised and concerned that so many youths were using Juul more frequently than other products,"" Bonnie Halpern-Felsher, a professor of pediatrics who was a lead author of the study, said in a statement.

""We need to help them understand the risks of addiction,"" she added. ""This is not a combustible cigarette, but it still contains an enormous amount of nicotine - at least as much as a pack of cigarettes."""

As parents, we have to mind our body language because though we can blame the outer world for our situation, we cannot neglect our responsibility to the child.

By Vaibhav Datar

Ever wondered how people communicated with each other in ancient times, when there was no verbal language? Communication was mostly through gestures and body language. But as verbal language evolved, we got more dependent upon the words we speak and with time, lost the ability to listen to our inner voice.

Having said that, humans have still not lost the ability to decipher unspoken messages completely. We still have a wonderful tool called intuition. In fact, there was a study done to understand whether body language is a learnt skill or inborn. The study compared blind athletes (born blind) with regular athletes. Every time a winner completed his run, his hands went out and head went up, irrespective of whether he was blind or not. This shows that we already have the skills of communicating effectively through our body language. We may have just forgotten the basics to understand and decipher the code.

Children are like sponge, absorbing completely from their environment as much as they can. They are fast learners. They can easily distinguish if their mother is angry or if she is being loving. As parents we have this immense responsibility of teaching children the importance of body language, which is probably the only communication skill that is not taught in schools. We have, unfortunately, no training provided for body language, listening, emotional intelligence, etc.

Advertising

So, a parent has to be the first teacher when it comes to body language, paying attention to how a child sits, stands and communicates with the social environment. Let us look at the key points where parents have the opportunity to teach these skills effectively.

Interaction with your partner

Suppose you are about to get into an argument with your spouse and your child is watching you, how do you react? Do you respond in a manner which speaks highly about you? How is your body responding to your thoughts? Is it in synchronicity with your verbal outburst?

A child is watching you closely and knows how you feel about it. It is best time to teach your child effective body language, by showcasing the right emotions.

Dinner table interactions

What gets discussed at the dinner table? Are we talking about problems or challenges? Or are we speaking about opportunities and solutions? Every interaction that you have with the child or in his presence is registered. How do you react or respond to tricky situations? Because, for a child, his parents are the best teachers. If you take things casually, there is a high probability that your child follow suit. If you focus on negativity, there is a high chance that your kid will do so as well. As parents, it is our responsibility to learn effective body language.

Interactions with others

You meet several people, whether it is in the lift, during social meetings, family get-togethers, birthday parties, etc. Difficult situations arise triggering unwanted reactions, sometimes unconscious retaliations. As parents, we have to mind our body language because though we can blame the outer world for our situation, we cannot neglect our responsibility to the child. For him, you are his world and the way he will face the world depends on how you teach him to do so.

Body language (or nonverbal communication) is a very important tool and the earlier one learns, the better it is for everyone.

Surender Kumar's father knew how difficult it would be for the next generation to eke out a living from a small piece of ancestral agricultural land. So, his priority was to get both his sons educated, and help them land a government job.

Despite his family pushing him to study, Surender realised books were not his cup of tea. His school teachers agreed, advising that he should perhaps take up sports. Surender knew he would do well in any field that required endurance. But his family vehemently opposed that, even refusing to purchase a hockey stick for R450 in 2006. But that didn't deter the defender, who has become a pillar of the India hockey squad.

At the Bhubaneswar World Cup, Surender was a silver lining in India's campaign, which ended with a 1-2 defeat against Netherlands in the quarter-finals. In the big game, Surender showed maturity and nerves of steel to keep the Dutch at bay. Though it didn't prevent a defeat, he was adjudged the 'Player of the Match'.

""When I heard my name for Man of the Match, I didn't feel any emotion. I was blank. My team was out of the tournament, so it meant nothing. Hockey is a team game and when it comes to team performance, individual honour has no standing,"" says Surender, 24, with 107 India caps. ""Once we were out, I didn't want to return to the stadium to watch any other match. It was all over for me.""

Surender, who played in the 2013 Junior World Cup, is an India regular over the last two years. Except the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games in April, he has played in all other major events.

""Missing the CWG was a big jolt for me. Be it the junior or senior teams, I was never dropped since my international debut. But my family (humble background) has made me mentally strong. So, I took it as a challenge and worked hard on weak areas. After that, I was again in the squad,"" he said.

He took up hockey by accident. ""I used to play cricket with my friends and they joined hockey at the Kurukshetra stadium. When they told me it's an interesting game, I also started going with them to the hockey field. My main concern was getting my own hockey stick because whenever a senior took a break, I used to play with his stick. But my parents were not willing to buy me even a basic stick thinking it was waste of money and a distraction from studies. Eventually, after I revolted, my uncle got me my first stick for R450. Unfortunately, it broke in three-four days and it was back to square one. Thankfully, my seniors supported me.""

While the teachers welcome the innovation wholeheartedly as it does magic in schools, experts opine that video lessons could be used only in addition to classroom learning.

Initially, the department had embedded QR code in the textbooks for classes I, VI, IX and XI - syllabus was revamped in this academic year - and each lesson had at least three QR codes which upon scanning would take you to video lessons of that lesson, explained an official from the department who is involved in the process.

The department also has a YouTube channel with 1.18 lakh subscribers and is planning to launch a 24-hour free satellite education channel, said the official.

""The basic idea is to evoke interest among the students and to make them attend classes regularly. Also, concepts which are considered as difficult by the students, were made into videos to unwrap its complexity,"" the official added.

The video lessons in turn has done magic in the schools as most of the students who were difficult to find in classrooms, were not just found on regular basis, but also noticed paying keen attention to the lessons, said a government schoolteacher on condition of anonymity.

A teacher, who teachers Mathematics, said most of the problems which, in general, students would struggle to understand were solved, within matter of time as the videos explain it with pictorial representations and sound effects.

""Teaching the students to pronounce difficult words has become a fun task now for both students and teachers. But, the only issue that we face is that videos were created only for a few concepts and not for entire lessons,"" T Arulanantham of Tamil Nadu high and higher secondary teachers' association said.

With videos, students can listen to it numerous times until they clearly understand it, while a teacher would not be able to spare much time to explain same doubts during the class hours as they would have to move on to next chapter, he added.

""The video lessons would definitely be useful in understanding difficult concepts, but it should not replace the textbooks completely. How will a student be able to reproduce the concepts in textual manner while giving exams, upon listening only to videos. How will they be able to learn the spelling of words without reading and writing habits,"" district president of Tamil Nadu Post Graduate Teachers Association GR Chentooran questioned.

Meanwhile, PB Prince Gajendra Babu, an educationist, said the video lessons should only be used in addition to reading and it should never be used as a tool to replace teacher as nothing would match the live interaction between teacher and students.

The government should take steps to appoint a teacher per subject per class in all the government schools and ensure that every student was given equitable access to all its initiatives, he added."

The success of any task or activity depends upon the quality of preplanning and whether accomplish or not the objective must be attempted to solidify. To start with a strong monitoring mechanism is imminent in the School level and a rational commitment is needed from all the stakeholders. In my 20 years of continuous selfless attachment in Service Association work like ANSTA & NSEAOA what I personally observed is a logical working system is in the offing particularly management policies at all level and emphatically requires more inputs on academic interest. And to achieve its goal a tangible policy is impending to formulate through the blessing of political will to improvise its traditional tag. In this regard I would like to lay down the following humble suggestions as a measures for improvement of academic acceleration towards qualitative education in the department.

1. Teachers Registry may be installed digitally so as to maintain the actual position of the required Teachers in the GPS, GMS, GHS across the State to balance the staffing pattern and also to check the excess and shortage Teachers in the School. While it can also help in reckoning the actual vacancies caused to be filled up without any discrepancies.

2. Teachers Code with a Working Gown or Working Identity Card may be introduced to Teachers for public recognition in honoring as Professionals. And by doing so it will incline to prevent from manipulative practices of keeping proxy Teacher in the School.

3. Teachers recruitment policy may be taken up on regular basis or conduct at least twice in a year to avoid all sorts of frequent agitation/strikes for want of backlog service regularization which is endless that hampers the daily classroom routine time and again.

4. Primary Education is the backbone of a child's foundation and this basic education must be prioritized by evolving an academic viable policy more of creativity and play way methods of child centered approach to bring about quality education. And it requires a major amalgamation in this sector to carry forward an effective and sustainable teaching learning process which can enable the child to pursue higher education at all level because that is the gate way of building the child's educational future career.

5. An Academic Cell for Primary and Elementary Education may be separately function in the Directorate and promote supervision and monitoring the academic performance of the GPS and GMS in particular. As it is the fundamental basis which can excel in Secondary and Higher Secondary Education ie, HSLC/HSSLC results and therefore more weightage can be given at this stage of primary and elementary targeting to minimize or eliminate the nil result Schools in public exams instead of blaming one another.

6. Regular School inspection with a feed back by the Inspecting Officer may be taken up as a tool for immediate measures towards academic improvement besides cleaning up all

Kinds of unwanted prevalent practices like sharing salaries, Teachers absenteeism, false enrolment of the School etc. While that may lead to minimize the worries and burden of Unions/ NGOs to do the checking indeed this responsibility is being vested to the department officers to carry out periodically.

7. Regular DPC may be held for timely promotion to fill up all the resultant vacancies of Asst. Headmaster, Headmaster at the School level and JEO, SDEO, DEO, the field officers in the Sub. Divisional / District level to upkeep the continuity of coordinating in managing their establishment courteously because these are correlated functionaries as far as administrative aspects are concerned.

8. Teachers Award may be streamlined by giving responsibility to the Heads of the School to identify only deserving genuine Teachers and not by the individual Teachers concerned to initiate by himself/ herself to be awarded. The number of State Teachers Award may be fixed and distributed to all the District on quota wise to do justice to all teaching community in the State. Besides due facilities be accorded and their services can be fully utilized as an outstanding meritorious Teachers in the department.

9. As far as possible Teachers training can be of an oriented motivational teaching learning skill and preferably during vacation so as not to disturb the regular classes.

10. The different formats related to State School Employees bio data/ particulars may be limited to only one and formulate as Unified School Education Format (USEF) inclusive of all expected requirements to fill in such as Staff position, Students enrolment and other physical related matters like building, classrooms, offices, furniture's, fencing, toilets, safe drinking water etc enabling for accessibility use by DoSE, NBSE, SCERT through data base to do away filling of numerous School formats.

11. Instead of opening new Schools the existing Schools may be standardized both in the academic performance and infrastructural facilities to really experience the quality education in the state with the available resources.

12. The Government may plan for observance of Year of Academic Excellence for School Education Department."

Difficult roads, they say, often lead to beautiful destinations. There may be multiple challenges, but one thing binds India's change-makers together - they view problems as means for innovation. From tackling unemployment to becoming financially independent and providing livelihoods to others at a time of personal tragedy, YourStory brings you stories of social impact through the Monday Motivation series.

As we draw closer towards the end of 2018, here are some of our top picks from the year.

Recognising the vulnerabilities of migrants who move from rural areas to urban India, Vinod Pandey started a ""tea stall"" with a difference - Rozgar Dhaba, at Shehore district's Nashrullaganj block in Madhya Pradesh. The dhaba not only sells tea and refreshments, but acts as a centre for the exchange of information on livelihood and employment opportunities.

""I am from Bihar and have seen how people from Bihar migrate to different cities in search of jobs, especially for daily wage labour. An elder cousin migrated to Punjab and died because he did not get proper work in the city; he lived in slums, without proper healthcare. The city failed him,"" Vinod says.

Started in January 2018, Rozgar Dhaba caters to over a 1,000 people a month and has hosted over 20 job fairs, and five farm produce sale displays till date. It has over 70 registered entities such as government agencies, skill centres, NGOs, district agriculture centres, grameen centres, and small local businesses that provide regular job information. The dhaba itself provides employment to almost 10 people and has revenue of Rs 8,000 to Rs 12,000.

At a time when rote learning and academic-based examination continue to dominate the Indian school system, a 21-year-old student from IIT-Madras is on a mission to change the way knowledge is imparted. Using the peer teaching model, which has Harvard University's stamp of approval, Divanshu Kumar hopes to improve the learning ability of students through his startup, Involve.

""Most of the world believes that we can improve the quality of learning and have better results by putting more qualified teachers in the classrooms. And while this is true, it fails to address one very important need: capability building of students,"" he says.

Involve's peer teaching method involves a nine-month fellowship where students from higher grades, like from Class 8, can teach and mentor juniors. By getting students who can teach and learners together in a classroom, Involve aims to create a school ecosystem that defines a student's potential not merely in terms of examinations, but through overall academic and personal excellence.

Till date, the team has worked with over 400 students across four schools in Chennai and Bengaluru. These include more than 100 student leaders.

To introduce food processing techniques and create links in the agri-business model, Balaji Balaraman, 35, started Agribolo. The startup aims to create a market linkage opportunity that can become a farm-to-fork, farm-to-mill, and farm-to-warehouse model for farmers and the ecosystem at large.

""The primary necessities include creating multiple pre-processing or primary centres at the farm or village level. That will provide a basic value addition to farmers and an opportunity to develop a cluster-based model,"" Balaji says.

The farmer engagement platform allows an individual to get an umbrella of services under one roof at his location and according to the season, relevance, demand, supply, and in a timely and efficient manner. Agribolo engages and connects farmers with experts, NGOs, and development institutes for training, capacity building, and outreach programmes.

The startup offers a platform to aggregate services in the form of farm mechanisation, plant nursery, protected cultivation, seed production, input demonstration, collateral management, financial inclusion, and local processing that could be co-owned and operated by the community at large.

The farmer is also provided an opportunity to partner with a business solution - available on the platform - that empowers him towards rural employment and social empowerment.

Josephine Arokiya Mary, a National Award winner for apiculture, started her journey with 10 bee boxes. She now has 7,000 bee boxes, and has helped create more than 1,800 entrepreneurs in her district.

In 2010, a year after her daughter's death, Mary took a loan of Rs 10 lakh from Canara Bank to start Vibis Natural Bee Farming with 1,000 bee boxes. Targeting diabetic patients, she accumulated and harvested jamun honey, which gave her good revenues; soon, Mary started harvesting honey from more than 10 varieties of bees. Apart from selling honey, she diversified her business by selling bee wax candles and the pollen bees carry on their legs.

Mary is now known as Queen Bee in her village and sells honey to 23 districts in Tamil Nadu. She offers 25 varieties of honey with flavours like jamun, neem, and amla among others, through her enterprise. She now earns more than Rs 1 lakh per month, and her venture has an annual turnover of Rs 3 crore.

Besides providing employment to over 50 people and helping over 400 women set up honey bee farms, she is training more than 50,000 people in bee harvesting under the National Honey Mission and creating awareness to save bees from going extinct.

Prem Singh's lush green farmland paints a vivid picture of sustainable farming: organic produce and homegrown compost, fruit-bearing trees, livestock shelter with water bodies, well-nourished soil, natural fertilisers, and, most importantly, a continuous source of income.

""I too was captured in the cycle of debt and crop failure; we couldn't control climatic conditions and bank loans kept increasing. And then I started thinking about our ancestors, our traditional farming methods, and knew that this was the key to success. Today, I am debt-free. I am a pragatisheel kisaan,"" he says proudly.

Advocating Avartansheel Kheti, or periodic proportionate farming, Prem Singh believes that farming has to be a self-sustaining occupation for the farmer. The practice encourages a farmer to divide his land into three parts: one-third to be used as a garden to grow fruits and crops, the second part for rearing livestock, and the third to grow timber. His approach advocates crop rotation, organic farming, animal husbandry, food processing, improving soil fertility, and seed development.

This farming method is currently followed by 28 percent farmers in his district and also has followers from the agrarian community of Belgium and France."

Soon, passengers onboard trains or students in faraway locations can take a tour of the National Rail Museum or see the Kalka-Shimla rail route without moving from their seats. Taking forward its digital initiative to preserve and promote its heritage, Railways has tied up with Google's education initiative to create and deliver virtual educational expeditions using 3-D imaging and virtual tours of its prominent heritage places.

As a part of this project, Railways is considering providing virtual reality glasses to passengers on rent so that they can have a glimpse of the sites without actually being there physically. It is also planning to collaborate with schools and NGOs to take the glasses to classrooms.

""We want to take this forward and offer an opportunity for students across the country, wherever they are, to experience railway heritage. They might not be able to come there physically, but they will experience it as if they were. We want to join hands with educational institutions, NGOs for this purpose.

""The railway minister has asked us to provide such glasses to the onboard staff so that they can be used by passengers,"" Subrata Nath, Executive Director (Heritage) told PTI. The cost of these glasses - Google's version is called Google cardboard - vary, with the cheapest coming for less than Rs 200. All one has to do is use the Google Expedition app or open the Google arts and culture website and search for the railway heritage sites one wishes to visit. In the first phase, virtual expeditions are being created for Kalka Shimla Railway (KSR) and CSMT, Mumbai -- both UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

Nath said that the project is exciting especially because it can be used as a teaching tool for students who may be unable to afford trips to the sites themselves. ""Through this innovative project, children and students will be introduced to a new way of learning using virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), thus creating classrooms with no boundaries. ""With VR and AR, teachers will no longer be limited by the space of the classroom and this project will allow teacher, say in Kerala or Tamil Nadu to guide students through scenic panorama of Kangra Valley Railway, located thousands of miles away in Himachal Pradesh or Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, Mumbai, without travelling even out of their city or town,"" said Nath."
