In the latest case, District Child Protection Officer Kanhu Charan Rout has lodged a complaint against Maa Ambika SC/ST Residential School, Sidhal for running a school by producing forged documents, harassing and humiliating students.

The school was opened in 1992 and the management of the residential school had obtained NOC by submitting a fake land document and other infrastructure. After obtaining NOC from the District Education Officer, Jagatsinghpur, the Board of Secondary Education gave permission to conduct examinations. Meanwhile, the villagers brought allegations of lack of facilities and harassment of students by engaging them in the agriculture field or domestic work.

They alleged that school authorities have pressed the children, including girls, in domestic work and cultivation of paddy crops in the land. The students were also tortured when they refused to do these activities. The parents also alleged that though the strength of the residential school is about 170 from Classes I to X, the stipend of Rs 1,200 was being availed against 300 students.

Acting on the complaint, Collector Yamini Sarangi sought details on the school's infrastructure like toilets, kitchen, drinking water facilities, boundary wall, safety measures and other documents in August.

The school was also asked to comply with the shortcomings within 15 days but the management failed to do so following which the administration obtained permission from the Government and closed the school.

Despite the closure of the school, the management was running it illegally. Inspector-in-charge of Jagatsinghpur police station Rajani Kant Mishra said after receiving allegations, police registered a case against the president, secretary and headmaster of the school as their names are mentioned in the FIR under Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act and an investigation is on."

According to the report, MMRDA gave the 30,000 square foot ground on lease to Vidya Shikshak Prasarak Mandal Trust that runs Akshara High School. The school is located right in front of the ground.

Interestingly, the trust is run by former Maharashtra agriculture minister Ranjeet Deshmukh, and his son Ashish, who is a BJP MLA from Katol.

However, according to the Bombay High Court, general public can access Mumbai's open spaces between 5.30 am and 7.30 am, and then in the evening between 5 pm and 7 pm. Denying people entry during these times can attract prosecution, as per the law.

In 2017, DNA had reported that while on paper, the BMC will release 216 open spaces to NGOs and citizen groups, in reality most of these spaces are controlled by netas.

If we calculated the cost of these open spaces that measure up to 250 acres, it runs into thousands of crores of rupees as they exist at prime locations across the city.

According to Garden department of BMC, there are around 1,068 open spaces available with the civic body which are spread over 1,200 acres and these are spread across the city, western and the eastern suburbs. The civic administration claims that out of 1,068 open spaces, only 216 open spaces will be given to citizen groups, NGOs and private organisations to maintain. And, the civic administration will ensure that the garden should not be used for other purposes. However, activists and a few corporators believe that the civic administration will give away all these plots gradually."

The city-based boarding school where a 16-year-old student was allegedly gang-raped is all set to lose its no-objection certificate from the state education department as well as its affiliation from the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).

Bhupinder Kaur Aulakh, secretary school education, said: ""I have written a strongly worded letter to the CBSE emphasising that the school's affiliation be cancelled immediately. The NOC from the education department will also be withdrawn. This matter cannot be taken lightly,"" she said.

Withdrawal of NOC by the education department is necessary for the cancellation of affiliation with the respective board. Aulakh said they will make arrangements to admit the rest of the students in other nearby schools.

The incident was exposed on September 16 and district education officers conducted a raid in the school on September 18, after which the chief education officer (CEO) Dehradun district recommended the cancellation of affiliation and NOC on the basis of poor security steps in the school.

There are 357 students in the school that is registered as a day and boarding facility where 33 senior boys, 8 senior girls and 12 junior girls were staying in hostels.

The report said the school did not have CCTVs at the main gate, school or hostels.

The regional CBSE office had earlier served five notices to the school to improve the security arrangements but the school did not pay heed. The office served a show-cause notice to the school on Monday, demanding explanation on why it had not made proper security arrangements, after a case was registered regarding the gang rape of a student.

Acknowledging the need for regular monitoring of private schools, Aulakh said, ""It is very important to regularly monitor private schools so that such incidents do not take place. The Supreme Court has made guidelines for the safety of children in schools. Next week, we will begin work on a mechanism to ensure these schools are regularly monitored by officials. All private schools must follow the SC guidelines.""

Pointing out that ICSE schools also will be monitored, Aulakh said: ""All the schools in the state comes under the jurisdiction of the state education department, irrespective of which board they are affiliated to. We will ensure that even ICSE schools are regularly monitored so that the safety of students is not at risk."""

writes to state govt, recommending withdrawal of this key document, after scores of parents complain that the makes impossible demands during admissions, such as submission of birth certs in English, ration cards only on specific names, and more

After years of complaints by parents of students applying for admission to The Bishop's School in Camp, claiming that the latter insists on the submission of birth certificates only in the English language, the possibility of repercussions is in the offing. Now, the education officer has finally suggested the withdrawal of the school's no-objection certificate () to the state government, in a letter issued by the Zilla Parishad education office.

Over the years, complaints have come from parents about various rules imposed by the school during admissions, despite regular warnings from the education officer. For instance, while birth certificates are usually accepted in the local language of the state, parents claimed they were inconvenienced by the school's insistence on this document being in English.

One such parent, who was vying for his son's admission here, shared on condition of anonymity, ""I was forced to knock on the doors of a different school at the last moment as Bishop's did not accept my child's birth certificate in Marathi. We tried to get it in English, but this was not possible. We complained about this to the education officer, so that the school does not continue with such rules in future.""

Many such plaints from parents poured in before a committee was set up during this academic year to make inquiries. The latest letter sent by the education officer confirms that the school denied giving any clarifications about its demand, citing only that it can do so because it is a minority school. The missive further states that the school has submitted no documentary evidence of its minority status. Considering all this, ZP (primary) education officer Sunil Kurhade suggested revoking the school's NOC.

""I have issued a letter to the deputy secretary of the state education department in this regard. There have been many complaints from parents during the admission period over the last two years,"" Kurhade confirmed to Mirror, adding that the basic inquiry report cleared that the school has submitted no clarifications or documents demanded by the authorities.

Many had also complained that the school pressured them to submit ration cards bearing the names of either the parents or students; cards on the names of grandparents or other kin are rejected. The official inquiry report also mentions that the school principal has been accused of never attending any meetings with parents, and always sending non-teaching staffers for the same.

All this, said officials, amounts to not following rules laid out in the NOC and permission letter given to the school -- and therefore, these may as well be revoked.

The letter was sent out by the education office in the face of mounting pressure, soon after the (MNS) students' union also demanded action on the school.

WhenMirror quizzed school authorities about this uproar, Bishop's spokesperson Markas Deshmukh said, ""We ask for translations of birth certificates submitted in the regional language because we want the correct spelling of the student while entering it into the register. What has happened now is a politically motivated complaint. We have not received any letter from the education office till date."""

The decision will have serious implications on the future of about 2,500 students studying in the school. The order issued by the director, secondary education, Bikaner, said the department received many complaints by parents of students regarding unreasonable hike in fees by the school management. The department then ordered an inquiry by the district education officer, secondary, and pointed out the flagrant violations of the rules of Fee Regulation Act, 2016 by the school.

As per the Act the school had to constitute a school level fee committee to decide on the hike in fees, but the school had not followed this rule while hiking the fees.

The order pointed out that based on the NOC issued by the state government the Central Board of Secondary Education grants affiliation to the school. The school is duty bound to follow the rules and regulations of the state government.

The school was found guilty of not following the rules under the Rajasthan Schools (Fees Regulation) Act 2016 by not constituting the fee committee and also the directions issued by the officials under Rajasthan Non-Governmental Educational Institution Act 1989 and 1993 under section 7(3).
