On Sunday, Mohammad Latief Khan, Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS), Eastern Circle, got firsthand experience of how Metro passengers must have felt after dense smoke entered their coaches near the Maidan station on Thursday evening. The CRS, who is probing the incident of a fire and dense smoke from under a coach, visited the spot on Sunday and waited inside the air-conditioned rake as Metro Railway personnel generated smoke and re-enacted their rescue efforts. This exercise will help the CRS decide whether some passengers were justified in smashing windowpanes and jumping out. Some of them received injuries in the process.

2. In Death Too, No Fanfare

Mrinal Sen, the politically radical filmmaker whose knack for experimentation and unconventional treatment made him a pioneer of ""new wave"" cinema in India, died at his Bhowanipore home on Sunday morning. He was 95.

The director of Bhuvan Shome, Ek Din Achanak, Calcutta 71 and Khandhar, whose film-making career spanned from 1955 to 2002, had been unwell following a bout of fever, his family said.

Sen's death marks the passing of a golden generation of Bengali filmmakers that also included Satyajit Ray and Ritwik Ghatak -- the trio were born within four-and-a-half years of one another.

3. Kolkata Ready To Ring In New Year, Safely

In a zero-tolerance campaign against drunk drivers and rogue bikers, special police teams will hit the streets as early as 4pm on Monday since the police feel that early deployment of cops had helped curb the menace during Christmas. In the two-day period, including Christmas day, 75 people were arrested for driving drunk. In 2017, the number was over 100 in the same period.

At least nine crossings -- including Park Street-Russell Street crossing, Park street-Chowringhee Road crossing and Mayo Road crossing -- have been identified where traffic officials will put up points to check drivers with breathalyzers. A detective department team in plain clothes -- specially tasked with prevention of drink-driving -- has already been deployed since Christmas.

5. Wetland 'Filled' On Airport Premises

The Airport Authority of India (AAI) on Friday lodged a complaint with the airport police alleging that a promoter had filled up a wetland on the airport premises and was attempting to illegally build flats. The complaint prompted the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation to demolish the illegal structures. However, the promoter is absconding.

The FIR stated that on 28 December, an inspection of the airport areas by AAI revealed that some miscreants had filled up a waterbody in Khamruipara on Kaikhali-Nayaranpur Road. The AAI attached 12 photographs of the disputed zone. The FIR also stated that the water body was being filled up by a builder/promoter, adjacent to the airport, to construct flats.

Wrestling him onto his stomach, one of them, a tattoo on his forearm, got on top. As Alex struggled to move, he said he could feel the teen's penis grinding against his butt.

""Take off his shorts!"" he heard the other teen, who'd bragged he'd been a gang member in Honduras, shout. ""Let's get him naked!""

Just 10 days earlier, Alex, 13, had been caught by the Border Patrol after traveling from Honduras with his 17-year-old sister and five-year-old stepbrother, to flee the country's gang violence. Now, they were being held at Boystown outside Miami, one of more than 100 youth shelters in the government's sprawling system meant to provide a temporary haven for migrant children caught crossing the border.

The two teens had been taunting Alex since he'd arrived at the shelter, making crude sexual jokes about his pregnant sister. Now, in the bedroom, Alex said, they yanked down the front of his shorts.

""At least your sister has already tasted a man,"" he heard one of them sneer. ""But you haven't even tried a woman.""

Alex said he fought as hard as he could, somehow managing to pull up his shorts and kick until he broke free. As he lay on the floor catching his breath, he said, the boys fled, warning him to keep his mouth shut.

Over the past six months, ProPublica has gathered hundreds of police reports detailing allegations of sexual assaults in immigrant children's shelters, which have received $4.5 billion for housing and other services since the surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America in 2014. The reports, obtained through public records requests, revealed a largely hidden side of the shelters - one in which both staff and other residents sometimes acted as predators.

Several of the incidents have led to arrests of shelter employees or teenage residents. And in one particularly heinous case, a youth care worker was convicted in September of molesting seven boys over nearly a year at an Arizona shelter. The employee had worked for months without a full background check.

Coverage of such incidents by ProPublica and other media triggered demands for investigations.

Arizona's governor ordered a statewide inspection of the shelters, leading to the shutdown of two centers run by Southwest Key after the nonprofit failed to provide proof that its employees had completed background checks.

And late last month, federal investigators warned that the Trump administration had waived FBI fingerprint background checks of staffers and had allowed ""dangerously"" few mental health counselors at a tent camp housing 2,800 migrant children in Tornillo, Texas.

But ProPublica's review of the hundreds of police reports showed something else about the assaults. Something that went beyond background checks. Kids at shelters across the country were, indeed, reporting sexual attacks in the shelters, often by other kids. But again and again, the reports show, the police were quickly - and with little investigation - closing the cases, often within days, or even hours.

And there are likely even more such cases. ProPublica's cache of records is missing many police reports from shelters in Texas, where the largest number of immigrant children are held, because state laws there ban child abuse reports from being made public, particularly when the assaults are committed by other minors.

Now, as the immigration system struggles to house and care for 14,600 children - more than ever before - an examination of how federal and state authorities investigated the assault against Alex, one of those children, reveals startling lapses.

For a few days, Alex said, he didn't report his assault, heeding his attackers' warning, worried that speaking up would delay his release from Boystown. But as they continued to harass him, he decided to tell his counselor.

The counselor told him that a surveillance tape had captured the teenagers dragging him by his hands and feet into a room, and that there might have been a witness.

But Alex's report did not trigger a child sexual assault investigation, including a specialized interview designed to help children talk about what happened, as child abuse experts recommend.

Instead, the shelter waited nearly a month to call the police. When it finally did, a police report shows, the shelter's lead mental health counselor told the officers ""the incident was settled, and no sexual crime occurred between the boys like first was thought among the staff.""

And instead of investigating the incident themselves, officers with the Miami-Dade Police Department took the counselor's word for it and quickly closed the case, never interviewing Alex.

A spokeswoman for the Archdiocese of Miami, which received $6 million last year to care for about 80 children at Boystown, said it handled Alex's case correctly, blaming him for any delays. In response to questions, a Miami-Dade police spokesman said the department was reopening the case.

An examination of Alex's case shows that almost every agency charged with helping Alex - with finding out the full extent of what happened in that room - had instead failed him.

The police closed Alex's case 72 minutes after responding to the call.

Alex's mother, Yojana, had just gotten off work on July 27, bone-tired after another hot day installing swimming pools in southwest Missouri, when the call came from Boystown. She'd been expecting her regular chat with her children, so when her cellphone showed a Florida number, she answered excitedly.

Yojana had left them behind in Honduras four years earlier to seek a better life in the United States. Now after a month in the shelter, they'd soon be reunited.

But instead of her children, she heard the unfamiliar voice of a shelter staff member. Something had happened to Alex.

There was surveillance video, the woman said, showing two older teenagers grabbing Alex, throwing him to the floor and dragging him into a bedroom.

""But there are no cameras in the room,"" she said, ""so we couldn't see the rest.""

The woman passed the phone to Alex, who sobbed as he told his mother what happened in the bedroom.

When she hung up, Yojana was furious. The attack had happened more than three weeks ago. Why was she only finding out about it now? Where was the staff? Why wasn't anyone watching them? And what if the attack had been worse than Alex said?

As a mother, Yojana said her instincts were to go to the police - to break down any door she had to - to make sure the shelter and the teens were held accountable. But she knew that in the United States, she wasn't just any mother. She and her husband, Jairo, had separately crossed the border illegally several years earlier and had been living in the country without permission ever since. The family agreed to let us tell their story as long as we didn't use their last names.

Yojana had reason to worry. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have been arresting parents and family members, or members of their households, who are in the country illegally when they come forward to claim their children. This month, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it had arrested 170 such sponsors, or people connected to them, between July and November; 109 of those people had no criminal record.

If Yojana and Jairo went to the authourities, or pressed too hard, they could risk everything they'd worked for.

Weeks earlier, Alex had started on a path he thought would lead to help. Four days after the attack, he finally got up the courage to report it to his counselor. ""She told me it was very sad what happened to me and that she was very sorry,"" Alex recalled. His counselor took him to the office of her supervisor, Marianne Cortes, where he repeated his story.

Then, he said, Cortes told him that she and his counselor would watch the surveillance video and ""if it's like you told me, we'll put in a report."" After they watched the video, Alex said, his counselor told him that there was something else on the tape, something he hadn't realised during the attack. There'd been a witness.

""In the video, my counselor told me there was another boy in a window,"" he said.

But then, after those revelations, nothing happened. There was no further investigation.

In an interview, archdiocese spokeswoman Mary Ross Agosta said at that time there was no reason for one. Alex ""was interviewed by staff, and he claimed it was verbal harassment, sexual gestures and teasing about his sister, but no nudity,"" she said.

The staff had reviewed the surveillance footage, she said: ""They did grab him by his hands and feet and take him in the room."" But, she said, it was ""humiliating,"" not criminal.

The shelter reported the incident to federal regulators as sexual harassment. Staff didn't call the police, she said, ""because there was no sexual contact or inappropriate behavior - other than making fun of him.""

Waiting three weeks to call Yojana was ""an oversight,"" Ross Agosta said, which Cortes noticed when she prepared to call Yojana to begin the reunification process.

It wasn't until July 30, she said, that Alex told staff that something sexual had happened. But Alex said by that time, Cortes knew the full story. He'd told her when he first reported it in early July and she heard it again as she stood by while he told his mom on July 27.

On July 30, Ross Agosta said, the shelter called the Miami-Dade police and the Florida Department of Children and Families.

Child abuse experts say waiting in such a situation goes against best practices. Regardless of what Alex revealed the first time, they said, counselors who work with children should know that it's common for assault victims to withhold details initially.

""Sometimes it can be overwhelming,"" said Chris Newlin, the lead author of a US Justice Department report on best practices for interviewing children in abuse cases. Young victims may be unsure of what to do, what will happen if they tell or how the system works, he said. They may have been threatened or they may be traumatised.

Newlin said a child in Alex's situation would be even less likely to report because of his immigration status. That's why it's critical, he said, for staff members to take every case seriously and look for signs of trauma.

Ross Agosta said the police came to the shelter on July 30 followed the next day by Department of Children and Families investigators. And both agencies, she said, determined there ""was no sexual assault.""

After the call from Alex, Yojana and Jairo dropped everything and started driving across the country to Boystown. It was supposed to be a happy time, but now they were filled with worry.

Yojana, 33, had come to the United States from Honduras in 2014, leaving behind Alex, then 9, and his sister, Yemerly, 13. She joined a sister in southwest Missouri and found work at a chicken plant, packing frozen pieces on the graveyard shift.

She kept up with her kids through video chats and posted pictures on Facebook of Alex's face painted like a clown at a birthday party she missed.

The money she sent to Honduras allowed Alex and Yemerly to attend private school, a rare privilege she hoped would insulate them from the country's gang violence. Yojana hadn't made it past the sixth grade, but Yemerly was studying to be a civil engineer.

But that display of economic success made them vulnerable to kidnappers, she and Jairo said. One night, after not hearing from Yemerly for several days, Yojana saw a TV news report about five young girls being kidnapped and decided it was time.

""If we didn't send for them to come, we might regret it for life,"" Jairo said.

Alex, Yemerly and their stepbrother Amahury set off from Honduras in June with their 8-year-old cousin. They traveled in a packed refrigerated trailer through Mexico and, 11 days later, crossed the Rio Grande in a green inflatable raft. They were quickly caught by the Border Patrol and taken to Catholic Charities' Msgr. Bryan Walsh Children's Village - a facility most people call Boystown.

Five weeks later, on the day they were finally reunited in the Boystown cafeteria, photos show Yojana didn't even stop to put her handbag down before hugging her children tightly to her. Alex was now taller than her with a new haircut, a thick wave of black hair on top with the sides shaved to a point in the back like the soccer stars he worshipped. Yemerly cried in her mother's arms.

""Right there, in that moment,"" Yojana said later, ""it felt like the children that I left in Honduras had come back to life.""

But, she said, she could feel a part of Alex was closed off. The kids wouldn't be released for two days, so when Alex called her at the hotel, Yojana decided to press for more details about the attack and record it on her phone.

During the call, Alex told her the police were coming and he'd been told they ""are going to interview me."" But he was scared that anything he said could interfere with his getting out. ""I just don't want to be here anymore.""

Yojana urged him to tell the truth. ""When the police arrive, you tell them the exact same thing you told me,"" Yojana said. ""Don't be afraid of what those kids did. You must tell them what happened.""

Yojana could hear the staticky sound of a walkie-talkie in the background.

""Hold on,"" Alex said, ""the counselor is coming for me.""

What happened next is disputed. Alex said after he hung up he was never interviewed by police or anyone else.

The Miami-Dade police initially told ProPublica it couldn't find any reports about an alleged sexual assault at Boystown despite being provided with Alex's full name, the shelter's address, the date and a description of the incident.

After culling through a log of 145 calls the police had received from the shelter since 2013, we found it under the vague label ""Conduct Investigation.""

According to the report, Miami-Dade police officers arrived at Boystown at 4:42 p.m. on July 30 and completed their investigation at 5:54 p.m. The report doesn't describe what they did for that 72 minutes. The narrative is three sentences long.

Cortes, it said, had called the police ""to advise that on the listed date and approximate time"" Alex had ""an incident"" with two other boys. But she ""advised the incident was settled and no sexual crime occurred between the boys like first was thought among the staff.""

That was essentially it. The police left. There was nothing about a surveillance video. They didn't interview the teenagers or the potential witness. They didn't talk to Alex. There was no mention of how Boystown had come to its conclusion - or why the police believed it.

Under ""Case Status,"" an officer had typed ""CLOSED.""

In a brief phone call, Cortes said she couldn't discuss how she and others in the shelter responded because of privacy rules and referred questions to the archdiocese.

""The only thing I could tell you is that we advocated the most for him and his care,"" Cortes said. ""Anything that happens with any child there that might be a trauma, we take it for face value. We don't minimise it. We take everything very serious.""

Detective Alvaro Zabaleta, a Miami-Dade police spokesman, said he didn't know if the officer who responded had been told there was video. But he didn't want to second-guess his judgment in not interviewing Alex.

Shelter staff members, Zabaleta said, are trained to work with immigrant children and the issues they face. So when ""you're dealing with kids and you have their counselor,"" he said, ""they become their voice, and they're there to look out for the best interest of the child.""

But the officer's decision not to interview Alex struck child abuse experts we spoke with as unusual.

""How can you possibly conduct an investigation without getting input from the one person who you think can be your most credible witness about what may or may not have happened?"" Newlin said. ""How do you know who to talk to? How do you know what evidence to possibly look for if you don't obtain a statement from that individual?""

Mike Haney, who formerly oversaw abuse prevention and intervention at Department of Children and Families and the Florida Department of Health, said the state developed its model for abuse investigations in 1978 when it created ""child protection teams"" made up of pediatricians, social workers and child psychologists. The teams work with local law enforcement agencies and DCF [Department of Children and Families] to assess child abuse reports, provide services and conduct what are known as ""forensic interviews.""

Haney said such interviews should occur ""as soon as it's reasonably appropriate for the child,"" but generally within 24 to 48 hours. That's because children come under a lot of pressure when a report is made to law enforcement and Department of Children and Families, he said.

""For an officer to respond to that type of allegation and not interview the kid, I'm not sure what the officer was thinking,"" Haney said. ""And if the clinician said, 'I talked with the kids, they said this,' I'd want to know that the child gave me the same story.""

Still, under Florida law, Haney said, the officer was under no obligation to call in a child protection team to conduct a forensic interview. That's because the law only requires such interviews when the child alleges abuse by a parent or caregiver. And what Alex says happened to him is what's known in Florida as a ""child on child.""

""In my opinion, we should be referring any child if there's an allegation of sexual abuse for a professional assessment,"" Haney said. ""But that becomes a resource issue, a funding issue, a staff issue. That's the biggest reason. There would be a significant cost increase if we make it available to any child.""

The hundreds of police reports reviewed by ProPublica revealed many hastily dismissed incidents like Alex's in immigrant youth shelters.

In 2016, a staff member at a shelter outside Phoenix observed one boy making hip-thrusting movements on top of another boy with a blanket in between them. The victim couldn't stop crying and wouldn't speak to the staff member. A police officer took a report and the case was closed.

A year earlier at the same facility, a youth care worker walked in on a boy who had his shorts partially down and was standing behind another boy who also had his pants down and was bending over a bed. The next day, during a medical exam, the boy told a nurse that one of his roommates had held him down while the other raped him. Five days later, however, when he was finally brought in for an official interview, the boy denied that anything had happened. That case, too, was closed.

In March 2017, a 16-year-old Honduran boy told a shelter employee in New York that his roommate had raped him while he'd been at a shelter in Renton, Washington. After nearly two months of back-and-forth, a detective finally interviewed the teen. But by that time, the boy no longer wanted ""to do anything about it."" Like the others, the case was closed.

In many cases, the responding officers simply filed brief information reports about the incidents, without investigating them as potential crimes.

Critics say this highlights a flaw of the system. Because immigrant kids are typically only in the investigating agencies' jurisdictions for a few weeks, even if a detective wanted to pursue a case, it wouldn't necessarily be easy. Kids get moved around a lot in the shelter system, sometimes without warning or in the middle of the night. When they're released, they're often sent out of state to live with parents or relatives who might want to avoid interactions with police because they're undocumented themselves or living with someone who is.

When Boystown finally released Alex and his siblings on August 1, they handed Yojana a folder. It contained Alex's intake papers, vaccination records and blood tests. There was information for Yojana about how to be a good sponsor and how to follow up with immigration court. But there wasn't anything, not even an incident report, about what happened to Alex.

When Jairo asked to see the surveillance video, a staff member informed him that the security cameras were on a loop.

""They said that after 30 days, the video is erased, and much to our regret, today is the 31st day,"" Jairo said. ""How convenient.""

But in that moment, he and Yojana didn't want to press. They had their children again. And for the first time in their lives, they could step outside and into America together.

After leaving Boystown, the family huddled at a nearby Honduran restaurant to decide if they should go to the police or if they should just get home.

They'd only been given a few days off work, and Jairo felt pressure to get back. On the other hand, somebody should pay for what happened to Alex, if not for his sake, to prevent other children from being harmed in the shelter.

Then again, the shelter said it filed a police report. Even if Alex hadn't been interviewed yet, surely an officer would follow up.

""I wanted to grab my phone and break it because I couldn't stand it anymore - the pressure,"" Jairo said. ""I have so many responsibilities on my shoulders and this was another on top of that. Plus, we already had our children, and that was good.""

They decided to leave.

Back in Missouri a few days later, Alex squeezed into the backseat of Jairo's pickup, tagging along on a swimming pool job.

As they drove east on Interstate 44, passing the exit-ramp oases of Waffle Houses, Best Westerns and Flying J truck stops, Alex stared out the window silently, occasionally resting his head on the window or running his fingers nervously along the seams of his jeans.

For days, Yojana and Jairo had been wavering between wanting to seek justice but feeling powerless over how to go about it. Jairo said he had a business card for a lawyer in Kansas City who could take Alex's case and maybe get to the bottom of what happened. But Jairo and Yojana hadn't called for an appointment.

There was a lot they were trying to sort out. They weren't sure if Alex was telling the whole story of what happened at Boystown or keeping something even worse from them. Yojana said she'd tried to broach the subject, but Alex told her not to ask him about it anymore.

Alex said that on the day the police came, he and his counselor ""were waiting for the police to talk to me, but Marianne Cortes spoke with them, and then my counselor told me they didn't need to interview me anymore.""

Alex said he was left confused. He'd wanted to tell the police what the two boys did to him and didn't understand why the shelter had talked to the police on his behalf.

When asked what he wanted to happen, Alex was unequivocal. ""I want to report them,"" he said. ""To go to the police.""

In mid-August, Department of Children and Families released a report citing Boystown for three violations of the state's rules regarding residential child care facilities.

The report said the shelter had been understaffed. It had failed to report suspected child abuse in a timely fashion. And it had failed to notify a child's parents or legal guardian after a critical incident.

The records didn't mention Alex or describe what prompted the investigation. But they show that on August 16 - a little over two weeks after Alex was released - Boystown agreed to a ""corrective action plan."" It promised to retrain employees and file biweekly reports that would allow the state to check that Boystown had enough staff to supervise the kids.

Department of Children and Families spokesman David Frady said he couldn't speak about Alex's case or even confirm that there'd been an incident at Boystown because of privacy concerns.

""I'm not able to confirm or deny whether or not we've spoken to an alleged victim,"" he said.

Miami-Dade police denied a request to interview the responding officers and refused to release body-camera footage of their visit to Boystown. Of the 17 minutes of video and audio that exists, the department said only 12 seconds was public because Florida law prohibits release of any body-cam recording taken within a ""private residence.""

ProPublica challenged the decision, but the department said the conversation occurred in an office, a place where the social worker could expect privacy.

However, after receiving our questions about the handling of the case and reviewing the incident, Zabaleta said, the department had assigned an investigator to take a second look - effectively reopening the case.

The department then said it wouldn't even release the 12 seconds of footage because the case was still under investigation.

The federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, which funds and regulates the shelters, said that after the incident, Boystown transferred the ""perpetrators"" to a different dorm. But the agency declined to answer questions about whether Boystown had handled the incident properly or what, if anything, ORR had done in response.

""Our focus is always on the safety and best interest of each child,"" spokeswoman Lydia Holt said in an email. ""We have no additional information to share regarding this case.""

Today, Alex's case remains in the hands of the state attorney's office. But child abuse experts say the likelihood of learning the truth of what happened to him in the bedroom at Boystown grows dimmer every day.

This much is clear: If Alex's case is any guide, the thousands of children passing through the nation's overburdened shelter system - understaffed and increasingly akin to long-term orphanages - should not expect a rigorous investigation if they suffer abuses in the shelters.

""Somebody has to pay for these mistakes because these are monstrous things,"" Jairo said. ""It can't go unpunished. If it stays that way, in many centres, this is going to continue to happen."""

As per the Central Motor Vehicle Act, it is mandatory to have a first-aid box in all passenger carrying vehicles, with the box to contain antiseptic cream, Dettol, sterilized dressings, elastic and waterproof plaster, gauze and bandage for wounds and burns, and tincture iodine.

According to officials, many of the 3,500-plus RTC buses in the city do not have first-aid kits, with many passengers too complaining about the same. RTC Secunderabad Regional Manager G Ramakanth, admitting that first aid kits were absent in many buses, said the practice was not there for several years. However, efforts were on to ensure medical kits in buses, he said.

The Central Motor Vehicle Act also says that a conductor's licence is granted only after getting the first-aid certification. A conductor usually undergoes a week-long training in first aid prior to availing licence and need to renew it for every three or four years.

On the other hand, the Road Transport Authority (RTA) has to issue a fitness certificate for the vehicle after ensuring that it is fully equipped, including with a first aid box. They are also supposed to carry out surprise inspection on passengers and school buses to check whether the kits are available.

These days, it is not unusual to see children, still sleepy, leave home before sunrise to sweat it out at tuition centres before racing off to school. School hours are, in many instances, sandwiched between expensive, back-breaking coaching sessions after which the children limp home -- bleary-eyed and exhausted -- by 8 p.m. or 9 p.m., or even later.

Acting on a set of complaints, the Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights on Friday issued orders to the State government to frame a law for regulating tuition/coaching centres and to ensure that children's rights are protected. The commission asked the Secretary, General Education, and the Director of Public Instruction (DPI), to ensure that such institutions are allowed to operate only in a child-friendly atmosphere.

Commission member Sreela Menon N., in her order, noted that while rules and regulations protected the rights of children in the school environment, no such framework protected them in tuition centres that have mushroomed in every nook and cranny of the State.

The commission's order came on two petitions filed by Sebi Joseph of Ancheri, Thrissur, and a group of parents. The petitioners, urging the commission's intervention, alleged that gross violation of children's rights was occurring at such institutions. They also wanted the commission to slap a ban on summer coaching classes that also have become a common feature.

Although the commission issued notices on the matter to the Secretary, General Education, and the DPI, it received the reply that the Education Department was helpless.

The Kerala Education Rules did not contain any provision to regulate tuition/coaching centres. In fact, Friday's order has come at a time when even veterans in the coaching classes sector have started to complain about excesses. P.C. Thomas of Thrissur, a pioneer in the field, welcomed the order, saying it was high time steps were taken to protect children. According to him, tuition/coaching centres have transformed into a 'mafia' in recent years.

""This has become a big business where the children are at the receiving end. There is no doubt that the rights of the children have to be protected. The government should introduce regulations and form inspection teams,"" Mr. Thomas said.

The film shows her at the World heritage site of Ajanta and Ellora talking about Buddha and his influence on her art.

Venkatappa Art Gallery in the dock, once again

The iconic art institution has once again become a bone of contention between the artists and the government. With the State Tourism department planning to demolish VAG on Kasturba Gandhi Road as the structure was found to be weakened upon inspection, the artists are once again up in arms, asking the government to revamp the building instead of razing it. The building was saved by the group of artists just a couple of years back when the Siddaramaiah Government had signed an MOU with Tasveer Foundation to set up Museum of Art and Photography (MAP). After non-stop protests by the community of artists, the government had to relent. Now the said MAP is coming up right opposite VAG.

Beginning next Kharif season, the Union Agriculture Ministry will roll out a nation-wide, agri market intelligence system with the objective of helping farmers secure better price by forecasting demand for major foodgrains and price-sensitive horticulture crops such as onions, The Hindu Business Line has reported.

A forecasting system well ahead of the production season can enable the farmers to undertake an informed decision on their production with a view to earning optimal returns. The forecasting system is also expected to help other stakeholders in the agri-supply system including traders, processors, exporters, importers.

Quoting an official in the Agriculture Ministry, The Hindu Business Line report said that the proposed system will be exactly modelled on the seasonal weather forecasting system of India Meterological Department's (IMD). Regular forecasts will be issued on a fortnightly basis during the sowing season through the system and the initial scope will include foodgrains -- which cover 72 per cent of total cropped area in the country and horticulture crops such as potatoes, onions and tomatoes.

Setting up a system for forecasting price and demand for agricultural commodities is based on the recommendations made by an expert panel on doubling farmers' income, headed by Ashok Dalwai, who is also the CEO of National Rainfed Area Authority (NRAA). The Dalwai Committee, set up in April 2016, has submitted a14 -volume report identifying ways to double farmers' 2015-16 income level, in real terms, by 2022.

The Dalwai committe had observed that over the years, though the government has developed an elaborate system of estimation of crop sown area, yield and production of different crops, quality and timeliness of the data poses a big challenge in precise and error free forecasting and projections. It also pointed out that despite multiple organisations involved in compilation, monitoring and release of prices/price indices, currently no department is involved in forecasting prices/demand officially at the national level. The committe had recommended restructuring of Directorate of Marketing Inspection into the Directorate of Marketing Intelligence to help provide a solution at national level for reliable and timely price forecasting in a sustainable way. The committee also recommended that focus should be on monitoring demand and supply situations to arrive at associated price forecast.

The Dalwai commitee had underscored the need for designing a multivariate forecasting system for price of an agriculture commodity using a dynamic model that, in addition to historical prices, incorporates all possible explanatory factors including yield, rainfall, temperature, stocks, trade (imports and exports), unforeseen factors like political uncertainty, strikes, etc., that influence future price and production of a commodity.

In October this year, the Agriculture Ministry constituted a technical advisory committee (TAC), again under the chairmanship of Dalwai.

According to The Hindu Business Line report, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR-NIAP) has been identified as knowledge partner for the project to begin with. The TAC, from time to time, would recommend commodities on which price and demand forecasting needs to be made by ICAR-NIAP. The TAC is likely to sign a memorandum of understanding with some agricultural universities in the country and also set up centres in different places so that regional forecasts can be made.

The Dalwai Committe report also showcased few success stories in building a price forecasting system for agricultural commodities.

In 2015-16 in Karnataka, with financial assistance from Karnataka State Agriculture Marketing Board, three agriculture universities located at Bengaluru, Dharwad and Raichur were assigned the project of developing a price forecasting system using rigorous time series econometric models for select commodities including paddy, sorghum, maize and ragi under cereals; bengal gram, red gram, green gram and black gram under pulses; groundnut, sunflower and soybean under oilseeds; dry chillies, cotton, coconut, arecanut and turmeric under commercial crops; and tomato, potato and onion under vegetable crops.

Apart from forecasting, traders' survey, consideration of future market prices, changes in the government policies, weather changes, import and export situation, prices of competitive commodities and a shift in the crop area at district, state and country levels were considered for building the model.

The government of Karnataka also constituted the Karnataka Agriculture Prices Commission (KAPC) as an advisory body to deal with aspects of scientific costing and pricing of farm produces, competitive market structure and all other issues related to farmers' income and welfare in the state.

In order to accomplish the major mandate of timely dissemination of market intelligence and information to policy makers as well as to farmers, a project was assigned to School of Food Business, Diary Sciences College, Hebbal Campus, Bengaluru, falling under Veterinary University (KVAFSU) Bider, to construct an Interactive Dashboard for real-time prices forecast for principle agriculture and horticultural commodities. Accordingly, the dashboard was designed and developed as a 'Decision Support System (DSS)' with the active support a Bengaluru-based software company."

""We require the particular stretch up to St Xavier's School signal. Here, only pavement work must be carried out for the time being and not the storm water drain works. This particular stretch is heavily used by pedestrians, including schoolchildren, and faces extreme traffic jams between 8 am and 10 pm due to Metro Line 4 work barricading,"" the residents said in their letter to the BMC's Chief Engineer, Roads.

Residents claimed that the BMC had not carried out any inspection before awarding the storm water drain works.

""Please appreciate that the work on the side of the road along with the Metro work on the median, badly narrows carriageways down. The chances of escalation of emergencies due to expected prolonged work are exceedingly high.

I agree that the residents will face inconvenience for a few months, but once the work is over, it will bring a lot of relief to residents,"" Patil said.

""The road work must be prioritised and the footpaths must be restored to their original condition. We will conduct a review of the works once again next week and make sure that the footpaths are made walkable and street lights are in a working condition,"" Patil said."

A World Cup soccer match was playing on the shelter's TV when the two older teenagers tackled Alex on July 1 and dragged him into the empty bedroom. Wrestling him onto his stomach, one of them, a tattoo on his forearm, got on top. As Alex struggled to move, he said he could feel the teen's penis grinding against his butt.

""Take off his shorts!"" he heard the other teen, who'd bragged he'd been a gang member in Honduras, shout. ""Let's get him naked!""

Just 10 days earlier, Alex, 13, had been caught by the Border Patrol after travelling from Honduras with his 17-year-old sister and 5-year-old stepbrother, to flee the country's gang violence. Now, they were being held at Boystown outside Miami, one of more than 100 youth shelters in the government's sprawling system meant to provide a temporary haven for migrant children caught crossing the border.

The two teens had been taunting Alex since he'd arrived at the shelter, making crude sexual jokes about his pregnant sister. Now, in the bedroom, Alex said, they yanked down the front of his shorts.

""At least your sister has already tasted a man,"" he heard one of them sneer. ""But you haven't even tried a woman.""

Alex said he fought as hard as he could, somehow managing to pull up his shorts and kick until he broke free. As he lay on the floor catching his breath, he said, the boys fled, warning him to keep his mouth shut.

Over the past six months, ProPublica has gathered hundreds of police reports detailing allegations of sexual assaults in immigrant children's shelters, which have received $4.5 billion for housing and other services since the surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America in 2014. The reports, obtained through public records requests, revealed a largely hidden side of the shelters -- one in which both staff and other residents sometimes acted as predators.

Several of the incidents have led to arrests of shelter employees or teenage residents. And in one particularly heinous case, a youth care worker was convicted in September of molesting seven boys over nearly a year at an Arizona shelter. The employee had worked for months without a full background check.

Coverage of such incidents by ProPublica and other media triggered demands for investigations.

Arizona's governor ordered a statewide inspection of the shelters, leading to the shutdown of two centres run by Southwest Key after the nonprofit failed to provide proof that its employees had completed background checks.

And late last month, federal investigators warned that the Trump administration had waived FBI fingerprint background checks of staffers and had allowed ""dangerously"" few mental health counsellors at a tent camp housing 2,800 migrant children in Tornillo, Texas.

But ProPublica's review of the hundreds of police reports showed something else about the assaults. Something that went beyond background checks. Kids at shelters across the country were, indeed, reporting sexual attacks in the shelters, often by other kids. But again and again, the reports show, the police were quickly -- and with little investigation -- closing the cases, often within days, or even hours.

And there are likely even more such cases. ProPublica's cache of records is missing many police reports from shelters in Texas, where the largest number of immigrant children are held, because state laws there ban child abuse reports from being made public, particularly when the assaults are committed by other minors.

Now, as the immigration system struggles to house and care for 14,600 children -- more than ever before -- an examination of how federal and state authorities investigated the assault against Alex, one of those children, reveals startling lapses.

For a few days, Alex said, he didn't report his assault, heeding his attackers' warning, worried that speaking up would delay his release from Boystown. But as they continued to harass him, he decided to tell his counselor.

The counsellor told him that a surveillance tape had captured the teenagers dragging him by his hands and feet into a room, and that there might have been a witness.

But Alex's report did not trigger a child sexual assault investigation, including a specialized interview designed to help children talk about what happened, as child abuse experts recommend.

Instead, the shelter waited nearly a month to call the police. When it finally did, a police report shows, the shelter's lead mental health counselor told the officers ""the incident was settled, and no sexual crime occurred between the boys like first was thought among the staff.""

And instead of investigating the incident themselves, officers with the Miami-Dade Police Department took the counselor's word for it and quickly closed the case, never interviewing Alex.

A spokeswoman for the Archdiocese of Miami, which received $6 million last year to care for about 80 children at Boystown, said it handled Alex's case correctly, blaming him for any delays. In response to questions, a Miami-Dade police spokesman said the department was reopening the case.

An examination of Alex's case shows that almost every agency charged with helping Alex -- with finding out the full extent of what happened in that room -- had instead failed him.

The police closed Alex's case 72 minutes after responding to the call.

Alex's mother, Yojana, had just gotten off work on July 27, bone-tired after another hot day installing swimming pools in southwest Missouri, when the call came from Boystown. She'd been expecting her regular chat with her children, so when her cellphone showed a Florida number, she answered excitedly.

Yojana had left them behind in Honduras four years earlier to seek a better life in the United States. Now after a month in the shelter, they'd soon be reunited.

But instead of her children, she heard the unfamiliar voice of a shelter staff member. Something had happened to Alex.

There was surveillance video, the woman said, showing two older teenagers grabbing Alex, throwing him to the floor and dragging him into a bedroom.

""But there are no cameras in the room,"" she said, ""so we couldn't see the rest.""

The woman passed the phone to Alex, who sobbed as he told his mother what happened in the bedroom.

When she hung up, Yojana was furious. The attack had happened more than three weeks ago. Why was she only finding out about it now? Where was the staff? Why wasn't anyone watching them? And what if the attack had been worse than Alex said?

As a mother, Yojana said her instincts were to go to the police -- to break down any door she had to -- to make sure the shelter and the teens were held accountable. But she knew that in the US, she wasn't just any mother. She and her husband, Jairo, had separately crossed the border illegally several years earlier and had been living in the country without permission ever since. The family agreed to let us tell their story as long as we didn't use their last names.

Yojana had reason to worry. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have been arresting parents and family members, or members of their households, who are in the country illegally when they come forward to claim their children. This month, ICE said it had arrested 170 such sponsors, or people connected to them, between July and November; 109 of those people had no criminal record.

If Yojana and Jairo went to the authorities, or pressed too hard, they could risk everything they'd worked for.

Weeks earlier, Alex had started on a path he thought would lead to help. Four days after the attack, he finally got up the courage to report it to his counsellor. ""She told me it was very sad what happened to me and that she was very sorry,"" Alex recalled. His counselor took him to the office of her supervisor, Marianne Cortes, where he repeated his story.

Then, he said, Cortes told him that she and his counsellor would watch the surveillance video and ""if it's like you told me, we'll put in a report."" After they watched the video, Alex said, his counselor told him that there was something else on the tape, something he hadn't realized during the attack. There'd been a witness.

""In the video, my counselor told me there was another boy in a window,"" he said.

But then, after those revelations, nothing happened. There was no further investigation.

In an interview, archdiocese spokeswoman Mary Ross Agosta said at that time there was no reason for one. Alex ""was interviewed by staff, and he claimed it was verbal harassment, sexual gestures and teasing about his sister, but no nudity,"" she said.

The staff had reviewed the surveillance footage, she said: ""They did grab him by his hands and feet and take him in the room."" But, she said, it was ""humiliating,"" not criminal.

The shelter reported the incident to federal regulators as sexual harassment. Staff didn't call the police, she said, ""because there was no sexual contact or inappropriate behaviour -- other than making fun of him.""

Waiting three weeks to call Yojana was ""an oversight,"" Ross Agosta said, which Cortes noticed when she prepared to call Yojana to begin the reunification process.

It wasn't until July 30, she said, that Alex told staff that something sexual had happened. But Alex said by that time, Cortes knew the full story. He'd told her when he first reported it in early July and she heard it again as she stood by while he told his mom on July 27.

On July 30, Ross Agosta said, the shelter called the Miami-Dade police and the Florida Department of Children and Families.

Child abuse experts say waiting in such a situation goes against best practices. Regardless of what Alex revealed the first time, they said, counsellors who work with children should know that it's common for assault victims to withhold details initially.

""Sometimes it can be overwhelming,"" said Chris Newlin, the lead author of a US Justice Department report on best practices for interviewing children in abuse cases. Young victims may be unsure of what to do, what will happen if they tell or how the system works, he said. They may have been threatened or they may be traumatized.

Newlin said a child in Alex's situation would be even less likely to report because of his immigration status. That's why it's critical, he said, for staff members to take every case seriously and look for signs of trauma.

Ross Agosta said the police came to the shelter on July 30 followed the next day by DCF investigators. And both agencies, she said, determined there ""was no sexual assault.""

After the call from Alex, Yojana and Jairo dropped everything and started driving across the country to Boystown. It was supposed to be a happy time, but now they were filled with worry.

Yojana, 33, had come to the US from Honduras in 2014, leaving behind Alex, then 9, and his sister, Yemerly, 13. She joined a sister in southwest Missouri and found work at a chicken plant, packing frozen pieces on the graveyard shift.

She kept up with her kids through video chats and posted pictures on Facebook of Alex's face painted like a clown at a birthday party she missed.

The money she sent to Honduras allowed Alex and Yemerly to attend private school, a rare privilege she hoped would insulate them from the country's gang violence. Yojana hadn't made it past the sixth grade, but Yemerly was studying to be a civil engineer.

But that display of economic success made them vulnerable to kidnappers, she and Jairo said. One night, after not hearing from Yemerly for several days, Yojana saw a TV news report about five young girls being kidnapped and decided it was time.

""If we didn't send for them to come, we might regret it for life,"" Jairo said.

Alex, Yemerly and their stepbrother Amahury set off from Honduras in June with their 8-year-old cousin. They travelled in a packed refrigerated trailer through Mexico and, 11 days later, crossed the Rio Grande in a green inflatable raft. They were quickly caught by the Border Patrol and taken to Catholic Charities' Msgr. Bryan Walsh Children's Village -- a facility most people call Boystown.

Five weeks later, on the day they were finally reunited in the Boystown cafeteria, photos show Yojana didn't even stop to put her handbag down before hugging her children tightly to her. Alex was now taller than her with a new haircut, a thick wave of black hair on top with the sides shaved to a point in the back like the soccer stars he worshipped. Yemerly cried in her mother's arms.

""Right there, in that moment,"" Yojana said later, ""it felt like the children that I left in Honduras had come back to life.""

But, she said, she could feel a part of Alex was closed off. The kids wouldn't be released for two days, so when Alex called her at the hotel, Yojana decided to press for more details about the attack and record it on her phone.

During the call, Alex told her the police were coming and he'd been told they ""are going to interview me."" But he was scared that anything he said could interfere with his getting out. ""I just don't want to be here anymore.""

Yojana urged him to tell the truth. ""When the police arrive, you tell them the exact same thing you told me,"" Yojana said. ""Don't be afraid of what those kids did. You must tell them what happened.""

Yojana could hear the staticky sound of a walkie-talkie in the background.

""Hold on,"" Alex said, ""the counsellor is coming for me.""

What happened next is disputed. Alex said after he hung up he was never interviewed by police or anyone else.

The Miami-Dade police initially told ProPublica it couldn't find any reports about an alleged sexual assault at Boystown despite being provided with Alex's full name, the shelter's address, the date and a description of the incident.

After culling through a log of 145 calls the police had received from the shelter since 2013, we found it under the vague label ""Conduct Investigation.""

According to the report, Miami-Dade police officers arrived at Boystown at 4:42 p.m. on July 30 and completed their investigation at 5:54 p.m. The report doesn't describe what they did for that 72 minutes. The narrative is three sentences long.

Cortes, it said, had called the police ""to advise that on the listed date and approximate time"" Alex had ""an incident"" with two other boys. But she ""advised the incident was settled and no sexual crime occurred between the boys like first was thought among the staff.""

That was essentially it. The police left. There was nothing about a surveillance video. They didn't interview the teenagers or the potential witness. They didn't talk to Alex. There was no mention of how Boystown had come to its conclusion -- or why the police believed it.

Under ""Case Status,"" an officer had typed ""CLOSED.""

In a brief phone call, Cortes said she couldn't discuss how she and others in the shelter responded because of privacy rules and referred questions to the archdiocese.

""The only thing I could tell you is that we advocated the most for him and his care,"" Cortes said. ""Anything that happens with any child there that might be a trauma, we take it for face value. We don't minimize it. We take everything very serious.""

Detective Alvaro Zabaleta, a Miami-Dade police spokesman, said he didn't know if the officer who responded had been told there was video. But he didn't want to second-guess his judgment in not interviewing Alex.

Shelter staff members, Zabaleta said, are trained to work with immigrant children and the issues they face. So when ""you're dealing with kids and you have their counsellor,"" he said, ""they become their voice, and they're there to look out for the best interest of the child.""

But the officer's decision not to interview Alex struck child abuse experts we spoke with as unusual.

""How can you possibly conduct an investigation without getting input from the one person who you think can be your most credible witness about what may or may not have happened?"" Newlin said. ""How do you know who to talk to? How do you know what evidence to possibly look for if you don't obtain a statement from that individual?""

Mike Haney, who formerly oversaw abuse prevention and intervention at DCF and the Florida Department of Health, said the state developed its model for abuse investigations in 1978 when it created ""child protection teams"" made up of pediatricians, social workers and child psychologists. The teams work with local law enforcement agencies and DCF to assess child abuse reports, provide services and conduct what are known as ""forensic interviews.""

Haney said such interviews should occur ""as soon as it's reasonably appropriate for the child,"" but generally within 24 to 48 hours. That's because children come under a lot of pressure when a report is made to law enforcement and DCF, he said.

""For an officer to respond to that type of allegation and not interview the kid, I'm not sure what the officer was thinking,"" Haney said. ""And if the clinician said, 'I talked with the kids, they said this,' I'd want to know that the child gave me the same story.""

Still, under Florida law, Haney said, the officer was under no obligation to call in a child protection team to conduct a forensic interview. That's because the law only requires such interviews when the child alleges abuse by a parent or caregiver. And what Alex says happened to him is what's known in Florida as a ""child on child.""

""In my opinion, we should be referring any child if there's an allegation of sexual abuse for a professional assessment,"" Haney said. ""But that becomes a resource issue, a funding issue, a staff issue. That's the biggest reason. There would be a significant cost increase if we make it available to any child.""

The hundreds of police reports reviewed by ProPublica revealed many hastily dismissed incidents like Alex's in immigrant youth shelters.

In 2016, a staff member at a shelter outside Phoenix observed one boy making hip-thrusting movements on top of another boy with a blanket in between them. The victim couldn't stop crying and wouldn't speak to the staff member. A police officer took a report and the case was closed.

A year earlier at the same facility, a youth care worker walked in on a boy who had his shorts partially down and was standing behind another boy who also had his pants down and was bending over a bed. The next day, during a medical exam, the boy told a nurse that one of his roommates had held him down while the other raped him. Five days later, however, when he was finally brought in for an official interview, the boy denied that anything had happened. That case, too, was closed.

In March 2017, a 16-year-old Honduran boy told a shelter employee in New York that his roommate had raped him while he'd been at a shelter in Renton, Washington. After nearly two months of back-and-forth, a detective finally interviewed the teen. But by that time, the boy no longer wanted ""to do anything about it."" Like the others, the case was closed.

In many cases, the responding officers simply filed brief information reports about the incidents, without investigating them as potential crimes.

Critics say this highlights a flaw of the system. Because immigrant kids are typically only in the investigating agencies' jurisdictions for a few weeks, even if a detective wanted to pursue a case, it wouldn't necessarily be easy. Kids get moved around a lot in the shelter system, sometimes without warning or in the middle of the night. When they're released, they're often sent out of state to live with parents or relatives who might want to avoid interactions with police because they're undocumented themselves or living with someone who is.

When Boystown finally released Alex and his siblings on Aug. 1, they handed Yojana a folder. It contained Alex's intake papers, vaccination records and blood tests. There was information for Yojana about how to be a good sponsor and how to follow up with immigration court. But there wasn't anything, not even an incident report, about what happened to Alex.

When Jairo asked to see the surveillance video, a staff member informed him that the security cameras were on a loop.

""They said that after 30 days, the video is erased, and much to our regret, today is the 31st day,"" Jairo said. ""How convenient.""

But in that moment, he and Yojana didn't want to press. They had their children again. And for the first time in their lives, they could step outside and into America together.

After leaving Boystown, the family huddled at a nearby Honduran restaurant to decide if they should go to the police or if they should just get home.

They'd only been given a few days off work, and Jairo felt pressure to get back. On the other hand, somebody should pay for what happened to Alex, if not for his sake, to prevent other children from being harmed in the shelter.

Then again, the shelter said it filed a police report. Even if Alex hadn't been interviewed yet, surely an officer would follow up.

""I wanted to grab my phone and break it because I couldn't stand it anymore -- the pressure,"" Jairo said. ""I have so many responsibilities on my shoulders and this was another on top of that. Plus, we already had our children, and that was good.""

They decided to leave.

Back in Missouri a few days later, Alex squeezed into the backseat of Jairo's pickup, tagging along on a swimming pool job.

As they drove east on Interstate 44, passing the exit-ramp oases of Waffle Houses, Best Westerns and Flying J truck stops, Alex stared out the window silently, occasionally resting his head on the window or running his fingers nervously along the seams of his jeans.

For days, Yojana and Jairo had been wavering between wanting to seek justice but feeling powerless over how to go about it. Jairo said he had a business card for a lawyer in Kansas City who could take Alex's case and maybe get to the bottom of what happened. But Jairo and Yojana hadn't called for an appointment.

There was a lot they were trying to sort out. They weren't sure if Alex was telling the whole story of what happened at Boystown or keeping something even worse from them. Yojana said she'd tried to broach the subject, but Alex told her not to ask him about it anymore.

Alex said that on the day the police came, he and his counsellor ""were waiting for the police to talk to me, but Marianne Cortes spoke with them, and then my counsellor told me they didn't need to interview me anymore.""

Alex said he was left confused. He'd wanted to tell the police what the two boys did to him and didn't understand why the shelter had talked to the police on his behalf.

When asked what he wanted to happen, Alex was unequivocal. ""I want to report them,"" he said. ""To go to the police.""

In mid-August, DCF released a report citing Boystown for three violations of the state's rules regarding residential child care facilities.

The report said the shelter had been understaffed. It had failed to report suspected child abuse in a timely fashion. And it had failed to notify a child's parents or legal guardian after a critical incident.

The records didn't mention Alex or describe what prompted the investigation. But they show that on Aug. 16 -- a little over two weeks after Alex was released -- Boystown agreed to a ""corrective action plan."" It promised to retrain employees and file biweekly reports that would allow the state to check that Boystown had enough staff to supervise the kids.

DCF spokesman David Frady said he couldn't speak about Alex's case or even confirm that there'd been an incident at Boystown because of privacy concerns.

""I'm not able to confirm or deny whether or not we've spoken to an alleged victim,"" he said.

Miami-Dade police denied a request to interview the responding officers and refused to release body-camera footage of their visit to Boystown. Of the 17 minutes of video and audio that exists, the department said only 12 seconds was public because Florida law prohibits release of any body-cam recording taken within a ""private residence.""

ProPublica challenged the decision, but the department said the conversation occurred in an office, a place where the social worker could expect privacy.

However, after receiving our questions about the handling of the case and reviewing the incident, Zabaleta said, the department had assigned an investigator to take a second look -- effectively reopening the case.

The department then said it wouldn't even release the 12 seconds of footage because the case was still under investigation.

The federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, which funds and regulates the shelters, said that after the incident, Boystown transferred the ""perpetrators"" to a different dorm. But the agency declined to answer questions about whether Boystown had handled the incident properly or what, if anything, ORR had done in response.

""Our focus is always on the safety and best interest of each child,"" spokeswoman Lydia Holt said in an email. ""We have no additional information to share regarding this case.""

Today, Alex's case remains in the hands of the state attorney's office. But child abuse experts say the likelihood of learning the truth of what happened to him in the bedroom at Boystown grows dimmer every day.

This much is clear: If Alex's case is any guide, the thousands of children passing through the nation's overburdened shelter system -- understaffed and increasingly akin to long-term orphanages -- should not expect a rigorous investigation if they suffer abuses in the shelters.

""Somebody has to pay for these mistakes because these are monstrous things,"" Jairo said. ""It can't go unpunished. If it stays that way, in many centers, this is going to continue to happen."""

The Modi-led government started the Swadhar Greh scheme for homeless women in 2015. The Ministry of Women and Child Development released funds to the tune of nearly Rs 200 crore to 559 shelter homes. What is all that money meant to do?

The funds are supposed to be used to house homeless women in need of shelter, and to provide skills training so that they can look for work and become financially independent. They are supposed to shelter women between the age group of 18-60 years.

But the National Commission For Women (NCW) submitted a report to the ministry in December revealing the 'poor and deplorable' condition in 25 out of 26 homes in Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Karnataka and West Bengal.

According to the Chairperson of NCW, Rekha Sharma, the licences of the NGO running these homes should be cancelled immediately.

""They (Ministry for Women and Children) have a mechanism to check on shelter homes immediately. If we (Central government) are providing money to the shelter homes, then it should go into the right hands, it shouldn't be misused. Before giving out the next budgets, a proper check should be carried out on each and every NGO that is running a shelter house. Or else their licences should be cancelled, or we should invite new NGOs.""Rekha Sharma, Chairperson, National Commission for Women

The government is yet to take any action based on the report.

Major Findings

Some of the major findings of the NCW mentioned inadequate facilities and unclean, even dangerous conditions in the shelter homes: ""Unkempt mentally ill-women with no medical aid,"" ""dirty and unhygienic kitchens,"" ""cramped rooms, no beds or mattresses to sleep on"".

The report says some women complained of being forced to live in the shelter home rather than just stay to gain skills, while others detailed accounts of physical torture and a lack of counselling facilities. Some NGOs were even running these government shelters as hostels, illegally charging these destitute women fees for their stay.

The NCW has made strong recommendations to the Ministry of Women and Child Development to try and address these problems. They include measures like only employing women to run the homes, ensuring these homes aren't located in isolated, remote areas, and insisting that proper records of all these homes are maintained across the country.

Jayaprakash Institute of Social ChangeWhen the women were questioned, they informed the NCW Committee that the NGO workers go out and solicit donations of food and clothes for the women staying there.

During a surprise inspection in July this year, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had called the Burari transport authority a den of corruption. The authority was the central location for issuance and renewal of autorickshaw registration and fitness certificates but following the inspection, the work of issuance of permits and fitness certificates to autorickshaws were de-centralised and is now carried out in the 13 regional transport offices (RTO) in Delhi in a second shift.

While the autorickshaw unit (ARU) and vehicle inspection unit (VIU), where commercial vehicles were inspected and given fitness certificates, were closed after the CM's inspection in July, the ARU was reopened in November following the demand of autorickshaw unions. The unions had protested the lack of space at the zonal centres and wanted Burari ARU to be reopened.

In November, the fitness tests of most goods vehicles, public carriage buses and school buses were shifted from Burari to the transport department's state-of-the-art and automated new fitness centre at southwest Delhi's Jhuljhuli.

The 37-acre campus of the Burari authority was planned to be turned into a driving training and testing centre. The transport department, however, has now plans to turn the Burari complex into an automated vehicle fitness testing centre on the lines of the facility at Jhuljhuli.

""At present, most commercial vehicles, including heavy vehicles and buses, are being sent to Jhuljhuli for inspection, where the entire process of testing is automated and scientific. However, we are going to turn Burari into a fully automated fitness centre within the next six months,"" a transport department official said.

""The facilities available at Burari will be at par with the new centre at Jhuljhuli. However, since Jhuljhuli was built from the scratch and at Burari we already have infrastructure, we would have to factor that into the tender we would float,"" the official added. The department is first going to engage a consultant for preparing a tender, which is expected to be floated soon.

""At Burari, the inspection is visual and is done manually and performance check is not possible. At Jhuljhuli, however, we are able to test a vehicle's overall performance and its condition,"" the official said. ""All safety components of the vehicle, including brakes, propeller shaft, speed, vibrations, sound, emissions, headlights, etc, will be tested on international parameters,"" he said."

Effective midnight, Friday, December 21st, there is a partial federal government shutdown in effect.

Earlier this week, the National League of Cities (NLC) called on federal leaders to do their jobs and find a bipartisan solution to avoid a shutdown and keep every federal agency open.

""Cities expect our leaders in Washington to meet their most basic obligation and keep the federal government open,"" said NLC President Karen Freeman-Wilson, mayor of Gary, Indiana. ""A federal shutdown would impact programs that grow local economies and build more resilient communities. Instead of wasting $6.5 billion a week on a shutdown, let's put that money to good use -- by investing in America's cities.""

This would be a ""partial"" shutdown because Congress met the deadline to approve five of the twelve total appropriations bills. In addition to all ""mandatory"" spending programs, federal discretionary grant programs administered through the following agencies will not be impacted by the partial shutdown:

For city leaders, this means residents can expect uninterrupted operations and payments from Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. VA Hospitals and other service providers for veterans should remain open. Before and after school programs funded by the Department of Education's 21 Century Community Learning Center grants should not be interrupted.

Unfortunately for city leaders, the federal agencies that will be shutting down to various degrees are those that administer most federal grants allocated directly to municipal governments, including:

According to this detailed Q&A from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, when a funding lapse results in the shutdown of a federal agency, the government must discontinue all non-essential discretionary functions until new funding legislation is passed and signed into law. And according to this White House Shutdown FAQ, all normally, routine, ongoing operational and administrative activities relating to contract or grant administration (including payment processing) cannot continue when there is a lapse in funding. Moreover, federal agency employees who are paid with annual appropriations and who perform an activity associated with contract or grant administration (including oversight, inspection, payment or accounting) should generally not continue work during a lapse in appropriations.

In other words, federal discretionary grants that are administered to local governments from unfunded federal agencies, including HUD's CDBG and HOME grants, DOJ's COPS grants, DOT's TIGER grants, EDA's economic development grants, SBA's small business loans, and USDA's rural loans and grants, will be unavailable for reimbursement to local governments, and agency staff will generally be unavailable to answer questions or offer technical assistance throughout the duration of the partial government shutdown. Any local employees funded by federal grants may also be required to stop work.

The White House Office of Management and Budget maintains a list of each agency's plans here. Additional contingency information may be posted on individual agency websites as well.

A short shutdown of a week or less will have little to no impact on cities (although it will cost the federal government plenty to furlough employees, mothball offices, and reopen even a short time later). The effects of a longer shutdown would multiply quickly, including inaccessible federal funding, project delays and potential layoffs. As federal funding for services dry up, residents usually expect local governments to step in with supplemental funding. Eventually it will fall on cities and states to bear the cost of the shutdown on the broader economy, which will result in less tax revenue for all levels of government.

The federal law that prohibits agencies from incurring obligations in advance of appropriations, the Antideficiency Act, also requires an ""orderly shutdown"" when there has been a lapse in appropriations. Of course, actual government shutdowns are anything but orderly, and there will be exceptions and inconsistencies across the board, known and unknown.

Among the known exceptions and inconsistencies, if there is a partial government shutdown:"

The Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ranchi, will evaluate the merger of primary schools in Jharkhand. The state education department has roped in the institute for a detailed study of 4,600 merged schools to find out if the reorganisation has brought about any improvement or not, department officials said.

State education secretary AP Singh said, ""IIM Ranchi would see if the reorganisation has brought any benefits for students as well as the education system. It would also evaluate if the initiative brought about any improvement in the education of those students who were shifted to other schools in the merger process,"" he said. ""We have sought a financial proposal from the institute for the study.""

The reorganisation exercise of schools had also caught the interest of IIM Bangalore, which expressed its willingness to carry out a study on the process and its benefits, said the secretary.

Merging schools with low enrolment is an exercise that has been undertake by Rajasthan and Jharkhand in the country with the support of the Union government and NITI (National Institution for Transforming India) Aayog, the policy think tank of the Government of India. Jharkhand started the merging procedure in 2016-17.

Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) director Uma Shankar Singh said that there were 39,600 schools in 2016-17 under the education department in Jharkhand. ""Of them, 18,000 schools had 60 or fewer students. These schools had an average of one or two teachers per school. Providing quality education was a major challenge. One teacher was handling four-five classes at a time. How could one expect a better education in these schools?"" he said.

The council said that a four-step process -- field inspection; cross-district verification; block and district consultation; and final notification -- was undertaken to merge the schools.

Singh said that 98% students from the 4,600 primary schools had been shifted and 96% of the students had expressed satisfaction with the consolidation. ""We faced difficulty in shifting 150 schools due to some technical reasons. Now, the issue has been resolved, and students from 120 schools have been shifted,"" he said.

The reorganisation of primary schools benefited seven lakh students, giving them better teacher availability, and cut the requirement of 4,500 teaching positions. The merger process saved the government Rs 400 crore by reducing teaching positions and infrastructure requirements, said JEPC officials. The officials added that the funds thus saved would be spent on strengthening the education infrastructure of the merged schools."

Three students of Class 6 told him that the teacher of the primary school, located across the road from the girls' school, used to sexually harass them around a year ago.

""A number of girls started crying when they were asked about their issues. Even the teachers admitted how they have seen the girls being subjected to harassment by miscreants outside the school. The girls also named a teacher of the nearby school, saying he would harass them under the pretext of free tuitions,"" said Mittal.

Under the Ek aur Sudhaar project, Mittal has visited schools in 15 districts, including Gurugram, so far. Police said that they would look into the complaints. ""No formal complaint has been filed in the matter and the harassment of school girls is not restricted to one teacher. Students complained that they were being harassed on a daily basis, especially on their way home after school,"" said a senior police officer. The accused teacher, police said, had been posted with the neighbouring school for two years but the school authority was unaware of the girls' ordeal. The principal of the school could not be reached for comments."

After merger of 4,600 primary schools, the Jharkhand government is planning to shut over 6,466 middle schools (classes 6 to 8), having less than 100 students.

These schools would be merged with upgraded high schools in phases, starting with the institutions, which have less than 50 students, education department officials said on Thursday.

Initially, 3,732 middle schools having less than 50 students would be undertaken for merger. The process of merging has already been started.

""Merger is an effort to provide quality education to students in a better educational ambience. Jharkhand has around 411 such middle schools where number of students is less than 10. If these schools are merged with high schools, students would get better education,"" said state education secretary AP Singh.

""As per the rules in the right to education (RTE), there should be at least three trained graduate teacher (TGT) in middle schools where number of students is less than 100. It means, we would have to afford additional Rs 18 lakh on teachers' salary even in the schools where number of students is less than 10, which is not logical,"" he added.

The decision comes at a time when the opposition parties and critics have been criticising the state government for merging the primary schools. Several ruling party elected representatives have also been lobbying with the government against the move. There have been protests in several parts of the state as well, against merger of schools.

The officials, however, argue that, ideally, there should be one middle school and five to seven primary schools in a panchayat. As many as 6,466 middle schools have been identified in Jharkhand, which could be merged with high schools within a 5-km radius in a panchayat, Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) officials said.

The state government has decided to offer bicycles to the students, who would be shifted to other schools so that they do not face any trouble in commuting to the school.

Meanwhile, the JEPC officials said they have completed the merging exercise of 4,600 primary schools.

JEPC director Uma Shankar Singh said there were 39,600 schools in 2016-17 under education department in Jharkhand. ""Of them, 18,000 schools had 60 or few students. These schools had an average of 1 or two teachers per school. Providing quality education was a major challenge. One teacher was handling four to five classes at a time. How could one expect a better education in these schools,"" he said.

The council said four-step process including field inspection, cross-district verification, block and district consultation and final notification to merge the schools.

Singh said 98% students from the 4,600 primary schools have been shifted and 96% students have expressed satisfaction with the consolidation. ""We faced difficulty to shift 150 students due to some technical reasons. Now, the issue is resolved and 120 students were shifted,"" he said.

The reorganisation of primary schools benefited seven lakh students with better teachers' availability and reduced the requirements of teachers by 4,500. Besides, the process saved government's Rs 400 crore through reduced teachers and infrastructure requirements, JEPC officials said.

Education Dept ropes in IIM Ranchi for merged school evaluation

State education secretary AP Singh said the department has roped in Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ranchi, for evaluation of the merged schools. The IIM, Ranchi would see if the reorganization process brought any difference in improving the education of students, who were shifted in merging process.

He said IIM Bangalore has also expressed willingness for a study of the reorganization process and its benefit."

NITI Aayog does precisely that,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said immediately after the formation of the policy think tank in 2015. It was set up to replace the decade-old Planning Commission.

Modi had then said that unlike the Planning Commission, the NITI Aayog would not follow the 'one size fits all' approach. ""Through NITI Aayog, we bid farewell to a 'one size fits all' approach towards development. The body celebrates India's diversity and plurality,"" he said.

The inception of NITI Aayog was a strategic decision by the Narendra Modi government. Its aim was to replace the idea of development planning from public perception. However, it is not simple to do that since it is meant to cater to the needs of those people who are either unable to seize opportunities or are excluded by the market.

The idea of development planning was first discussed in the country in the 1931 Karachi session of the Indian National Congress before Independence. It was initiated as part of the Freedom movement and to see the future of India from a development perspective. Indian development planning entered a new facet with the Five-Year Plans in 1950 under the Planning Commission, a separate entity. That continued till 2014.

Representational image.

The first decision of the newly-elected Modi government was to scrap the Planning Commission and replace it with a new agency, the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog) with considerably less power and resources. It is true that the planning process had failed to deliver justice to the population; however, the idea of planned development is essential for the poor and needy. Even Jawaharlal Nehru was not happy with the planning process to a great extent. Reforms were inevitable, however, not at the cost of scrapping of the Planning Commission.

The new entity completely disowns the history and purpose of development planning in the country. Since its formation, NITI Aayog has come up with a number of proposals and policy framework to transform the country. However, all those suggestions depend on private initiatives. Unlike the Planning Commission, NITI Aayog proposes many methods of letting the private sector take over public policy responsibilities.

To be specific, every intervention and policy document of NITI Aayog is aimed at Public Private Partnership (PPP) as its core strategy. PPP is an encompassing concept and needs to share both capital and responsibility.

Putting all developmental projects including public infrastructure invites massive changes in the approach to development and primarily propagates the idea of prioritising development intervention. This is the context in which we should discuss the 'Strategy for New India @ 75' document. It proposes a set of ideas to transform India in 2022-23, i.e. at the 75th year of Independence. Of course, we need a strategic long-term vision and mission to achieve higher economic prospects for the country.

The strategic document released by NITI Aayog begins with a statement that India needs a 'development state' that focuses sharply on the difficult and accountable delivery of key public goods and services. It looks sensitive and is the need of the hour, however, a close examination of suggestions and methods proposed in the report reveals that it fully relies on PPP and privatisation. It has been the strategy and vision of every government since 1991. Interestingly, the text of the plan is a continuation of another brief document prepared in 2014 for Prime Minister Modi. This report is still up in the NITI Aayog website--The Planning Era in India: A Retrospective.

NITI Aayog has put in a lot of effort to prepare a critical note on India's decade-long development plan and each session of the report ends with a critical note explaining how it failed. It has listed the causes that play spoilsport such as labour laws, restrictions on land acquisitions and government control of the agriculture market, labour and resources. The proposed strategy follows the same arguments and suggestions.

All efforts have been on attaining double digit economic growth; the present strategy document also suggests an annual growth rate of 9 percent by 2022-23 to generate sufficient employment and development for all. It has listed out a comprehensive action plan and most important among them is the growth of Gross Fixed Capital Formation from the present 29 percent to 36 percent by 2022.

The report wants about half of GFCF from public investment. Chart 1 and 2 give a detailed account of India's Gross Capital Formation over a period of time. Chart 1 shows which sector the capital is getting concentrated and chart 2 show the base of capital formation. So, the purpose of putting public capital upfront in this critical context is unrealistic, and apart from that Niti Aayog does not propose any plan or project for the government to intervene in the business of achieving higher growth rate.

If NITI Aayog wants to push up public investment, it has to change its policies. It has to include more sector-oriented public investment plans, for instance, agriculture where capital formation is taking place unlike other sectors. Only government can invest here and it is true that public invesesment is also declining over a period of time. And it also proves that GFCF is concentrated in the private sector and household sector.

There must be an action plan to boost pubic capital formation if we want to achieve the expected growth; however, it is a known fact that such a massive investment plan by the government is not anybody's agenda. Public invesment pertains to development project and plans. It could be a challenge when there is no planning taking place at the government level.

Similarly, the GDP growth envisaged in the report is unrealistic. It wants to increase tax GDP ratio to 22 percent by 2022 from the current 17 percent. However, the report depends on demonetisation and GST as the sources. The ability of GST to increase tax, GDP, is yet to be proven since the final assessment on the impact of GST is still not assessed. NITI Aayog's suggestion for the agriculture sector talks about business-oriented solutions. The sector is labour-oriented and hence suggestions by the policy think-tank such as skill enhancement, Aadhar-based payment delivery and transparency in labour inspection, etc may be difficult for a farmer to understand.

It is not limited to only agriculture but for all other sectors too. NITI Aayog proposes administrative reforms and does not put forward any strategic and structural changes. In industry, its major proposals is to have single-window system for ease of business across the country and not to put forward any specific plan for small and medium-scale industries which are reeling under a crisis after demonetisation and GST. It is really surprising that a government agency can come up a stratgic suggestion without any proper and feasible action plan.

Poverty and the poor get less reference in the report. It has referred to the poor in the context of Pradhan Manthri Awas Yojana housing scheme and Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana -- an insurance scheme with a healthcare cover of Rs 30,000 for a family of five members living below the poverty line. It proposes to continue the scheme with some financial provisions to meet outpatient expenditures. So, how can one trust such a strategic plan which talks only administrative reforms and endorses the government project without even proposing a critical evaluation to see the impact? It seems that NITI Aayog has lost its direction and is limited to a simple consulting firm which is not needed for an economy like India.

Alleging that the inspections by the government teams are ""motivated"" and ""an attempt just to tarnish the image of civic bodies"", the education committees of both south and north corporations have directed their officials not to let the ""survey teams enter the school premises"".

The government has asked Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) to assess each government, private, and municipal school on parameters like safety, teaching-learning facilities and community engagement. DCPCR is the statutory body to monitor implementation of rights of children and Right To Education Act, 2009 in the city.

The chairperson of the south corporation's education committee, Nandini Sharma, said the House had already rejected the inspection proposal. ""The survey teams had taken permission from us three months ago after showing us a set of questions. But now they have completely changed their track, which is unacceptable."" These inspections also disrupt entire work in schools, she added. ""No permission is sought from the principals and committee members barge into classrooms,"" she alleged.

Sharma's counterpart in the north corporation, Ritu Goel, said she had directed education officials to discontinue the visits with immediate effect. ""We had agreed to the exercise keeping child welfare in mind but the government is using it politically to malign the image of corporation schools."" Goel said she had received complaints from 20-25 teachers about the conduct of inspection teams.

The little kids are asked ""motivated"" questions, Goel alleged. ""Which brave child gets beaten by teachers? Which good student brings the tea for teachers? When a teacher is talking on mobile phones then you don't disturb them -- such types of questions are being asked,"" she said. ""The purpose is only to create a controversy.""

Showing the files about the ""agreed-upon"" questions, she added that the survey was meant to be about issues like safety of kids, guard rooms and visitors in the school. Corporation officials were also asked to provide details of students' family members but they are yet to send any information.

DCPCR member Anurag Kundu, however, claimed that the corporations couldn't legally stop the inspections. ""DCPCR is not under Delhi government and it is an independent statutory body. It is legally obligated to monitor implementation of RTE Act in all schools. The education committee has no authority to stop us,"" he said.

Kundu said the teams were asking the questions agreed upon in joint meetings in September. ""The questions cited by the education committees are not being asked. Only questions like how do you feel in classroom? Are you allowed to ask questions,"" he added.

He also pointed out that Quality Council of India, a central government agency, had been selected as the project management agency for the survey."

According to school records, the GA High School has more than 1,500 students in Classes IX to XII, and castes of each student is mentioned against their names on attendance sheets, reportedly to ""help the school administration to easily identify beneficiaries"" of all government schemes.

The attendance sheets have been seized by the Vaishali District Secondary Education Office.

Under various government schemes, a Class IX student is entitled to Rs 3,000 to purchase a bicycle; girl students from Classes IX to XII are entitled to Rs 1,000 for uniform and Rs 150 for sanitary napkins; students from Classes IX to XII are also entitled to Rs 1800 scholarship annually.

All the benefits are, however, given only against 75 per cent attendance.

Claiming that the report of compliance on government schemes are sought every month, and at times fortnightly, the school's in-charge principal, Meena Kumari, said: ""My predecessor, Phool Mohammed Ansari, had introduced segregation on caste lines in attendance register in 2014 and I have been following it because it has comes as handy to identify beneficiaries and prepare the reports.""

Dismissing the allegations of ""dividing students on caste lines"", she, said: ""One should know that we have only six classrooms, which can accommodate maximum 600 students.

While all students of the school usually come to the institute together and leave the premises together, they are made to sit in different classrooms as per their castes and religions according to a system followed for the past four years, said sources. Students from Dalit and Muslim communities are reportedly never allowed to visit other classrooms.

There are also separate sections and rooms for students belonging to Hindu and Muslim communities at the school, said sources.

Teachers Registry may be installed digitally so as to maintain the actual position of the required Teachers in the GPS, GMS, GHS across the State to balance the staffing pattern and also to check the excess and shortage Teachers in the School. While it can also help in reckoning the actual vacancies caused to be filled up without any discrepancies.

2. Teachers Code with a Working Gown or Working Identity Card may be introduced to Teachers for public recognition in honoring as Professionals. And by doing so it will incline to prevent from manipulative practices of keeping proxy Teacher in the School.

3. Teachers recruitment policy may be taken up on regular basis or conduct at least twice in a year to avoid all sorts of frequent agitation/strikes for want of backlog service regularization which is endless that hampers the daily classroom routine time and again.

4. Primary Education is the backbone of a child's foundation and this basic education must be prioritized by evolving an academic viable policy more of creativity and play way methods of child centered approach to bring about quality education. And it requires a major amalgamation in this sector to carry forward an effective and sustainable teaching learning process which can enable the child to pursue higher education at all level because that is the gate way of building the child's educational future career.

5. An Academic Cell for Primary and Elementary Education may be separately function in the Directorate and promote supervision and monitoring the academic performance of the GPS and GMS in particular. As it is the fundamental basis which can excel in Secondary and Higher Secondary Education ie, HSLC/HSSLC results and therefore more weightage can be given at this stage of primary and elementary targeting to minimize or eliminate the nil result Schools in public exams instead of blaming one another.

6. Regular School inspection with a feed back by the Inspecting Officer may be taken up as a tool for immediate measures towards academic improvement besides cleaning up all

Kinds of unwanted prevalent practices like sharing salaries, Teachers absenteeism, false enrolment of the School etc. While that may lead to minimize the worries and burden of Unions/ NGOs to do the checking indeed this responsibility is being vested to the department officers to carry out periodically.

7. Regular DPC may be held for timely promotion to fill up all the resultant vacancies of Asst. Headmaster, Headmaster at the School level and JEO, SDEO, DEO, the field officers in the Sub. Divisional / District level to upkeep the continuity of coordinating in managing their establishment courteously because these are correlated functionaries as far as administrative aspects are concerned.

8. Teachers Award may be streamlined by giving responsibility to the Heads of the School to identify only deserving genuine Teachers and not by the individual Teachers concerned to initiate by himself/ herself to be awarded. The number of State Teachers Award may be fixed and distributed to all the District on quota wise to do justice to all teaching community in the State. Besides due facilities be accorded and their services can be fully utilized as an outstanding meritorious Teachers in the department.

9. As far as possible Teachers training can be of an oriented motivational teaching learning skill and preferably during vacation so as not to disturb the regular classes.

10. The different formats related to State School Employees bio data/ particulars may be limited to only one and formulate as Unified School Education Format (USEF) inclusive of all expected requirements to fill in such as Staff position, Students enrolment and other physical related matters like building, classrooms, offices, furniture's, fencing, toilets, safe drinking water etc enabling for accessibility use by DoSE, NBSE, SCERT through data base to do away filling of numerous School formats.

11. Instead of opening new Schools the existing Schools may be standardized both in the academic performance and infrastructural facilities to really experience the quality education in the state with the available resources.

12. The Government may plan for observance of Year of Academic Excellence for School Education Department."

This information was given by the Minister of State for Human Resource Development Satya Pal Singh in a written reply to the Lok Sabha on Monday.

The CBSE has announced that under Rule-11.1 of the revamped affiliation by-laws, no school shall be affiliated to the Board without inspection by a committee of not less than two members, at least one of whom has to be an academician.

Applications for affiliation will take less time for disposal under the new process, which is entirely online from application to final decision, said Singh.

Some of factors which will be taken into consideration during the inspection by the committee are the number of teachers and their qualifications, academic standards, and the process of teaching.

Meanwhile, Singh also informed the House that as per the All India Survey on Higher Education Report 2017-18, there has been a huge increase in the total enrolment for Ph D programmes in the last four years.

In 2014-15, the total number of Ph D enrolments were 117301, which increased to 161412 in 2017-18."

Government-run rehabilitation centres for women are being used in some cases to confine girls and young women who have eloped, while many other centres have failed to give care to the survivors of sexual assault and mentally challenged inmates, according to a survey done by the National Commission for Women (NCW) of 26 centres in four States.

The Women and Child Development Ministry runs Swadhar Greh as short-stay or temporary rehabilitation centres for adult women survivors of domestic violence and trafficking, as well as for women who have nowhere to go after being freed from jail.

The survey, conducted in August and September, found that most of these centres were not being used for the beneficiaries, and often functioned as hostels for school girls and working women; in some cases, girls and women were housed there without an order from a court or a child welfare committee.

The Ministry has now written to all the States to submit a list of Swadhar Greh after verifying their performance. They have also been asked prepare a quarterly progress report on the condition of the shelters and conduct surprise visits. The Centre has also asked that CCTVs be installed and entry of men restricted in the centres.

A home at Bhadoi in Uttar Pradesh had girls in the age group of 15-19, and most of them had eloped. The homes in Mirzaganj and Allahabad were found to provide shelter to its inmates without a court order. They also had mentally challenged women, who were rolling on the floor at the time of inspection, but there was no sign of treatment given to them.

A centre at Chikkaballapur in Karnataka was found to have a rape survivor under severe mental trauma, but it had no provision for her special care. There was no counselling for inmates suffering from depression. It housed girls who had eloped, but wanted to return to their partners.

A victim of human-trafficking was an HIV patient but a shelter in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, failed to provide her access to treatment. The report said she wanted to return to her family but was forced to stay. Many other inmates wanted to return home, but the shelter did not pay heed to their requests. In a Cuttack facility, a third of the victims were mentally challenged who needed to be shifted to a mental asylum.

Two centres in 24 Paraganas in West Bengal were found to be operating as a hostel for school girls who were in touch with their parents, the study said."
