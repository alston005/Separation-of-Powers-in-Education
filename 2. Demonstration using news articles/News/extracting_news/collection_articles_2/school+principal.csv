The Government of Bihar has now ordered action against the principal of the school.

Vaishali District Magistrate Rajeev Roshan said that the reports of the caste-wise seating arrangement were found to be true, following which action was ordered against the principal.

According to a local source, the GA High School in Lalganj Vaishali, which has over 1,000 students enrolled in Classes IX and X, divided the students on the basis of their religion and caste and asked them to sit in separate classrooms accordingly. Their attendance registers also mention their caste along with their names, so as to ensure that all students stuck to the religion and caste-based division while sitting in the classrooms.

""The issue came to the fore when some students of the school raised an objection to the caste-based segregation, following which the district administration probed the matter and ordered action against the principal, Meena Kumari,"" the source added.

Kumari, in her defence, said she only continued with the seating plan decided by her predecessor as it was convenient to implement the various welfare schemes of the government if the students were seated accordingly. She also denied that the students had ever been discriminated due to their religion or caste.

The local officials of the education department have sent a detailed report on the matter to the senior officials for information and further recommendation.

The Government of Bihar not just provides scholarships but also funds for buying the uniform and cycle to the students, most of which is now directly transferred to their bank accounts, if the students have 75% attendance."

Justice Fateh Deep Singh's verdict, which upholds the Chandigarh district court's decision of asking the

school administrator to come and face charges under the Pocso Act, is meant to deter all those school managements that sit on child-abuse complaints.

The man had been troubling a milk contractor and asking for commission for clearning his bills. The aggrieved party used to supply milk under the Annapurna scheme for school children. The ACB has registered a case and is investigating the school principal.

According to ACB sleuths, the accused principal has been identified as one Gamer Lal, a resident of Udaipur, currently posted as principal of government primary school at Tekri near Udaipur.

""Recently the Udaipur wing of the ACB received a complaint against the Principal. In his grievance, the complainant - identified as Hira Lal, a resident of Agarwal Colony at Udaipur - claimed he used to supply milk for the children studying at the primary school at Tekri,"" ACB officials investigating the case said.

All are enrolled at the Presbyterian Secondary School in Bamenda, capital of Cameroon's Northwest Region -- one of two areas where surging anglophone separatist militancy has been met with a brutal crackdown by authorities.

Communications Minister Issa Bakary Tchiroma said ""all 79 students"" seized on Monday ""have been released,"" without giving details of the circumstances under which they were set free.

The students were kidnapped with their principal, a teacher and a driver, but Tchiroma said their fate was not yet clear.

Separately, the Presbyterian Church, which runs the school, said that 11 other pupils were taken on 31 October but they have now been freed.

News of their disappearance had been withheld to enable negotiations with the kidnappers, the church said.

It said the school, located on the outskirts of Bamenda where there is a negligible presence by the security forces, would remain shuttered ""until further notice"".

On Tuesday, a leading member of the church, Reverend Foki Samuel Forba, said he had been negotiating with the kidnappers, who were not demanding a ransom but the closure of the school.

The kidnappings were the first such mass abductions seen in Cameroon and coincide with an upsurge of political tensions in the majority French-speaking country.

The release was announced a day after Cameroon's 85-year-old President Paul Biya was sworn in for a seventh term in office.

A six-minute video seen by AFP on Monday, but which could not be confirmed independently, showed 11 boys apparently aged about 15 giving their identity and name of the school in English, and adding that they were abducted by the ""Amba Boys"" -- a name for anglophone separatists.

Unprecedented in Cameroon

Such mass kidnappings were previously unknown in Cameroon, though they are notorious in neighbouring Nigeria.

The Islamist group Boko Haram snatched more than 200 schoolgirls from Nigeria's Borno state town of Chibok in April 2014, sparking worldwide condemnation and the #FreeOurGirls movement on Twitter.

Some 107 girls have since been released or found, but the Islamist group abducted scores more schoolgirls from the neighbouring Yobe state in February this year.

Cameroon's Biya on Tuesday promised to pursue policies of decentralisation to address ""frustrations and aspirations"" in English-speaking regions.

It was his first public acknowledgement of resentments that have spilled over in the country's anglophone Northwest and neighbouring Southwest Region.

In 2016, anger at perceived discrimination in education, the judiciary and the economy fanned demands for autonomy in the anglophone regions.

But Biya refused any concessions and a year later, radicals declared an independent state -- the ""Republic of Ambazonia"" -- taking up arms soon after.

Separatists have since attacked troops and police, boycotted and torched schools and attacked other state symbols, prompting a severe official crackdown.

At the start of the school year in September, several secondary schools were attacked, a headmaster was killed and a teacher was badly wounded.

At least 400 civilians and more than 175 members of the security forces have been killed in the year to September, according to a toll compiled by non-governmental organisations.

More than 300,000 others have fled the violence, some crossing into neighbouring Nigeria.

Around a fifth of Cameroon's 22 million people are English-speaking -- a minority whose presence dates back to the colonial period.

The principal and a teacher of a government girls school in Punjab's Fazilka district have been suspended for allegedly stripping some students to check who was wearing a sanitary pad, after a soiled one was found in the school toilet, an official spokesperson said Tuesday.

The orders were issued on Monday night after Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh received an inquiry report, which found the incident to be a case of ""gross negligence, indifference and insensitivity"" on the part of the teachers of the school, he said.

School headmaster Kuldeep Kaur and teacher Jyoti have been suspended on the directives of the chief minister, the spokesperson said.

A charge sheet will also be issued under Rule 8 of the Conduct Rules against Kaur and Jyoti, who have been placed under suspension, he said.

The incident, which came to light last week, was brought to the chief minister's notice after a video showed students crying and complaining that they had been stripped by the teachers in the school premises. The teachers were reportedly trying to find out who was wearing a sanitary pad, after a soiled one was found in the school toilet.

The chief minister has issued strict instructions to show no laxity in the matter as the respect and dignity of the students could not be allowed to be compromised at any cost.

Singh has reiterated his government's commitment to providing a favourable environment for education and empowerment of girls.

The chief minister had on Friday ordered a probe into the allegations of stripping made by some of the students and their parents. The chief minister had also directed Secretary Education Krishan Kumar to complete the investigation by Monday and take further action if necessary.

The inquiry report said the students were checked twice on the directions and with full knowledge of the school principal and the teacher.

The girls were checked with their clothes on the first time and then the two women got them checked again by senior girl students of class 8 with their clothes taken off, as per the SDM Abohar, at whose office the statements of Kuldeep and Jyoti were recorded on Monday.

During the first checking, which was undertaken in the mid-day meal kitchen, Kaur was standing outside during the process, the inquiry committee members, District Education Officer Fazilka Kulwant Singh, Station House Officer Sadar Abohar Angrej Singh and District Child Protection Officer Fazilka Ritu, have stated in their report, the spokesperson said.

The committee unanimously agreed to the ""indifference and insensitivity"" towards women's physical dignity expressed by the school staff.

The report further said that though there may not have been any intent of physical/sexual assault, the teachers, at the outset, were found to be ""negligent and careless""."

Three former students of a Catholic school in Chandigarh have levelled sexual harassment charges against the former principal and co-founding director of the school on social media.

Harold Carver, who is the principal of the school has been accused of sexual harassment by Manraj Singh.

Manraj, a student of the 1980 batch, has called Carver a sexual predator on his Facebook page. He said that he and his hostel mates were aware of the principal's activities. He mentioned that he was a Class 7 student when the accused called him to his office and initiated an uncomfortable conversation with him.

Earlier, a 42-year-old Delhi based journalist Sanjay Austa had accused Harold Carver of sexually harassing him and his hostel mates when he was a student in the school. Austa had said in his blog that he was a Class 9 student when Carver abused him in his office.

""Harold Carver is a sexual predator whose choice was children. Ever since I learnt that Harold Carver was back in Chandigarh, I started getting worried. How many children would he have abused in his entire career? How many like me who knew he was a pedophile were silenced? How many kids couldn't have walked out of his office the way I did that day,"" said Sanjay Austa.

However, it is not for the first time that Harold has been accused of sexual harassment by his students. Carver was also sentenced to prison for one month 30 years ago for allegedly abusing half a dozen students. Navin Chhetri, who was one of the students had also appeared in the court. The complaint was later withdrawn.

The principal of a convent school, who has been arrested for alleged sexual harassment of a 14-year-old student, has told police that he had already been awarded punishment by a 'religious authority' in Poland which had asked him to remain under house arrest for three years.

In a statement made before a city court seeking his remand, the police submitted that the arrested principal had claimed that an 'internal inquiry' had been conducted by a bishop from a school in Solapur, following which the punishment was awarded to him. It was not clear which 'religious authority' the principal was referring to. Police said they are still in the process of verifying the claims.

The principal is accused of showing pornographic videos on his mobile phone to the youngster in his office and in the school restroom in March this year. The victim had complained to a female counsellor in the school who allegedly asked him to remain silent about the incident. For this reason, the counsellor is also a co-accused in the police case.

The matter reached police after the father of the victim registered an FIR at the Wanavdi police station on September 14. Police has invoked sections of the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, besides those of Indian Penal Code, against the principal and the counsellor.

In the remand report submitted to the court on Thursday, the police claimed that the principal had been staying at a building named 'Carmel Heaven' in Wagholi, apparently under house arrest, but fled the spot as soon as he came to know of the FIR. He was arrested on Wednesday while he was on his way from Chembur in Mumbai to Ahmedabad.

The police told a special court today that its investigation so far had revealed that two more boys had been similarly harassed by the principal.

Seeking his custody, the remand report submitted to the court says that the principal had used his own mobile phone to show the pornographic content to the victim and that the police was still to recover this phone from the accused. It also says that the police needed to investigate his claims about 'internal inquiry' and punishment from a 'religious authority' in a foreign country. The police said it also wanted to probe the role of the co-accused counsellor and whether anyone else had helped to keep the crime hidden.

The court remanded the accused principal to police custody till September 23.

Besides the accused principal, even the schoolteachers are facing allegations of being party to the alleged sexual abuse of other girl students. It has been alleged that certain teachers, especially the class in-charges, ignored the complaints made to them by students.

The incident came to light on Thursday, when Sonipat police registered two separate cases at Kharkhoda police station. The registration of cases was consequent to the visit of the DSP Kharkhoda and a senior cop from crime branch to school premises on the basis of a report in a vernacular daily.

Initially, the principal has been arrested in the first case registered against him on the complaint of the victim. The second case has been registered on the complaint of the current principal, who has referred to the new report and sought a probe. According to the second FIR, the girl students were allegedly forced to have physical relations to get good grades or remarks like 'Very Good' and made to go to hotels for this. The FIR states that in one instance, the principal took a girl to a room for an extra class, and in another a teacher allegedly forced a girl into relations after she got good grades.

Sonipat SP Prateeksha Godara confirmed the arrest of the principal while adding that he would be interrogated in the second case as well.

The Government of Bihar has now ordered action against the principal of the school.

Vaishali District Magistrate Rajeev Roshan said that the reports of the caste-wise seating arrangement were found to be true, following which action was ordered against the principal.

According to a local source, the GA High School in Lalganj Vaishali, which has over 1,000 students enrolled in Classes IX and X, divided the students on the basis of their religion and caste and asked them to sit in separate classrooms accordingly. Their attendance registers also mention their caste along with their names, so as to ensure that all students stuck to the religion and caste-based division while sitting in the classrooms.

""The issue came to the fore when some students of the school raised an objection to the caste-based segregation, following which the district administration probed the matter and ordered action against the principal, Meena Kumari,"" the source added.

Kumari, in her defence, said she only continued with the seating plan decided by her predecessor as it was convenient to implement the various welfare schemes of the government if the students were seated accordingly. She also denied that the students had ever been discriminated due to their religion or caste.

The local officials of the education department have sent a detailed report on the matter to the senior officials for information and further recommendation.

Justice Fateh Deep Singh's verdict, which upholds the Chandigarh district court's decision of asking the

school administrator to come and face charges under the Pocso Act, is meant to deter all those school managements that sit on child-abuse complaints.

The verdict says that the summoning orders of August 5, 2017 (issued by an additional sessions judge who is also judge of the special court) appear to have missed this material point. For the sake of justice, the high court deems it ""essential to exercise the powers under Section 482 of the CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure) and direct the court where the matter is pending to ensure that even the principal, who had the knowledge of this incident..., is not let off.""

""The accused also assured him that once the money is handed over, he would clear all his bills,"" officials said. When several attempts at getting the principal to forego the commission failed, the complainant approached the ACB for help.

""After the complaint was registered, a bid to verify the same was initiated. When the demand was verified, it was decided to lay a trap and nab the man red-handed,' an official said. On Tuesday afternoon the ball was set rolling.

The complainant was handed over the commission money and sent to the principal's office. As soon as the money exchanged hands, the complainant gave a signal to the ACB sleuths who raided the school premises and nabbed the principal red-handed while he was collecting the money. A case under Prevention of Corruption Act has been registered in the matter and further action is being taken, the official said."

All are enrolled at the Presbyterian Secondary School in Bamenda, capital of Cameroon's Northwest Region -- one of two areas where surging anglophone separatist militancy has been met with a brutal crackdown by authorities.

Communications Minister Issa Bakary Tchiroma said ""all 79 students"" seized on Monday ""have been released,"" without giving details of the circumstances under which they were set free.

The students were kidnapped with their principal, a teacher and a driver, but Tchiroma said their fate was not yet clear.

Separately, the Presbyterian Church, which runs the school, said that 11 other pupils were taken on 31 October but they have now been freed.

News of their disappearance had been withheld to enable negotiations with the kidnappers, the church said.

It said the school, located on the outskirts of Bamenda where there is a negligible presence by the security forces, would remain shuttered ""until further notice"".

On Tuesday, a leading member of the church, Reverend Foki Samuel Forba, said he had been negotiating with the kidnappers, who were not demanding a ransom but the closure of the school.

The kidnappings were the first such mass abductions seen in Cameroon and coincide with an upsurge of political tensions in the majority French-speaking country.

The release was announced a day after Cameroon's 85-year-old President Paul Biya was sworn in for a seventh term in office.

A six-minute video seen by AFP on Monday, but which could not be confirmed independently, showed 11 boys apparently aged about 15 giving their identity and name of the school in English, and adding that they were abducted by the ""Amba Boys"" -- a name for anglophone separatists.

Unprecedented in Cameroon

Such mass kidnappings were previously unknown in Cameroon, though they are notorious in neighbouring Nigeria.

The Islamist group Boko Haram snatched more than 200 schoolgirls from Nigeria's Borno state town of Chibok in April 2014, sparking worldwide condemnation and the #FreeOurGirls movement on Twitter.

Some 107 girls have since been released or found, but the Islamist group abducted scores more schoolgirls from the neighbouring Yobe state in February this year.

Cameroon's Biya on Tuesday promised to pursue policies of decentralisation to address ""frustrations and aspirations"" in English-speaking regions.

It was his first public acknowledgement of resentments that have spilled over in the country's anglophone Northwest and neighbouring Southwest Region.

In 2016, anger at perceived discrimination in education, the judiciary and the economy fanned demands for autonomy in the anglophone regions.

But Biya refused any concessions and a year later, radicals declared an independent state -- the ""Republic of Ambazonia"" -- taking up arms soon after.

Separatists have since attacked troops and police, boycotted and torched schools and attacked other state symbols, prompting a severe official crackdown.

At the start of the school year in September, several secondary schools were attacked, a headmaster was killed and a teacher was badly wounded.

At least 400 civilians and more than 175 members of the security forces have been killed in the year to September, according to a toll compiled by non-governmental organisations.

More than 300,000 others have fled the violence, some crossing into neighbouring Nigeria.

Around a fifth of Cameroon's 22 million people are English-speaking -- a minority whose presence dates back to the colonial period.

The principal and a teacher of a government girls school in Punjab's Fazilka district have been suspended for allegedly stripping some students to check who was wearing a sanitary pad, after a soiled one was found in the school toilet, an official spokesperson said Tuesday.

The orders were issued on Monday night after Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh received an inquiry report, which found the incident to be a case of ""gross negligence, indifference and insensitivity"" on the part of the teachers of the school, he said.

School headmaster Kuldeep Kaur and teacher Jyoti have been suspended on the directives of the chief minister, the spokesperson said.

A charge sheet will also be issued under Rule 8 of the Conduct Rules against Kaur and Jyoti, who have been placed under suspension, he said.

The incident, which came to light last week, was brought to the chief minister's notice after a video showed students crying and complaining that they had been stripped by the teachers in the school premises. The teachers were reportedly trying to find out who was wearing a sanitary pad, after a soiled one was found in the school toilet.

The chief minister has issued strict instructions to show no laxity in the matter as the respect and dignity of the students could not be allowed to be compromised at any cost.

Singh has reiterated his government's commitment to providing a favourable environment for education and empowerment of girls.

The chief minister had on Friday ordered a probe into the allegations of stripping made by some of the students and their parents. The chief minister had also directed Secretary Education Krishan Kumar to complete the investigation by Monday and take further action if necessary.

The inquiry report said the students were checked twice on the directions and with full knowledge of the school principal and the teacher.

The girls were checked with their clothes on the first time and then the two women got them checked again by senior girl students of class 8 with their clothes taken off, as per the SDM Abohar, at whose office the statements of Kuldeep and Jyoti were recorded on Monday.

During the first checking, which was undertaken in the mid-day meal kitchen, Kaur was standing outside during the process, the inquiry committee members, District Education Officer Fazilka Kulwant Singh, Station House Officer Sadar Abohar Angrej Singh and District Child Protection Officer Fazilka Ritu, have stated in their report, the spokesperson said.

The committee unanimously agreed to the ""indifference and insensitivity"" towards women's physical dignity expressed by the school staff.

The report further said that though there may not have been any intent of physical/sexual assault, the teachers, at the outset, were found to be ""negligent and careless""."

Three former students of a Catholic school in Chandigarh have levelled sexual harassment charges against the former principal and co-founding director of the school on social media.

Harold Carver, who is the principal of the school has been accused of sexual harassment by Manraj Singh.

Manraj, a student of the 1980 batch, has called Carver a sexual predator on his Facebook page. He said that he and his hostel mates were aware of the principal's activities. He mentioned that he was a Class 7 student when the accused called him to his office and initiated an uncomfortable conversation with him.

Earlier, a 42-year-old Delhi based journalist Sanjay Austa had accused Harold Carver of sexually harassing him and his hostel mates when he was a student in the school. Austa had said in his blog that he was a Class 9 student when Carver abused him in his office.

""Harold Carver is a sexual predator whose choice was children. Ever since I learnt that Harold Carver was back in Chandigarh, I started getting worried. How many children would he have abused in his entire career? How many like me who knew he was a pedophile were silenced? How many kids couldn't have walked out of his office the way I did that day,"" said Sanjay Austa.

Another former student Navin Chhetri, who is currently in Colorado, US, has also accused Harold of sexual harassment.

However, it is not for the first time that Harold has been accused of sexual harassment by his students. Carver was also sentenced to prison for one month 30 years ago for allegedly abusing half a dozen students. Navin Chhetri, who was one of the students had also appeared in the court. The complaint was later withdrawn.

The school management has refuted the allegations against Harold Carver saying that he is a ""man of intense integrity"" and accusations levelled against him are false, baseless and extremely hurtful.

Harold Carver has also termed the allegations as baseless.

""I have an unblemished record and cannot even imagine committing such an act. I sanguinely feel that the whole game is to malign the reputation of the school,"" Harold Carver said.

The principal of a convent school, who has been arrested for alleged sexual harassment of a 14-year-old student, has told police that he had already been awarded punishment by a 'religious authority' in Poland which had asked him to remain under house arrest for three years.

In a statement made before a city court seeking his remand, the police submitted that the arrested principal had claimed that an 'internal inquiry' had been conducted by a bishop from a school in Solapur, following which the punishment was awarded to him. It was not clear which 'religious authority' the principal was referring to. Police said they are still in the process of verifying the claims.

The principal is accused of showing pornographic videos on his mobile phone to the youngster in his office and in the school restroom in March this year. The victim had complained to a female counsellor in the school who allegedly asked him to remain silent about the incident. For this reason, the counsellor is also a co-accused in the police case.

The matter reached police after the father of the victim registered an FIR at the Wanavdi police station on September 14. Police has invoked sections of the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, besides those of Indian Penal Code, against the principal and the counsellor.

In the remand report submitted to the court on Thursday, the police claimed that the principal had been staying at a building named 'Carmel Heaven' in Wagholi, apparently under house arrest, but fled the spot as soon as he came to know of the FIR. He was arrested on Wednesday while he was on his way from Chembur in Mumbai to Ahmedabad.

The police told a special court today that its investigation so far had revealed that two more boys had been similarly harassed by the principal.

Seeking his custody, the remand report submitted to the court says that the principal had used his own mobile phone to show the pornographic content to the victim and that the police was still to recover this phone from the accused. It also says that the police needed to investigate his claims about 'internal inquiry' and punishment from a 'religious authority' in a foreign country. The police said it also wanted to probe the role of the co-accused counsellor and whether anyone else had helped to keep the crime hidden.

The court remanded the accused principal to police custody till September 23.

According to a local source, the GA High School in Lalganj Vaishali, which has over 1,000 students enrolled in Classes IX and X, divided the students on the basis of their religion and caste and asked them to sit in separate classrooms accordingly. Their attendance registers also mention their caste along with their names, so as to ensure that all students stuck to the religion and caste-based division while sitting in the classrooms.

""The issue came to the fore when some students of the school raised an objection to the caste-based segregation, following which the district administration probed the matter and ordered action against the principal, Meena Kumari,"" the source added.

Kumari, in her defence, said she only continued with the seating plan decided by her predecessor as it was convenient to implement the various welfare schemes of the government if the students were seated accordingly. She also denied that the students had ever been discriminated due to their religion or caste.

The local officials of the education department have sent a detailed report on the matter to the senior officials for information and further recommendation.

Justice Fateh Deep Singh's verdict, which upholds the Chandigarh district court's decision of asking the

school administrator to come and face charges under the Pocso Act, is meant to deter all those school managements that sit on child-abuse complaints.

Even though the district court had not summoned the principal, the high court ordered the local court to summon her as well. The verdict says that the summoning orders of August 5, 2017 (issued by an additional sessions judge who is also judge of the special court) appear to have missed this material point. For the sake of justice, the high court deems it ""essential to exercise the powers under Section 482 of the CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure) and direct the court where the matter is pending to ensure that even the principal, who had the knowledge of this incident..., is not let off.""

Dismissing the petition of the school administrator against his summoning to face prosecution, justice Singh observed that since the matter was brought to the notice of the school authorities, the administrator's duty was to ensure due redress, in matters concerning child abuse especially. The court observed: ""He (the school administrator) cannot hide behind the facade of lack of knowledge or information.""

So that matters like these are not brushed under the carpet and the purpose of the Pocso Act is met by all means, the high court has said that the district magistrate and the UT director of school education must fulfil their obligations under UN convention and Section 43 (public awareness of the law) of the Pocso Act."

The man had been troubling a milk contractor and asking for commission for clearning his bills. The aggrieved party used to supply milk under the Annapurna scheme for school children. The ACB has registered a case and is investigating the school principal.

According to ACB sleuths, the accused principal has been identified as one Gamer Lal, a resident of Udaipur, currently posted as principal of government primary school at Tekri near Udaipur.

""Recently the Udaipur wing of the ACB received a complaint against the Principal. In his grievance, the complainant - identified as Hira Lal, a resident of Agarwal Colony at Udaipur - claimed he used to supply milk for the children studying at the primary school at Tekri,"" ACB officials investigating the case said. This was being done under the Annapurna Scheme floated by the Vasundhara Raje government under which schoolkids are provided with free milk.

However, over the past several weeks he had stopped receiving his payments for the milk supplied to the school. When the contractor approached the principal to inquire about the non-payment of his bills, the school principal demanded Hira Lal pay him Rs 8,500 as commission, instead of making the payment.

""The accused also assured him that once the money is handed over, he would clear all his bills,"" officials said. When several attempts at getting the principal to forego the commission failed, the complainant approached the ACB for help.

""After the complaint was registered, a bid to verify the same was initiated. When the demand was verified, it was decided to lay a trap and nab the man red-handed,' an official said. On Tuesday afternoon the ball was set rolling.

The complainant was handed over the commission money and sent to the principal's office. As soon as the money exchanged hands, the complainant gave a signal to the ACB sleuths who raided the school premises and nabbed the principal red-handed while he was collecting the money.

All are enrolled at the Presbyterian Secondary School in Bamenda, capital of Cameroon's Northwest Region -- one of two areas where surging anglophone separatist militancy has been met with a brutal crackdown by authorities.

Communications Minister Issa Bakary Tchiroma said ""all 79 students"" seized on Monday ""have been released,"" without giving details of the circumstances under which they were set free.

The students were kidnapped with their principal, a teacher and a driver, but Tchiroma said their fate was not yet clear.

Separately, the Presbyterian Church, which runs the school, said that 11 other pupils were taken on 31 October but they have now been freed.

News of their disappearance had been withheld to enable negotiations with the kidnappers, the church said.

It said the school, located on the outskirts of Bamenda where there is a negligible presence by the security forces, would remain shuttered ""until further notice"".

On Tuesday, a leading member of the church, Reverend Foki Samuel Forba, said he had been negotiating with the kidnappers, who were not demanding a ransom but the closure of the school.

The kidnappings were the first such mass abductions seen in Cameroon and coincide with an upsurge of political tensions in the majority French-speaking country.

The release was announced a day after Cameroon's 85-year-old President Paul Biya was sworn in for a seventh term in office.

A six-minute video seen by AFP on Monday, but which could not be confirmed independently, showed 11 boys apparently aged about 15 giving their identity and name of the school in English, and adding that they were abducted by the ""Amba Boys"" -- a name for anglophone separatists.

Unprecedented in Cameroon

Such mass kidnappings were previously unknown in Cameroon, though they are notorious in neighbouring Nigeria.

The Islamist group Boko Haram snatched more than 200 schoolgirls from Nigeria's Borno state town of Chibok in April 2014, sparking worldwide condemnation and the #FreeOurGirls movement on Twitter.

Some 107 girls have since been released or found, but the Islamist group abducted scores more schoolgirls from the neighbouring Yobe state in February this year.

Cameroon's Biya on Tuesday promised to pursue policies of decentralisation to address ""frustrations and aspirations"" in English-speaking regions.

It was his first public acknowledgement of resentments that have spilled over in the country's anglophone Northwest and neighbouring Southwest Region.

In 2016, anger at perceived discrimination in education, the judiciary and the economy fanned demands for autonomy in the anglophone regions.

But Biya refused any concessions and a year later, radicals declared an independent state -- the ""Republic of Ambazonia"" -- taking up arms soon after.

Separatists have since attacked troops and police, boycotted and torched schools and attacked other state symbols, prompting a severe official crackdown.

At the start of the school year in September, several secondary schools were attacked, a headmaster was killed and a teacher was badly wounded.

At least 400 civilians and more than 175 members of the security forces have been killed in the year to September, according to a toll compiled by non-governmental organisations.

More than 300,000 others have fled the violence, some crossing into neighbouring Nigeria.

Around a fifth of Cameroon's 22 million people are English-speaking -- a minority whose presence dates back to the colonial period.

The principal and a teacher of a government girls school in Punjab's Fazilka district have been suspended for allegedly stripping some students to check who was wearing a sanitary pad, after a soiled one was found in the school toilet, an official spokesperson said Tuesday.

The orders were issued on Monday night after Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh received an inquiry report, which found the incident to be a case of ""gross negligence, indifference and insensitivity"" on the part of the teachers of the school, he said.

School headmaster Kuldeep Kaur and teacher Jyoti have been suspended on the directives of the chief minister, the spokesperson said.

A charge sheet will also be issued under Rule 8 of the Conduct Rules against Kaur and Jyoti, who have been placed under suspension, he said.

The incident, which came to light last week, was brought to the chief minister's notice after a video showed students crying and complaining that they had been stripped by the teachers in the school premises. The teachers were reportedly trying to find out who was wearing a sanitary pad, after a soiled one was found in the school toilet.

The chief minister has issued strict instructions to show no laxity in the matter as the respect and dignity of the students could not be allowed to be compromised at any cost.

Singh has reiterated his government's commitment to providing a favourable environment for education and empowerment of girls.

The chief minister had on Friday ordered a probe into the allegations of stripping made by some of the students and their parents. The chief minister had also directed Secretary Education Krishan Kumar to complete the investigation by Monday and take further action if necessary.

The inquiry report said the students were checked twice on the directions and with full knowledge of the school principal and the teacher.

The girls were checked with their clothes on the first time and then the two women got them checked again by senior girl students of class 8 with their clothes taken off, as per the SDM Abohar, at whose office the statements of Kuldeep and Jyoti were recorded on Monday.

During the first checking, which was undertaken in the mid-day meal kitchen, Kaur was standing outside during the process, the inquiry committee members, District Education Officer Fazilka Kulwant Singh, Station House Officer Sadar Abohar Angrej Singh and District Child Protection Officer Fazilka Ritu, have stated in their report, the spokesperson said.

The committee unanimously agreed to the ""indifference and insensitivity"" towards women's physical dignity expressed by the school staff.

The report further said that though there may not have been any intent of physical/sexual assault, the teachers, at the outset, were found to be ""negligent and careless""."

Three former students of a Catholic school in Chandigarh have levelled sexual harassment charges against the former principal and co-founding director of the school on social media.

Harold Carver, who is the principal of the school has been accused of sexual harassment by Manraj Singh.

Manraj, a student of the 1980 batch, has called Carver a sexual predator on his Facebook page. He said that he and his hostel mates were aware of the principal's activities. He mentioned that he was a Class 7 student when the accused called him to his office and initiated an uncomfortable conversation with him.

Earlier, a 42-year-old Delhi based journalist Sanjay Austa had accused Harold Carver of sexually harassing him and his hostel mates when he was a student in the school. Austa had said in his blog that he was a Class 9 student when Carver abused him in his office.

""Harold Carver is a sexual predator whose choice was children. Ever since I learnt that Harold Carver was back in Chandigarh, I started getting worried. How many children would he have abused in his entire career? How many like me who knew he was a pedophile were silenced? How many kids couldn't have walked out of his office the way I did that day,"" said Sanjay Austa.

Another former student Navin Chhetri, who is currently in Colorado, US, has also accused Harold of sexual harassment.

However, it is not for the first time that Harold has been accused of sexual harassment by his students. Carver was also sentenced to prison for one month 30 years ago for allegedly abusing half a dozen students. Navin Chhetri, who was one of the students had also appeared in the court. The complaint was later withdrawn.

The school management has refuted the allegations against Harold Carver saying that he is a ""man of intense integrity"" and accusations levelled against him are false, baseless and extremely hurtful.

Harold Carver has also termed the allegations as baseless.

""I have an unblemished record and cannot even imagine committing such an act. I sanguinely feel that the whole game is to malign the reputation of the school,"" Harold Carver said.

The school authorities came to know about the incident in the morning when the security guard of the morning shift reached the school and found the night guard tied to a chair. The police have scanned CCTVs installed in the school premises, in which seven miscreants were captured.

Karamjit said he was present at the gate when six miscreants barged in the school after scaling the compound wall from the school's rearside. Meanwhile, one of the accused had knocked at the main gate to distract him. ""When I went near the door to see who was knocking it, six other miscreants, who had already entered the school, attacked me with iron rods and sharp-edged weapons. They overpowered me and tied me to the chair with my turban,"" he said.

The SHO at Sidhwan Bet police station, sub-inspector Navdeep Singh, said the accused had directly entered the principal's office, remained in the school for 30 minutes, and escaped with cash. All the accused were bare- footed. The forensic science team has collected fingerprints of the robbers from the principal's office.

Navdeep further said that according to the school management, they had collected examination fee from students. Usually, they deposit cash in the bank on the same day, but due to a family function in the house of Manpreet Singh Brar, president of the school management committee, they kept the cash in the principal's office. An FIR against unidentified accused has been registered on Brar's statement."

The principal of a convent school, who has been arrested for alleged sexual harassment of a 14-year-old student, has told police that he had already been awarded punishment by a 'religious authority' in Poland which had asked him to remain under house arrest for three years.

In a statement made before a city court seeking his remand, the police submitted that the arrested principal had claimed that an 'internal inquiry' had been conducted by a bishop from a school in Solapur, following which the punishment was awarded to him. It was not clear which 'religious authority' the principal was referring to. Police said they are still in the process of verifying the claims.

The principal is accused of showing pornographic videos on his mobile phone to the youngster in his office and in the school restroom in March this year. The victim had complained to a female counsellor in the school who allegedly asked him to remain silent about the incident. For this reason, the counsellor is also a co-accused in the police case.

The matter reached police after the father of the victim registered an FIR at the Wanavdi police station on September 14. Police has invoked sections of the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, besides those of Indian Penal Code, against the principal and the counsellor.

In the remand report submitted to the court on Thursday, the police claimed that the principal had been staying at a building named 'Carmel Heaven' in Wagholi, apparently under house arrest, but fled the spot as soon as he came to know of the FIR. He was arrested on Wednesday while he was on his way from Chembur in Mumbai to Ahmedabad.

The police told a special court today that its investigation so far had revealed that two more boys had been similarly harassed by the principal.

Seeking his custody, the remand report submitted to the court says that the principal had used his own mobile phone to show the pornographic content to the victim and that the police was still to recover this phone from the accused. It also says that the police needed to investigate his claims about 'internal inquiry' and punishment from a 'religious authority' in a foreign country. The police said it also wanted to probe the role of the co-accused counsellor and whether anyone else had helped to keep the crime hidden.

The court remanded the accused principal to police custody till September 23.

The incident came to light on Thursday, when Sonipat police registered two separate cases at Kharkhoda police station. The registration of cases was consequent to the visit of the DSP Kharkhoda and a senior cop from crime branch to school premises on the basis of a report in a vernacular daily.

The second case has been registered on the complaint of the current principal, who has referred to the new report and sought a probe. According to the second FIR, the girl students were allegedly forced to have physical relations to get good grades or remarks like 'Very Good' and made to go to hotels for this. The FIR states that in one instance, the principal took a girl to a room for an extra class, and in another a teacher allegedly forced a girl into relations after she got good grades.

Sonipat SP Prateeksha Godara confirmed the arrest of the principal while adding that he would be interrogated in the second case as well.
