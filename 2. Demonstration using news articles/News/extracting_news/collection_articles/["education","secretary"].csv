EXPRESSING ""SERIOUS concern"" over the findings of an investigation by The Indian Express on student suicides in Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) Tuesday issued notice to the school education secretary in the HRD Ministry seeking a response within six weeks.

On December 24, 2018, The Indian Express reported that the central government's residential schools for talented rural children witnessed 49 student suicides from 2013 to 2017, including that of 25 Dalit and tribal students. The investigation also revealed that there are no trained counsellors on campus, and that it's largely left to ""overburdened"" teachers to look after the welfare of students.

Taking suo motu cognizance of the findings, the NHRC, headed by former Chief Justice of India H L Dattu, directed the ministry to submit its response on three aspects: whether trained counsellors are available on campus; if there is dedicated staff to ensure students are not left alone in their rooms; and whether students have access to emergency assistance through counselling over telephone and a suicide hotline service.

""The Commission has observed that the contents of the media report, if true, cannot be ignored or overlooked as this reported pattern of suicides by so many students in JNVs might still increase, if not checked in time with appropriate measures... The proportion of suicides of students from the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities is also a matter of concern for a society, which aspires for an inclusive growth,"" the NHRC said.

Citing the findings of The Indian Express investigation, NHRC said a total of 2.53 lakh students in the age group of nine to 19 were enrolled across roughly 600 JNVs for the year 2017 and that in the same year, the number of suicides touched 14."

And of the 2018 recruits who finished the 15-week foundation course last month, 2.16% took the CSE in Hindi.

Of the 370 new civil services recruits trained at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBNSAA) in Mussoorie, eight took the Civil Service Examination (CSE) in Hindi compared to 48 of 202 in 2013; five recruits studied at Hindi-medium universities; and 30 attended Hindi-medium schools.

Data obtained by The Indian Express show that since 2013, there has been a sharp dip not only in students taking the CSE in Hindi -- for services like the IAS, IPS and Indian Foreign Service -- but also in recruits who studied in either Hindi-medium universities or schools. According to the data, there is also a steady increase in students preferring English.

An analysis of the profiles of recruits who took the foundation course available on the LBNSAA website shows the decrease: while students took the CSE in Hindi accounted for nearly 17% in 2013, it stood at 2.11% in 2014, 4.28% in 2015, 3.45% in 2016, 4.06% in 2017. And of the 2018 recruits who finished the 15-week foundation course last month, 2.16% took the CSE in Hindi.

The sharp fall stems from reforms implemented in the CSE when the UPA government brought in the Civil Services Aptitude Test (CSAT) in 2011. Following a backlash in and outside Parliament, the compulsory CSAT Paper-2, comprising Maths and English comprehension, was made just a qualifying paper with effect from the CSE-2015.

Advertising

In 2013, the pattern of the CSE Mains was also changed. Instead of two optional subjects, only one subject was made optional and General Studies papers were increased from two to four. Experts believe this limited the space for students from Hindi-medium schools and universities.

Satyanand Mishra, who retired as Secretary, Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), the nodal department for UPSC and cadre controlling authority for IAS said: ""The quality of vernacular teaching and the number of academically bright students opting for their mother tongues in colleges and universities can be one more angle to look at. Besides, more middle-class small/medium town parents increasingly prefer an English-medium education for their children.""

Data show that in 2013, there were 48 -- or a quarter -- of 202 recruits at LBNSAA, who studied in Hindi-medium schools, 22 (or nearly 11%) studied at Hindi-medium universities and 34 (nearly 17%) took the CSE in the Hindi.

Before the CSAT was introduced, the performance of Hindi-medium students was a little better, according to data. Profiles of the LBNSAA recruits for 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005 show that the representation of students who took the CSE (written) in Hindi was between 12 and 15%. In 2008, for instance, 32 out of 239 students took the CSE in Hindi - over 14%.

Incidentally, of the 370 recruits at the foundation course in 2018, 280 have studied Science subjects including Engineering and Technology, Medicine, Pharmacy or pure sciences. Among them, as many as 149 were B.Tech graduates and 75 were B.E graduates. Only 55 were from Arts and Humanities while the remaining were from management and commerce. This follows the trend in 2017 when of 369 recruits, 287 were from Science fields and in 2016, when 280 of 377 had studied science subjects."

The report was to be prepared by Vidarbha Industries Association (VIA) in association with government departments. It was to be submitted to the CM in February 2017. However, shockingly it is yet to reach Fadnavis.

The term of BJP-Shiv Sena government will expire in October this year. Unless Fadnavis or at least a person from Vidarbha becomes the CM again, the report is likely to be put in cold storage. Thus, the industrialists and officials may have missed a golden opportunity for development of the two regions.

VIA had constituted 16 committees to study various sectors in the two backward regions. These committees submitted their report one by one in 2018. Anup Kumar then got it translated into Marathi. Some months ago, a local daily had published a serious of news articles on the summary of the report. No action has been taken since Kumar got transferred and the report is lying with the industrial association. It is seeking an appointment with Fadnavis to hand it over to him.

Initially, work on the report was done fast. Kumar held a daylong meeting with industrialists in VIA office. He then organized similar meetings in Amravati and Aurangabad. The principal secretary (industries) also held a daylong meeting with VIA office-bearers. After that the field work began. However, this was very slow.

The committee prepared a detailed questionnaire and provided it to the respective collectors. It contained questions like number of industries closed down, cases where land was refused to industries, persons registered at the employment exchange, etc. This information was collected and compiled by September 20, 2016. All the district and sector wise reports were to be presented to Anup Kumar, who was to then prepare a plan of action with the help of industrialists.

In mid-2017, VIA said that it had prepared the draft of the report. Sixteen sectors had been identified for development. These included defence, mining, ayurveda, minor forest produce, etc. The focus areas were skill and entrepreneurship development, industry and education interface, etc.

One of the concerns raised in the draft report was high-handedness of banks towards small and medium scale industries while recovering loans which had turned into non-performing assets (NPAs). The report claimed that while big fish went scot free, the small and medium scale industrialists had to face strict action."

And it's not a pretty sight for students of Gurugram, with only 55% managing to pass. The results were uploaded on the Saksham Haryana Education portal last week. The tests are conducted by the state education department to track and improve the learning ability of government school students.

Students of Mahendergarh topped with a pass percentage of 69%, with Yamunanagar bringing up the rear at 36%. English is the subject most students struggled with, especially in higher classes. Across the state, barely 35% students managed to clear it.

Satyanarayan Yadav, state secretary of Haryana School Teachers Association, said, ""Most students find it hard to learn English as they speak in Hindi. Effort is needed to ensure students improve their English scores."" In contrast, most students performed well in fine arts and music scoring overall 91% and 81%, respectively.

District elementary education officer Prem Lata Yadav said, ""From this year onwards, I'll ensure kids take their class tests seriously. I'm sure results will improve."" In the block-wise comparison of SAT scores for the district, Sohna scored 49%, Farrukhnagar 56%, Gurugram 57% and Pataudi 62%.

In Government Senior Secondary School, Khetawas, out of 18 students who appeared for the Class XII exam, only three passed. The principal said: ""As most students belong to families of migrant workers, they don't have the environment to study at home. How can they clear board exams on the basis of class teaching alone?""

The SAT results are shared with district education officers to evaluate performance of students and teachers, followed by classes under the learning enhancement programme to bridge gaps.

Besides, current capacity utilisation in traditional disciplines is just 40% as opposed to 60% seat occupancy in branches such as computer science and engineering, aerospace engineering and mechatronics.

Mains Question: Examine the challenges faced by higher education sector in India and discuss the impact of policy decisions taken to address these issues?(250 words)

As part of its initiatives to empower women, the Odisha government, last year, launched this scheme to provide free sanitary napkins to school girls across the state.

India is among the first five countries in the world, the first in Asia and the first among the biodiversity-rich megadiverse countries to have submitted the report.

The submission of national reports is a mandatory obligation on parties to international treaties, including the CBD. As a responsible nation, India has never reneged on its international commitments and has earlier submitted on time five national reports to the CBD.

The report provides an update of progress in achievement of 12 National Biodiversity Targets (NBT) developed under the convention process in line with the 20 global Aichi biodiversity targets.

At the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, world leaders agreed on a comprehensive strategy for ""sustainable development"" -- meeting our needs while ensuring that we leave a healthy and viable world for future generations. One of the key agreements adopted at Rio was the Convention on Biological Diversity.

The Convention on Biological Diversity is the international legal instrument for ""the conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources"" that has been ratified by 196 nations.

The 'Aichi Targets' were adopted by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) at its Nagoya conference. It is a short term plan provides a set of 20ambitious yet achievable targets, collectively known as the Aichi Targets. They can be divided into:

Strategic Goal A: Address the underlying causes of biodiversity loss by mainstreaming biodiversity across government and society.

Strategic Goal B: Reduce the direct pressures on biodiversity and promote sustainable use.

Strategic Goal C: To improve the status of biodiversity by safeguarding ecosystems, species and genetic diversity.

Strategic Goal D: Enhance the benefits to all from biodiversity and ecosystem services.

Strategic Goal E: Enhance implementation through participatory planning, knowledge management and capacity building.

Mains Question: Critically evaluate the implementation of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 which is meant to fulfil the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity.

For Prelims and Mains: OSIRIS-Rex mission and facts on asteroid bennu.

Context: NASA's OSIRIS-Rex spacecraft has set a new milestone in cosmic exploration by entering orbit around an asteroid, Bennu, the smallest object ever to be circled by a human-made spaceship.

OSIRIS-Rex is the first-ever US mission designed to visit an asteroid and return a sample of its dust back to Earth. The $800 million (roughly Rs. 5,600 crores) unmanned spaceship launched two years ago from Cape Canaveral, Florida and arrived December 3 at its destination, some 70 million miles (110 million kilometres) away.

The plan is for OSIRIS-REx to orbit Bennu through mid-February, using a suite of five scientific instruments to map the asteroid in high resolution to help scientists decide precisely where to sample from.

OSIRIS-Rex stands for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer.

OSIRIS-REx is the third mission in NASA's New Frontiers program, which previously sent the New Horizons spacecraft zooming by Pluto and the Juno spacecraft into orbit around Jupiter.

Bennu was selected for a the OSIRIS-REx mission from over 500,000 known asteroids, due to it fitting a number of key criteria. These include:

Proximity to Earth: In order for OSIRIS-REx to reach its destination in a reasonable timeframe, NASA needed to find an asteroid which had a similar orbit to Earth.

Size: Small asteroids, those less than 200m in diameter, typically spin much faster than larger asteroids, meaning the regolith material can be ejected into space. Bennu is around 500m in diameter, so rotates slowly enough to ensure that the regolith stays on its surface.

Composition: Bennu is a primitive asteroid, meaning it hasn't significantly changed since the beginning of the Solar System (over 4 billion years ago). It is also very carbon-rich, meaning it may contain organic molecules, which could have been precursors to life on Earth.

Additionally, Bennu is of interest as it is a Potentially Hazardous Asteroid (PHA). Every 6 years, Bennu's orbit brings it within 200,000 miles of the Earth, which means it has a high probability of impacting Earth in the late 22nd Century.

For Prelims and Mains: Ultima Thule and New Horizons- Key facts.

Context: On January 1, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft became the first explorer to fly past the mysterious object- Ultima Thule, located some 4 billion miles from Earth.

Ultima Thule is located in the Kuiper belt in the outermost regions of the Solar System, beyond the orbit of Neptune.

New Horizons was launched on 19 January 2006, and has been travelling through space for the past nine years. New Horizon's core science mission is to map the surfaces of Pluto and Charon, to study Pluto's atmosphere and to take temperature readings.

Mains Question: Write a note on the significance of NASA's New Horizons Mission.

For Prelims and Mains: Key provisions and significance of the bill, the need for legislation on outer space.

There is a need for national space legislation for supporting the overall growth of the space activities in India. This would encourage enhanced participation of non-governmental/private sector agencies in space activities in India, in compliance with international treaty obligations, which is becoming very relevant today.

Mains Question: What are the salient features of the Space Activities Bill, 2017? Examine how the use of outer space by ISRO has helped common man in India.

Establishing Gas Trading Hub/Exchange in the country

It has been agreed to establish the gas trading hub(s)/exchange(s) in the country wherein the natural gas can be freely traded and supplied through a market mechanism.

Development of Natural Gas Grid:

To develop the natural gas grid, Government has taken a decision to provide a capital grant of Rs. 5176 crore (i.e. 40% of the estimated capital cost of Rs. 12,940 Crore) to GAIL for development of a 2655 Km long Jaddishpur-Haldia/Bokaro-Dhamra Gas Pipeline (JHBDPL) project.

This pipeline will transport Natural Gas to the industrial, commercial, domestic and transport sectors in the States of Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh.

An Integrated Refinery-cum-Petrochemical Complex:

Oil Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) namely Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) have decided to set up an integrated refinery-cum-petrochemical complex with a refining capacity of 60 MMTPA (Million Metric Tonnes Per Annum) at Babulwadi, Taluka Rajapur in Ratnagiri District in the state of Maharashtra.

Background:

The establishment of a hub is an attempt to meet operators' demands for the adoption of a market-based gas-pricing regime. But India faces challenges in making the dream a reality, amid concerns over third-party access and competition.

The gas hub plan ties in with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's efforts to boost the share of natural gas in India's energy mix to 15% by 2030, from just over 6% now.

Domestic supply is also increasing. ONGC, India's largest producer, supplied 23.5bn cubic meters of gas in the 2017-18 financial year and plans to almost double this within the next four years.

The Indian authorities, are considering overhauling the policy of fixed domestic gas prices, currently based on a formula derived from prices in the US, Canada, UK and Russia. Delhi sees itself as a potential candidate for Asia's largest LNG trading hub, in a region that lacks accurate benchmarks reflecting Asian gas fundamentals."

Right-wing nationalist Jair Bolsonaro, who has vowed to crack down on political corruption, violent crime and ignite a moribund economy with deregulation and fiscal discipline, will be sworn in as Brazil's president on January 1.

The former Army captain and seven-term fringe congressman rode a wave of anti-establishment anger to became Brazil's first far-right president since a military dictatorship gave way to civilian rule three decades ago.

Bolsonaro plans to realign Brazil internationally, moving away from developing nation allies and closer to the policies of Western leaders, particularly US President Donald Trump, who sent Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to his inauguration.

As a clear sign of that diplomatic shift, Bolsonaro plans to move the Brazilian embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, breaking with Brazil's traditional support for a two-state solution to the Palestinian issue.

Crowds of supporters, many with the Brazilian flag draped around their shoulders and with faces painted yellow and green, the national colors, gathered before the Planalto palace, where later the presidential sash will be draped on Bolsonaro.

Backed massively by conservative sectors of Brazil, including Christian evangelical churches, Bolsonaro would block moves to legalize abortion beyond even the current limited exceptions and remove sex education from public schools, opposing what he calls ""cultural Marxism"" introduced by recent leftist governments.

One-third of his cabinet are former army officers, mostly fellow cadets at the Black Needles academy, Brazil's West Point, all outspoken backers of the country's 1964-1985 military regime.

Bolsonaro, 63, has faced charges of inciting rape and for hate crimes because of comments about women, gays and racial minorities. Yet his law-and-order rhetoric and plans to ease gun controls have resonated with many voters, especially in Brazil's booming farm country.

In an interview with Record TV on the eve of his inauguration, Bolsonaro lashed out at Brazil's notorious bureaucracy, which makes doing business in the country difficult and expensive. He vowed to strip away the so-called ""Brazil Cost"" that hamstrings private enterprise.

""The government machine is really heavy,"" he said. ""There are hundreds of bureaucratic governing bodies across Brazil, of regulators as well. ... We have to untangle the mess.""

His vow to follow Trump's example and pull Brazil out of the Paris Agreement on climate change has worried environmentalists. So have his plans to build hydroelectric dams in the Amazon and open up to mining the reservations of indigenous peoples who are seen as the last custodians of the world's biggest forest.

Brazilian businesses are eager to see Bolsonaro take office and install a team of orthodox economists led by investment banker Paulo Guedes, who has promised quick action in bringing Brazil's unsustainable budget deficit under control.

Guedes plans to sell as many state companies as possible in a privatization drive that he forecasts could eventually bring in up to 1 trillion reais ($257 billion).

That would help restore order to government finances. The key measure, however, for reducing the deficit and stopping a dangerous rise of Brazil's public debt will be the overhaul of the country's costly social security pension system.

Pension reform will be Bolsonaro's biggest challenge since he has yet to build a base in Congress, where he has eschewed the political horse-trading that has traditionally helped Brazilian presidents govern the nation of nearly 210 million people.

Bolsonaro may find that lax protection of the environment and human rights could have negative economic effects, more so than those faced by other far-right leaders, given the spotlight on Brazil's Amazon jungle as a protection against global warming and because the country has more murders than any other nation.

""I think they will be good on the economy and they will probably be bad for human rights and the environment,"" said Brian Winter, vice president for policy at the Americas Society and Council of the Americas in New York.""The key question is whether those things can be separated. Most of Wall Street says 'Yes.' I have my doubts."""

Of these, 37,000 youths had got jobs with the government, 1.30 lakh with the private sector and 2.86 lakh were employed under various self employment schemes, he said.

Amarinder Singh also gave the nod to holding a state-level mega job fair in February.

The Chief Minister directed senior officers to carry out the filling up process of the vacancies in a phased but focused manner, addressing the critical requirements of departments of health, education and medical education and research in the first phase.

The directives came during a meeting held here on Tuesday to review the progress of the state government's flagship 'Ghar Ghar Rozgar' and 'Karobar Mission' scheme.

The Chief Minister has asked Chief Secretary Karan Avtar Singh to work out the modalities for filling up the government vacancies.

""The Chief Secretary has been directed to hold a meeting of Administrative Secretaries to work out the requirement of posts to be filled in the various departments in the Officers' Committee headed by him,"" an official spokesperson said.

The Chief Minister stressed on the need for better coordination and synergy between the Skill Development Mission and the Department of Employment Generation and Training (DEGT) to bridge the gap between skill training and job profile.

He called for more special technical training and vocational guidance programmes to equip the local youth to be gainfully employed in the domestic industry.

Technical Education and Employment Generation minister Charanjit Singh Channi apprised the meeting that 30,000 youth had applied for placements in foreign companies during the aOverseas Employment Camp' organised by DEGT.

Government figures said that although 1.8 lakh women were to have been part of the wall, nearly two lakh women turned out to build it.

CPI(M) State committee member became the first link of the wall at Ayikkarapadi.

A large number of men too turned out to support the women. Public meetings marked the conclusion of the wall raised by the women supporting the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government at 10 centres in the district.

Minister for Higher Education K.T. Jaleel attended the wall along with his wife Fatimakutty here. Public meetings were held at Ayikkarapadi, Pulikkal, Kondotty, Morayur, Malappuram, Koottilangadi, Ramapuram, Angadipuram, Perinthalmanna and Pulamanthol.

Assembly Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan's wife Divya and mother Seethalakshmi, former Local Administration Minister Paloli Mohammedkutty's wife K. Khadeeja and daughter Nafeesa were among the prominent women who joined the wall.

Addressing the women, Mr. Jaleel said that women were the real beneficiaries of the social awakening. He said only societies that attained equality of men and women had progressed. Any groups opposing the progress of the society would be ignored by the people, he added.

Inaugurating the public meeting here, All India Democratic Women's Association general secretary Mariam Dhawale said that the wall had become a part of Indian history. CPI leader P. Gouri presided.

The former paratrooper and longtime lawmaker was starting his four-year mandate on January 1 as required by the constitution, after a night of New Year's celebrations across the country.

He was taking office with a sky-high approval rating, fueled by public expectations that he will be a new broom sweeping away chronic crime and corruption, and boosting an economy still limping after a record recession.

""I will bring in politics completely different from that which brought corruption and inefficiency to Brazil,"" he said late Monday in an interview with Record TV.

The 63-year-old comfortably won an October election against Fernando Haddad, a candidate from the leftwing Workers Party that was in power between 2003 and 2016 but is now reviled after a series of graft scandals.

The Workers Party icon, former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, is serving prison time for corruption. And his chosen successor Dilma Rousseff was impeached for cooking the government's books.

In a ceremony marked by pomp and high security, Bolsonaro will formally take over from center-right Michel Temer, who succeeded Rousseff but made little headway with needed fiscal reform and ended up Brazil's most unpopular leader ever.

Bolsonaro voters hope their man will do better.

He has promised to govern for all of the country's 210 million Brazilians, and campaigned on vows to eradicate graft, crack down on crime, open up Brazil's protectionist economy to the free market, and put business interests ahead of environmental protection.

In his interview, he said ""we will debureaucratize to the maximum possible"" and ""clean out"" the government so its ""weight"" is cut back.

But there has been no sign of him dropping the bluff, shoot-from-the-lip style that has earned him comparisons with US President Donald Trump, whom he admires.

Even before taking office Bolsonaro tweeted he will issue a decree easing gun laws so ""good"" citizens can possess weapons to deter criminals.

That worries many, who fear it could aggravate Brazil's rampant violence. The country saw nearly 64,000 murders in 2017 -- the highest number of any country. A poll by the Datafolha survey firm found 61 percent of Brazilians against Bolsonaro's decree.

Bolsonaro also said his education minister will stop ""Marxist trash"" being taught in schools and universities -- a swipe at Workers Party ideology.

Bolsonaro's track record of waxing nostalgic for Brazil's 1964-1985 military dictatorship has stirred some concerns, as have his past disparagements of women, gays and blacks.

A more forceful foreign policy is on its way, with the new leader saying he will do all he can to challenge leftist-ruled Venezuela and Cuba.

The leaders of those countries, and their ally Nicaragua, were excluded from the guest list to Boslonaro's inauguration, although Bolivia's leftwing President Evo Morales did get invited.

Other foreign dignitaries attending include Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Hungary's national Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

Bolsonaro and Netanyahu talked up their budding ""brotherhood"" ahead of the inauguration. And Netanyahu said Bolsonaro had assured him that it was a question of ""when"" and not ""if"" Brazili was to move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, the city claimed by both Israelis and Palestinians as their capital.

The roads stretching from Kasaragod to Thiruvananthapuram was a hive of activity as lakhs of women - from commoners to politicians and celebrities - came together to take part in the Kerala government's Women's Wall on January 1. An event organised to show the state's commitment to renaissance values and improve the status of women in society, in the wake of protests against Supreme Court's historic verdict allowing women of all ages entry into Sabarimala.

CPI (M) politburo member Brinda Karat started the chain at Vellayambalam in Thiruvananthapuram as other women stood in line, inches apart, stretching all the way to Kasargode, covering 620 kilometre- passing through all districts across the state.

(Maharaja's College)

In what is being seen as a defining moment for feminist politics in Kerala, leaders and members from political parties, socio-political organisations and progressive Hindu organisations, too, joined the event. There were men, too, who stood up in support and solidarity, affirming their commitment to gender equality. While women and girls formed the chain on one side, a corresponding wall of men, supporting renaissance values, was also formed opposite the Women's Wall.

Organised by the ruling CPI(M), the Women's Wall featured members from more than 176 other socio-political organisations, including the CPI, Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam (SNDP) and Kerala Pulayar Maha Sabha (KPMS). On the main stage in Thiruvananthapuram, Left leaders Annie Raja and KK Shailaja stood along with top women bureacurats and police officers like Thiruvananthapuram Collector K Vasuki, Additional Chief Secretary Asha Thomas, Principal Secretary (Education) Usha Titus, Chandhini IPS and Sheela Thomas. Dalit activist Dhanya Raman, Dr Radhika, artist Vindhu Vincent, dubbing artist Bhagyalakshmi, TV star and chef Lakshmi Nair were also on stage.

The event comes in the wake of the strong opposition to the Supreme Court verdict allowing women of all ages entry into the Sabarimala temple.

After a trial run, the event commenced at 4 pm. During the 15-minute event, the participants made a pledge, which read: ""We are taking the pledge that we will uphold Renaissance values, we will stand for equality for women, we resist the attempts to make Kerala a lunatic asylum, and we will fight for secularism.""

Calling it a ""historic gathering"", Brinda Karat said, ""Very often, religious beliefs and sentiments have been employed to use women in subordinate positions. Today, dear sisters, you have made history. You have resisted against the dark forces that want to push women back into the dark ages. You have built the wall of resilience to take forward the values of social reforms, which are critical for women's advancement in 21st century. Kerala, you have moved ahead, not only for the women of Kerala but for the women across India.

""Swami Vivekananda once called Kerala a 'lunatic asylum'. But, today, Kerala is seen as the most advanced and developed state because of the communist and progressive movements here. Today, Kerala, with its history of social reforms and the contemporary struggles, stands as the first state in every aspect of human development,"" she added."

The event, a planned wall of women on National Highways spanning 620 kilometres, is meant to show Kerala's commitment to renaissance values and improve the status of women in society.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan also stated that the Women's Wall event was necessitated by the strong opposition to the Supreme Court verdict allowing women entry into the Sabarimala temple.

The event is organised by the ruling CPI(M), along with over 176 other socio-political organisations, including the CPI, Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam (SNDP) and Kerala Pulayar Maha Sabha (KPMS).

The numbers

The event's executive planning committee has said that it will require the participation of 31 lakh women to see a seamless chain from Kasaragod to Vellayambalam in Thiruvananthapuram, and that it currently expects the participation of 50 lakh women. The SNDP is expected to bring in 6 lakh participants, while the KPMS will bring 5 lakh participants.

Speaking at a press conference on Monday, CPI(M) Secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan reiterated, ""Those who oppose the Women's Wall are conservative people, and the Congress is aligning with such conservative people. Fifty lakh women will be take part in the event, and men will also join.""

While women and girls will form one side of the wall, a corresponding wall of men who support renaissance values will be formed opposite the Women's Wall. The participants will gather at appointed centres on Tuesday at 3 pm, and a rehearsal will be held at 3.30 pm, following which the Women's Wall event will take place between 4 and 4.15 pm, with the participants making a pledge. The pledge reads, ""We are taking the pledge that we will uphold Renaissance values, we will stand for equality for women, we resist the attempts to make Kerala a lunatic asylum, and we will fight for secularism.""

Different parties in organisations have been given the responsibility of populating and looking after the Wall in various districts. Of the 44 km stretch that the Wall plans to span in Thiruvananthapuram, the CPI(M) is in charge of ensuring that 31 km is filled, the CPI is entrusted with filling 11 km, while other parties have been allocated 2 km. Three lakh women are expected to participate in Ernakulam, Kollam and Kozhikode each, while an expected four lakh women will participate in Alappuzha, five lakh in Kannur, 1.8 lakh in Malappuram and one lakh in Kasargod. Labour and Excise Minister TP Ramakrishnan also told The Hindu that an ambulance would be posted every 5 km along the length of the Wall to deal with any emergency medical issues.

Prominent personalities who will attend

The event will attended by over 200 notable personalities like Malayalam writer, literary critic and educationist M Leelavathy, writers P Vatsala and Khadeeja Mumtaz, athletes Mercy Kuttan, Preeja Sreedharan and boxer KV Lekha, and prominent individuals from the film industry, including Parvathy Thiruvoth, Rima Kallingal, Remya Nambeesan, Bina Paul and Geethu Mohandas.

Ministers and political leaders will also participate in the event from various districts. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and ministers Kadakampally Surendran and Thomas Isaac will participate from Thiruvananthapuram. Revenue Minister E Chandrashekaran and Health Minister KK Shylaja will participate from Kasargod, Minister for Industries and Sports EP Jayaraj and Minister for Ports and Museums Ramachandran Kadanapally will participate from Kannur, Transport Minister AK Saseendran and Labour and Excise Minister TP Ramakrishnan will participate from Kozhikode, Higher Education Minister KT Jaleel from Malappuram, Electricity Minister AK Balan from Shornur, Water Resources Minister K Krishnankutty from Pattambi, Agriculture Minister VS Sunil Kumar and Education Minister C Raveendran from Thrissur, Electricity Minister MM Mani from Angamaly, Fisheries Minister J Mercykutty Amma from Kollam, Minister for Food and Civil Supplies P Thilothaman from Cherthala, Public Works Minister G Sudhakaran from Allapuzha and Forest Minister K Raju will participate from Kayamkulam.

The event will be presided over by three types of organising committees. While the event, as a whole, has an executive planning committee, each district also has an organising committee headed by the District Collector. The Committee for Protection of Renaissance Values, comprising various social organisations, and a committee comprising members of the LDF Women's Wing will also be in charge of administration of the event.

In the months preceding the event, the Women's Wall had been mired in various controversies, with the Congress terming it a ""communal wall"" for having invited participation only from ""progressive Hindu organisations"", a claim which the LDF government refuted. It was also criticised for using government funds by detractors who claimed that it was a political event by the CPI(M) and therefore should not use government funds, or mandate participation by women public servants. While government funds generated for the prevention of atrocities against women have been used to finance the event, women government employees are not mandated to attend. The Kerala Child Rights Commission also opposed a Kerala High Court order preventing children's participation in the event.

BY SUNEEL KOUL

At a time when large swathes of East Africa, middle east, parts of eastern Europe & parts of central Asia continue to battle acute poverty, malnutrition, lack of basic health care, primary education, communicable diseases, immigration & closed borders, UN authority & role in mitigating such sufferings & inhuman conditions is under a cloud. Looking at such plight & abject neglect by powers to be including the holy cow called UN, one can't but help laugh at the innocuous interventions by the top body on insignificant matters involving two countries.

So when a pliable officer at the highest seat of world peace & harmony refers to some sort of an investigation into a non-existent issue, the very authority, respect & sanctity of the institution comes into the cross hairs of an otherwise avoidable discussion & debate. What also becomes unpalatable & uncharitable is the unilateral, biased view & opinion about a hitherto bilateral issue at a time when the whole world is sick & tired of the shenanigans of a state that sponsors global terror. It is a different question that India has been shouting from every pedestal, every forum & every responsible platform to the outside world on the consequences of turning a blind eye to this menace that has gripped humanity in its vicious tentacles. Sad that it took a 11/9 for the world & UN to see what India has been a victim of for decades now. Pakistan's track record of using instrument of terror as its state policy is anything but an open secret

UN must be exasperated with events in Afghanistan & Pakistan as a interminable vortex of terror. So it becomes laughable & a point to ponder when an odd call or a careless reference to non-existent issues like Kashmir which at best is a bilateral issue between India & Pakistan is raised by the very authority mandated to usher in sanity & restore humanity from being vandalised by rogue forces like Pakistan. To put things in perspective, there have been innumerable dialogues, debates, bilateral & subsequent resolutions & joint statements adopted that give India a legitimate right to whole of Jammu & Kashmir. Our parliament has passed a resolution to this effect in 1996. So does the Shimla accord between two countries, the Lahore declaration as many other interjections sealed this issue for ever? UNMOGIP has lost its relevance in as far as it was only supposed to be an observer group overseeing the cease fire of 1948 post J &K's accession to India.

It is of very little significance then what a former UN Human Rights Commissioner Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein had to say of an investigation of human rights violation in Kashmir. History is not kind to those who are motivated more by personal beliefs & agendas & whose utterances can be as prejudiced as broad daylight. India very righty has termed this statement highly objectionable & an unnecessary overreach by the UN of its charter of responsibilities concerning a bilateral issue. If anything UN is under a severe & solemn duty & obligation to world at large to redirect its focus on the terror havens & sanctuaries thriving in Pakistan that has heaped unending misery to humanity perpetrated deaths & disaster across the globe including 11/9 & Afghanistan. It may also be a matter of record at UN that the worlds' most dreaded terrorist Osama Bin Laden was captured from a highly fortified military colony of Abbottabad by the US seals in a daring pre-dawn operation. UN would also be seized of the inhuman & barbaric acts of violence against women including Nobel Laureate Malala Yousuf zai, the ethnic cleansing of Hindus from Kashmir, Baluchis from Baluchistan as well as the atrocities perpetrated by militant organisations & fundamentalist forces across the globe. Every investigation, every act of terror including one on 26/11 in Mumbai have found their origin to Pakistan & its ISI in cahoots with the army.

Hopefully the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres must have reiterated all such brazen facts in his conversation with Imran Khan, the Pakistan PM, who it is said had a telephonic conversation with him recently. UN secy. general must also have sought a report on POK where persecution & discrimination on the basis of caste, religion & tribe continue to expose its dubious character. It is also expected that Guettres would have raised the issue of Mumbai terror attack & its mastermind Hafiz Saeed, a UN proscribed terrorist, accorded state patronage by Pakistan.

While we find it normal for heads of state to have a conversation with UN chief once in a while, it would be a sham, were these calls to emanate from the territory that is infested lock, stock & barrel with anti-humanity elements. Those who are hell bent upon disturbing word peace & order; A state that has abdicated its sovereign responsibility & a pledge to the UN, as a signatory to maintaining peaceful & cordial relations with all other member states & not letting its territory to be used for launching terror attacks across oceans, mountains & borders. UN would do well to rein in the behemoth, the terror factory called Pakistan if it were to look at any semblance of peace in Afghanistan & the rest of the world.

It is time India put all its cards on the table & let UN know of its deep dismay, disgust & frustration with its unsolicited, uncalled for observations that raise more questions than answers about UN & its role as a genuine watchdog & not a partisan group or a cozy club of few, or for that matter a platform which errs on the side of caution & counsel. It is also time that India either ignored such mischief mongering by Pakistan which is nothing but a part of their state doctrine to take the attention away from its own domestic rumblings, whenever it found under the debris of deceit & falsehood or go hammer & tongs in its diplomatic, economic & political isolation of the rogue country. We must not falter or tire getting the tag of a terror state to Pakistan.

It may be pertinent to mention that India has not ever found any need or desire to approach the group ever since its role & responsibility has ceased & been nullified in a sovereign country such as ours. It is only a matter a time before our government asks the UN to vacate any remnants of its physical existence on our land.

It is sheer irony that while UNMOGIP acknowledges the intrusion by Pakistani troops disguised as tribesmen into Kashmir soon after Independence as a covert operation to forcefully occupy this territory; it fails to recall its own observation of such a monstrous fact in any of its dossiers on Kashmir. As reiterated earlier, India finds UNMOGIP a colossal waste of resources & time more so in the aftermath of various bilateral accords & agreements like the one signed in Shimla in 1971 by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and then President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto stipulating that Kashmir was a bilateral issue with no role for third parties."

The landslide victory of the Awami League-led alliance is now being furnished as evidence to sustain the Opposition's charge. Is South Asia evolving a new political model in which political parties come to power through elections and then deploy state power to knock out competitors from the electoral race to retain power? Or does the Awami League's astonishing victory conceal social processes not easily discernible to outsiders?

Screengrab of professor Mesbah Kamal. YouTube@71 News TV

In a telephonic interview, Mesbah Kamal, Dalit rights activista and professor of history, Dhaka University, answers these questions and analyses the significance of Bangladesh's 11th parliamentary elections. A regular in television talk shows, Kamal wears many hats -- he is the chairperson of the Research and Development Collective; general secretary, Adivasi Odhikar Andolan; secretary-general of the National Coalition for Indigenous People in Bangladesh; and chief advisor of Bangladesh Dalit Forum. These are edited excerpts from the interview conducted with Kamal.

Sheikh Hasina's Awami League has won a landslide victory but Bangladesh's Opposition in claiming it was not a free and fair election. How true are these claims?

We don't yet know the final voting percentage but it was over 60 percent. That is a very good turnout. Of course, there are allegations of intimidation, but it can be definitely said that these were essentially stray cases. The overall result would have been perhaps the same even if there had been no intimidation, or if the elections would have been 100 percent fair.

What explains the huge support for the Awami League?

This is partly because the entire country has rallied behind the pro-liberation forces (a term used for those who fought against the Pakistani Army to liberate Bangladesh). They also represent the country's secular, democratic forces. The other reason for the Awami League's victory is the (Sheikh Hasina) government's development initiatives. Bangladeshis thought that the government's continuity is essential for continuing the process (of development).

Critics would say that Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party did not have a level playing field -- she is in jail and the candidature of her party's candidates was rejected in as many as 17 constituencies. Could that be the reason behind BNP's poor performance?

Really, that is not the reason for the Opposition's defeat. Khaleda Zia has been very widely discredited, largely because of the graft charges levelled against her when she was in power. In fact, her party had started to gather support because of its alliance with Kamal Hossain (who enjoys an iconic status in Bangladesh) and some other well-known political leaders. Hossain said the Opposition alliance will not have any affiliation with the Jamaat-e-Islami, which is an Islamic fundamentalist group. Soon thereafter, it became clear that the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) would continue its affiliation with the Jamaat-e-Islami.

A Bangladeshi woman casts her vote at a polling station in the ancient city of Panam Nagar, about 20 kilometers southeast of Dhaka. AP

Are you saying that the Jamaat-e-Islami was the most important factor why the BNP was comprehensively trounced?

Yes, it cost them a high percentage of votes. The second reason was the role of (Khaleda Zia's son) Tarique Rahman in the election. He has been discredited because of his involvement in corruption when his mother was in power. He was also held responsible for the 21 August, 2004, grenade attack on Sheikh Hasina. Around 24 people were killed in the incident. Tarique was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment in the case.

Tarique was earlier the BNP's senior vice-president. He has been out of the country for 10 years. Yet he played a major role in choosing candidates, even interviewing them through video conferencing. This fact dominated media headlines and turned the popular sentiment against the BNP.

There were thus two reasons for the BNP's poor showing -- its persistence on retaining affiliations with the Jamaat-e-Islami, contrary to what Kamal Hossain had promised, and Tarique's leadership role in the Opposition alliance.

Are you saying that the 2018 parliamentary election is a vote against the anti-liberation forces and communal or fundamentalist elements?

Of course, it is. The BNP and the Jamaat in Bangladesh are known as pro-Pakistani elements. They are also known to be associated with the ISI (the Pakistani intelligence agency). In fact, there were reports that the ISI provided a list of potential candidates (to the BNP).

Weren't these reports speculative?

These reports were based on telephone conversations between a top BNP leader, who had been earlier a minister, and an ISI agent based in Dubai.

Can we then say that the election results are a message to the BNP that it cannot be pro-Pakistan and still hope to win elections?

Clearly, yes. The BNP has no political future as long as they continue to be pro-Pakistan and function under the leadership of Khaleda Zia and Tarique Rahman. BNP has paid a price for being anti-liberation and pro-Pakistan. Leaders from Jamat-e-Islami have been executed after a very long trial that was conducted by the International Crimes Tribunal, which held them guilty for committing atrocities, genocides and raping women. The charges against them have been proved beyond any doubt.

These constitute the memory of 1971. There are people who saw 1971 and are still alive. It is also a memory that transcends generations. A very good number of voters did not see 1971 -- for instance, those who voted for the first time in this election numbered nearly 2 crores. These first-time voters (too) rejected the anti-liberation forces.

The memories of (the Bangladesh) Liberation War dominated the media. In Bangladesh, TV talk shows are extremely popular and a very important instrument for political education. It is because of TV talk shows that issues pertaining to the Liberation War have reached the younger generation.

Essentially, the issues were framed thus: Do we own our liberation war? Do we own our freedom fighters? Do we own our history? How to write real history? All these issues have gone against the fundamentalists. The BNP is, in fact, a changed or another name of the Muslim League.

Muhammad Ali Jinnah's Muslim League?

Yes, Jinnah's Muslim League. They have been using the cover of BNP, but the party is a continuation of the Muslim League. They have been exposed.

Students in Bangladesh recently took to the streets. It was interpreted as an expression of discontent against the government. Was it not?

There were a couple of issues the young people wanted to be addressed. There was a campaign against the quota system in government jobs (56 percent of jobs are reserved; of that, 30 percent are reserved for families of freedom fighters), and for road safety. These were popular demands. I must say the government did not handle these protests well. The Awami League government had many successes, but there were also failures. However, this did not mean, as some thought, that they would vote for the BNP.

There is always anti-incumbency against a ruling party. But the anti-incumbency was not so strong that people would cast their votes negatively. Ultimately, it can be said that people want, above all, parties that are pro-liberation, secular and democratic. They don't want to give space to anti-liberation and communal forces.

Do you think Kamal Hossain joined the Opposition alliance because he might have thought liberal democracy requires an effective opposition?

He probably thought that space for people to express their democratic aspirations was shrinking. He was partially correct. But this did not mean he had to go and align with anti-liberation and communal forces. It was the biggest political mistake of his life. It will be difficult for Hossain to overcome his mistake.

Do you think Sheikh Hasina is becoming increasingly authoritarian?

At this stage, I will say it is not so. When a party has an absolute majority, it does pose a real challenge (to democracy). Sheikh Hasina has a fantastic majority, but unless she is careful, things could well turn (against her).

Are we seeing a new model of democracy in South Asia -- a leader comes to power through elections and then uses power to knock out those who could be his or her competitors?

The Awami League's history is quite different. It hasn't, for instance, resorted to extra-judicial killings. What Sheikh Hasina has been trying is to restore the rule of law. She has been trying to punish the perpetrators of atrocities and genocides, but very much through the judicial process. The judicial process in Bangladesh takes very long to complete. But it is a good thing that Sheikh Hasina and the Awami League have shown tremendous patience.

Look at the trial of the killers of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. It went through the judicial process even though it took many, many years to bring the killers to justice. Or take the case of four national leaders, who were killed in jail in 1975. This case also took very long to complete, as did cases involving the collaborators (of the Pakistan Army in 1975). Before they were executed, they were given all chances (to appeal against the verdict). The vision here is to sensitise people against the values of anti-liberation forces. The Awami League seeks to challenge them politically and ideologically.

Do you think the 2018 verdict will force Islamic fundamentalists to go underground for waging their battle? Or do you think they will realise their mistake and dilute their hardline position?

In fact, I think it is a mistake to believe or hope they will change themselves. Even after 48 years, they neither admitted to the atrocities they committed in 1975 nor did they appeal for mercy.

Do you think these Islamic fundamentalist forces will adopt more violent methods?

These forces have always had underground outfits. They had it in the 1960s. Going underground is new neither for them nor for Bangladesh. They have gone as extreme as they could against the country and people's interest. Not only are they a declining force, but they will also become politically obsolete in the future. This will create space for (the emergence of) other secular, democratic forces which are on the margins.

The Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Banaglore and the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay are ready to jointly host the second annual future of learning conference, 'Learning 4.0: Connecting the Dots and Reaching the Unreached'. The conference will be held at IIM-Bangalore on January 4 and January 5, 2019.

The future of learning (FoL) conference 2019 aims to highlight innovation and foster dialogue between the major actors shaping the 21st-century learning models, namely, academics, entrepreneurs, regulators and technologists.

Despite the emphasis on a digital transformation of the economy, the rural-urban divide is huge, with the internet penetration in urban and rural areas pegged at 65 per cent and 20 per cent respectively leaving over 50 per cent of India's population unserved or underserved with regards to educational services. The situation in much of South Asia is similar with 65 per cent of the population with limited or no access to the internet.

The conference will discuss factors that account for these gaps in technology, policy and practice, and how advances in technology can be leveraged to make high-quality education affordable, accessible and empowering.

This year the school education sector in Punjab certainly saw some ups even as the last quarter of 2018 was marked by two-month-long protests by Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and RMSA teachers from October.

As the contractual teachers protested against the state government's decision to regularise 8,886 teachers, but with pay cut, as many as 2,265 government schools saw a facelift with world-class infrastructure. Also the students of several government schools set unprecedented examples of their IQ level. And last, but not the least, English, the subject, in which maximum number of students fail in the final exams of Punjab School Education Board, is no more dreaded in many government schools now.

The schools were given a facelift under 'Smart School Project' launched by the government. Crores have been spent on attractive clean buildings, smart classrooms, computer rooms, hygienic toilets, playgrounds, drinking water facilities and colourful premises. Government, however, has not spent from its pocket, but motivated individual donors, Non-government Organisations (NGOs), charitable trusts, firms, and Non-resident Indians to financially help the schools.

Even Director General School Education-cum-Project Director Parshant Goyal had written to several NGOs, charitable trusts and firms to contribute towards digital classrooms, laboratories and toilets, provide books in libraries, uniforms to the students, create infrastructure for Midday Meals and sports, install solar power plants and Reverse Osmosis system and any way that the donor or the school deemed fit.

Education Secretary Krishan Kumar confirmed the infrastructure in 2,265 schools have already been improved and by the end of this academic session, a total of 4,250 institutes will be covered. He said some 100 teachers of Punjab are supporting them hugely by motivating people.

""With the contribution of such people and organisations, it will become a sustainable model of community ownership and accountability,"" said he, adding the government will provide support on pedagogy, ways of teaching, resolving specific problems etc. ""It will enhance the performance of the government schools in every possible manner. We will cover all 20,000 government schools in a few years,"" said he.

Several government schools, including government middle schools at Rajgarh village (Ludhiana), Malwa and Nawanshahr, have already started getting applications from people in advance for reservation of seats for their wards for the next session, revealed the education secretary. ""Two government school teachers in Nawanshahr have got admitted their wards,"" said he.

""It is a dream come true for us as we belong to poor families and haven't even thought of having access to facilities like e-content, computer labs and libraries,"" said one Kamljit Kaur of Kishangarh village in Mansa district. Along with the infrastructure, the education standard has also started improving. The students of Government Primary School, Jhangerian, in Nurpur Bedi block of Ropar district, have set an example. Several students of this schools have memorised the names of all 117 Assembly segments, 13 Lok Sabha constituencies, names of several countries with their respective capitals, that of Punjabi and Indian English writers, Indian scientists, Indian festivals, national holidays and neighbouring countries. The Class I children of this school have memorised tables up to 20, while as per syllabus, they need to learn just up to 5.

Education secretary has also uploaded the videos of these children on social media. ""Under Parho Paunjab Project, we have designed several programmes and now our students are speaking in English without any hesitation and several schools have started conducting prayers in English now,"" said District Mentor of English, Chander Shekhar.

Even, a renowned missionary-run convent school, St Francis in Batala (Gurdaspur district) had invited the government school students during a Science and maths fair recently. ""The government school students explained maths and science equations in fluent English to their convent counterparts,"" said Principal of St Francis School, P J Joseph."

Bengaluru: In the mid-1920s, Messrs Steel Brothers and Co, London, found themselves facing an expensive problem.

A subsidiary, the Rawalpindi-based Attock Oil Company, was having trouble drilling for crude oil, as the thick, viscous agent used to prevent the leakage of oil into the drill bit kept solidifying.

Put in charge of fixing this problem was a 31-year-old scientist, who got to work at the Panjab University in Lahore and devised a solution: The viscosity of the fluid had to be reduced. He asked Attock to add acacia gum -- also called Indian gum, obtained from the sap of the acacia tree -- into the mixture, and the rest, as they say, is history.

Steel Brothers and Co was so pleased with the young scientist, Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar, that they offered him Rs 1.5 lakh, more than a fortune at the time, to research petroleum.

Bhatnagar declined, asking the company to give the money to the university instead so they could start research on petroleum.

Afterwards, astrophysicist Meghnad Saha wrote to Bhatnagar in praise of his initiative.

""India does not lack in men earning millions, but, if a few of those millionaires were guided by the fine example set by a comparatively poor teacher like yourself, I think her scientific and moral progress would have been rapid.""

This young scientist, who passed away on 1 January 1955, is today remembered as one of the early champions of science and technology in India who helped set up crucial infrastructure in Independent India for the pursuit of these fields.

Bhatnagar was born on 21 February 1894 in Bhera, in what is today Pakistan Punjab. His father passed away before his first birthday, and Bhatnagar was sent to live with his maternal grandfather, an engineer credited with inspiring an early interest in science in the child.

Bhatnagar did his schooling at the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic High School and enrolled for graduate studies at the then newly founded Dayal Singh College, Lahore, in 1911. He then joined the Forman Christian College, where he obtained a BSc in physics in 1916, and an MSc in chemistry in 1919.

Having received a scholarship from Dayal Singh College Trust to study abroad, Bhatnagar wanted to travel to the US. However, ships embarking from England for the US at the time were filled with American soldiers returning home after World War I. So he went to University of London instead, where he earned a Doctor of Science (a higher doctorate) degree in chemistry in 1921.

On his return to India, Bhatnagar, aged all of 27, joined the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) as a professor of chemistry.

He taught there for three years before taking up a job at the University of Panjab, Lahore, as a professor of physical chemistry and director of the university's chemical laboratories.

Anthropogenic or human-caused climate change was not a known concept in the early 20th century.

Until 1958, when atmospheric carbon dioxide was finally measured and found to be increasing, fossil fuels were where physics and chemistry research was at.

And Bhatnagar was among the leading lights of the field. Best known for making wax odourless, he also discovered how to make the kerosene flame taller and larger, thus helping multitudes of Indian households.

During World War II, Bhatnagar worked on innovations for the British army and Indian troops. He created the anti-gas cloth and developed plastic from waste, besides finding a way to use petroleum extraction byproducts in the oil industry.

He was also keen on magnetic chemistry. In 1928, he and friend K.N. Mathur developed the Bhatnagar-Mathur Magnetic Interference Balance, which was at the time considered to be one of the most sensitive instruments measuring magnetism and related properties. It was even exhibited at the Royal Society Soiree in the UK in 1931.

However, Bhatnagar was not a man of science alone and loved the performing arts, especially drama and poetry. While at Dayal Singh College, Lahore, he is said to have excelled as an actor. Later, he famously wrote a prize-winning one-act play in Urdu, Karamati. When at BHU, he wrote the university's song, the Kulgeet, which is sung to this day.

In 1940, Bhatnagar was appointed the director of the newly-formed Board of Scientific and Industrial Research, modelled on the British body by the same name.

The institution had an annual budget of Rs 5 lakh, but Bhatnagar wanted research to be better funded. When the government agreed to issue an annual grant of Rs 10 lakh for five years for industrial research, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) was established as an autonomous body in 1942.

By 1943, Bhatnagar had already established five national laboratories under its banner. Today, CSIR runs 38 laboratories. The institution's prestigious Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, awarded for excellence in the sciences, is a tribute to the first director-general of CSIR, who helped shape much of research in India today.

In 1934, he became one of the earliest fellows of the Indian Academy of Sciences. He was bestowed the Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1936, and knighted in 1941 for his contributions to science. He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1943.

After Independence, Bhatnagar served as secretary in the ministry of education, and educational adviser for the government. He was an ardent proponent of industrial research, and his negotiations with the oil industry led to the establishment of a number of oil refineries in India.

The first chairman of the University Grants Commission, he also had stints as the president of the Indian Chemical Society, National Institute of Sciences of India (now known as the Indian National Science Academy), and the Indian Science Congress.

He was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1954. Months later, Bhatnagar passed away unexpectedly on New Year's Day, 1955, due to a cardiac arrest. He was 60."

THE incessant drilling continues throughout the conversation, as it does through most of the day. Their home a stone's throw from where tunnelling work is underway for the Colaba-Bandra-SEEPZ Metro rail, 88-year-old Narayan Lavate's forehead is creased. ""I don't know whether we'll be alive when the first station comes,"" says Narayan, a resident of the Laxmibai chawl in Kalbadevi's Zaobawadi area.

Exactly a year ago, Narayan and his wife Iravati had written to the President of India, seeking permission for physician-assisted suicide before they become bed-ridden or before they die a slow natural death, of old age or terminal illness. Certain now that their plea will not be accepted, the couple is bracing for a city where they have seen change intimately change some more.

The Lavates' letter was forwarded to the Maharashtra government chief secretary for consideration. After some correspondence, the couple says they know their wish won't be fulfilled. ""We never thought we will see 2019 coming. But I guess we will,"" Narayan says as Iravati nods.

The couple lives alone in Laxmibai chawl, Narayan's home for 75 years. Iravati moved in 51 years ago, upon marrying him. Through the decades that Narayan spent working with the state transport department and Iravati as a teacher at the Aryan Education Society High School, they have seen Mumbai's transition. From a tram ride at 10 paisa per head to the death of the city tram in 1964, to buses to CNG buses and now electric buses, from taxis to Ubers, and now the Metro rail, the Lavates have watched keenly.

Iravati's evening strolls have ceased. Blue barricades with ""Mumbai is upgrading' painted on them dominate the roads outside the chawl. ""I would walk to the Ram temple in Kalbadevi every evening. Now the roads are dug up. There is no footpath. I am afraid I'll fall,"" says Iravati (79). It's getting increasingly tough to hail a taxi, so every time she needs a ride, she calls a former student to come pick her up.

Two chawl buildings near their home will be pulled down soon as they prepare to undergo redevelopment. Narayan's visits every afternoon to his old office in Mumbai Central have also stopped. ""There's too much traffic,"" he says. The only thing that remains constant in their lives is the limited water supply in their chawl building. There's water in the taps from 5 am to 6 am, like clockwork. Every morning Narayan immerses himself in five newspapers, regional and English, to stay updated. He still does not wear spectacles. Iravati switches to television every evening to watch a Marathi soap.

Since their letter to the President, several NGOs approached them throughout 2018 to place them in old age homes. The two refused. ""We don't want to depend on anyone. That is why we did not have children,"" Iravati says. ""But now even to walk outside on the lane, I need help.""

A maid buys them vegetables every day and cleans their house. Iravati receives Rs 25,000 in pension every month, they spend Rs 500 per day. The couple disagrees on multiple topics, including who will operate the TV. But they agree on one point. What would they wish to change about the city? ""The space for pedestrians. Hawkers have been pushed to the footpaths,"" Iravati says, as Narayan nods."

The issue assumes importance ahead of the 2019 general election as extending the services of AIIMS to Noida was the BJP's manifesto for the Assembly polls.

After becoming MLA, Pankaj Singh had written to the CM in March 2017, suggesting that super-speciality paediatric hospital and post-graduate teaching institute (SSPHPGTI) be handed over to AIIMS. However, the proposal did not work out as AIIMS apparently objected to the old staff working there. The MLA said the proposal to hand over the new district hospital building to AIIMS was hence the ""second option"". ""We've to see how the centre wants to take it up. I had suggested this in a meeting with the health minister and the medical education minister, Ashutosh Tandon. They've been positive about the proposal,"" Singh told TOI.

I would love to see a huge breakthrough in education in the years to come. We still need to achieve a lot in education, especially in the interiors, where people need to be educated. It is important for the country's future and if we can start working towards it, that's a beautiful change I would like to see in the years to come. If we achieve 100 per cent education, it will help grow the country in a better way. The other thing I would like to see is people being positive. There is so much negativity in society and so much hatred for no reason. Each one is playing their own game in this competition, but don't spread hatred or negativity, spread happiness. I think live-and-let-live approach, and be happy, spread smiles is the change I want to see. I personally don't believe in New Year resolutions; if I want to make a resolution, I don't wait for a New Year's Day. I didn't have a release in 2018, so I am looking forward to 2019 as some of my films are releasing this New Year.

Pullela Gopichand, national badminton chief coach

On a personal front, with 2019 being the qualification year for 2020 Olympics, I would love to see my players being injury-free and break barriers to reach new heights. I would want the government to look at fitness as a policy as there is huge need for us to be motivated to be active play less of gadgets and more of participative sports. We also need more peace in the world. In India, it's the year of general elections, I hope they are smooth and there is a stable government in place. I would also like sport to be a lot more in focus I feel that is essential. We as a nation have taken care of literacy only in an alphabetical and numerical sense but truly I think physical literacy is important.

N. Uttam Kumar Reddy, TPCC president

We wish well for the people of Telangana. We also wish that the aspirations of the Telangana people will come true in 2019. In this year the Congress party will rise like the phoenix, which rises from the ashes.

M. Kodandaram, Telangana Jana Samiti president

The year 2019 should make the farmers happy with timely rains. The government should bring changes in the economic models. It should also work for employment generation in the state this year. TJS leaders and workers will work hard for the expansion of the party to overcome the issues the party is facing.

Chada Venkat Reddy, CPI State Secretary

We wish that 2019 will see the completion of the irrigation projects. We are also expecting social justice in Telangana. The CPI will do its best in 2019. The party leaders will take up several measures to expand the party by fighting against the local issues.

Dr K. Laxman, BJP state President

The 2019 should bring happiness and prosperity for the people of Telangana. The government should focus on the overall development of the state in this New Year. The TRS government should stick to its promises and should implement them without any failure.

Rakesh Munnanooru, founder, WhistleDrive

Just the way government took initiative to level the playing field for brick-and-mortar stores to take on funding-backed online unicorns, we are expecting that there would be a normalisation in transportation space as well. This will fuel the growth of our cab partners and help in bringing a certainity to their earnings. We are also expecting a better infrastructure for e-vehicles as corporates are increasingly looking for eco-friendly solutions. Change is inevitable in both the cases and 2019 looks like the year of transformation.

Abhishek Deshpande, co-founder, Rapidue Technologies

There is a clear shift in consumer needs and demands towards advanced, safe and secure accessories for their smartphones. From the technology standpoint, we will see a lot of advancement in wireless mobile phone accessories in 2019. But the industry also faces severe threats from sub-standard products without BIS, FCC and CE certifications or rather fake products available in the market. In 2019, we expect stringent enforcement of law to curb the availablity of fake products. We expect governments to look at massive data pooled in at a city and municipality levels to address growing volumes of waste recyclables on a sustainable basis.

B.V.R. Mohan Reddy, chairman, CYIENT Ltd

Today, upskilling and reskilling of over 50 per cent of the industry workforce has become an indispensable obligation for the IT-ITES industry. Also, students and fresh graduates need to be skilled in the new technologies. The Union government has identified Information Technology as one of the 12 champion services sectors earlier this year and initiated an action plan. As a part of the Union Budget 2018-19, it is heartening to see NITI Aayog setting-up a national level programme on Artificial Intelligence. But to create growth momentum, the government of India has to create clusters around each of the disruptive technologies. The creation of Centres of Excellence (CoE) in Big Data, Analytics, and AI is a good first step in this direction, but we need to populate these CoEs with domain experts to truly provide the right advice and consultancy to the industry.

Ashwin Reddy, MD Aparna Enterprises: The real estate sector also witnessed a major revolution in the past year with government policy changes. The resulting transparency has forced developers and approval authorities to maintain high levels of compliance. We are looking forward to project approvals being processed more quickly with Single Window Clearance, resulting in reduced construction costs, thereby substantially reducing property costs. An efficient, fair and transparent system would result in a revived demand for new projects in 2019. Last year's Budget saw the affordable housing segment being granted infrastructure status. We predict more government support with infrastructure status being granted to the entire sector in 2019. This will lead to financing being available to the developer at lower interest rates. In turn, this would make projects more affordable for the home buyer.

Nikhil Siddharth, actor

I would like to see a big change in the caste system and also education for poor. In 2018 we have witnessed some bad incidents especially the honour killings that shook the Telugu States. Remove the caste system in our society and also the discrimination between people which I want to see the big change. All people are equal and I hope that the column 'caste' removed from the applications that we fill for anything. This is the big change I want to see and also the immediate priority. The other big thing is education for poor. There are many children who can't afford good education and I hope the government should give priority to the education to those children. As a personal front in the year 2018, I wanted to do at least two films, but only one films releases. So, I decided to take a resolution that I signed four films now and at least three of them can hit the screen in the New Year.

The State Cabinet's prompt move has come in for praise from civil society groups.

The State Cabinet has taken a slew of decisions, ranging from the elimination of educational qualification for Panchayati Raj elections, the reopening of universities and removal of Deendayal Upadhyaya's logo from official documents to direct elections for Mayor's post and the appointment of a committee on eligibility for the waiver of farmers' loans.

Health Minister Raghu Sharma said after the Cabinet meeting here that the State government would review all the decisions taken by the previous government in the last six months. Minister of State for Education Govind Singh Dotasara has also announced a review of school textbooks and other reference materials that were revised by the BJP.

The State government has abolished the criteria of educational qualification of candidates for Panchayati Raj bodies, introduced by the BJP regime through an Ordinance in 2014, to ensure that each citizen gets the right to contest. The qualification of 'Class X pass' was set for the Zila Parishad and Panchayat Samiti polls, and 'Class VIII pass' for Sarpanch elections.

The People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) has welcomed the move, saying it had done away with a ""highly discriminatory"" provision that had led to the exclusion of 73% of the population above 21 years of age in rural areas. ""This was an elitist law, denying equal opportunities to citizens who did not have the means for securing education,"" PUCL-Rajasthan president Kavita Srivastava said here on Monday.

Ms. Srivastava pointed out that a special leave petition challenging the amendment to the Panchayati Raj Act was still pending in the Supreme Court. ""After the State government's decision, we will argue in the apex court that the right to contest elections ought to be recognised as a fundamental right,"" she said.

The Congress government has also ordered the removal of the logo of Bharatiya Jan Sangh's co-founder Deendayal Upadhyaya from the official letterheads of Ministers and government functionaries. Social activist Sawai Singh, president of Rajasthan Samagra Seva Sangh, said there was no justification for eulogising an Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ideologue and undermining the significance of the Sarnath pillar as the national emblem.

Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has handed over the Congress party's manifesto to the Chief Secretary with the direction that it should be treated as the State government's policy document. A Cabinet committee will also be constituted to ensure its effective implementation.

Among other decisions, the State Cabinet has revived the Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar Law University and Haridev Joshi University of Journalism and Mass Communication, which were closed by the Vasundhara Raje government.

On the social security front, the Cabinet announced an increase in the amount of pension paid to widows and elderly and disabled persons. The Congress had protested against the halting of pensions for eligible beneficiaries during the BJP's rule."

As India wakes up to a new year 2019, the nation's performance on major global indices in the year past shows a mixed bag of good and bad news. While we might not be the happiest nation of the lot, or have miles to go on the overall human development, we are increasingly becoming significantly better place to do business.

As the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business rankings portray, we rank 77th on a list of 190 economies that are doing well for businesses. Created by World Bank, the Ease of Doing Business index ranks countries on various parameters such as regulations for businesses and stronger protections of property rights; the higher the rating, the better a country's performance. India improved its rank substantially on the Ease of Doing Business index from 132 in 2016, to 100 in 2017, and further to 77 in 2018.

India has done slightly better on another important measure -- the Human Development Index (HDI), compiled by the United Nations Development Program. Taking parameters like education, health and income into account, HDI provides a holistic view of a country's development and the well being of its citizens. In 2018, India has done slightly better than the previous year as it climbed up a spot from 131 to 130 out of 189 nations.

With the current rating, India counts in medium human development countries. While it is encouraging to note that we are doing better than at least 50 countries, there are still miles to go before we make a considerable development.

On the other hand, what may spell gloom is the fact that India slipped 11 spots from 122nd rank of 2017 to become the 133rd happiest nation in the world. An annual publication carried out by United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network since 2012, the report ranks 153 countries on the happiness of the population. While the Nordic nations top the rankings, Indians need to learn a thing or two from the Danish and Norwegian concept of Hygge, the art of happy living.

The Global Peace Index too is not spelling a better year for India. Ranking 163 independent nations, the Institute for Economics and Peace study is endorsed by individuals such as former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the Dalai Lama.

Peace enthusiasts will not find it promising that India has performed poorly and has done just a shade better than its previous performance of 137 as we rank 136 this time. Iceland, New Zealand, Austria, Denmark and Canada are the most peaceful countries, according to GPI. Naturally, they rank higher in HDI and Global happiness index as well.

Global Hunger Index has also shown a fall in India's ranking from the past year. While India ranked 100th in a list of 119 countries last year, the 2018 performance is worse as now it is on 103rd spot. According to the report, ""a ranking below 100 shows that a country's undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting, and child mortality levels are at the highest level.""

This is despite the fact that India ranks 3rd in the countries with the highest number of billionaires, according to the Forbes' annual list of countries with most billionaires. According to the report, India has 131 billionaires with Mukesh Ambani being the richest of them all."

Atal Bihari Vajpayee passes away at 93

Former Prime Minister (PM) and one of the country's most admired leaders, Atal Bihari Vajpayee died on August 16 at the age of 93.

Advertising

Born in 1924 in Gwalior, Vajpayee became the first non-Indian National Congress PM to serve a full five-year term. His first stint as Prime Minister lasted only for 16 days (from May 16-31, 1996) and then again from March 19, 1998 to May 13, 2004. Vajpayee, whose parliamentary experience spanned over four decades, had been a Member of Parliament since 1957. He was elected to the Lok Sabha 10 times, and twice to the Rajya Sabha.

Important Supreme court verdicts

Sabarimala temple verdict

In the month of September, the apex court in its landmark judgment allowed women, irrespective of their age, to enter Kerala's Sabarimala temple. A five-member constitution bench comprising Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra, Justices Rohinton Nariman, AM Khanwilkar, DY Chandrachud, and Indu Malhotra, in a 4-1 majority, struck down the century-old provisions of The Kerala Hindu Places of Public Worship (Authorisation of Entry) Rules, 1965 that banned women between the age of 10 and 50 from the temple.

Adultery is not a crime: SC

Describing the law criminalising adultery as arbitrary, which treats the wife as chattel and deprives women of her sexual autonomy and dignity, the Supreme Court struck down as ""unconstitutional"" Indian Penal Code Section 497, which makes adultery a punishable offence only for men. Adultery will, however, continue to be a ground for any civil wrong, including a ground for divorce.

'Section 377' scrapped

The Supreme Court in its landmark judgment on September 7 legalised homosexuality and partially decriminalised Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. A five-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra and comprising Justices Fali Nariman, A M Khanwilkar, D Y Chandrachud and Indu Malhotra, delivered the judgment saying, ""Only Constitutional morality and not social morality can be allowed to permeate rule of law. Sexual orientation is one of the many natural phenomenon. Any discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation amounts to violation of fundamental rights.""

PNB scam

Fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi and his maternal uncle Mehul Choksi are being investigated by the investigating agencies after PNB filed complained against their companies, saying that the bank had been cheated of Rs 13,600 crore through fraudulent issue of letters LoUs and foreign letters of credit (FLCs). PNB in its January 29 complaint to CBI said that the bank detected the fraud only in the third week of January.

Both Modi and Choksi left India in the first week of January. While Nirav Modi is in the UK and has applied for asylum in June, Choksi has become a citizen of Antigua and Barbuda and is learnt to be residing there.

#MeToo campaign

The #MeToo movement rocked India in 2018 with multiple women accusing men of sexual harassment. Several prominent names mainly from film and media industry cropped up -- Alok Nath, Nana Patekar, Sajid Khan, Subhash Ghai, Musicians -- Kailash Kher, Anu Malik, journalists -- Vinod Dua, Prashant Jha, Suhel Seth, BJP leader MJ Akbar, author Chetan Bhagat among others. The campaign gained momentum in India after actor Tanushree Dutta accused fellow actor Nana Patekar of sexually harassing her during a film shoot in 2008. Since then multiple women have come forward on different social media platforms to name men who they say have sexually harassed or assaulted them in the past.

Rafale deal controversy

The Rafale deal controversy -- over the procurement of 36 Rafale fighter jets from France's Dassault Aviation -- saw a sharp exchange of words between the government and the Opposition. The Supreme Court on December 14, however, dismissed all petitions seeking a court-monitored probe into the matter. The court said it was satisfied with the procurement process and that it found no reason to interfere in the pricing or the offset partner chosen as part of the deal.

Kartarpur corridor

The long-standing demand to open a corridor from India to Pakistan to allow pilgrims to enter Pakistan and visit the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib at Kartarpur in Pakistan's Narowal district was fulfilled after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on November 28 laid the foundation stone for the visa-free corridor. Kartarpur Sahib is revered as the place where Guru Nanak is said to have spent his final days and where he breathed his last. It is expected to be completed within six months.

Shaktikanta Das takes over as new RBI Governor

Urjit Patel resigned as the RBI Governor on December 10 citing personal reasons amid a bitter dispute over the regulator's autonomy. A day after, former economic affairs secretary Shaktikanta Das was appointed the 25th governor of the RBI. For Das, the biggest challenge now is to handle the pressure from the government on issues such as the restructuring of loans, infusing liquidity and sticking to its strict default norms for resolution of bad debts in banks' books, where the Centre has favoured a more lenient approach.

Assam NRC Final Draft List: 40 lakh don't get place

Around 40 lakh people did not find mention in the final draft of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) that was released in July amid tight security in presence of NRC state coordinator Prateek Hajela, Registrar General Sailesh and Satyendra Garg, joint secretary (NE) of the Ministry of Home Affairs. Registrar General Sailesh mentioned that 40 lakh people did not find mention in the final draft of NRC. ""2,89,83,677 out of 3.29 crore applicants are eligible,"" he said.

Lok Sabha clears Triple Talaq bill

The Triple Talaq Bill criminalising instant divorce by Muslim men was passed in the Lok Sabha amid a heated debate followed by an Opposition walkout on December 27. While the government projected the Bill as a question of ""Insaaniyat aur Insaaf"", the Opposition accused the government of indulging in vote bank politics and demanded that the Bill is referred to a joint select committee.

The case dates back to 2016 when the Supreme Court had sought assistance from the then Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi on pleas challenging the constitutional validity of ""triple talaq"", ""nikah halala"" and ""polygamy"", to assess whether Muslim women face gender discrimination in cases of divorce.

States in turn are to reimburse a certain amount of money for every RTE admission.

However, it turns out that the Maharashtra government is looking around for ways to not pay these schools the money it owes them.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Maharashtra, led by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, can claim credit for many successes, especially with the irrigation project Jalyukt Shivar and an impressive infrastructure upgrade topping the list. However, its record on one front has been abysmal, i.e., in fulfilling its responsibility under the Right to Education (RTE) Act.

According to Section 12 of the RTE, non-minority unaided private schools are required to reserve 25 per cent of the seats in entry-level classes (either primary level or Class 1) for students belonging to disadvantaged groups (DGs) [Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), etc] and economically weaker sections (EWS) [income less than a certain amount]. The state in return is supposed to pay these schools, for every RTE admission, an amount fixed by the government or the tuition fee of a school, whichever is less. Maharashtra has fixed an amount of Rs 17,000 a year for RTE students.

But it goes to great lengths to avoid reimbursing this amount to schools. Though the schools have been reserving seats under RTE since 2012, the government tried to get out of its commitment by simply agreeing to pay dues for only one academic year. Then, there was disagreement over the actual amount due and how it should be calculated. The government said it owed Rs 300 crore while the schools said the amount was more than 1,000 crore.

This mismatch in estimates came about because the government wanted to pay only for fresh RTE admissions while the schools were asking to be compensated for all RTE admissions (new and repeat/old students - explained in detail here).

Even to date, the dues of past academic years have not been fully released to all the private schools. Now, the Maharashtra government has come up with a new plan to avoid paying the money it owes to these institutions. In a government resolution released recently, it has modified the norms for RTE reimbursement stating that ""if a private school is using any government land and benefiting from the same then the school would not receive reimbursement for students who have been admitted in 25 per cent RTE quota,"" Mumbai Mirror reported.

Through this order, the government has effectively imposed a retrospective binding of sorts in an agreement that is in force for years and it has done so in a one-sided manner. This is a textbook definition of ""breach of contract"". When the government leased out land, it didn't impose a condition that schools will have to reserve 25 per cent seats for EWS/DG category students. Nor does the RTE Act mandate that those schools that have received land from the government at concessional rates will not be compensated for fulfilling the RTE quota. Hence, both from the RTE Act and the leasing agreement, the government's action is prima facie illegal. Less said about the ethical aspect of its action, the better.

Independent English Schools Association (IESA) secretary Rajendra Singh told Swarajya that ""the government's action is not just illogical but outright illegal. The RTE and land leasing are two separate contracts. In any case, under the RTE Act, the government gives reimbursement for only tuition fees and not for infrastructure costs the school has to bear. Land comes under the latter category. How can the two be clubbed? If the government was paying per student reimbursement for infrastructure costs also, then they had a case. In such a scenario, they could have deducted this from total reimbursement, but how can they not reimburse the tuition fees?""

Singh further explained that the government simply ""doesn't have the data to ascertain how many schools have the land leasing agreement with the government. Nor it has the manpower to determine this number. It will take anywhere between one to two years to collect the data. This is nothing but their latest attempt to delay payments to private schools."""

Pompeo and Secretary of Defense James N. Mattis to India on September 6, 2018 for the inaugural India-U.S. Ministerial 2+2 Dialogue. They welcomed the launch of the 2+2 Dialogue as a reflection of the shared commitment by Prime Minister Modi and President Trump to provide a positive, forward-looking vision for the India-U.S. strategic partnership and to promote synergy in their diplomatic and security efforts. They resolved to continue meetings in this format on an annual basis.

Celebrating over 70 years of diplomatic cooperation, the Ministers reaffirmed their view that India and the United States, as sovereign democracies founded on the values of freedom, justice, and commitment to the rule of law, must continue to lead global efforts to promote peace, prosperity, and security.

Recognizing their two countries are strategic partners, major and independent stakeholders in world affairs, the Ministers committed to work together on regional and global issues, including in bilateral, trilateral, and quadrilateral formats. The two sides further decided to establish secure communication between the Minister of External Affairs of India and the U.S. Secretary of State, and between the Minister of Defense of India and the U.S. Secretary of Defense, to help maintain regular high-level communication on emerging developments.

Strengthening the Defense and Security Partnership:

The Ministers reaffirmed the strategic importance of India's designation as a Major Defense Partner (MDP) of the United States and committed to expand the scope of India's MDP status and take mutually agreed upon steps to strengthen defense ties further and promote better defense and security coordination and cooperation. They noted the rapid growth in bilateral defense trade and the qualitative improvement in levels of technology and equipment offered by the United States to India in recent years. They welcomed the inclusion of India by the United States among the top tier of countries entitled to license-free exports, re-exports, and transfers under License Exception Strategic Trade Authorization (STA-1) and also committed to explore other means to support further expansion in two-way trade in defense items and defense manufacturing supply chain linkages. They welcomed the signing of a Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) that will facilitate access to advanced defense systems and enable India to optimally utilize its existing U.S.-origin platforms. The Ministers also announced their readiness to begin negotiations on an Industrial Security Annex (ISA) that would support closer defense industry cooperation and collaboration.

Recognizing their rapidly growing military-to-military ties, the two sides committed to the creation of a new, tri-services exercise and to further increase personnel exchanges between the two militaries and defense organizations. The Ministers reviewed the recent growth of bilateral engagements in support of maritime security and maritime domain awareness, and committed to expand cooperation. Toward that end, the Ministers committed to start exchanges between the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command (NAVCENT) and the Indian Navy, underscoring the importance of deepening their maritime cooperation in the western Indian Ocean.

Acknowledging the unique role of technology in the India-U.S. defense partnership, the Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to continue to encourage and prioritize co-production and co-development projects through the Defense Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI), and to pursue other avenues of defense innovation cooperation. In this regard, they welcomed the conclusion of a Memorandum of Intent between the U.S. Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) and the Indian Defence Innovation Organization - Innovation for Defence Excellence (DIO-iDEX).

Welcoming the expansion of bilateral counter-terrorism cooperation, the Ministers announced their intent to increase information-sharing efforts on known or suspected terrorists and to implement UN Security Council Resolution 2396 on returning foreign terrorist fighters. They committed to enhance their ongoing cooperation in multilateral fora such as the UN and FATF. They reaffirmed their support for a UN Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism that will advance and strengthen the framework for global cooperation and reinforce the message that no cause or grievance justifies terrorism. The Ministers denounced any use of terrorist proxies in the region, and in this context, they called on Pakistan to ensure that the territory under its control is not used to launch terrorist attacks on other countries. On the eve of the 10-year anniversary of the 26/11 Mumbai attack, they called on Pakistan to bring to justice expeditiously the perpetrators of the Mumbai, Pathankot, Uri, and other cross-border terrorist attacks. The Ministers welcomed the launch of a bilateral dialogue on designation of terrorists in 2017, which is strengthening cooperation and action against terrorist groups, including Al-Qa'ida, ISIS, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, Hizb-ul Mujahideen, the Haqqani Network, Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, D-Company, and their affiliates. The two sides further reaffirmed their commitment to ongoing and future cooperation to ensure a stable cyberspace environment and to prevent cyber-attacks.

Partners in the Indo-Pacific and Beyond:

The Ministers reviewed cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region, noting that the common principles for the region articulated in the India-U.S. Joint Statement of June 2017 have been further amplified by President Donald Trump at Danang, Vietnam on November 10, 2017, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Singapore at the Shangri-La Dialogue on June 1, 2018. Both sides committed to work together and in concert with other partners toward advancing a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific region, based on recognition of ASEAN centrality and on respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, rule of law, good governance, free and fair trade, and freedom of navigation and overflight. Noting the importance of infrastructure and

Connectivity for the Indo-Pacific region, both sides emphasized the need to work collectively with other partner countries to support transparent, responsible, and sustainable debt financing practices in infrastructure development.

The Ministers reaffirmed their shared commitment to a united, sovereign, democratic, inclusive, stable, prosperous, and peaceful Afghanistan. The two sides expressed support for an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned peace and reconciliation process. The United States acknowledged India's longstanding and ongoing contributions of economic assistance to Afghanistan and also welcomed India's enhanced role in Afghanistan's development and stabilization.

India welcomed the recent U.S.-North Korea summit. The two sides pledged to work together to counter North Korea's weapons of mass destruction programs and to hold accountable those countries that have supported them.

The United States welcomed India's accession to the Australia Group, the Wassenaar Arrangement, and the Missile Technology Control Regime and reiterated its full support for India's immediate accession to the Nuclear Suppliers Group.

Promoting Prosperity and People-to-People Ties:

The Ministers recognized the importance and the potential for increasing bilateral trade, investment, innovation, and job creation in both countries. Both sides committed to further expanding and balancing the trade and economic partnership consistent with their leaders' 2017 joint statement, including by facilitating trade, improving market access, and addressing issues of interest to both sides. In this regard, both sides welcomed the ongoing exchanges between the Ministry of Commerce of India and the Office of the United States Trade Representative and hoped for mutually acceptable outcomes.

Both sides looked forward to full implementation of the civil nuclear energy partnership and collaboration between Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) and Westinghouse Electric Company for the establishment of six nuclear power plants in India.

Observing the strong ties of family, education, and business, and the spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation that unite their people, the Ministers highlighted the unmatched people-to-people ties between their countries and recognized the benefits to both nations and the world from these ties, including the free flow of ideas and collaboration in health, space, oceans, and other areas of science and technology.

The next 2+2 meeting is to be held in the United States in 2019.

Nearby was a small pair of rubber boots, sized to fit an 8-year-old.

Taped to the wall were three photos, alternately smiling and serious, bearing a simple epitaph for the boy whose memory the makeshift altar honored: ""Felipe Gomez Alonzo. Died Dec. 24 2018 in New Mexico, United States.''

On Christmas Eve, Felipe became the second Guatemalan child this month to die while in US custody near the Mexican border. The deaths prompted widespread criticism of President Donald Trump, who has sought to deflect responsibility toward Democrats even as his Homeland Security secretary vowed additional health screenings for detained migrant children.

In the boy's village of Yalambojoch, in western Guatemala, the political fallout in the United States seemed a world away and there was only deep sadness over his death. Relatives said they had no idea that such a tragedy could occur. Nor had they heard about U.S. policies that led to thousands of migrant children being separated from their parents earlier this year.

""We don't have a television. We don't have a radio,'' Catarina Gomez, Felipe's sister, said Saturday. ""We didn't know what had happened before.''

The hamlet, set on a plain and surrounded by spectacular, pine-covered mountains, is a place of crushing poverty and lack of opportunity, home to a single small school, dirt roads that become impassible during the rainy season and rudimentary homes without insulation, proper flooring, water or electricity.

The community is populated by families who fled to Mexico during the bloodiest years of Guatemala's 1960-1996 civil war but returned after the signing of peace accords. There are no jobs, and people live off meager subsistence farming and local commerce. Residents say the Guatemalan government has turned a blind eye to their plight, a complaint that can be heard in other impoverished villages in the country.

Felipe's sister, Catarina, said that in recent years ""everyone started heading for the United States,'' so much so that a local project to boost education financed with Swedish help was abandoned because there were practically no more young people to take the classes.

It was extreme poverty and lack of opportunity that drove Felipe's father, Agustin Gomez, to decide that he and the boy would set off for the United States. Others from the community had been able to cross the US border with children, and he figured they would have the same luck. Felipe was chosen because he was the oldest son. It didn't occur to anyone that the journey could be dangerous.

""I didn't think of that, because several families had already left and they made it,'' the boy's mother, Catarina Alonzo said, speaking in the indigenous Chuj language as her stepdaughter translated into Spanish.

Felipe was healthy when they left, according to the family. The last time he spoke with his mother was a day before they were taken into detention by border agents. Felipe told her he was well, that he had eaten chicken, that the next time they talked would be by phone from the United States.

Instead, the call that came Christmas Day was from her husband, who said Felipe had died the day before.

The two had been apprehended a week earlier, on December 18, near the Paso del Norte bridge connecting El Paso, Texas, to Juarez, Mexico, according to border officials. Father and son were held at the bridge's processing center and then the Border Patrol station in El Paso before being transferred on Dec. 23 to a facility in Alamogordo, New Mexico, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) away.

After an agent noticed Felipe coughing, father and son were taken to an Alamogordo hospital, where Felipe was found to have a 103-degree fever (39.4 degrees Celsius), officials have said.

Felipe was held for observation for 90 minutes, according to US Customs and Border Protection, before being released with prescriptions for amoxicillin and ibuprofen.

But the boy fell sick hours later and was admitted to the hospital on Christmas Eve. He died just before midnight.

New Mexico authorities said late Thursday that an autopsy showed Felipe had the flu, but more tests need to be done before a cause of death can be determined.

The other Guatemalan child, 7-year-old Jakelin Caal, died Dec. 8 in El Paso. She showed signs of sepsis, a potentially fatal condition brought on by infection, according to officials.

On Saturday, Trump claimed that Felipe and Jakelin were ""very sick'' before they reached the border, though both young migrants passed initial health screenings by Border Patrol.

Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said last week that prior to this month, no child had died in the agency's custody in more than a decade.

On Sunday he called for a ""multifaceted solution'' on immigration, including not only better border security and new immigration laws but more aid to the Central American countries the migrants are fleeing from.

Referring to the US pledge earlier this month of $5.8 billion in development aid for Central America, McAleenan called it ''a tremendous step forward.''

""There are green shoots of progress both on security and the economic front in Central America. We need to foster that and help improve the opportunities to stay at home,'' he said on ABC's ""This Week.''

Outside the Gomez family home in Yalambojoch, women gathered wearing lavender skirts in the intricate patterns typical of indigenous garb in Guatemala. Colorful tapestries hung on a clothesline above the muddy yard.

Taped to the door were a pair of Felipe's artworks. One was a rendering of a blue balloon with a green string; in the other, a white horse jumped over a fence against a yellow sun and tangerine sky.

Among the villagers grieving Felipe's death was his 7-year-old best friend, Kevin. Two days before Felipe and his dad left, the two boys quarreled.

""They were crying because they had fought,'' said Felipe's sister, Catarina.

By the time Kevin came back to look for his friend, he had left for the United States. Kevin now knows that Felipe has died, the family said.

Trying to fight back tears, Catarina Alonzo said her son promised before leaving that when he was grown, he would work to send money home. Felipe also wanted to buy her a cellphone so she could see pictures of him from afar.

Now she hopes for only two things: That Felipe's body is returned as soon as possible for burial, and that her husband can remain in the United States to work off debt and support their other kids.

The Guatemalan Consulate in Phoenix has said that Agustin Gomez was released on a humanitarian license allowing him to remain in the United States for now. Felipe's body is expected to be sent back to Guatemala around mid-January."

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been gloating over The Accidental Prime Minister, a Vijay Ratnakar Gutte-directed film on former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's tenure. The ruling party, in a tweet, described the movie as a ""riveting tale of how a family held the country to ransom for 10 long years.""

Many wouldn't argue with the BJP on the verity of the dual power centres during the UPA regime, which left it riven and tottering.

Narendra Modi is not an accidental prime minister, his predecessor Singh was. But the current NDA regime is no less hamstrung by an alternate power centre -- that is, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the BJP's ideological fountainhead.

The RSS imprint on governance is, however, taken for granted and evokes little outrage because the prime minister and many of his Cabinet colleagues are self-certified former Sangh pracharaks and volunteers. The usual reaction, therefore, is: ""Oh, tell me something new.""

Also read: Why The Accidental Prime Minister matters to 'chowkidar' Narendra Modi

But that doesn't take away the fact that the power-without-responsibility phrase -- which was once associated with the Nehru-Gandhi family -- equally aptly describes the RSS' position today. Take a look at the clout the Sangh wields in the current dispensation. Not to state the obvious, let's exclude the point about the top decision-makers among the political executive being ex-RSS karyakartas.

Let's also discount the fact that the RSS-associated think tank, Vivekanand International Foundation, provided critical resources to man powerful positions in the Modi government -- national security adviser Ajit Doval, principal secretary to the prime minister, Nripendra Mishra, and Prasar Bharati chairman A Surya Prakash, to name a few.

The RSS' inroads into the government run much deeper, in a rather insidious way. Consider the background of private secretaries, assistant private secretaries and other personal staff of union ministers. Most of them were once associated with the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the Sangh's student wing, or were trained at Surya Foundation, a Haryana-based organisation associated with the Sangh, or at RSS leader Vinay Sahasrabuddhe's Rambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini (RMP).

These gatekeepers posted in ministers' offices serve as the eyes and ears of the RSS in the corridors of power.

A similar system of gatekeeping has been replicated in chief ministers' offices in states where the BJP is in power. Himachal Pradesh chief minister Jairam Thakur, say BJP leaders from the state, was given a list with names of a political secretary, a media adviser and two officers on special duty (OSDs) by RSS leaders in Delhi for their posting in the CMO. He had no option but to comply. Rajat Sethi, a close aide of BJP general secretary and RSS leader Ram Madhav, was appointed political adviser to Jharkhand chief minister Raghubar Das.

Sethi had done his schooling from the RSS-run Shishu Mandir and gone on to study at IIT-Kharagpur and Harvard before joining Madhav's team in Assam. Das had to comply with the Sangh's wish to hire Sethi but wouldn't entertain him much.

He would often get to know through newspaper reports about how Sethi was spearheading Jharkhand's transformation.

Also read: What will Narendra Modi do if he is not PM in 2019?

Sethi soon shifted to Imphal as adviser to chief minister N Biren Singh. Another BJP chief minister told this writer that the pulls and pressures from various RSS leaders were so much that he wasn't able to decide appointments in boards, corporations and authorities.

In Uttar Pradesh, ruled by Hindutva icon Yogi Adityanath, ministers, MLAs and anybody who matters are all seen scrambling every day to meet Sunil Bansal, state BJP general secretary (organisation) and Amit Shah confidant with RSS roots.

These are only a few instances that indicate the RSS' grip on the levers of power at the Centre and in states. During the UPA regime, Sonia Gandhi was criticised for interfering in the government's policies.

In the current NDA regime, the RSS and its affiliates seldom get the credit but everyone knows who forced the Modi government to put many things on the backburner -- be it labour reforms, Air India disinvestment, FDI in multi-brand retail trade, or the national education policy.

Like the Congress' top brass during the UPA regime, the RSS loves to wield power but won't share responsibility for the lapses or reverses. US academic Walter Andersen, an authority on the RSS, was in India in August and met several Sangh leaders.

He said in an interview that the RSS says that the government has not done what it should have done in terms of job creation and instead become too allied with various 'isms' that are unsuitable to the present Indian situations.

The Sangh wouldn't share the blame for the downslide in the BJP's fortunes in the past year -- not even for its loss in the tribal belts of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh where Sangh affiliates have been working for five decades. And, the RSS would also not take the blame for replacing 'vikas' -- Modi's USP -- with 'mandir' as the BJP's trump card should the saffron party suffer electoral reverses in 2019.

That's exactly what the Congress did in 2013-14 when it saw the writing on the wall. Manmohan Singh became the fall guy as the Nehru-Gandhi family loyalists blamed his model of governance for the party's failures.

But that's how dual power centres work."

Parliament LIVE updates: The triple talaq bill is likely to be tabled in the Rajya Sabha on Monday, after the Lok Sabha passed the bill amid ruckus and an Opposition walk-out on Thursday. The Lower House had refused to refer the bill to a parliamentary select committee, as demanded by the Opposition.

In light of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill being tabled in the Rajya Sabha, the BJP and Congress have issued whips to their MPs to be present in Parliament on Monday, though the Congress had reiterated that it will not allow the proposed legislation to be passed in its present form.

All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary KC Venugopal said the party would join hands with other Opposition outfits to prevent the bill from getting passed in the Upper House, where the BJP lacks the numbers to get it passed without Opposition support.

The bill seeks to criminalise the practice of triple talaq, or instant divorce, in the Muslim community. It includes a jail term of three years for the husband pronouncing triple talaq and also makes the practice a a non-bailable offence.

Among other bills on the Rajya Sabha's agenda are the Allied and Healthcare Professions Bill, 2018, to be introduced by Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda, the National Council for Teacher Education (Amendment) Bill, 2018, the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (Amendment) Bill, 2018, and the Representation of the People (Amendment) Bill, 2018.

In the Lok Sabha, the government has listed five bills for discussion and voting, including the introduction of a Appropriation Bill, 2018. The others are the Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Bill, 2018, the National Medical Commission Bill, 2017, the Companies Amendment Bill, 2018, the New Delhi International Arbitration Centre Bill, 2018. The Centre is likely to face resistance against two of them as Opposition members have moved statutory resolutions against the Indian Medical Council Amendment Bill and the Companies Amendment Bill.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will move the second batch of supplementary demands for grants for the financial year 2018-19. If these are approved after being put to vote, he will introduce the Appropriation Bill (Bill no. 6 of 2018), which seeks authorisation to withdraw some extra funds from the consolidated fund of India for the financial year 2018-19.

New Delhi: Within the first 100 days of the BJP-led NDA coming to power in 2014, then-human resource development minister Smriti Irani had stressed on the need for a New Education Policy for India, as the one which is being followed was formulated in 1986.

Official deliberations on the new policy began in January 2015. But after two committees and a lot of consultation with various stakeholders, India is yet to see the policy, which was Narendra Modi's biggest promise in the field of education.

On 15 December, while speaking at the convocation ceremony of Goa University,

Prakash Javadekar, who is now in charge of the HRD portfolio, said a draft of the New Education Policy is ready, and the committee will submit it soon.

Sources in the ministry, however, told ThePrint the government is not likely to announce the policy in the near future.

""There are about two months left for the Model Code of Conduct to come into force, which makes the probability of the policy being announced very bleak. Though there is nothing controversial in the policy draft, it will definitely have political repercussions,"" said a source aware of the developments.

""But even if government decides to take a calculated risk and announce the policy anyway, there is nothing that it can change. A policy takes many years to implement. It should have ideally been announced in the first two years of the government, so that rest of the years could've gone in its implementation.""

A policy is not a binding law which would be applicable immediately, and mostly needs to be further deliberated upon and improvised. It is then implemented through circulars, laws and, if needed, a constitutional provision.

The HRD ministry first constituted a committee headed by eminent scientist T.S.R. Subramanian to work on the policy draft in 2015. When the committee submitted its report in May 2016, the ministry held several consultations with various stakeholders on the report's contents. In 2017, when Javadekar took over as HRD minister, the report was rejected and the committee disbanded.

The Javadekar-led ministry then formed another committee under former Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) chief K. Kasturirangan. The committee began work on the policy in July 2017, and was to submit a report by December 2017, but has so far received a number of extensions.

Those aware of the policy draft say a number of points from the Subramaniam committee's report have been used in the new policy draft. Major recommendations included improving the education system at the school level.

The committee recommended that a Teacher Entrance Test (TET) should be made compulsory, and the minimum eligibility to take admission in B.Ed. courses should be at least 50 per cent marks at the graduate level.

It also suggested that an Indian Education Service (IES) should be established as an all-India service, and the HRD Ministry should be its controlling authority.

Declaring pre-school education for children in the age group of 4 to 5 years as a right and a implementing a policy for it were also suggested.

Former education secretary Anil Swarup, who was instrumental in bringing a number of policy changes at the school education level, has questioned the need to have a uniform policy for the entire country.

""India is too diverse to consider a single mandate by way of policy for the entire country. Can a new education policy solve the problems that beset this sector? Problems vary from region to region. If policies were to solve the problems of the country, they would have all been solved long ago,"" Swarup told ThePrint.

""Instead, what is actually required is an action plan clearly outlining what needs to be done, how will it be done, who will do it, and by when. The roles of the respective entities should be clearly defined so that performance can be assessed.""

He also suggested that instead of a uniform policy, there should be state-wise policies, keeping in mind the specific demands of each state.

The ministry had already started work on two state-specific policy roadmaps, one for Uttar Pradesh and another one for Jammu and Kashmir. According to sources in the ministry, there was also a plan to have a roadmap for Bihar, but it never took off."

When volunteers visited the wedding hall with social welfare officials, the mehendi ceremony was on.

The volunteers reasoned with the parents to call off the wedding. Then officials stepped in with a warning of the legal implications. The incident happened in Podanur, a favourite locale of the British and now a buzzing residential area in the city.

This was not a one-off incident of child marriage in an urban area. In November, Childline, the NGO that operates a 24x7 helpline for children, in Coimbatore stopped nine child marriage and half of them were in city limits.

There is a perception that child marriages are something that happen in the rural hinterland. But every third child marriage in Tamil Nadu is in an urban centre. A report by National Commission for Protection of Child Rights released in September says that 36.5% of child marriages are from urban areas of the state. TN ranks fourth among states with high urban child marriage rates. Goa tops the list with 77% of child marriages in the state happening in urban areas followed by Mizoram and Haryana.

""We have stopped a lot of child marriages within the city from places including Ramanathapuram, Irugur, Ondipudur and Athupalam,'' says S Umadevi, Coimbatore district coordinator of Childline.

Child rights activists say this trend started about 10 years ago, partly because of the influx of rural folk, who brought with them age-old customs. But even among urban populations this trend is picking up. While deep-rooted socio-cultural practices, matriarchal prejudices and economic factors drive parents in rural areas to marry off their daughters before the legal age, what prompts urban parents to marry off their minor children? Economic factors are key to urban child marriages. But equally, urban parents marry off their daughters early fearing they will fall in love with boys from different castes or that they will face sexual harassment, say activists who have counselled families.

Parents of Malathi (name changed) from Radha Nagar in Tirupur said they decided to marry off their daughter when she was studying in Class XI after they saw her speaking to a boy in 2015. ""We felt she would elope,"" said her father. But social welfare department officials intervened and stopped the marriage. After counselling, Malathi promised to pursue higher education. Now she is in the second year of her BCom course. ""In Chennai, we found most of the child marriages happen in the slums,'' says Girija Kumarababu, honorary general secretary of Indian Council for Child Welfare, Tamil Nadu.

""More than 90% of parents of child brides in Chennai say there is no protection for their daughters. When both parents are working, there is no supervision of children in slums where the tenements are so close to each other,'' she said. ICCW analysed 1,156 child marriages stopped in Chennai and found that poor economic conditions of the girl's family, concern for her safety and feat that she would have an affair were cited as reasons. There were instances of marriages planned with the consent of the minor, but in a large number of cases the child's consent was not obtained. ""Child marriage takes an emotional toll on the girl. Early pregnancy and child birth also have adverse effects on the health of mother and child,'' says a social welfare department officer.

In Tamil Nadu, a significant number of child marriages are reported in southern and western districts in rural and tribal areas. In villages, marrying within blood relatives is still prevalent, where a girl will be wedded to her maternal uncle. Caste and social status as well as bids to retain property within the family are reasons why parents force early marriages. But over the past decade, rural child marriages are coming down while the graph is rising in urban areas.

""Some 60% to 70 % of child marriages in urban areas are because of safety concerns. Parents feel protection mechanism is inadequate,'' said Andrew Sesuraj, state convener of Tamil Nadu Child Rights Observatory. Activists say a multi-pronged approach should be adopted to curb child marriage. A close watch and timely action is imperative, but long term action such as building awareness on the health implications of early marriage, which results in immediate pregnancy and financial burden, should be carried out, say activists."

The newly formed Congress government in Rajasthan has decided to restore right to contest, improve benefits under social security schemes and review change in textbooks that were made during previous BJP government. In the first cabinet meeting held on Saturday, chief minister Ashok Gehlot reversed the key decisions taken by the previous Vasundhara Raje government in the state. While handing over the party's manifesto to the chief secretary, the cabinet unanimously decided that it would be the policy document of the state government and a cabinet committee would be constituted to ensure its effective implementation. The key takeaways of the meeting included reopening of Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar Law University and Haridev Joshi University of Journalism and Mass Communication that were closed by the Raje government, elimination of the provision of minimum educational qualification in the Panchayati Raj elections, and removal of Deendayal Upadhyay logo from official documents. To effectively execute its loan waiver announcement, the Gehlot government decided to constitute an inter-departmental committee to waive the short-term crop loan. The chief minister has been authorised to nominate members in the said committee that will set the eligibility criteria for the waiver in cooperative banks, nationalised banks, and regional rural and land development banks. Putting an emphasis on the social security schemes, the government announced increment in the pension received by old-age, widow and disabled persons under its old-age pension scheme. The Congress, while in opposition, had called out the Raje-led BJP government for halting the pension of eligible beneficiaries. ""For the past five years, the Raje government didn't increase the pension that was previously set by our government. Keeping in mind the present scenario, we have increased the pension from Rs 500 to Rs 750 for men and women above 55 years of age and from Rs 750 to Rs 1000 for the pensioners in the age bracket of 75 years and above,"" Master Bhawarlal Meghwal, minister of social justice and empowerment in the Rajasthan government, told The Wire. ALSO READ: Rajasthan Cabinet turns manifesto into policy doc, to ensure implementation The state council also decided to constitute a committee for resolving the issues of the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) workers, para-teachers, Urdu para-teachers, anganwadi workers, education workers, panchayat assistants and a few others working on a contractual basis in state. During Raje's tenure earlier this year, several NRHM who showed black flags to PM Narendra Modi demanding permanent employment were arrested for 'sloganeering' and 'obstructing police personnel in discharging their duties'. The government also decided to abolish the criteria set by the previous BJP government for the educational qualification of candidates for panchayati raj and local body elections to ensure each person gets a right to contest elections. The state government under the BJP had brought in an ordinance a few days ahead of panchayat polls in 2014 making it mandatory for candidates contesting zila parishad and panchayat samiti polls to be Class X pass and those contesting sarpanch elections to be class VIII pass. In the scheduled areas, the criteria was class V pass. It later led to an amendment to the Rajasthan Panchayati Raj Act, 1994. Civil society members who have been consistently fighting to restore the right to contest have welcomed the step. ""The law was discriminatory and elitist.

It was maliciously brought in Rajasthan to break the Congress control over the panchayats. After its implementation, 65% of the elected representatives were under 35 and it completely ruled out the older people and tribals who had no adequate means for education. The law was basically brought in to woo the youth, the only base of the Bhartiya Janta Party in rural areas,"" Kavita Srivastava, Rajasthan president of the People's Union for Civil Liberties, told The Wire."

Meanwhile, in another resolution, the ABVP demanded that the process of appointment of regular teachers on vacant posts should be started immediately, adding that short-term ad hoc and contract-based appointments were atrocities to the long term vision of cosmopolitan education.

The students' outfit also criticised the semester system, claiming that these are the demands that have been received by maximum number of students.

Chauhan demanded that consideration of semester system as a standard system by National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) and mandatory implementation of this semester system in colleges with lack of infrastructure makes it a compulsion and binding should be removed."

After all, no parties truly representative of the people have tangible presence in the elections. Those in power are seeking votes to come to power again. They were in the government for the last 10 years and want to cling to power for yet another five years. Records say no election held under a ruling government has been fair, for which the caretaker government evolved. This time there is no caretaker government, there is the ruling party. And they have craftily used every tool and advantage they have created over the past 10 years.

There was apprehension that the opposition would not participate in the polls in the face of government repression, attacks, and the spree of cases and arrests. However, joining the election was a matter of survival for the opposition. If they did not participate in the polls, the registration of the major opposition party may have been cancelled.

Questions remain regarding the ideological stance of the two parties and their alliances. The government promises development if elected. But this development is an expansion of inequity. The development benefits just a handful of people. They are getting rich quick and siphoning money abroad. What does this development mean to the 80 per cent who are deprived? The development is being brought about by the toiling masses, yet they are the ones most deprived.

Meanwhile, the opposition promises a revival of democracy. But democracy does not depend on votes alone. The main purpose of democracy is ensuring people's rights and creating equal opportunities. But are they listening to the people?

This election perfectly unveils the ugly face of the bourgeois politics. As for the the power of money, enough has been said.

What about the turncoats? What caused them to pull out? Badruddoza Chowdhury's move was quite a shocker. He had been a tough critic of Awami League's ideology, but now he has joined the the Awami 'boat'. Yet, he came to politics through Ziaur Rahman. He was the first secretary general of the BNP. He had become MP, minister and was elected as a president of the country as part of the BNP-led government. BNP stood for Bangladeshi nationalism and he was committed to that ideology. On the other hand, Awami League believes in Bangali nationalism.

This election has unveiled opportunism in its naked form. Enam Ahmed Chowdhury was the latest case. There had been speculations that he would contest in the elections from BNP. When he did not get the BNP ticket, he did a U-turn and immediately joined Awami League.

So why were they with BNP in the first place? Simply for personal gains? Enam Ahmed Chowdhury had been chairman of the privatisation board during the BNP's regime. The key 'achievement' of the board was shutting down Adamjee Jute Mills. That was most damaging to the country. But he termed the jute mill as a python that would swallow everything up unless destroyed. He joined the politics at the end of his bureaucratic career and has now he has changed parties. He is more concerned about private rather than public interests.

This time the ruling camp can't smear their opposition as anti-liberation as many in the opposition camp fought in the liberation was and are celebrated freedom fighters. And both the camps have war criminals. BNP has drawn up a list of 22 'war criminals' who are contesting the polls from Awami League (Prothom Alo, 25 December 2018). Also, both camps include Islamic parties in their respective coalitions. The hidden 'ideology' of both sides is nothing but 'opportunism'.

It is only natural that the people in the government will work for the government. This election is no exception. The administration went all out to ensure the ruling party faced no obstacles. Even former civil servants and former military men called upon the prime minister and wished her success in the elections. It is not unusual for the administration and law enforcement to support the government. But if they get involved in the political activities of the ruling party, that does not bode well for the public interests and security.

Businessmen declared they wanted the current government to continue in power to keep up the pace of development. They are the part of the development and some of them have impressed their world with their achievements. But they are not keeping their wealth in the country. They simply siphon it abroad.

A huge amount of the election expenditure will go to the hands of the unemployed youth. These are the 'lumpen' who are not loyal to any political party, only to money.

This development is not generating employment. The development, founded on labour of the people, is just widening the gap. The rulers should have been most alarmed by the unemployment. The 'lumpen' are given the money during the elections, but when they will see the money going away, they will turn to crime. The number of drug addicts will increase and there is no guarantee that already high number of murders and rapes will not increase in the future.

Islamic parties are gaining ground. We know about the atrocities of Jamaat-e-Islami. But the way Hefazat-e-Islam is advancing in the political arena and garnering support is dangerous too.

The people of Dhaka saw their atrocities during the Shahbag movement. Some of their demands are despicable. They want a blasphemy law as in Pakistan. It could hardly be imagined that such a demand could be made in a secular country like Bangladesh. Yet this group is being given priority. Some objectionable changes have been made in the text books at their behest. Their education degrees have been given equal status as university degrees.

None of this is good news. The wealthy people of the country realize this and are investing in their future abroad. They donate money to Qawmi madrasa education at home, but send their children abroad. These youth will return. Many of them have gone abroad for the elections, to watch the polls from a safe distance. In fact, this has caused quite a crisis in airline tickets. (Banik Barta, 25 December 2018).

The bottom line is, things must change. We need to replace individual ownership with collective ownership. The country's leftists should lead the way. The problem is, the leftists are not strong enough. They are not given the space. The government dislikes them and the media is totally against them as the owners of the media houses are all for the private ownership. Ironically, the Islamic political groups have the same mindset for which they too are growing in strength.

Most of the people believe that only the 'boat' and 'sheaf of paddy' will survive in politics. Given the circumstances, I doubt the 'sheaf of paddy' has any future. Then who will Awami League's next competitors? Leftists have no chance either, as the bourgeois do not want to see them in place. In that case, Islamic parties will fill the gap. That will not be good in any way. We surely cannot let Bangladesh become the Middle East. It is imperative to emerge from this frustration, unite and stand up against the system."

In the IPS cadre, sources said this time officers belonging to the 1994 batch are eligible for promotion to Additional Director General (ADG) rank. Mumbai's Joint Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Deven Bharti is among those in line for promotion. Others include Ashutosh Dumbare, Dr Sukhwinder Singh, Anup Kumar, Vineet Agarwal and Ramanand Bharma. Meanwhile, IPS officers belonging to the 2001 batch are eligible for promotion to Inspector General of Police rank.

Scoring A Home Run

Politicians are not the only ones who are reluctant to give up perks of office, especially spacious government accommodations, long after they have demitted office. Tales abound in the corridors of power on how several retired bureaucrats, including some who haven't even been accommodated by the government in post-retirement positions, have clung onto official accommodations in violation of norms.

Lectured

This past week, a senior bureaucrat suffered the ignominy of being lectured by his senior in front of representatives of the Maratha Kranti Morcha. Sources said while the CMO had directed the MKM representatives to meet the bureaucrat, he'd left his office leaving them waiting. Objecting to this, they raised the matter with a senior official. The bureaucrat was then recalled and had to sit for the meeting.

Serving A Message

Eknath Khadse may be sulking, but the former minister hasn't lost his acerbic sense of humour. With the BJP leadership having to bear intense ribbing after the poll debacle in the heartland states, Khadse did not miss the opportunity to make himself heard. Eyebrows were raised when Khadse last week stated that permanent loyalty to a party cannot be taken for granted in politics, at a function where senior Congress leader Ulhas Patil publicly offered him support to switch over to his party."

When they all wore black attire and accorded a celebratory welcome to actor Salim Kumar to their campus a few months ago, the students of C.H. Mohammed Koya College for Advanced Study in Varkala would not have imagined that the attire would lead a news channel to brand them as terrorists, much later.

A short video of the college annual day celebration, which took place on March 14 this year, was telecast on a television channel on Friday, as the ""latest example of Islamic State-Al Qaeda terrorism taking root on Kerala campuses"". However, officials of the Ayiroor police station dismissed these allegations and said it was a harmless celebration. Actor Salim Kumar too came out sharply criticising the report.

""The students had invited me to the college and told me that I should wear black as it was also a tribute to my character in CID Moosa. They welcomed me at the junction near the college, with all of them in black, accompanying me as a procession,"" he says.

""It is unfortunate that it has been twisted this way because it is a Muslim management college. The students did not indulge in any sloganeering as claimed by the channel. It is also funny that all the students have been branded as terrorists. Even I was wearing black. Today, the channel came to interview me and I told them what had happened,"" Salim Kumar says.

According to Ayiroor SI Sajeev, there was nothing provocative in the celebration organised by the students.

""Following the report, we had visited the college. We also inspected the toilets as the television report claimed that these had suspicious drawings supporting terrorism. We found only typical drawings found on campuses, with danger signs, pirate faces, and other scribblings. The video of the celebration also did not have anything suspicious,"" he says.

A. Shaheer, General Secretary of the Muslim Education Trust for Coastal Area that runs the college, says the college will initiate legal action against the defamatory report.

""It is suspicious how they had made up this story based on an old celebratory video. The flags shown in the video are our own department's flags, not IS flags as claimed in the report. More than 75% of our faculty and a majority of the students are from communities other than Muslim. We are a secular institution. Today, all of the old students had to be summoned to the college to give statements to the Intelligence Bureau and the Special Branch.

The selection procedure would involve a written test, an interview and teaching demonstration in a classroom.

The total vacancies include 175 Secondary Grade teachers, 193 B.T. Assistants, and 108 Post Graduate Assistants, who will be recruited for a monthly salary of ₹8,000, ₹9,000 and ₹10,000 respectively.

The GO said that priority must be given to eligible Scheduled Caste (SC) or Scheduled Tribe (ST) candidates belonging to the village where the particular school having vacancy is located.

He justified the allocation of portfolios, saying it was a ""well-thought out"" exercise and has been ""welcomed"" by the people.

The newly inducted Rajasthan ministers were allocated portfolios, with Chief Minister Gehlot keeping nine departments, including the key finance and home, with himself, in an exercise late Wednesday night.

Speaking to mediapersons here, Gehlot said, ""The first meeting of new Rajasthan state Cabinet will be held on December 28, which is the Congress foundation day, and the new government would make a good start on this day.""

He also rejected claims that there were differences within the state Congress over portfolio distribution and said a united Congress will help provide good governance in the state.

""We have taken a well-thought out decision, which the people have welcomed,"" he told reporters when asked about alleged differences within the state Congress over portfolio allocation.

He also brushed aside criticism over alleged delay in Cabinet formation, saying ""It takes two-three days in Cabinet formation and the portfolios were handed over within two days in the state""

In Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra when the BJP came to power, it took them seven-nine days to announce chief ministers, he said.

""We will provide good governance, improve law and order and move towards fulfilling the hopes and aspirations of the youth, which are some big challenges before us,"" he said.

The BJP government, he alleged, had ""blocked"" several big decisions of the previous Congress government and said his party would not emulate them.

""We won't block any good decision of the outgoing Raje government. The good work of the Vasundharaji's government, we will not block them in public interest.""

He said his government will take up all projects that can improve infrastructure and address problems of water, electricity, education, health and road. ""Our endeavour would be to provide growth in the state at a fast pace.""

The Rajasthan chief minister said the Congress government in the state has taken a big decision by waiving farm loans and it has been welcomed by all.

He alleged the state suffered due to ""mis-governance and misrule"" of the Raje government, which, he claimed did not deliver any development work despite getting a huge mandate.

Gehlot said the state Congress had already started preparations for the Lok Sabha elections and a meeting with PCC chief Sachin Pilot and AICC general secretary in-charge for the state Avinash Pande has already taken place.

He also expressed hope that a 'maha gathbandhan' (grand alliance) of opposition parties would soon be formed to take on and defeat the BJP, which he claimed was working to satisfy ""public perception"" and not doing any sincere and concrete work.

""Rahul Gandhi ji has said that we will exert pressure on the prime minister to waive farm loans as farmers were the most harassed, besides the youth of the country, whose aspirations were left unfulfilled.

""If this government comes again, then there is a threat to the country, the country's democracy and its Constitution. All opposition parties feel this and we are hopeful the 'maha gathbandhan' will be formed soon and will be successful,"" he said.

Gehlot said the Modi government will be remembered as a ""jumlon ki sarkar"" (a government of rhetoric) as it has only made promises and not fulfilled any, ""which the people have realised now"".

Prime Minister Modi has been claiming that farmers' income will be doubled by 2022, but his mandate is only till May 2019, Gehlot said. ""And it (the farmers' income) should have risen by at least three-fourths by now.""

Referring to Nitin Gadkari's recent remark that the BJP ""leadership"" should own up to ""defeat and failures"" also, days after his party lost polls in three states, Gehlot said, ""Maybe some more BJP leaders should speak their hearts out in the party's interest before the NDA government goes out of power,"" he said.

It is a worrying factor as the quality of teaching that they impart may be poor,"" said M Padmanabh Reddy, secretary of the forum.

An RTI appeal by a citybased civil society had revealed that of the 878 teachers and headmasters, working in government schools across the state, highest number of teachers i.e. 345 with fake degrees hail from Medak. In some cases, the teachers even produced certificates of nonexistent courses from distance universities.

Officials said that most certificates submitted by the teachers were of bachelor of education and master of arts (English literature) and forged by unscrupulous elements. Some teachers even got away with forging certificates of different Vidhyapeeths that are not competent to issue certificates."

Governor ESL Narasimhan asked to expedite fake certificate case","The New Indian Express",FALSE,"HYDERABAD: With no action taken on the decade-old case of 878 government school teachers submitting fake education qualification certificates, M Padmanabha Reddy, Secretary of Forum for Good Governance, wrote a letter to Governor ESL Narasimhan on Friday, urging him to instruct the investigating authorities to expedite the enquiry process and file the charge sheets.

Pointing out in his letter that these teachers who submitted the fake certificates are presently working in government schools, Reddy said the future of the students cannot be left in the hands of teachers who neither have the knowledge nor any moral values.

Pointing out the flaws in the ongoing investigation, Reddy said that the CID, since 2013, is yet to initiate any action due to lack of clarification from the UGC on the issue.

'Clear case of cheating'

Pointing out to the ridiculousness of the reasoning, as UGC is a body that deals with universities and not schools, Reddy said in his letter: ""It is not clear in what way the UGC comes into the picture in the criminal case of getting jobs with fake certificates. It is a clear case of cheating and forgery.

The persons involved should have been suspended and criminal prosecution launched."" Along with CID enquiring into the issue, the DSE had also ordered all District Education Officers to enquire against the 878 teachers. Years later the DSE still awaits reports on the issue and has not bothered to weed out the teachers who got jobs on the basis of fake certificates."

Under pressure from within the party and also among the Muslim community at large, League supremo Panakkad Hyderali Shihab Thangal sought an explanation from Kunhalikutty on the matter. The unusual move is seen as a jolt to the predominance Kunhalikutty enjoys in the party.

According to League sources, party state president Thangal sought clarification from Kunhalikutty in his capacity as president of the IUML national political affairs committee. It is learnt Thangal conveyed to Kunhalikutty that his absence from Parliament was a serious lapse. Sources said Thangal's move was on basis of majority opinion within the party's top leadership. Sadiqali Shihab Thangal, the IUML Malappuram unit chief, did not hide his displeasure over Kunhalikutty's absence. ""The party has taken a note of the incident as a serious lapse. The explanation has been sought due to the lack of caution exercised on the matter,"" said Thangal.

The rare move by Thangal has taken many in the party by surprise. However, owing to Kunhalikutty's dominance in the League IUML, leaders were restrained in their response. ""Thangal is the supreme leader of the party. If there is any issue in connection with the party, he may have asked for a clarification to know the exact facts. The person concerned just has to explain the facts,"" the party's other MP E T Mohammad Basheer said.

It perhaps for the first time in recent history that a senior leader of such stature has been pulled up by the Thangal family. Earlier, when Kunhalikutty was in the dock for skipping the election to the vice-president post, similar demands had emerged for seeking an explanation from the IUML strongman. Sensing a chance to corner the IUML, newly-inducted LDF partner INL took out a march to Kunhalikutty's house in Malappuram.

Jaleel faces protests from MYL workers, clashes break out at Kalpakanchery

Malappuram: Clashes erupted at Kalpakanchery after Youth League(MYL) activists blocked Higher Education Minister K T Jaleel and waved a black flag at him. The minister was here at Paravannur to lay the foundation stone of the new hi-tech block of GLP School.

Around 30 Youth League activists blocked the road while the minister arrived to attend the function. This was followed by clashes between CPM and DYFI activists with Youth League activists. And the police resorted into lathi charge in order to disperse the protesters. After attending the function, Jaleel was accompanied by CPM and DYFI activists who took him by foot to Kadungathukundu, a few kilometres away from Paravannur.

Taking note of the possible protests and clash, more than 50 police personnel were deployed at the spot.The UDF had already announced non-cooperation venting ire against not inviting local MLA C Mammootty to the programme. They alleged the school got the new block after efforts were taken by the Tirur MLA. The Kalpakanchery police have registered a case against 150 Youth League activists for blocking the minister and waving a black flag.

MP remains unfazed

Unfazed by the storm building up over him, Kunhalikutty told mediapersons in Dubai that he skipped Parliament not to attend a wedding but to attend a meeting in connection with the party's mouthpiece Chandrika. He said these facts have been stated in his explanation to Hyderali Shihab Thangal. Kunhalikutty added he would not have skipped Parliament had he known that voting would take place on the Bill on Thursday. He added that he left Delhi after evolving a strategy to be adopted on the Triple Talaq Bill in consultation with E T Mohammad Basheer."

Whether it is the life of a person, life of a nation, or the lifespan of a society, inspiration, is the basis of progress. Come, imbued with renewed inspiration, renewed zeal, renewed resolution, new accomplishments, loftier goals - let's move on, keep moving, change oneself and change the country too.

My Dear countrymen, Namaskar. The year 2018 is about to conclude. We shall soon enter 2019. At such a juncture, it is natural to reflect on the year gone by; it is equally so, to hear about resolutions for the year being ushered in. Whether it be the life of an individual, the life of a society at large or the life of a Nation collectively, everybody has to look back & ponder; at the same time one has to try & look forward to the best extent possible. Only then can the gains of experience be availed of, only then can one's self-confidence renew further. What exactly should we do in order to ensure a change in our lives, simultaneously contributing our bit in taking our country & society forward? Many good wishes to all of you for the year 2019. You must have wondered how to keep 2018 etched in your memory! It is important to bear in mind HOW India as a country, as a collective entity powered by the might of a hundred & thirty crore people remembers the year 2018; something that swells our hearts with pride.

The year 2018 saw the launching of the world's biggest health insurance scheme 'Ayushman Bharat'. Electricity reached each & every village of the country this year. Noted world institutions have accepted that the country has taken strides in the area of poverty alleviation at a record pace. On account of the unwavering resolve of our countrymen, swachchata, sanitation coverage is rapidly advancing towards crossing the 95% mark.

After Independence, for the first time ever, the tricolor was hoisted at Red Fort on the 75th anniversary of the formation of the Azad Hind Government. In honour of SardarVallabhbhai Patel who bonded the entire country around a common thread of unity, India witnessed the coming up of the tallest statue in the world, 'Statue of Unity'. The country secured a place of pride & glory in the entire world. The highest United Nations Environment Award 'Champions of the Earth' was conferred upon India. The world duly took notice of India's efforts in the areas of Solar Energy & Climate Change. The first General Assembly of the International Solar Alliance was held in India. It is due to our collective efforts that our country has seen unprecedented improvement in the 'Ease of doing business' rankings. The country's self defence mechanism got further reinforced. It was during this very year that our country has successfully accomplished the Nuclear Triad, which means we are now armed with nuclear capabilities-in water, on land and in the sky as well. Daughters of the country have done her proud by circumnavigating the globe through the NavikaSagarParikrama. India's first inland waterway was launched in Varanasi. This has laid the foundation of a new revolution in the waterways sector. The longest rail-road bridge, Bogibeel Bridge was dedicated to the Nation- Sikkim's first & India's hundredth airport, Pakyong commenced operations. India scripted a thumping win in the under- 19 Cricket World Cup and the Blind Cricket World Cup. This time, India clinched a large number of medals in the Asian Games. India also performed very well in the Para Asian Games too. By the way, if I continue enumerating examples of the Purusharth, the character & the mettle of Indians, or those of our collective endeavour, this episode of Mann Ki Baat will go on and on, perhaps to the point when 2019 makes an entry! And all this has been possible due to the relentless efforts of a 130 crore countrymen. I sincerely hope that India's journey on the path of advancement & progress continues through 2019 too. Taking her to newer heights with her inner strengths.

My dear countrymen, this December we had to bear the loss of some extraordinary, exemplary countrymen. On the 19th of December, Dr. Jayachandran passed away in Chennai. People fondly called him 'MakkalMaaruthuvar' since he had a special place in their hearts. Dr. Jayachandran was known for his efforts of making the most economical treatment possible available to the poor. People tell us that he would be ever ready & eager, when it came to treatment of patients. In the case of elderly patients, he would even bear the cost of their travelling to and fro. On the betterindia.com website, I have read about many of his endeavours that serve as an inspiration to society.

On similar lines, on the 25th of December, I learnt of the loss of SulagittiNarsamma in Karnataka. SulagittiNarsamma was a midwife, aiding pregnant women during childbirth. In Karnataka, especially in far-off, remote places, thousands of women availed of her services. In the beginning of this year, she was honoured with a Padma Shri. There are many exemplary personalities such as Dr. Jaya Chandran and SulagittiNarsamma, who dedicated their lives to the welfare of all in society. Since we are referring to healthcare, I would like to mention the social endeavour of doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh. Recently, I was told by some of our party workers that a few young doctors in the town set up camps offering free treatment for the underprivileged. Every month, the Heart Lungs Critical Centre there organizes such camps, where free diagnosis and treatment for a host of ailments is done. Every month, hundreds of poor patients are benefitting from these camps. The dedication of these doctor friends engaged in selfless service is truly worthy of praise. Today, I'm saying it with pride that it was collective efforts that made the 'Swachch Bharat Mission' a successful campaign. I was told that a few days ago, in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, over three lakh people came together to work for the sanitation campaign.

In this 'Mahayagya', grand undertaking, the Municipal Corporation, voluntary bodies, School- College students, the people of Jabalpur; in fact everyone participated with enthusiasm & Zest. I just referred to the betterindia.com, where I got to read about Dr. Jaya Chandran. Whenever I get the opportunity, I visit the better India website and try to know more about such shining, inspiring deeds. I am glad to observe that these days, there are many websites apprising us of inspiring life- stories of such remarkable gems. Just as thepoitiveindia.com is doing great work in spreading positivity and infusing more sensitivity into society. Similarly, success stories of young innovators & entrepreneurs are women beautifully on yourstory.com. In the same way, you can easily learn the Sanskrit language sitting at home through samskritabharati.in. Can we join hands in one endeavour?.. Let us share such websites amongst ourselves. Let's come together to make positivity viral.

I do believe that by doing so more and more people will get to know about our heroes who brought a change in society. Spreading negativity is fairly easy. But some really good work is being done around us, in our society. And all this has been possible through the collective efforts of a 130 crore countrymen.

Sports has its own significance in every society. When a game is being played, the spectators too experience a rush of energy in their beings. We observe name, fame and laurels when it comes to sportspersons. But, at times, in the background, there exist many things that are much higher, much greater than the world of sports. Let me tell you about one of our daughters from Kashmir who won a gold medal in a Karate Championship in Korea. Hanaya is 12 years old and lives in Anantnag, Kashmir. Hanaya trained hard in Karate with perseverance & fervor, studied its nuances and proved herself. On behalf of all countrymen, I wish her a bright future. Best wishes and blessings to Hanaya. Similarly, the media discussed extensively about the 16 year old Rajani. You too must have read it. Rajani has won a gold medal at the Junior Women's Boxing Championship. The moment Rajani won the medal she rushed to a nearby milk stall & drank a glass of milk. After that, she wrapped a cloth around the medal & kept it in a bag. You must be wondering why Rajani did that ! She did it in honour of her father Jasmer Singh ji who sells lassi, at a stall in Panipat. According to Rajani, her father has sacrificed a lot, undergone hardships to help her reach where she is. Early every morning, Jasmer Singh used to leave for work before Rajani and her siblings woke up. When Rajani approached her father, expressing her wish to learn boxing, he encouraged her, arranging for whatever possible resources that he could. Rajani had to start her training in boxing with old gloves, since those days, the family was not too well, financially. Despite so many hurdles, Rajani did not lose heart & went ahead with her training in boxing. She has won a medal in Serbia too. My best wishes and blessings to Rajani. I also congratulate her parents Jasmer Singh ji and Usha Rani Ji for supporting & encouraging Rajani. This very month, 20 year old Vedangi Kulkarni from Pune became the fastest Asian to traverse the globe riding a bicycle. She rode for 159 days, covering around 300 kilometres every day. Just imagine... 300 kms of cycling every day ! Her passion for cycling is indeed commendable. Don't news of such achievements, such accomplishments inspire us? Especially my young friends, when we hear about such feats, we derive inspiration to touch heights despite obstacles.

If your resolve is strong, if your fervor, your enthusiasm is without bounds, all your hurdles halt in their tracks. Hardships can never turn into obstacles. When we come to know of such examples, we too feel inspired every moment of our life.

My dear countrymen, the month of January ushers in many festivals filled with hope & joy- such as Lohri, Pongal, MakrSankranti, Uttarayan, MaghBihu, Maaghi; on the occasion of these festivities, the length & breadth of India will be replete... with the verve of traditional dances at places, the embers of Lohri symbolizing the joy of a bountiful harvest at others. Somewhere the skies dotted with colourful flying kites, elsewhere the funfilled air of a mela or carnival. The spirit of Sports & games will come to the fore... and at places, people will joyfully feed each other til&gur... sesame &jaggery... people will be heard exchanging the greeting phrase 'Tilgurghyaaanigorgor bola'!

All these festivals may carry different names but the underlying or inherent feeling of celebrating them is singular - these are harvest festivals and somewhere or the other are connected with crops and farming, connected with the farmer, with the village and with our barns. It is during this period that the sun enters Uttarayan due to Northward movement of the earth on the celestial sphere and enters the Makardasha. It is during this period that days begin to lengthen and the winter harvesting of our crops begins. Best wishes to our food providers, the farming brothers and sisters.

Our festivals are replete with fragrance of the essence of Unity in Diversity and the spirit of One India Great India. We can witness how closely our festivals are interlinked with nature. In Indian culture society and nature are indistinguishable, in our culture the person and his environment are considered in totality. A great example of the interconnection between us and Nature is the calendar based on our festivals. It comprises festivals all around the year as well as the movements of the celestial bodies. This traditional calendar depicts our bonding with natural and astronomical events. The lunar and solar Calendars based on the movement of earth with respect to moon and sun decide the occurrence and dates of our festivals. It is also dependant on the fact which calendar you follow. In many regions the position of the planetary constellations determines the occurrence and celebration of festivals. GudiPadva, Chettichand, Ugadi and others are all celebrated according to the lunar Calendar, whereas Tamil PutanduVishnu, Baisakh, Baisakhi, PoilaBoisakh, Bihu are all celebrated in accordance with solar calendar.

The sagacity of conserving rivers and water is inherently reflected in many of our festivals. Chhath festival is associated with the worship of the sun, rivers and ponds. Millions of people take a dip in the holy rivers on theoccasion of MakarSankranti. Our festivals, impart to us many social values. On the one hand, where they have mythological significance, on the other, every festival quite easily in itself teaches the important lesson of life - the value of staying together, imbued with a feeling of brotherhood. I wish all of you a great year 2019 and do hope that you all to enjoy the oncoming festive season. Doo share the photographs taken on these festivals with one another so that everyone can witness the diversity of India and the beauty of Indian culture.

My dear countrymen, there is an abundance of events in our culture, of which we can be proud and display them in the entire world with pride - and one of them is the Kumbh Mela. You must have heard a lot about Kumbh. Even in films, a lot is exhibited regarding its grandeur and magnificence and most truly so, the dimensions ofKumbh are vast - supremely divine, as much magnificent. People from all over the country and around the world come and participate in the Kumbh. In the Kumbh Mela, there is a tidal upsurge of faith and reverence. Millions and millions of people from India and around the world congregate at one place.

The tradition of Kumbh has bloomed and flourished as part of our great cultural heritage. This time the world famous Kumbh Mela is going to be held in Prayagraj from January 15, and many of you might be waiting eagerly for it to take place. The process of Sant- Mahatmas converging at the Kumbh Mela has already started. It is a measure of its global importance that last year UNESCO has marked Kumbh Mela in the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. A few days ago the Ambassadors of many countries witnessed for themselves the preparations for Kumbh. The national flags of many countries were together hoisted at the Kumbh. The festival of Kumbh, to be organized in Prayagraj, is expected to have footfalls from more than 150 countries; the divinity emanating from Kumbhwill spread the colours of India's splendour throughout the world.

Kumbh Mela is also a huge medium of self discovery, where every visitor experiences a unique feeling and learns to look at the worldly things from a spiritual perspective. This can be a huge learning experience especially for the youth. I myself went to Prayagraj a few days ago and saw that the preparations for the Kumbh were progressing on a war footing. People of Prayagraj are also very enthusiastic about the Kumbh. I inaugurated the Integrated Command & Control Center at the Kumbh which will be of great benefit to the devotees.

This time much emphasis is being laid on cleanliness during Kumbh. If during the course of this event sanitation prevails along with reverence, then it will lead to a positive message reaching far and wide. This time every devotee will be able to have a darshan of the pious Akshayavat after the holy dip in the confluence. This great symbol of people's faith was locked up in the fort for hundreds of years, due to which the devotees despite a deep seated desire could not get a glimpse of. Now the entrance gate of Akshayavat have been opened for everyone. I urge all of you to share different aspects of Kumbh and photos on social media when you go to Kumbh so that more and more people feel inspired to go to Kumbh.

May this Kumbh of Spirituality become Mahakumbh of Indian Philosophy.

May this Kumbh of faith also become Mahakumbh of ofnationalism.

And a Mahakumbh of National integration

May this Kumbh of the devotees also become Mahakumbh of global tourists.

May this Kumbh of aesthetics also become the Mahakumbh of creativity.

My dear countrymen, there is a lot of curiosity regardingthe celebration of RepublicDay on 26th January, when we remember those great men who gave us our Constitution.This year we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of revered Bapu. We are fortunate that South African President Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa is going to grace the Republic Day celebrations as chief guest. Our revered Bapu and South Africa shared an unbreakable bond. It was South Africa, where Mohan transformed into the 'Mahatma'. It was in South Africa, where Mahatma Gandhi had started his first Satyagraha and stood rock steady in protest of apartheid. He also founded the Phoenix and Tolstoy Farms, from where the demand for peace and justice echoed to the whole world. The year2018 is also being celebrated as Birth centenary of Nelson Mandela, also known as 'Madiba'. We all know that Nelson Mandela was the role model of struggle against racism all over the world and who was the inspiration for Mandela? He derived inspiration and endurance for spending many years in jail from Bapu himself. Mandela said this about Bapu - ""Mahatma is an integral part of our history, because it was here that he used his first experiment with truth; It was here, That he had displayed a great deal of determination for justice; It was here, he developed the philosophy of his satyagraha and his methods of struggle. ""Mandela used to consider Bapu as his role model. Both Bapu and Mandela are not only sources of inspiration for the entire world, but their ideals have always encouraged us to create a society full of love and compassion.

My dear countrymen, a few days ago, a DGP conference was held at Kevdia on the banks of Narbada in Gujarat, where the world's highest statue 'Statue of Unity' is situated, there I had a meaningful discussion with the top policemen of the country. What kind of steps should be taken to strengthen the security of the country and that of the countrymen, was discussed in detail. At the same conference, I also announced the awarding of 'Sardar Patel Award' for National Integration to be given to those who have contributed for national unity in any form. Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life for the unity of the country. He always remained engaged in keeping India's integrity intact. SardarSaheb believed that the power of India lay in the diversity of the land. It is our way of paying homage to Sardar Patel's aspirations through this award for National Integration.

My dear countrymen, January 13 is the date of the sacred festival observed in honour of Guru Gobind Singh ji's birth anniversary. Guru Gobind Singh Ji was born in Patna. For most of his life, his work was centred in North India and he sacrificed his life in Nanded, Maharashtra. His birthplace was Patna, Karmabhoomi was north India and the last moments were spent in Nanded. In a way, entire India received his blessings. A glimpse of his lifespan reflects a glimpse of the entire India. After the martyrdom of his father Shri Guru TeghBahadurji, Guru Gobind Singh Ji attained the hallowed position of the Guru at a tender age of nine years. Guru Gobind Singh ji had inherited courage to fight for justice from the legacy of Sikh Gurus. He was bestowed with a quiet and simple personality, but whenever, an attempt was made to suppress the voice of the poor and the weak, or injustice was done to them, then Guru Gobind Singh ji raised his voice firmly for the poor and the weak and therefore it is said -

""I can make one fight against one hundred and fifteen thousands,

He used to preach that strength cannot be demonstrated by fighting against the weaker sections. Shri Gobind Singh Ji believed that the biggest service is to alleviate human suffering. He was a divine figure full of heroism, valor, courage, sacrifice and devotion. He had beatific knowledge of both weapons and Shastras. He was an archer, and a pundit of Gurmukhi, BrajBhasha, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu and many other languages. I once again bow paying my obeisance to Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.

My dear countrymen, there are many good events happening in the country, which are not widely discussed. Such a unique effort is being attempted by F.S.S.A.I viz Food Safety and Standard Authority of India. Many programs are being organized across the country in celebration of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. In this regard F.SA.A.I. is engaged in promoting good eating or Safe and Healthy Diet habits. Under the aegis of ""Eat Right India"" campaign, 'Swasth Bharat' trips are being carried out across the country. These campaigns will last till Jan 27th. At times, government organizations are tagged as a regulator, but it is commendable that F.SA.A.I has been working beyond this brief for public awareness and public education. A clean and healthy India will spell a prosperous India also. Nutritious food is most essential for good health. In this context, I extend hearty greetings to F.S.S.A.I for this initiative. I urge you to the utmost, let's join this initiative. You should participate in this initiative and especially I urge you to make you children witness these campaigns. The education regarding importance of food is essential right from childhood.

My dear countrymen, this is the last episode of the year 2018, we will meet again in 2019, and will engage in another episode of Mann Ki Baat.

The most egregious examples are in the news every day.

The dictionaries have decided on their 2018 words of the year. Oxford picked ""toxic."" Merriam-Webster went for ""justice."" Collins chose ""single-use."" I'd zero in on ""misgovernment."" Surely, 2018 saw a staggering number of countries woefully misruled by the worst crop of world leaders in recent memory.

The most egregious examples are in the news every day. U.S. President Donald Trump tops the chart as he runs out of straws to clutch in trying to convince Americans that his election has been good for them. The stock market bump of which he was so proud is disappearing. The fiscal deficit is the highest since 2012. Trade wars notwithstanding, the trade deficit is at a 10-year high.

The turnover on the presidential staff has reached catastrophic levels: 65 percent of Trump's ""A Team"" had been replaced since his election as of Dec. 14, according to the Brookings Institution, and that doesn't even include cabinet members (12 of the 24 officials in the cabinet have been replaced and now a 13th, Defense Secretary James Mattis, is leaving). Trump is having trouble filling once-coveted positions, and the officials he fired and those who have resigned are sometimes unconstrained in criticizing him -- a situation that, were it to occur in a corporation, would have tanked its stock.

All this doesn't even scratch the surface of what Trump has done. The damage he has wreaked on the U.S. role in the world is only beginning to manifest itself. Almost everywhere (with a few exceptions such as Israel and South Korea) favorable views of the U.S. are declining, and people are becoming convinced that the U.S. doesn't care about other countries' interests. Alliances are loosening and the multilateral world order is creaking.

Almost as obvious is the misgovernment of the U.K. Blind to the reality of disappearing economic growth, slowing business investment and a growing trade deficit, Prime Minister Theresa May's government has persevered in trying to pull the country out of the European Union and in fantasizing about withdrawal terms that the EU rejected from the start. Destroyed by the EU's dream team of super-competent negotiators, May's bungling, ill-prepared representatives flailed about, resigned in exasperation and finally produced a deal nobody really wants -- not even the EU, though it's skewed heavily in its favor. With her support weak even within her own party and her negotiating options exhausted, May now is setting up the country for a no-deal Brexit scenario that would cause massive disruption to millions of lives -- anything to avoid the only reasonable option, a new vote on EU membership for a U.K. public that found out this year it had been misled by Brexit campaigners who lied about the consequences of withdrawal.

Even beyond these two most obvious examples of mismanagement and incompetence, things aren't looking much better. Last year, Emmanuel Macron of France looked like the Western world's great hope with his sweeping reform plans and a grand vision for a tighter-knit EU. He ends the year in retreat before what's looking like the most effective Facebook-driven revolt in a Western nation to date, the Yellow Vest movement that started as a protest against a small increase in fuel taxes but grew into a violent anti-elite rebellion. Macron has undermined his reform ambitions by making concessions to the Yellow Vests worth up to 11 billion euros ($12.5 billion) a year, and his popularity hasn't recovered, remaining at a dismal 27-percent approval in public opinion polls.

Another potential leader of the west, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, spent most of the year hobbled by an open revolt within her party, the Christian Democratic Union, and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union. The conservative rebels paralyzed the government demanding tougher immigration policies and forcing Merkel into exhausting backroom battles that left her drained, sometimes even apathetic. The Union performed badly in two important state elections, and Merkel was forced to give up the party leadership. Though her chosen successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, won the leadership election earlier this month, beating the more conservative Friedrich Merz, the split in the party hasn't been healed and a lame-duck Merkel hasn't acted as though the lifted burden of party politics has freed her up to be more assertive as chancellor. The best she's been able to do is ensure stability, which looks to many Germans like stagnation at a time when the country is falling behind others in technology and underinvesting in areas such as education and infrastructure.

This was a year of chaos in other democracies, too.

The populist government in Italy drew up a fantasy budget that included a version of a universal basic income and fought with the EU over it (only to end up lowering its unrealistic projections) while the economy slid toward recession.

In Spain, Mariano Rajoy's center-right government buckled under the weight of corruption scandals and the outgoing prime minister spent a whole day at a restaurant as Socialist rival Pedro Sanchez unseated him in a kind of parliamentary coup. Sanchez, however, isn't doing too well, either: His government is beset by scandals, he faces a reprise of troublemaking by Catalonian separatists that made it almost impossible for Rajoy to focus on anything else. Now, for the first time in decades, a nationalist-populist party, Vox, is gaining popularity and has won representation in Andalusia's regional parliament.

Sweden and Latvia are entering the new year without governments following inconclusive elections and months of coalition negotiations. In Sweden, established parties are trying to exclude an increasingly powerful populist rival. In Latvia the establishment would like to engage the surging populists to get around a strong party that's considered pro-Russian, but the results are the same: a political fracturing unprecedented in both countries' history.

In Belgium, the government has just been toppled by a nationalist party campaigning against a non-binding United Nations migration pact that Belgium approved along with 163 other countries.

It hasn't been a great year for strongmen and hybrid regimes, either.

Russian President Vladimir Putin was re-elected, but has since seen a drop in popularity following a highly unpopular retirement-age increase. Russia's economy and Russians' incomes are stagnating, and Putin's been constrained overseas by a string of public failures by Russia's aggressive military intelligence service and an inability to build a working relationship with the U.S.

India's Narendra Modi goes into 2019 having lost elections in three states where his Bharatiya Janata Party was previously dominant. Modi's hubris and the lasting effects of his policy mistakes, such as the disastrous ""demonetization"" of 2016 in which Modi took 86 percent of the country's cash out of circulation, are partly responsible for his weakening hold on power. Urjit Patel, the central bank governor, resigned earlier this month after Modi's repeated attempts to weaken the bank's independence and get control over its reserves. Though economic growth has been strong, it hasn't been inclusive as Modi had promised; unemployment hit a two-year high in October.

Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan consolidated his power with an election win, but he's mismanaging Turkey's economy. The Bloomberg consensus forecast sees the country plunging into recession starting this quarter. The lira is the world's second-worst performing currency after the Argentine peso, having lost about 29 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar.

Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, once feted as a bold reformer, has seen his reputation destroyed by the October murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The brutal act has undermined international support for MBS, as the prince is known, and thrown a monkey wrench into his plans to reduce the Saudi economy's oil dependence.

Saudi Arabia's arch-rival, Iran, isn't doing much better. Beset by domestic protests and hit again by U.S. sanctions from which European powers have been unable to protect it, the regime of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has had an awful year, even if it's not teetering yet.

Viktor Orban in Hungary, whose Fidesz party won a supermajority in an election in April, appears to have overplayed his hand with a series of moves aimed at consolidating his power over courts and media, as well as a recent law that has the potential to force Hungarians into working overtime for pay that would be delayed for three years. He's facing the most persistent protests of his rule and has been forced to resort to violence against the protesters.

The current crew of error-prone rulers makes for a fractious world with a growing potential for conflict, armed and otherwise, domestic and international. The elites, both democratic and authoritarian, are weak, and they invite backlashes against their mismanagement. Protest movements and anti-establishment parties have sprung up and are strengthening everywhere; they have different goals but are all bolstered by social-network technology that amplifies anger and violence.

Even the few notable exceptions to the misgovernment rule of 2018 don't inspire much confidence.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has made no major errors, but his popularity is trending down ahead of next year's election.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who vowed to clean up the country after the disheartening corruption that plagued it under Jacob Zuma, couldn't maintain ""Ramaphoria"" for long. Though he has restored investor confidence, his anti-corruption efforts haven't yielded quick results and fears of a land expropriation campaign continue to hang over the country.

Most intriguingly, Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has avoided major errors for years, may have made some in 2018. It's unclear whether accepting Trump's trade-war challenge was a good idea. For all its might, China is still a middle-income country that's extremely dependent on trade. Xi's battle against Trump may win him sympathy in Europe, but Europeans aren't natural allies for China. Xi's show of strength may be premature, and that will become clear in the next couple of years.

The shortage of competent, clear-headed, hubris-free leadership in today's world may be a freak accident. But if it's the new normal, living in this world will require new skills from ordinary people, too. Vigilance and easy mobility in case a country deteriorates intolerably are two of them; a capacity for constructive protest is a third. Bad leadership isn't just something we read about on news sites. It could signal the deterioration of institutions, both global and domestic, that shape our lives. - Bloomberg"

United Nations Secretary General's Special Advisor on the Prevention of Genocide Adama Dieng said here on Saturday that education was the best tool to prevent genocide and other excesses against humanity.

Delivering the keynote address on 'Education for future, and the future of education' at the 20th anniversary celebrations of Madin Academy here, Mr. Dieng said human excesses could be stalled only through educating people to respect each other, to accept each other, to understand that the skin or faith does not determine their humanity.

Education should teach people that ""my God is not mightier than your God, that my culture is not superior to your culture, that we are all human beings and that we all have the same human rights,"" he said.

Mr. Dieng said education for the prevention of genocides should take lessons from the past.

""Learning about past violence and atrocity crimes, including genocides, teaches us about what we want to prevent in our present and for our future, and how to do it. As no region in the world is immune to the risk of atrocity crimes, this is important to all societies,"" he said. Inaugurating the programme, Education Minister C. Ravindranath underscored the necessity of democratising education for the making of an ideal human being.

Madin Academy is conducting a series of programmes involving international guests as part of the Vicennium celebrations.

As eminent authors have been raising concern over the waning practice of writing in the mother tongue, the 32nd Guwahati Book Fair here has turned into a confluence of young writers writing in various Indian languages as well as English from all over the country during a two-day young writers' conclave organized by Sahitya Akademi and Publication Board, Assam on Saturday. The conclave was titled All India Young Writers' Meet. Secretary of the Sahitya Akademi, K Sreenivasarao, extended warm welcome to the young writers, especially promising to promote the native, recognized Indian languages.

""All Indian languages are under threat. However big they may look, society is changing internally so fast that our mother tongues are coming under threat. One of the main reasons for this is that we have drastically given up school education in our mother tongues,"" said Borah, delivering the inaugural address of the meet.

Recollecting the contributions of brilliant minds writing in mother tongues from the past, he added, ""Over the last 30-40 years, the Indian middle class and the elite of the society have shifted focus from mother tongues to English. This is affecting not only big languages, the threat is huge in case of languages spoken by lesser populations. Some of them have already lost their languages.""

The eminent writer, who is also the convener of Sahitya Akademi's Assamese advisory board, said languages like Bengali, Marathi, Malayalam or Telugu, which are spoken by a large populace, the shift of a small section of students from the mother tongue may not have a big impact, but a similar shift will have a huge impact for the vernacular languages spoken by smaller populations.

""Many of our young writers don't want to write in their mother tongues, but the most important thing is that we have to uphold the right of our own language and know how to express in our own language,"" said Borah.

While stating that learning English is vital for higher scientific education and livelihood, he said people must build up their own language and literature in the cultural sphere.

He also expressed happiness that most writers attending the conclave write in their own mother tongue and are ""rooted in the world and society where they are living."""

The agriculture department estimates the loan waiver to cost Rs 35,000 crore.

The first scheme to face the axe was the Deendayal Vananchal Yojna that provided health and education facilities to forest dwellers. On December 24, the Kamal Nath government issued an order scrapping the scheme on procedural grounds--the absence of approval from the finance department. The state spent about Rs 5.50 crore in the last financial year on the scheme introduced in 2016, according to forest department officials.

""We are compiling all the schemes introduced by the previous government and the money spent on these schemes. The status report will be presented before the state cabinet to take a call,"" said a senior officer familiar with the matter who asked not to be named.

The previous government introduced several schemes such as the Sambal Yojna, Mukhyamantri Teerth Darshan Yojna, Mukhyamantri Kanyadan Yojna, Ladli Laxmi Yojna, and Krishak Samridhi Yojna targeted at senior citizens, women, farmers, poor households and students.

Under the Sambal scheme, the government provides electricity at a flat rate of Rs 200 a month to labourers from the unorganised sector and farmers having up to five acres land; it reimburses the power distribution companies if the monthly bill is over Rs 200. As a result, the government has to spend about Rs 150 crore per month. At least 20 million people have registered for the scheme.

""There is concern of excessive consumption of power by beneficiaries. The new government will have to look into the same"", said an official in the energy department who asked not to be named.

Jayant Malaiya, finance minister in the Bharatiya Janata Party government, said: ""The schemes of the previous government may be affected as the new government may not have adequate funds after waiving the loans of farmers. If the loans are really waived, the government may not have money for other schemes and infrastructure of the state may also suffer.""

Government officials said the problem the new state government is confronting is that it may not be able to scrap or modify many of Chouhan's schemes for fear of alienating people before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

Principal secretary, finance, Anurag Jain declined to comment on how the government will meet its requirement of funds to waive the farmers' loans.

Economist Jayantilal Bhandari said, ""The government may scrap some of the previous government's schemes. At the same time, it may look into tourism, industries, skill and development to generate more funds. But given the huge amount of debt and lack of balance in income and expenditure, its a huge task in the government's hands at present to fulfil its promise.""

State Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta said, ""There is no problem in arranging money for the loan waiver, though the previous government left the treasury empty. The previous government spent most of funds on rallies, events and advertisements. With fiscal discipline and revenue realisation, the government can manage the funds."""

They meet at a mini hall of the 115-year-old Madhavashram Hotel. ""It's been 15 years since they are meeting here. They make the place come alive with their interactions and activities. It's a joy to host them,"" says Krishna Mhane, hotel manager, who offers them the place for free.

The interactions range from political debates to literary discussions. ""We have discussions on informative write-ups, sometimes we review old Marathi literary works, recite poetry or watch acclaimed movies,"" Sarvardekar says. A few years ago, the group would come on air on a radio programme, Jestha Nagarik, hosted by Aakash Vani. In every show, four senior citizens would go on air to discuss Marathi poetry and prose.

The idea behind the group was to create a space where elderly people could feel free to have a conversation regarding anything. Tardeo-based Narayan (88) and Iravati Lavate (79), who wrote to the president last year seeking permission for physician-assisted suicide to avoid terminal illness and a slow death, are always ready to debate over euthanasia. ""Everyone asks why do you want to die. And we argue it is our right to decide when to end our lives,"" Iravati says.

The members are from different backgrounds -- some retired, while a few who did not complete formal education. But they share a common zeal to read, think and express themselves.

""These days, we spend most of our time with our grandchildren, taking care of them. They are born into the hands of technology. No one has time for a face-to-face conversation. With this group, we feel we are back in time,"" says Shailaja Virkar (75), a retired officer of General Post Office near Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. The group also celebrates birthdays, an annual day and many similar occasions.

""Once a year, we gather funds to donate to an organisation in Assam, which focusses on the education of girl child,"" says Prabha Devi, Secretary of Visava.

At 92, K G Chhetri is the oldest member of the group, a retiree from the Railways. ""We share a fraternal bond."" They also visit the houses of members, who are unable to make it to the weekly meetings due to health issues."

A team of top officials led by Chief Secretary SK Joshi are working on the reorganisation of departments to streamline governance.

Revealing this, Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao told the media that there was no hurry for Cabinet expansion and that it would be taken up after the reorganisation of government departments. He said he had been thinking about the reorganisation of departments for a while now.

""Departments such as agriculture, cooperative, marketing and civil supplies, which deal with farmers and agriculture, are led by different Ministers creating practical problems in administration. We clubbed all education departments during our previous term and are now planning to implement the same for other departments as well,"" he said.

Further, the Chief Minister said only hardworking MLAs would be inducted into the Cabinet for effective administration and progress of the State. He pointed out that people voted for the TRS as the Ministers worked hard and delivered effective services to the people. ""Though we have only 17 Ministerial posts in the Cabinet, we have other equivalent and even bigger posts such as Speaker. We will have a team of about 33 MLAs with Cabinet Minister's post or a post of Cabinet rank enabling them to liaise on behalf of all 33 districts, including the two newly proposed districts,"" he said. He added the Cabinet will be a mix of old and new faces.

Rubbishing the allegations of the opposition parties over not convening the Assembly and organising MLAs oath-taking ceremony, the Chief Minister said the new Telangana Assembly had already come into existence soon after the gazetted notification was issued based on orders of Election Commission of India (ECI).

""The oath-taking ceremony is just a formality with regard to the Assembly affairs, otherwise all those elected candidates are the Members of the new Legislative Assembly beyond any doubt,"" he said. He pointed out that he could not have sworn-in as the Chief Minister without the new Assembly coming into being and stated that even during his previous term in 2014, new MLAs did not take the oath for about 29 days.

When questioned about rumours of Congress MLAs planning to join the TRS, Rao categorically stated that TRS had enough strength in the Assembly, but he cannot stop Congress MLAs seeking to join the TRS en masse. However, he declared that he would go by the established norms if MLAs from any other parties wanted to join the TRS. He said that the TRS' strength would increase in the Assembly as it would gain one more MLA seat in terms of a nominated MLA seat. In response to the Congress' decision to approach the court against the merger of Congress Legislative Party in the Telangana Legislative Council with the TRS Legislative Party, he said the courts would decide."

According to sources, administrative secretaries of over half a dozen departments recently met the Chief Secretary for devising modalities for merging the departments including State Sports Council, Horticulture, Animal and Sheep Husbandry and Technical Education.

The government is also mulling to create a new department for maintenance of all water bodies and irrigation projects by bifurcating the Public Health Engineering (PHE) and Irrigation and Flood Control department, sources said.

They said the PHE would be left with the mandate of providing drinking water facilities to the people while the new department would look after irrigation, flood control and maintenance of all water bodies including those being looked after by the Housing and Urban Development, Forest and Tourism departments.

The Agriculture department is likely to be mandated with its erstwhile departments of Animal and Sheep Husbandry and Horticulture departments, which over the years were severed from the department by the previous State governments.

The Youth Services and Sports department is also likely to take over the Sports Council department, which would be disbanded as a separate identity.

The intermingling mandate of the two departments had led to a feud between the Sports Council and Youth Services and Sports ministry during the previous Peoples Democratic Party-Bharatiya Janata Party led government.

The Youth Services and Sports department then led by former Peoples Democratic Party leader Imran Reza Ansari had run into a showdown with the then Sports Council Secretary Waheed-ur-Rehman Parra.

Keeping in view the similar mandate and work, the government has now decided to merge the Sports Council with the Youth Services and Sports department.

Similarly, the Technical Education department is also likely to be brought under the diocese of the Higher Education department to streamline the sector post higher secondary level.

The government's decision comes in the backdrop of expected shortage of administrative secretaries in the administration next year as two dozen officers of the Indian Administrative Service and Kashmir Administrative Service are due to retire next year.

An official said the decision of merger is also being taken in view of previous month's meetings of the committee on the languishing projects.

During those meetings, the pivotal reason for delay in projects was attributed to multiple control of similarly-mandated departments.

The government is also contemplating to create a single department for international funding of the development projects in the State on the lines of the other states.

Currently every department in the State has been pursuing the internationally-funded projects in their sector on their own including the projects funded by Asian Development Bank, World Bank and other global financial organisations."

The unrest in the Kashmir Valley has caused a considerable decline among other things, of the practice, performance/ exhibition of art and culture expressions in public spaces. While the Jammu region, especially the winter capital boasted of a busy calendar with its usual pre and post-Darbar move flurry of 'cultural functions' by different agencies of the state led by J&K cultural Academy and the state-funded NGOs working ostensibly for promotions and development of art and culture.

Nonetheless, it was either Sarkari or the popular versions of culture spurned of by institutions and a few NGOs, many of which try to ape the practices followed in leading metros of the nation. In such a scenario of hackneyed and trite cultural expressions, the credit for innovative expressions once again rested with a few select creative individuals who fired by the calling of the heart, imaginative and creative power, dedication and hard work, succeeded in making a mark.

Hope the JMC's mayor and the team of carporators continue the initiative which has already started finding an echo in beautifully embellished walls of Jammu's private schools and other public spaces.

Coming to the creative practice of Visual Arts, which has given a new identity to cities like Kochi, Goa, just to name a few, the scene in J&K continues to be grim. One reason could be the changed priorities of the J&K Cultural Academy, which otherwise has been the main engine for initiating and sustaining the modern art movement in J&K through its Institutes of Music & Fine arts at Jammu/Srinagar and holding artist camps and exhibitions. The Academy's atrophy can be gauged from the fact that it failed to hold its coveted annual art exhibition at Jammu this year. Much to the chagrin of veteran artist like Triloke Kaul, who along with others had laid the foundation of modern art renaissance in the late 1940s in J&K.

Nonetheless, the individual artists continued to create, exhibit their works and win accolades albeit outside the state. Some of the well-known local artists who hogged limelight were Nikhil Chopra, Veer ji Munshi, Rajinder Tikku, Suman Gupta.

Gandhi, and Jang Varman.

Cartoonist Manoj Chopra & Chander Shekhar Bunti won honors in national cartoon exhibition cum competitions. The NGOs Viraj Kala Kendra, Kesar Art circle and, JK Creative Centre for Arts contributed by holding art exhibitions, art camps etc.

Theatre: J&K Cultural Academy has certainly given a spurt to theatre art by encouraging amateur theatre enthusiasts. Nonetheless, the NGO groups in Jammu led by dedicated theatrists have been significantly contributing towards theatre movement.

NATRANG: held more than 100 shows in the year and set a record by organizing 8 theatre festivals in which 32 different plays by the same group were staged. Its regular mega events/shows at different melas were 'Bava Jitto' & Mata ki Kahani. It also screened first ever film on Maharaja Gulab Singh.

Creating a record of sorts, the municipal corporation completed five mega projects, including three underpasses and two flyovers to ease traffic congestion in different areas of the city, in just one year under Strategic Road Development Programme (SRDP).

The year 2018 began with the launch of Ayyappa Society underpass in January for GHMC. Living up to the expectations of the State Government and the citizens, the municipal corporation has completed four other much-needed projects, including the Mindspace underpass (April), Chintalkuna underpass (May), Kamineni LHS Flyover (July) and Mindspace flyover (November).

Municipal Administration and Urban Development Minister KT Rama Rao, during the launch of Ayyappa Society underpass, had announced that this was just the beginning and 2018 would be the year of execution and, accordingly, five projects were completed.

After the launch of Metro services on the Ameerpet-LB Nagar route on September 24 this year, commuting has become bit easy for many passengers in the city.

L&T Metro Rail Hyderabad is now operating a train for every six minutes on the Miyapur-LB Nagar route (8 am to 12 noon and 5 pm to 9 pm). A train is being operated for every seven minutes on the route during non-peak hours (12 noon to 5 pm).

Hyderabad Metro Rail crossed 30 million cumulative ridership milestone in just 351 days after the commercial operations were launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 28, 2017.

The striking aspect is that the ridership increased from 20 million to 30 million in a mere 71 days. With 46 kms of Metro operations, Hyderabad Metro Rail is now the second largest Metro service in the country after Delhi Metro Rail.

Buoyed with the response, Metro officials are now working hard to launch the services on the Ameerpet-Hitec City route at the earliest.

Hyderabad drew national attention for many reasons this year. Among the many, Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board's exclusive Rain Water Harvesting Theme Park in Jubilee Hills and Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation's first-of-its-kind Dog Park at Kondapur garnered attention of many nationally and are already a big hit with people.

Impressed with the initiatives taken by both the organisations, different departments from across the country are visiting the parks and drawing plans to replicate the same in their respective cities.

Kanpur Development Authority vice-chairman Kinjal Singh, along with a couple of others, visited the HMWSSB's rain water theme park at Jubilee Hills and complimented the good work done in Hyderabad.

Launched in August of this year, Kanti Velugu scheme in the State has not only identified eye-related ailments among the population but also has set a blueprint for the soon-to-be-launched universal health profile of every citizen in the State. All the health authorities in Telangana State now have to do is to simply replicate the Kanti Velugu scheme for other diseases.

The sheer scale of Kanti Velugu scheme is quite mind-boggling. For instance, between this August and December, over 8,000 healthcare workers in the State have covered a record 1.13 crore persons who underwent basic eye screening in as many as 6,603 villages in the State.

Perhaps, this is for the first time in the country that such a large cross-section of population has participated in eye screening. In the process, through the Kanti Velugu scheme, 18,36,303 beneficiaries received reading glasses. The mega eye-screening camp also identified 7,39,047 persons who were eventually referred to secondary and tertiary care facilities in the State.

The Telangana State took a major step towards strengthening medical education when the Centre gave its nod to set up All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) at Bibinagar in April of this year. The sector also got a boost when Telangana received green signal to set up four more medical colleges, each in Mahabubnagar, Siddipet, Nalgonda and Suryapet.

While it takes at least four to five years, and sometimes even more, to actually operationalise AIIMS following Centre's approval, the health authorities here are looking at a possible start of the academic year from 2019 itself. All this is possible because of the presence of a NIMS Bibinagar hospital building, which was constructed at a cost of Rs 80 crore, spread over a campus of 160 acre. Already, authorities here have handed over 200 acres of land, including the NIMS hospital building, to the Centre at Bibinagar for AIIMS project.

The AIIMS will be completely run by the Ministry of Health, Medical and Family Welfare (MOHFW), New Delhi, and is set to play an influential role as a teaching hospital and research centre in Telangana State.

Facial Recognition System (FRS), a first-of-its-kind technology-driven initiative, was introduced by the State police in 2018 for detecting crime.

The FRS is also enabling police in tracing missing persons also. A few weeks ago, the system helped police in identifying a woman, M Shantamma, who went missing from Nacharam, and reuniting her with the family members.

Kaleshwaram lift irrigation witnessed massive work turnout this year as six major works - lifts and barrages at Medigada, Sundilla and Annaram - were initially scheduled to be completed by the year end. Despite floods in Godavari that resulted in disruptions impacting the work progress, the implementation agencies have completed the key components of the six works barring concrete laying on the spill ways of the barrages.

Chief Minister, K Chandrasekhar Rao, who had a marathon review on the project works recently, pointed out the tardy progress in certain packages.

Medical College, Davangere, are anxious over payments next year

Medical interns and postgraduate students of KMC (Mangaluru) and J.J. Medical College (Davangere), who will start working in the State-run Chigateri and Wenlock hospitals from next year, are worried over payment of their stipends.

With the Medical Education Department stating that students studying under government quota should henceforth be paid by the colleges/hospitals (hitherto paid by the government), the students who will graduate and start interning from next year are not sure whether they will get the stipend.

In a letter dated October 30, the Additional Chief Secretary to Government (Medical Education) to the Director of Medical Education (DME) has directed payment of stipend to interns and postgraduate students under government quota only for the current year.

While medical interns are paid a monthly stipend of ₹20,000, postgraduate students are paid ₹30,000, ₹35,000 and ₹40,000 in their first, second and third years respectively.

Confirming this to The Hindu, DME P.G. Girish said from next year stipend payment to the ongoing batches has to done by the respective colleges/hospitals. ""As these hospitals are under the Health and Family Welfare Department and are attached to the two private medical colleges, so far the Health Department was funding the stipend through the Medical Education Department. But we do not want to intervene in the coming year and the matter now rests with the Health Department and the colleges. The colleges should pay the stipend and any violation or indiscipline will not be tolerated,"" the DME said.

However, M. Venkataraya Prabhu, Dean of KMC, Mangaluru, argued that the government's stand is contrary to a High Court order issued in 2001 which states stipend cannot be denied to ""postgraduate students working in government hospitals and attached to private medical colleges"". He said the college was paying for the current year, but it was too early to commit on the next year. ""Higher authorities will take a call,"" he said.

Sources said the Medical Education Department wants the Health Department to deal with the issue as the students from the two private medical colleges have aided the healthcare services at the hospitals.

Issue raised by CAG

Jawaid Akthar, Principal Secretary (Medical Education and Health and Family Welfare), said stipend payment to students in private colleges by the government has become an issue following an objection raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG).

In October this year, medical interns and postgraduate students under government quota from these colleges had protested as their stipend had not been paid for eight months. The issue, which had earlier surfaced in 2017, was resolved after the DME released funds."

The murder of 20-year-old M. Abhimanyu at the Maharaja's College, Ernakulam, was the defining moment in the higher education scenario in Ernakulam district in 2018 as it brought to the fore the dangerous trend of the growing politics of fear and terror on campuses.

Abhimanyu, a second-year undergraduate student of Environmental Chemistry, was stabbed to death allegedly by activists of the Campus Front of India, Social Democratic Party of India and Popular Front of India following differences over wall graffiti welcoming newcomers to the campus on July 2.

As per the case, a 16-member gang assembled with deadly weapons behind the college campus with an intention to do away with student leaders of the SFI and attacked them as conspired earlier. The college later removed Muhammed (first accused), a third-year student of B.A. Arabic, and Farooq, a first-year student of B.A. Economics, from the rolls for their alleged involvement in the brutal incident.

Recalling that the campus had never seen violence of this kind earlier, K.G. Sankara Pillai, noted poet and former Principal of the college, reminded that those behind the violent incident seem to be conveying a message that they would go to any extent to spread their ideology.

""The intention is to destroy democratic, vibrant and creative spaces like the Maharaja's campus,"" he said.

Despite hitting the headlines for wrong reasons, the prestigious Maharaja's College made considerable progress in its journey towards becoming a centre of excellence in 2020. The only autonomous college in the government sector across the State witnessed a heavy rush for admission to its undergraduate and postgraduate programmes.

The college has already started working on the estimated ₹30-crore first phase infrastructure development under the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB).

Rajagiri College of Social Sciences, Kalamassery, and Mar Athanesius College, Kothamangalam, were among the five autonomous colleges in the State that received ₹5 crore each under the second phase funding under the Rashtriya Uchathar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA).

Among the universities, Mahatma Gandhi University won the Chancellor's award for the best university for the second time. It also implemented a slew of reforms in the examination sector including online delivery of question papers to affiliated colleges and online question bank.

Cochin University of Science and Technology had a major distinction after it received the government nod for the ₹240-crore project supported by the KIIFB. Of the total ₹240 crore project under the KIIFB, ₹100 crore would be used to step up infrastructure.

Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady, which was hit hard by the devastating floods (nearly ₹8- crore loss) tried its best to make a comeback and organised an all-India conference of vice chancellors of Sanskrit universities as part of its silver jubilee celebrations.

Urging the higher educational institutions to focus on developing inter-disciplinary areas of research, Rajan Varughese, Member Secretary of the Kerala State Higher Education Council, suggested revamping of curriculum and syllabi in tune with the development of the knowledge domain.

Addressing the media after the meeting, AAP National Secretary Pankaj Gupta said that the proposal to extend the term of the current council by a year was passed unanimously and without amending the party's constitution.

""With the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and Delhi Assembly elections around the corner, the members have decided to extend the tenure of the National Council for a year. The elections for the new council will be held before the end of the extended tenure,"" Gupta told the media.

The tenure of the National Council was to end on April 23, 2019. Now Kejriwal will continue to remain party chief till April 2020. Kejriwal was elected as the National Convenor of AAP for a second time in April 2016 for a period of three years.

According to the AAP's constitution, no member can hold the same post as an office-bearer for more than two consecutive terms of three years each.

The National Council also decided that the party will utilise all its power and energy for contesting the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Goa and Chandigarh, AAP Delhi Convener Gopal Rai told the media.

The AAP also hinted at the possibility of an alliance with other parties for the 2019 elections as Rai said: ""The party will contribute in whatever way it can to ensure the end of the Modi government, including cooperating with others.""

The party leaders in their speeches attacked Modi and the Central government for their scams, non-fulfilment of promises and his ""dictatorship"".

Addressing the National Council meeting, Kejriwal accused the Central government of scanning over 400 files related to the Delhi government and dared Modi to show four files of the Centre, including those of Sahara-Birla and Rafale deal.

""The Centre took and examined our 400 files to find irregularities, but could not find any. Modi himself gave us a certificate of honesty. I always say if PM Modi shows us four of his files, he will end up in jail,"" Kejriwal said.

""You took our 400 files, show us Sahara-Birla and Rafale files and we can send you to jail with just these two files,"" he challenged Modi.

Kejriwal also said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the past four years has not left any stone unturned to ensure that the AAP government does not perform.

Calling the Rafale jet fighters deal ""a mega scam of Rs 36,000 crore"", AAP MP Sanjay Singh in his address said the Centre is misleading the people and is not telling the people as to ""why the country has to buy the jets at the cost of Rs 1,670 crore instead of the earlier cost of Rs 540 crore and why they preferred a private firm over the government firm"".

He also said the Centre is also misleading the Supreme Court over the Rafale deal.

Rai, too, attacked the BJP over corruption, saying: ""The BJP said that they will not allow corruption, but Rafale has turned out to be the biggest scam. The (party) members have agreed to expose the truth of the BJP before the public.""

The meeting also finalised the issues to target the ruling BJP on during the 2019 elections.

""AAP, in its campaigns, will take up the issues related to farmers before the public. The BJP had promised to implement the Swaminathan Commission report after coming to power. The Modi government should fulfil its promise soon.

""The Modi government has also failed in ensuring women's security. The BJP leaders themselves were found involved in crime against women. This shows the BJP only gave slogans of women's safety and not worked on it. The AAP members have condemned the acts of BJP and demanded that it should clear its stand on women safety,"" Rai said.

Singh added to expose the pseudo-religious policies of the BJP, the AAP will run a campaign from Ayodhya to Kashi on January 12 and 13.

The members have also decided to target the dictatorship of the Modi-Shah duo by contesting on seats where the party can win the elections on its own including Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Goa and Chandigarh, Rai said, adding that the party has asked the other states' heads for a report to assess the party's status there.

""The state committees will submit their reports to the political affairs committee, which will decide about the seats to contest the elections,"" he said.

Speaking about the hardships faced by the AAP government in Delhi, Kejriwal said: ""The public has voted for us but powers are with the Centre. Only we know how we handled the dictatorship of the Centre. They also used all possible agencies against us including the police and the CBI to humiliate us.""

He said that the Central government posted the worst officers in the education and health departments, soon after the two departments started doing good work. ""But Manish (Sisodia) and Satyendar (Jain) ensured that these officers delivered.""

He accused the two parties -- the BJP and the Congress -- of not doing any work in the last 70 years.

Kejriwal said that the country can become number one in the world if a good party comes to power at the Centre.

He said the formation of the party was not an end to the revolution.

Echoing the same sentiment, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said the common intention of the party formation was to stop corruption, ""be it corruption in a Rafale deal or in a ration scam"".

""We wanted to check the misuse of political position. I am happy that we have stopped this in Delhi,"" he said.

""The Anti Corruption Branch was with the Delhi government from the past 20 years, but soon after we came to power, it was taken away. This shows that we were hitting at the right place.""

Amid opposition apprehension that the ruling Awami League may engage its workers in large numbers to rig the Sunday's poll, Mr Goswami narrates his anxiety.

""If they [BNP-Jamaat electors] vote in large numbers since early morning we [Awami Leaguers] could be in trouble,"" he said and clarified that they -- the minorities of Bangladesh -- can't afford to witness the victory of the main Opposition parties, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami, usually referred as 'BNP-Jamaat jote.'

""We have experienced BNP-Jamaat's victory between 2001 and 2006 and it was a nightmare,"" said Mr. Goswami, sipping sugary tea, outside Martyr's Memorial.

Mr Goswami, originally from Manikganj in central Bangladesh, said 14 of 17 ""affluent upper caste families"" had left Bangladesh to settle in Bengal. ""Now, in our village, Binodpur in Manikganj, we hardly have any Hindu families.""

Mr Goswami could not leave for Kolkata; he has nearly a dozen member family in the lower to middle income group. ""We are not affluent, it was difficult to relocate,"" he said.

The Hindus, who are the main constituents of the minority community in Bangladesh have little option but to vote for Awami League on Sunday, despite a litany of complaints against the ruling party.

In close to 60 seats , out of a total of 300, the Hindu vote is a factor accounting for 30-40% votes, said Rana Dasgupta, general secretary of Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council, the leading minority pressure group in the country.

""The choice for the minorities in Bangladesh is between 'very bad' and 'bad',"" he said on the phone. Awami League's ""miscreants"" have been looting property of the Hindus along with Jamaat and the BNP, he claimed.

Their intentions, however, were different, he said. ""While BNP-Jamaat wanted minorities to slowly leave the country thus reducing population percentage, Awami League workers were engaged in usurping minority property,"" he said.

""That phase continued from 2011 to 2014 or 15 and Awami League has not punished anyone."" However, the ruling party later ""rehabilitated"" the minorities.

Interestingly, Awami League has now tied with Hifazat-e-Islami, a radical organization working in madrassa education sector.

""It is a cause of concern for not only the minorities but the entire country. In the secondary level education Awami League has abolished Hindu writers...including Rabindranath Tagore at the secondary level...being guided by Hifazat,"" said a top businessman of Dhaka, a Muslim who studied in India, on condition of anonymity.

""Nothing could be less atrocious,"" he said. The chief of anti-Awami coalition, Kamal Hossain called it League's ""politics of opportunism"" at a press conference on Saturday.

However a section of the minority community also told The Hindu that they ""do not mind"" BNP-Jamaat jote in power.

""For two reasons,"" said a Hindu businessman. ""We are also strongly entrenched now in BNP and the character of BNP-Jamaat is perhaps also changing,"" he argued.

Mr Dasgupta said that for the first time the Election Commission spoke to the minorities ""at every level to allay fear.""

""Also, no one is targeting the minorities or India [this time] and rather the majority community is in fear due to political clashes,"" Mr Dasgupta added.

But Mr Goswami will never vote for BNP-Jamaat.

""I am too afraid to trust them,"" he said,continuing his night vigil in one of the Dhaka's less affluent neighbourhood of predominantly Dalit Hindus."

Bharathidasan University on Saturday decided to wait for a new Government Order on the retirement age of principals in self-financing colleges, after contrasting views were expressed by the Senate members on raising the limit to 65 years from 62 at present.

During the Senate meeting, a section of members citing the Government Order 325, dated August 18, 2003, sought adherence to the State Government's emphasis on 62 years, while some others advocated compliance with the latest UGC regulations, citing the increase effected in retirement age of principals of affiliated colleges in Anna University to 65 years.

Apprehensions were expressed by members espousing the cause of teachers in self-financing colleges that appointment of retirees from government and aided colleges as principals in their institutions and letting them hold the post till 65 years was tantamount to curtailing the career progress of faculties who had put in decades of service.

The counter given by those favouring 65 years as retirement age was that Bharathidasan University had secured the consent of the University Grants Commission to that effect during 2005 and the decision had been adopted in the Syndicate.

Vice-Chancellor P. Manisankar said the university had discussed the issue with the Secretary of Higher Education Mangat Ram Sharma and that a Government Order on the retirement age of principals in affiliated colleges was expected shortly. Till then, the status quo will be maintained, Prof. Manisankar said, adding that in case there was a delay in issual of the G.O., the issue will be broached again in the next meeting of the Syndicate."

He said in the past four years of the NDA, more than 2.11 crore students of minority communities, including 60 per cent girls, have been provided scholarships.

""This year, a National Scholarship Portal Mobile App has been launched to ensure smooth and hassle-free scholarship system for poor and weaker section students. The scholarship amounts are given directly into the bank accounts,"" Naqvi pointed out.

Besides, he said 5.43 lakh youth and 1.50 lakh artisans have been provided employment opportunities through job-oriented schemes at various levels, indicating the government's efforts for educational empowerment of all weaker sections, including minorities, have shown results on the ground.

Present on the occasion were Anjuman-e-Islam Chairman Jahir Kazi, Maulana Azad Education Foundation Vice-Chairman Ashfaq Saifi and Secretary R. Rehman.

The 144-year-old Anjuman-e-Islam was founded by Dr. Badruddin Tyabji in 1874, who was the third President of Indian National Congress, and the first Indian Barrister to practise law at Bombay High Court, where he rose to become the first Acting Indian Chief Justice.

Starting with a solitary school then, today it has mushroomed into a mega-educational institution running around 90 schools, colleges, professional courses colleges and sports complexes in Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra benefitting over 1.10 lakh students of all communities.

Under the Sambal scheme, the government provides electricity at a flat rate of Rs 200 a month to labourers from the unorganised sector and farmers having land of up to five acre; it reimburses the power distribution companies if the monthly bill is over Rs 200. As a result, the government has to spend about Rs 150 crore per month. At least 20 million people have registered to avail of the scheme introduced in July.

""There is concern of excessive consumption of power by beneficiaries. The new government will have to look into the same"", said an official in the energy department who asked not to be named.

Jayant Malaiya, finance minister in the Bharatiya Janata Party government, said: ""The schemes of the previous government may be affected as the new government may not have adequate funds after waiving the loans of farmers. If the loans are really waived, the government may not have money for other schemes and infrastructure of the state may also suffer.""

Government officials said the problem the new state government is confronting is that it may not be able to scrap or modify many of Chouhan's schemes for fear of alienating people before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

Principal secretary, finance, Anurag Jain declined to comment on how the government will meet its requirement of funds to waive the farmers' loans.

Economist Jayantilal Bhandari said, ""The government may scrap some of the previous government's schemes. At the same, it may look into the areas like tourism, industries, skill development etc to generate more funds. But given the huge amount of debt and lack of balance in income and expenditure, it's a huge task in the government's hands at present to fulfil its promise.""

State Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta said, ""There is no problem in arranging money for the loan waiver, though the previous government left the treasury empty. The previous government spent most of funds on rallies, events and advertisements. With fiscal discipline and revenue realisation, the government can manage the funds."""

According to the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation Swachh Bharat Mission, India's sanitation coverage has successfully moved up to 98 per cent from mere 38 per cent in the year 2014, when Swachh Bharat Abhiyan was kick-started in the country in a bid to provide each and every individual access to safe sanitation and hygiene.

Status Of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan In Rural India

Since October 2, 2014, according to the data provided by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, around 9 crore toilets (9,09,69,052) have been constructed in the rural parts of India. In 2018 alone, more than 2 crore toilets have been built. As a result, 534 districts and over 5 lakh (5,38,285) villages have achieved the open defecation free status in the country.

A few months ago, addressing the nation while launching the Swachhata Hi Seva movement across the country ahead of Mahatma Gandhi's 149th birth anniversary on October 2, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, ""Nobody had thought that India can construct 9 crore toilets in 4 years, but, we all did it. This is the result of the efforts of swachhagrahis (People working for Swachh Bharat Mission) from across the country.""

Not just PM Modi, the movement of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan also received a big thumbs up from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. Mr Gates said, ""Most governments do not talk about sanitation, therefore, it remains a hidden problem. The Indian government is to be congratulated for putting a focus on sanitation. Given that this is a long lead time in terms of capital investment and the processes, I feel good about the progress that's been made in India.""

This is not the first time, Bill Gates has lauded the government's commitment towards improving the sanitation in the country, in 2017 as well through his blog post titled 'India Is Winning Its War On Human Waste', Mr Gates talked about how he ""loved"" the mission, its uniqueness and the considerable progress it had managed to make in a short span of time.

2018 Highlights

For the first time, taking inspiration from its urban counterparts, Rural India unveiled Swachh Survekshan Grameen 2018, wherein, 6800 villages, 680 districts and 34,000 public places, across the country were ranked on the basis of its cleanliness-related parameters. The ministry also took feedback from 50 lakh citizens during the course of the Swachh Survekshan Grameen 2018.

This year, Rural Haryana, topped the chart of Swachh Survekshan - Grameen in North Zone, Rural Gujarat in West zone, Chhattisgarh in East Zone, Andhra Pradesh in South zone and Assam and Sikkim in North East zone.

Apart from Swachh Survekshan Grameen, this year the government also launched Swachh Bharat Summer Internship Programme, wherein the government asked youths to visit one or more villages during their summer vacations and contribute 100 hours and conduct activities of their choice to contribute to the cause of rural sanitation in India. The interns who will get excellent results will be awarded a cash reward and recognition at the national level. Students pursuing courses in higher education institutions will also be given two credit points for undergoing 15-days (100 hours) summer internship under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan activities.

Talking to NDTV on how programmes like Swachh Survekshan and 100-hour Swachh Internship is helping rural parts achieve the ODF target, a senior official from the ministry said,

These programmes contributed towards achieving the sanitation goal in one way or the other - wherever we are today is because of the efforts of swachhagrahis, who have contributed towards the cause of swachh India.

Giving an example, the officer said,

In Bihar, Sitamarhi became the first ODF district this year. The credit goes to all the swachhagrahis who helped construct 2 lakh toilets in mere two months' time. Not just that, 20,000 swacchagrahis from across India came to Motihari for a week to work on behavioural change among people of 38 districts of Bihar and help the state achieve its swachhta target on priority. Whether people are helping construct toilets or simply motivating the villagers about constructing toilets, the end result always will be an open defecation free area. So, the motive of launching these activities and programmes is always helpful in meeting the end target of ODF country.

Status Of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan In Urban India

According to Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs, 62 lakh Individual Household Toilets (IHHL) and 5 lakh Community and Public Toilet seats have been added in urban areas of India, making 21 states and Union Territories urban regions free from open defecation. Along with this, a major initiative of mapping of all public toilets in the country on Google maps has also been undertaken by the ministry to enable people to easily locate public conveniences. So far, 835 cities have uploaded more than 33,000 public toilets on google maps.

Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs Secretary Durga Shanker Mishra says that India's urban sanitation ration is at 95% and the ministry is confident that they will be able to achieve ODF success before the target of October 2019.

As per the ministry, to make urban areas 100 per cent ODF, the government needs to build 67 lakhs individual toilets and 5.8 lakhs public toilets in the country. In the meantime, the Ministry of Housing & Urban affairs has launched ODF+ and ODF++ protocols', with a focus on sustaining ODF tag and achieve holistic sanitation, wherein proper maintenance of toilets is done for their continued usage and safe management of faecal sludge from toilets is ensure so that no untreated sludge is discharged into open drains, water bodies or in the open.

Swachh Bharat Abhiyan - Creating Positive Strides

Speaking to NDTV about what sets Swachh Bharat Abhiyan apart from previously launched sanitation programmes in India, Parameswaran Iyer, Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation said, ""One of the things that really sets Swachh Bharat Mission apart from other programmes is that it is really caught on to people. It has today become like one of the biggest jan andolan, a people's movement and has captured the imagination of a billion Indians. The focus of the government today is not on constructing toilets but on bringing in the behaviour change amoung people.""

Mr Iyer further added,

The most innovative technology under Swachh Bharat Mission is the twin-pit toilet. The toilet is a complete package in itself - one can build it for about Rs12,000 and after a year can actually start earning money from it. Once one pit is full with the excreta, you close and start using another pit, by the time the second one is full, the contents from the first pit is successfully converted into a very good compost, which can be sold in the market, as a result, you end up earning money.

Swachh Bharat Mission: What Experts Have To Say

World Health Organisation report states that by the time Swachh Bharat Abhiyan reaches its goal in 2019 and India becomes open defecation free (ODF), more than 3 lakh lives would have been saved because people will have access to safe sanitation.

The government-sponsored National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS) conducted by an independent verification agency under World Bank also shows the positive side of Swachh Bharat Mission. As per the survey, usage of toilets in rural India is over 93 per cent in India, which means people are actually using toilets that are being constructed by the government successfully. But there are challenges.

Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) Director General Sunita Narain says, ""Building toilets is only the first and perhaps the easiest part. This cannot be seen as the ultimate yardstick of success. What are we doing with the immense amounts of solid and liquid waste that these millions of new toilets would be/are generating?""

Explaining how monumental the problem of not sorting faecal waste would be, CSE which did an assessment of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in 2017, highlighted that 1 lakh tonne of excreta every day is produced by 720 million people using 144 million household toilets. To sort such a massive amount of waste, more than 5,200 trucks would be needed every day.

CSE's Programme Manager with rural water-waste management Sushmita Sengupta says,

If waste is not managed well, it can turn out to be a far bigger problem than that of open defecation. The untreated waste can contaminate everything - from land to water sources.

Naina Lal Kidwai, Chairperson, India Sanitation Coalition also stressed on the fact of shifting focus of government from becoming an open defecation free country to achieving ODF Plus targets that means total sanitation in terms of solid waste management, improved sewerage lines, stormwater drains and pucca cement roads, in addition to open defecation free tag.

Ms Kidwai says,

If ODF Plus targets are not met then for India, Swachh Bharat Mission will be a very expensive failure. It is time we all, even the government start working towards the treatment part of the excreta, otherwise getting a Clean India tag will be very tough.

Apart from the challenge of waste management, the last mile of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan of attaining 100 per cent ODF status in less than a year, may not be easy. Three crore more toilets are needed to be built in rural parts of the country and five lakh toilets in urban parts of India, while that may seem achievable there are concerns emerging. Recently the Comptroller and Auditor General exposed cases of fudging of data in the state of Gujarat. It highlighted that in ODF Gujarat, 29 per cent of households still lack toilets and said that false claims have been made by the state in a rush to achieve ODF targets.

On the other hand, Centre Of Science and Environment's 2017 assessment of Swachh Bharat Mission highlights that the government aspirational target of making India clean and open defecation free by October 2, 2019, looks like a tough goal. The report highlighted the tardy progress in four states of India - Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, and Odisha in four years of Swachh Bharat Mission. These four states account for a massive 60 per cent of the people in India who defecate in the open and the report concluded that unless these states become open defecation-free, the world, and India, cannot meet their ODF target."

""All important functionaries of the party are strongly with Upendra Kushwaha. The party is known for Upendra Kushwaha. Those quitting RLSP are effectively ending their political careers,"" he said."

The teachers at the IITs and other institutes across the country have been served with notices by the income tax department asking them to pay a levy for accommodation on campus.

Both government and non-government employees have to pay tax on prerequisite value when the employer provides accommodation. For non-government employees, the pre-requisite value is 15 per cent of the salary + 30 per cent tax.

Confirming the same, professor Errol D'Souza, Director, IIMA, said, ""Our issue is that everyone here has equal housing. Two people living in similar houses and paying different rent is not equal to the law. This will force faculty to stay outside the campus as the cost of staying on campus will be very high. This will impact educational outcomes as we have classes even at 8.00 pm and also hold surprise quizzes.""

""IIMA follows a gurukul system where everyone lives on the campus. If that goes away, we might not be producing industry ready students. One of the best advantages of our students is that they can be called in at any time. We believe it is bad in law as it does not treat equals equally. We have represented to the Ministry of Finance expressing our concerns over this and I must say the secretary has been very supportive,"" he added.

Citing an example of an IIT professor based in Delhi, he said, ""Fortunately or unfortunately, a professor in Delhi, doing consultancy, was asked to pay more than his salary. He eventually made a representation and now the authorities are looking into the situation more seriously.

A faculty member, requesting anonymity, said, ""We are a public institution and we were given housing as a perk. We never got an HRA and were paying the license fee for the housing. The new formula, if implemented, will compel us to move out of campus, which will impact education. Many a time, the faculty and students discuss projects at night after classes, which is only possible because we all live together on the campus.""

Another faculty member said, ""This is a stupid policy. While it will not impact faculty in cities like Mumbai where the cost of living outside the campus would be high, in small towns or a city like Ahmedabad, cost of living on campus would increase so much that a faculty would prefer to live outside the campus. This policy will discourage residential campuses in small cities.""

Unfortunately, IISC and IIM-Bangalore have agreed to pay. IIM-Calcutta went for advanced ruling and is not supposed to pay."

He further added that initially both the Congress and the IUML had decided to boycott the bill, but later some parties changed their stance and so did the IUML and his party colleague E.T. Mohammed Basheer in the Lok Sabha did the needful by voting against the bill.

Kunhalikutty is expected to give an explanation in the coming few days.

I hail from Cuddalore district in Tamil Nadu. Since my childhood, I have always aspired to become a scientist.

I did my undergraduation in Materials Science and Engineering at the College of Engineering Guindy, Anna University, Chennai. I worked in Accenture for a year after graduation. It was during this period that I decided my passion lay in materials science. Due to sparse opportunities for materials scientists in India, I decided to pursue higher education abroad.

I received an admit from Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), U.S., to pursue masters in Materials Science and Engineering. After I accepted the offer, I embarked on a whole new journey. Just like every student who travels abroad to study, I had mixed feelings of tension, anxiety, and excitement.

Collabortaive work

Founded in 1829, RIT is an internationally recognised university, where students collaborate with specialists to create and innovate, and pursue their passion. When I landed in the U.S., RIT welcomed me with open arms. RIT has supreme research facilities in every department. My research mentor is Dr. K.S.V Santhanam, a world-renowned scientist in materials electrochemistry. Our research focuses on developing portable, sensitive and reliable sensors to measure the concentration of antibiotics. Our goal is use our method as a prelude to treating cancer. I presented my research at various international conferences.

During the beginning of each academic year, RIT has many new-student orientation events to help them to easily adapt to the Institute's culture.

To make international students feel at home, it also has dedicated staff working at the International Students Services (ISS), which advises and assists international students from more than 100 countries. To give back to the international student community, I closely work with ISS, serving as the Vice President of a student organisation called Global Union (GU).

GU, supervised by ISS, represents international students and numerous cultural organisations at RIT. Together, they organise many facilities for international students like offering airport pick-ups, educational workshops, and networking events. In short, ISS has made the lives of international students a lot easier.

I also had many other opportunities to grow. I volunteered to exhibit nano-science concepts to school kids in an annual event called ""Nanodays"". I joined the Toastmasters club on campus to become a proficient speaker. I am a peer advisor leader who helps in the orientation of incoming international students. Additionally, I also serve as a Secretary of Materials Research Society - University chapter.

I have now begun my four-year doctorate education in Microsystems Engineering at RIT."

(HT File)

With some school headmasters (HMs) dragging their feet over paying penalties for allegedly inflating attendance of students, the Bihar government has finally decided to recover fines by deducting the amount from their salary.

The HMs allegedly spiked attendance of students to claim more funds under the mid-day meal(MDM) programme.

Though the government received reports of irregularities long ago and imposed financial penalty on HMs, the fines could not be fully recovered. Many of the HMs moved court for relief citing their unwanted involvement in non-academic work, while others were just indifferent.

The government has ordered the recovery of a Rs8.68-crore penalty from HMs. Of which, Rs 4.21-crore (48%) has been recovered. More than 1,000 HMs have allegedly fudged the data since 2013, when the idea of penalty was first mooted by the state education department.

RK Mahajan, principal secretary of the department of education, recently directed all district programme officers (DPOs) to deduct the penalty amount from headmasters' salary in five instalments over as many months.

""The DPOs must ensure a monthly deduction from all those who have not deposited the penalty amount within a month of the receipt of the letter, except those who have got stay from the court,"" stated a letter by Mahajan.

""During inspections, the attendance of that particular day in the school and the average of the previous week is matched. If the deviation is within 10%, there is no issue. However, if the deviation is above 10%, a penalty equivalent to the amount given in the last three months is imposed on the headmaster,"" said Vinod Kumar Singh, director of the mid-day meal programme, .

Another official said that in several cases, the accused HMs with the help of their association approached the Patna high court or the Lokayukta, claiming that they were overburdened with non-academic work like management of MDM. The court has also asked the government to find an alternative to free teachers from MDM responsibilities.

Though the Bihar government tried to hand over MDM to NGOs or self-help groups (SHGs) and also ran pilot projects, a viable alternative has not been found because of the scale of the programme. In Bihar, despite a drop in enrolment numbers, 1.20 crore students from Class 1 to Class 8 are estimated to avail MDM daily.

In a Niti Ayog meeting a few months ago, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar advocated the direct benefit transfer for the centre's flagship MDM programme to plug leakages. ""Cooking in schools has a direct bearing on education. Instead of centres of learning, schools are viewed as centres of food. Poor quality and unhygienic conditions often lead to unpleasant incidents,"" he had said.

However, to achieve this, the Centre would have to change the policy at the national level, which seems unlikely. Bihar, on its part, has been seriously mulling the option of handing over MDM to women SHGs, which are 8 lakh in the state, the highest in the country. A pilot project has been launched in one block each of Jehanabad and Muzaffarpur to assess the feasibility."

Chief minister Raghubar Das on Friday, while reading out his government's achievements in past four years, said that not a single charge of corruption or scam was levelled against his government during his tenure.

Speaking at a function held to celebrate the completion of four years of the BJP government in Jharkhand at CM House, he said good governance, right policies and commitments helped Jharkhand, which was synonymous to corruption and scams till few years back, to achieve hordes of milestones in the past four years.

""Now, people of the state proudly say I am a Jharkhand resident. This is the difference we made in the past four years,"" Das claimed.

In a bid to fulfill people's aspirations, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had created Jharkhand in 2000 but aspirations of the people were not fulfilled due to political instability, as a weak government does not have the power or commitment to take strong decisions, Das said, adding, most of the energy in weak or coalition governments goes in protecting the chair.

""Earlier, Jharkhand was known for left wing extremism. Due to government's strong decisions and efforts of security personnel, the extremism is taking its last breaths and peace prevailed across the state, which is the main rider of development,"" Das said.

The chief minister said that the government's focus has been on agriculture and rural development in the past four years. Under Ujjwala scheme, 47 lakh gas connections were provided while another 13 lakh women would get connections by March 2019. For women empowerment, Jharkhand is the first state in the country where property in the name of a woman is registered at Re 1.

He further said that 32% villages have been provided access to pure drinking water through pipelines so far. ""We are committed to provide safe drinking water through pipelines to all villages by 2022,"" he said, adding, houses would be provided to urban homeless by 2020. ""The project for urban homeless would start from Ranchi in January, where 27,000 houses will be built,"" he said.

Jharkhand government has so far provided jobs to 35 lakh people and one lakh youth got appointment letters on January 10, CM said.

The CM also counted the challenges on the occasion. He said more works needed to be done in health and education sector. School mergers and construction of five new hospitals are some of the initiatives that were taken in this regard.

Chief minister Raghubar Das also announced that the Mukhya Mantri Sukanya Yojana for girl empowerment and eradication of child marriages would be launched from January 1. Under the scheme, an incentive of Rs 5,000 will be given on birth of girl child. The amount will be credited to mother's account through direct benefit transfer, CM said. The incentive of Rs 5,000 will be given on enrollment at classes 1, 5, 8, 10 and 12. He said that an incentive of Rs 10,000 will be given if the girl remains unmarried till the age of 18 and Rs 30,000 would be given for her marriage under the scheme.

The chief minister also announced that Jharkhand would be fully electrified by December 31, 2018. He said electrification was a challenge in 10,000 houses of 247 villages. ""We have electrified the houses through solar power. Centre had given March 2019 as the deadline for electrification. We have achieved this three months before,"" Das said.

Here's What Women Have To Say","http://outlookindia.com/",FALSE,"Periods can be painful and messy, and it's a public health issue no one really talks about. According to a 2012 study, 96 per cent of the female workforce (it's 91 for males) is employed in the informal sector, where staying home due to menstrual pain usually means losing a day's wages or, worse, getting replaced. So it did seem like a step in the right direction when a Mumbai-based digital media company last year announced that all female employees can be on paid leave on the first day of their period every month. But ensuring that the first-day off is also extended to the overwhelming majority of women is more difficult than ensuring minimum wages are paid, which too isn't often the case.

So does menstruation add to the odds stacked against women at work? Different women have different experiences with the menstrual cycle. While some breeze through their periods, many others face severe pain, heavy bleeding, headache, nausea, depression and sleeplessness. According to Dr Rishma Dhillon Pai, consultant ­gynaecologist at Jaslok Hospital and Research Centre, Mumbai, menstrual pain or dysmenorrhoea affects nearly half of the women in the working age group, and 20 per cent of them may suffer from endometriosis or fibroids that may cause severe pain and bleeding.

Then there are the ­differences related to the nature of work -- for example, between work that ­involves standing long hours and that which can be done sitting. The way menstrual problems would affect a shop assistant's workday would be different from the case of those working in call centres. The problems faced by those working outdoors would be different from those who work indoors. The menstrual cycle would affect someone whose job primarily involves physical labour differently from one whose work involves more mental engagement. ""Overall, most women work through their menses,"" says Dr Pai. ""Education and inf­ormation play a major role in dispelling myths, misconceptions and fears associated with menstruation. Most conditions are treatable and women do not need to suffer painful periods.""

One of those who haven't experienced pain during their menstrual cycle is Dr Gayathri Vasudevan, co-founder and CEO of LabourNet Services India Pvt Ltd. Referring to her personal secretary, who is prone to menstrual cramps, Vasudevan says, ""It became necessary for me as an employer and her immediate reporting manager to allow her to take leave during her monthly cycle. The management needs to be sensitive to women who suffer immensely during their monthly periods and allow them to work from home or grant them leave. But I'm not in favour of a policy that specifically grants leave to women during periods as I fear this will push back women to a time when they were isolated.""

""My periods have been ­debilitating, at times going on for 15 days with heavy bleeding,"" says Kiran Manral, ideas editor with SheThePeople.TV, who was nine when she had her first period and was ­diagnosed with PCOS ­(polycystic ovarian syndr­ome) at 16. ""But I don't like to take a day off unless I am ­absolutely unable to function. That has rarely happened. But I also understand that a woman may feel she needs the day off to care for herself, and that's completely fine. I think women should be given a few additional days of sick leave for this.""

Won't more leaves accentuate the hiring bias against women, given maternity leave is sometimes informally cited as a reason to avoid hiring them in the reproductive age bracket? But even the idea of maternity leave had faced much resistance from employers, and is one of the gains of the struggles of women workers for their workplace rights. Women organised and agitated against the conditions that turned their capacity to be mothers into a disempowering factor for them vis-à-vis their employers -- more cost-efficient as workers than men as they could be made to work more for less wages, with employers weighing their wages against the risk that they might have to be replaced on becoming mothers. As there were always others out of work and looking for a job, women mostly had to settle for lower wages and their average wage across sectors has been lower than men doing the same or comparable work.

The nature of work influences how menstrual problems affect women.An officegoer and a farm worker would be affected in different ways.

Now that the concept of maternity leave has gained acceptance and has been written into labour laws in most parts of the world, inc­luding India (Maternity Benefit Act, 1961), doesn't ­'period leave', which too ­relates to a physiological ­process unique to women -- and one encountered every month from puberty to ­menopause -- deserve similar attention? Currently, menstrual leave is available to women in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and some provinces in China.

In India, the directive ­principles of state policy ­enshrined in the Const­itut­ion contain provisions ­reco­mmending that the State should enact laws for the welfare of woman workers. Article 42 says it is among the State's goals to ensure just and humane conditions of work, including maternity rel­ief. This means a law ena­c­ted in that light would be uph­eld as constitutionally valid.

""Menstrual problems must be addressed by passing a law entitling women to menstrual leave,"" says Abha Singh, former civil servant and an advocate practising in the Bombay High Court. ""All eyes must now turn to Parliament, which, having enacted the Maternity Benefit Act in 1961, is at an opportune moment to undo the injustice that has plagued women for ages.""

With rising social awareness about the hardships women face in the workplace, there is a gradual realisation that menstrual problems cannot be brushed under the carpet. Just like a few companies are now offering free egg-freezing options to their women employees, some may also offer menstrual leave as a way of showing concern for their welfare. Obviously, not every company would agree on this. ""It's simply not feasible to have an employee missing from work each month, for something like a period that can be managed,"" says Richa Singh, CEO of Niine Sanitary Napkins. ""Everybody at some stage suffers from allergies, headaches or gastric issues, and we can manage these and maintain our work schedules. There should be no stigma ­attached to openly talking about it, and a woman should be able to take a sick leave if she is having a particularly tough period.""

Dr Veena Aurangabadwala, a gynaecologist at Zen Multispeciality Hospital, Mumbai, says, ""Instead of asking for period leave, women should focus on ­improving their pain endurance and fitness, by having certain minimum hours of physical exercise every week."" Many women manage their periods with pain relievers, warm baths or hot fomen­tation. If the discomfort is so much that it stops a woman from working, then she must be evaluated by a gyn­aecologist to rule out any pathological cause such as endometriosis or fibroids.

Employers too can explore options other than granting period leave. ""They can inc­rease the number of casual or sick leaves for their female workforce. They can leverage technology wherever possible to offer telecommuting and work-from-home opti­ons,"" says Rituparna Chak­raborty, ­president of the Indian Staffing Federation."

A litany of protests lined up the roadside - the Left Democratic Manch Assam was protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, the Akom Premi Yuva Chatra Samaj agitating for such a Citizenship Bill to stop ""illegal"" migrants. Police barricades, green uniformed men, red flags and a steady flow of slogans, all led to an onslaught of colours and sounds.

But the brightest spectacle of them all was to be found in the corner of the street, right at the intersection of Jantar Mantar Marg and Tolstoy Road.

Hundreds of transgender persons had gathered to protest the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2018, which was passed on December 17 in the Lok Sabha. With sarees, posters, lipstick and bindis of all shades and sizes, the protestors had come from across India, including the states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and West West Bengal.

""The government of India is saying that this bill is towards the welfare of the transgender communities, but there is no mention of education, health, benefits, employment, livelihood programme inheritance law. These are required. Why are they being denied? Our fight is about this,"" trans-activist Aparna Banerjee told News18.

Aparna is a board member of the West Bengal Transgender Development Board and the secretary of Amitie Trust, a platform for sexual minorities that focuses on their health and livelihoods.

With long flowing hair, a brown saree with golden lining, and big red bindi, Banerjee's loud, hoarse voice filled the street as she urged the members of her community to keep fighting till their deaths.

The transgender community has been agitating against the Bill ever since it was first introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2016. ""The Bill that was introduced in 2016 was a pathetic bill,"" Deputy Director of Lawyer's Collective, Tripti Tandon exclaimed. ""It betrayed a complete lack of understanding for the transgender community, their concerns, their problems. That's when community objected.""

The primary concerns the transgender community has raised about the present form of the Bill (which wasn't so different from the 2016 version) were the Screening Committees that would attest an individual's ""trans-identity"", decreased sentencing for violence upon transgender persons and imprisonment of those who ""compel/entice a transgender person to indulge in the act of begging"".

""If you, a cisgender person, are not asked to strip before anyone to prove your gender, why should I? I am a man, and have identified that way since childhood, and I should not have to prove this to anyone,"" said one of the speakers at the event.

A survey of 918 transgender conducted in 2016 by the State Literacy Mission under the Government of Kerala found that almost 50% earned an income of less than Rs.1000, and as many as 20.35% were unemployed. Almost 14% of the group surveyed were either illiterate or had dropped out by class seven.

Grace Banu from Tamil Nadu said ""Without reservation, we have no opportunities. No one is ready to offer us the chance to work,"" anti-caste trans-activist Grace Banu addressed the crowd. Grace is the founder of the Trans Rights Now Collective and was the first trans-person in Tamil Nadu to get admission in an engineering college in 2014.

Another problem the transgender community highlighted was the bill's insistence on keeping the transgender persons with either their families or in rehabilitation homes.

""I knew I was male when I was in the second grade. I liked male things,"" said 35-year old Saransh Pathak. But, Saransh didn't realize what these impulses were till he was 17-years old. ""It's been ten years since I've been trying to explain it to my family. It became very difficult to live at home. I have had to stay away for some time. They thought this was a phase but it wasn't, I couldn't tell them that,"" he said.

Members of the trans-community are often forced to flee their homes to escape mental and physical abuse at the hands of their families. Many of them find their way to gharanas, which are essentially communities of transgender persons.

These hijra communities follow a strict hierarchy with a Naayak as the primary decision maker, followed by a number of gurus (literal translation is teacher) who then have many chelas (disciples) below them. The gurus in these gharanas initiate a person into the network. Essentially, these gharanas become a place of refuge, an almost non-biological family for innumerable transgenders who face social exclusion.

The bill however, restricts the definition of a family to a group of people ""related by blood or marriage or by adoption made in accordance with law.""

Members of various gharanas from Delhi, West Bengal and Telangana were present at the protest.

""From childhood to adulthood to old age, no one ever asked up if we had eaten (no one ever cared). This ancient tradition that taught us to breathe and live of guru-chela cannot be forbidden by the government"", Aparna Banerjee told the crowd in her impassioned speech.

The meeting was also attended by several members of the parliament, namely Trinamool Congress' Derek O' Brien and Kakoli Ghosh, Congress' Amee Yagnik and Rajeev Gowda, CPI (M)'s Elamaram Kareem and DMK's Tiruchi Siva.

It was Tiruchi Siva who had introduced the first ever legislation regarding transgender rights in the country, only a few months after the landmark Supreme Court judgement that declared ""transgender"" as the third gender.

The Rights of Transgender Bill, 2014 that followed from Siva's Private Member bill contained provisions for reservations in jobs, unemployment allowances and protection against discrimination in workplace,

The bill was passed in the Rajya Sabha in 2015, but was never tabled in the Lok Sabha.

Meanwhile, Social Justice and Empowerment Minister of the Bhartiya Janata Party led government, Thaawar Chand Gehlot introduced the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill.

Although, the house is not allowed to take up bill which contain topics that are similar to a pre-existing bill, it was argued that the 2016 bill was addressing very different issues.

""The government bill is a totally diluted one and is not an alternate to my bill,"" Siva told News18 shortly after addressing the crowd.

Listing the provisions for jobs, statutory commission which the earlier Rajya Sabha bill includes, Siva rued, "" Instead of serving or addressing the issues which are concerned about the community it is trying to criminalise the people."" He blamed the government for intentionally leaving the 2014 bill pending, saying that it was a result of their ego.

The drums had started to sound by now, trans-women were coming together in a circle. They flayed their hands and swung their hips with a kind of gaiety, markedly different from the angered, sombered air that had filled the gaps between the speeches earlier."

He is wearing a Christmas-red turtle-neck sweater and a black sleeveless down jacket. He has again reverted to wearing a scraggly, greying beard. In another room, half-a-dozen Congress spokespersons wait to have an interaction with him. They are being prepped for the outcome of the day's debate in Parliament and to engage in a slugfest with their BJP counterparts on prime time television later that evening. The aggression his partymen show reflects Rahul's belief in giving his opponents as good as he gets. And how he is transforming the moribund Grand Old Party.

It's been just a little over a year since Rahul took over as president of the Congress, but he has already attained the stature of a leader who has arrived. That's because, thanks to his untiring effort, 2018 brought plenty of sunshine to dispel the gloom that had enveloped the Congress party ever since its drubbing in the 2014 Lok Sabha election when its seat strength fell to 44. Rahul has led from the front all through the year. He made 50 tours to 17 states, including eight poll-bound ones. He relentlessly attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi on four key electoral issues the agrarian crisis, the flailing economy, unemployment and the Rafale fighter jets deal. He has unleashed a social media war on the BJP, inventing new phrases such as chowkidar chor hai, which have stuck. He grabbed centre stage in a Lok Sabha debate by hugging a nonplussed prime minister in the full glare of TV cameras to show that he didn't treat his opponents as enemies.

Now, with three creditable victories in the Hindi heartland under the Congress belt and having outmanoeuvred the BJP in forming a coalition government in Karnataka, the party is showing signs of a dramatic resurgence. It has also catapulted Rahul to new prominence as the prime challenger to Narendra Modi for the 2019 general election. The significance of the three victories can be gauged from the fact that, in 2014, the BJP won 62 of the 65 Lok Sabha seats spread across these states. On a personal front, he has emerged as a leader with cross-party acceptance the DMK's Stalin sees him as the future prime minister, the NCP's Sharad Pawar and the CPI(M)'s Sitaram Yechury are his sounding boards, the SP's Akhilesh Yadav and the RJD's Tejashwi Yadav are his young buddies and the TDP's N. Chandrababu Naidu, whose politics once revolved around opposing the Congress, has now been working as the unofficial convenor of a coalition of anti-BJP parties with the Congress at its core.

Rahul was always determined to deal with his illustrious legacy on his own terms, and when he not his mother or party thought he was ready.

The victories may have enhanced Rahul's stature enormously, but he looks upon them with humility. As he sat down for an exclusive interaction with INDIA TODAY at his house, he shied away from accepting credit for his party's recent wins, saying, I have a problem with anyone saying that I alone did it. I'm part of a political organisation with an ideology. I have a role, but these victories should be attributed to the people of these states, the Congress workers and the infrastructure we set up. Elaborating further, he says, We were in power for 10 years, and I must say with sadness that the Congress party became arrogant. I'm trying to put into the minds of our leaders that humility is the essence of our country. You cannot represent India without being humble. With humility comes the understanding of the country and the way forward.

It is one of the many changes that Rahul is bringing about to rejuvenate the Congress and once again make it the prime force to develop the country. Rahul now exudes the energy and clarity needed to achieve the mammoth tasks he has set for the party. In December last, when Rahul ended his Hamletian dilemma and accepted the nomination as Congress president, things began inauspiciously. Two days after he took over, the results of the crucial Gujarat assembly election were announced. Despite a strong fight by the Congress, it failed to prevent the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from registering its sixth consecutive victory in the state. That loss capped a miserable year for the Congress, in which it lost three states that it had ruledHimachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Manipur to the BJP and allowed Goa and Meghalaya to slip from its grasp. The only saving grace was a win in Punjab.

Over the previous four years, Rahul had tried desperately to pick up the pieces of the party after its devastating defeat in 2014. Although Sonia Gandhi was in charge of the party, Rahul as vice president faced as much flak. In the aftermath, state after state that the Congress-ruled succumbed to the onslaught of the Narendra Modi-Amit Shah steamroller, leaving the cadre demoralised and raising grave doubts over Rahul's ability to revive the party. Meanwhile, the Modi government unleashed a welter of cases against the Nehru-Gandhi family, targeting not just Sonia and Rahul but also his brother-in-law Robert Vadra. For Rahul, it became a fight for survival, not just of the Congress but also himself and his family. He knew that 2018 would be a year of reckoning. He had to find his political groove or he would be consigned to the dustbin of history along with his party.

How did things reach such a now-or-never point for Rahul Gandhi? His evolution as a leader began when he joined politics in 2004. Despite his illustrious lineage, politics did not come naturally to Rahul. When he joined the party as a 34-year-old, he was hesitant to take the lead, preferring to operate from behind the scenes. He was impulsive in his decisions, uncomfortable with the old guard in his party and spoke in staccato bursts that often landed him in controversy.

But even then, Rahul was determined to be a different kind of politician. He would tell his friends that the superficiality of Indian politics was driving him crazy. He did not want to become just another politician or take over the mantle by virtue of his pedigree. He wanted to rebuild the Congress from its roots but found to his dismay that the party had more leaders than cadre, and power, with all its perks and pelf, was its only glue. As he put it, My biggest challenge is that all political parties in India have a cultural problem. All politicians there are a few exceptions once they come to power, tend to think they are the owners. They are at best, as Mahatma Gandhi said, trustees.

There were many opportunities for Rahul to come to the forefront and take charge during the 10 years of the UPA government headed by the Congress. But he told his friends that he never wanted to become an alternative power centre to Manmohan Singh, the then prime minister or to his mother, Sonia. He preferred to remain a backroom leader. Only recently has he revealed that he initiated the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) when the UPA was in power and had worked towards making it a success. Also that, along with top Congress ministers and leaders, he was able to restore normalcy to Kashmir. He also confessed that he found himself in a strange place during the UPA government he would get the flak for anything it did wrong but could not attack it when it was going astray.

For Rahul, 2014 was the perfect storm. Finding out there were two Congresses within one, he worked towards giving each their dueand space

Rahul was born to a great family. And greatness was also being thrust on him. But he was determined to deal with the legacy on his own terms and when he not his party or mother thought he was truly ready. That moment would take its time coming 13 years after he took to politics. Asked why he chose to become the president of his party only last year, Rahul said, The Congress party has a particular spirit in the sense, it has deep ideas. I felt that I needed more time to understand these ideas. Now I understand them better. His opponents took his vacillation as a sign of weakness that he did not have the stuff to lead the grand old party, let alone the great Indian nation.

Meanwhile, India had no need to wait for him or the Congress. As the UPA government withered in its second term and Rahul exhibited his characteristic ambivalence, it allowed space for the extraordinary rise of Narendra Modi. He would fashion a narrative that would captivate a nation and take him to the pinnacle of power. From his chaiwala moorings to his emergence as the strongman of the BJP-RSS combine and the Gujarat model of development, Modi presented himself as the perfect foil to the flailing and indecisive leadership of the Congress. And pillory it for relying on namdaars (dynasts) to stay in power. In 2014, Modi swept to power, with the BJP winning a majority on its ownthe first party to do so in 25 years. The Congress was decimated and Rahul and Sonia barely hung on to their seats.

For Rahul, the 2014 defeat was the perfect storm, the absolute best thing for me, as he put it. It was a trial by firea cathartic moment. It was a time not only for introspection but also for action. Rahul embraced the challenge head on. Organisationally, he began to get the measure of the Congress. There was a deep divide between the old guard and the newcomers that Rahul had brought to the fore. There were, in effect, two Congresses within one. Instead of pushing aside the old guard, many of whom he would earlier treat with disdain, he worked hard to retain their wisdom and experience even as he injected youthful leadership into the party. Each had to be given their due and space. He would later say that it was the sandpaper of the Congress that helped him smoothen his rough edges.

One of Rahul's strategies to rebuild the party was to create clusters of talent in each state, blending the old guard with the new

The first big challenge for Rahul after he took over as president was to constitute the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the most powerful decision-making body of the party, on July 17 this year. Rahul opted to play safe by accommodating most of the veterans and making space for the young dynasts, though the average age of 63 of the CWC members belied his promise of inducting young blood. Rumours of a cold war between Rahul and Ahmed Patel, the former political secretary of Sonia Gandhi, were similarly silenced when the Congress chief elevated Patel to the post of treasurer something reserved only for the Nehru-Gandhi family's most trusted advisors.

Rahul's other formula was to build clusters of talent within each state, blending the old guard with the new. So in Madhya Pradesh, Kamal Nath was brought in to lead the party while Jyotiraditya Scindia and the younger leaders were given major roles. In Rajasthan, while he made Sachin Pilot the president of the state unit, he did not make the mistake of ignoring Ashok Gehlot, a former two-term chief minister, who had grassroots support in the state. When it came to anointing chief ministers, though, Rahul fell back on the old guard because, as a senior leader put it, There was a need to have a meeting point between the two parties within the party, but he also held out the promise of a transition. Rahul made sure the messaging was right. He posted photographs of smiling chief ministerial aspirants of Rajasthan, MP and Chhattisgarh after he brokered peace between them. The message was loud and clear of being a leader who takes everyone along, ensures consensus and doesn't impose his decisions.

Rahul also perfected a hands-on style of operation, moving swiftly to resolve crises. In an informal conversation with party workers during the MP election campaign, state Congress stalwart Digvijaya Singh said: I don't even go to give speeches because the Congress loses votes if I speak. The statement was caught on camera and the media projected it as a rebellion by Digvijaya. Rahul called the veteran and asked him to share the stage with him the same day at a rally in Joura near Morena. Later that night, Digvijaya flew with Rahul to Delhi, busting the impression that the Congress was a divided house. Unlike in the past, he is not averse to micro-management. He is still a keen believer in following due process, but in crisis, he is ready to bypass it. His responses are now much quicker, says a CWC member.

Another such quick decision was the deal the Congress struck with Janata Dal-Secular (JD-S) immediately after the results of the Karnataka assembly election in May. Though the Congress emerged as the second largest party with 78 seats in the 224-member house, Rahul did not hesitate to offer the post of chief minister to JD-S leader HD Kumaraswamy to deny the BJP, which fell 11 seats short of a majority, the chance to form a government. Taking lessons from the experience in Goa, Manipur and Meghalaya where the Congress was the single largest party, but was thwarted by the BJP's speedy management of MLAsRahul immediately dispatched Gehlot and Ghulam Nabi Azad to Karnataka, two veterans known for their political manoeuvring to ensure that the tables were turned on the saffron party. When Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Vala installed a BJP government, Rahul flew in Abhishek Manu Singhvi from Chandigarh to fight a midnight legal battle in the Supreme Court, which eventually led to the resignation of the 48-hour-long BJP government in the state.

The indispensability of the likes of Patel, Nath and Gehlot also reflects Rahul's growing acknowledgement of the importance of backroom manoeuvring in electoral politics. In 2019, the Congress will have to fight the charisma of Modi and the financial might of the BJP, says a Congress general secretary. While the Congress president will take on Modi, these veterans with huge networks have been tasked to generate resources read funds to fight elections next year. Resource mobilisation has been one of the key drivers behind Rahul's speeches and interactions at several global universities and think tanks in the past two years. Funds from NRIs played a key role in Modi's election campaign in 2014. These tours were an attempt to reach out to the NRIs and showcase what Rahul Gandhi stands for, and his intellectual calibre, in contrast to Modi, who sounds like a street fighter, says a young Congress leader who'd travelled with Rahul on one of these tours.

In his interaction with India Today, Rahul emphasised that among the things he was trying to do for the Congress was to make decisions based on conversations and by listening. By doing so, he said, you can be reasonably close to a fair outcome, and the mood of the organisation dramatically improves. Earlier this year, Rahul launched the Shakti mobile application, which not only allows the party to keep tabs on new enrolments in real time but also facilitates two-way communication between the Congress president and the grassroots workers. Rahul made extensive use of the inputs gathered from grassroots workers through the Shakti app as well as from the research team in finalising candidates and, in some cases, selecting party positions. For instance, in Karnataka, the decision to make Dinesh Gundu Rao president was based on the research team's inputs on his performance in elections. The Congress campaign strategy in MP, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh was based on the feedback of its cadre on the key issues in the states.

Rahul's other big challenge was to shake off his partymen's apprehensions that the Congress's core ideology was somehow less powerful than the RSS-BJP's Hindutva. As he told INDIA TODAY, Our central fight is against a limited number of people who believe they are India's destiny. Mr Modi and Mr Shah believe they are India. That's an insult to India. India is an idea that is much bigger than any individual or group. We believe that this country has to be run harmoniously and not by autocracy or dictatorship. The Congress ideology strives to make people feel that they are a central part of a great mission. It resonates within the Congress, the opposition and even elements in the BJP.

Ever since the Congress lost the 2014 election, Rahul identified the RSS as one of the biggest threats to the survival of the Congress. With its aggressive Hindutva agenda, supported by the Sangh Parivar, the BJP successfully built a narrative of the Congress as a party that favoured Muslims, to the detriment of the majority community. The Congress initially tried to hold on to the secular' slogan but found it electorally unsustainable in a highly polarised environment. Party circles say it was a conscious decision to challenge the BJP's monopoly over Hindutva that led to the emergence of Rahul Gandhi as a janeudhari Brahmin of the Dattatreya gotra. Not to mention his temple runs in the states that went to the polls. As party insiders put it, the Congress has projected its brand of soft Hindutva as inclusive and non-violent as against the divisive and aggressive brand of Hinduism practised by the likes of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.

At the same time, Rahul is aware that his primary target must be Narendra Modi, whose popularity in polls remains high despite the recent setbacks in the state assemblies. Rahul has pummelled all the achievements that the prime minister flaunts, harping on alleged corruption in the Rafale deal, farmers' distress and the lack of jobs caused by what he calls Modi developing a God complex one fine evening at 8 pm to demonetise India's economy and wipe out the informal economy. Unfortunately, apart from criticising Modi for failing on many fronts, Rahul has so far not come up with an alternative narrative or vision of development that might woo the voters and businessmen. Even in the three Hindi heartland states, he resorted to the promise of loan waivers to farmers to win over votes.

Rahul describes the core of his development strategy as being one of providing jobs, bolstering the economy and solving the farmers' crisis. The supporting pieces would be a massive boost to healthcare, education, as well as infrastructure to provide connectivity, including air transport. He is unwilling to reveal how the Congress would be different from the BJP in facing such challenges while promising that whatever his party would do in these sectors would revolutionise not only India but also the world. He believes the answers should come from within by listening to the people promising governance as a partnership and not a top-down mandate.

While the three state wins have boosted Congress hopes, the margins of the victory, if extrapolated to the Lok Sabha, show it would win just 32 of the 65 seats. With the 42 seats in Karnataka, Punjab and Puducherry, the other states they are ruling, totalling just 107 seats, the only way the Congress can overthrow the BJP in 2019 is by entering into strategic alliances with other Opposition parties. Rahul says he is open to a dialogue with these political parties, the goal being to work together while respecting their individual spaces.

Defeating the BJP in 2019 will be an uphill task. And Rahul knows he has to climb many more mountains to achieve it. But in 2018, he has shown that he has the mettle to take on the might of the Modi-Shah combine. He has engineered a Congress revival and emerged as the prime challenger to Modi in the next general election. For these reasons, India Today editors decided to make Rahul Gandhi the magazine's Newsmaker of the Year 2018.

The University Grants Commission (UGC) , the regulator of the higher education sector, has pushed ahead with the strategy of providing autonomous status to the country's better performing colleges, in an attempt to improve the quality of teaching and learning in the country's higher education institutions.

Thus far this year, it has given the autonomous status to 37 colleges, taking the total number to 672 colleges across 106 universities. To be sure, this has been UGC's long-time strategy: between 2007-08 and 2017-18, the number of autonomous colleges rose from 281 across 55 universities to 635 across 105.

According to data from UGC, the south Indian states account for a lion' s share of colleges with autonomy status. Tamil Nadu with 183 colleges leads the pack, followed by Andhra Pradesh (97), Karnataka (70) and Telangana (59).

Large states such as Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, with 11 and 5 autonomous colleges, lag behind. Interestingly, experts point out that Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan lag the southern states in various educational

indicators, perhaps suggesting a link between the presence of autonomous institutions and this.

Government officials are confident that with new guidelines for autonomous colleges issued earlier this year, more colleges from all geographical areas will now be applying for this status.

An autonomous college can review existing courses, programmes and restructure, redesign and prescribe its own courses or programmes of study and syllabi. These colleges can formulate new courses with the UGC-specified nomenclature and even evolve methods of assessment of students' performance and conduct of examinations.

However, even for these colleges, the degree is awarded by the University with the name of the college on the degree certificate.

""Nearly, 40 colleges in districts across the country were granted autonomous status in the current year by the commission. We are also planning to make the process of applying for autonomous status online and comparatively simpler. It is felt that autonomy can provide a much needed boost to academic standards,"" UGC secretary Rajnish Jain said.

Several top performing colleges have been given the autonomous college status in the course of this year, including Pune's Ferguson College, Chennai's Loyola College, L N Welingkar Institute of Management Development and Research, Mumbai and PSG College of Technology in Coimbatore, a government official said on condition of anonymity.

""Even in the last commission meeting on December 10, at least eight new colleges, including SGGS Khalsa college in Patiala, were approved for the autonomous status,"" this person added.

""The idea of academic autonomy to higher education systems is a good idea. But the full benefits of academic autonomy can be reaped only if the colleges have financial support to effectively implement innovations and new academic structures. In the absence of such a support only minor tinkering with the routine academic structures are possible,"" said former UGC member Inder Mohan Kapahy.

India started giving colleges such status in the eighties, Kapahy pointed out. Three decades on, an in-depth review may be called for to see if these colleges have fulfilled the original promise of helping the cause of academic excellence , he added."

Kushwaha said 35 state-level office-bearers and 1,200 active members of RLSP also joined the JD(U). Kushwaha said he tried his best to convince the RLSP chief to remain in the BJP-led NDA. ""But Upendra started feeling uncomfortable in the NDA ever since Nitish realigned with BJP,"" Shribhagwan said.

The three RLSP legislators in Bihar -- Lalan Paswan, Sudhanshu Shekhar (MLAs) and Sanjeev Shyam Singh (MLC) -- recently formed a separate group and staked claim on the RLSP name and election symbol.

Shribhagwan, who had deserted Jan Adhikar Party-Loktantrik (JAP-L) of Madhepura MP Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav in 2017, said he had joined the RLSP with the condition that the party would remain in the NDA. But Upendra ignored the sentiments of a large number of his party leaders and workers. Shribhagwan was JAP-L state president.

Before joining the JAP-L, Shribhagwan was state general secretary of RJD. He left the RJD after its president Lalu Prasad denied him the party ticket from Jagdishpur in 2015 assembly election. Lalu had fielded Ram Bishun Singh Lohia who won the election.

Before Joining RJD, Shribhagwan was with JD(U). He left JD(U) when Lalu offered him RJD symbol to contest the 2014 Lok Sabha election from Ara. Shribhagwan lost the election to BJP's Raj Kumar Singh.

Shribagwan began his political career with Indian People's Front and was elected an MLA on the party ticket from Jagdishpur in 1990. He later switched over to RJD and then to Samata Party and JD(U).

Welcoming him back in the party, JD(U) state president Singh said it was virtually a homecoming for Shribhagwan, who had also served as a minister in Nitish cabinet."

With the new academic year set to commence in the next few months, there are various key decisions that are now lying in the backburner as the CM is yet to allot ministries to the newly-elected members of the assembly.

Take for instance the schedule for common entrance tests and school admissions. Last year, the Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE) had declared the schedule for all common entrance tests on December 28 and released the admission schedule for schools on December 30. However, this year, the government is yet to commence the process for the same. ""The release of the schedule will take another 2-3 weeks. We have to wait before the minister of education department is appointed,"" said Papi Reddy, chairman of TSCHE, adding that there won't be much of loss as there is sufficient time before the exams are held.

Finalising of a committee to issue notification for fee fixation of professional courses also lies pending. ""First, a committee is constituted that will issue a notification calling applications from private colleges to fix the fee structure for the next three years. Once we receive applications, the same shall be audited and subsequently fee will be fixed. However, we have to wait for the minister to be appointed to seek approval on the committee,"" said Rama Rao, consultant at Telangana Admission and Fee Regulatory Committee (TAFRC).

Other aspects such as affiliation process for intermediate colleges and finalization of admission process for degree courses are also pending.

Making matters worse, several key positions such as principal secretary, commissioner of school education and chairman of the TAFRC also have to be finalised by the new education minister.

The delay by the chief minister has not only irked the opposition parties but also the parents community. ""The fee hike issue has been pending for the last four years. While the TRS party added the school fee issue in it's manifestos in 2014 as well this year, no results were yielded. Once the education minister is appointed, we intend to meet him and seek relief before commencement of the new academic year,"" said Subramanyam Neerukonda, president of Hyderabad School Parents Association (HSPA)."

The woman, who gave birth to a boy on September 15, told reporters that she tested positive after she was administered two units of blood at the hospital in April. Hospital dean Dr Vasanthamani P rejected the claim.

As per medical records, the woman visited a primary health centre in Mangadu on March 6 when doctors confirmed her pregnancy. In April, doctors referred her to KMCH for blood transfusion after they found her haemoglobin level was low. The report of a blood test she did at a private hospital on February 12 shows HIV negative.

At KMCH she was given two units of blood on April 5 and April 6, and she got discharged 10 days later. She was referred back to the hospital in August after scans showed the fetus was in ""breech position"" (legs down). That's when the hospital ordered the HIV test. ""Usually we assign a number along with every HIV test done. Her records did not have the number. So we repeated the test and she tested positive. We started her on medication and help her deliver a healthy baby in September,"" said hospital dean Dr Vasanthamani P.

The woman said she was forced to remain silent as she feared that she would be ostracized by her family and friends. But she petitioned health minister C Vijaya Baskar, health secretary J Radhakrishnan and other senior administrators. ""I did not receive any call from the government. When I read about how another pregnant woman acquired the infection, I decided to talk about my condition,"" she said. ""My husband has no infection. This hospital is the only possible source of infection,"" she said.

Director of medical education Dr A Edwin Joe said the government ordered for an inquiry in December. ""Today, the inquires revealed said the blood provided by the hospital was tested safe,"" he said.

The two units of blood (1962 and 2129) administered to the woman were labelled safe after they were screened on high-end equipment. While one of the blood samples were sourced from a college student, the other was a regular voluntary blood donor. ""We have a machine printed copy that says the samples were safe,"" said Dr Vasanthamani. ""It is difficult for us to point out the infection source now,"" she said.

Health activists and NGOs say the state health department should do a more detailed inquiry to clear its name. ""It is important for the hospitals to recall the donors for a HIV test. If they test negative, it is evident that the disease was not transfused through blood. What if the test was false negative because they were in their window period,"" said Karunanidhi, who works for a positive network NGO.

Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society project director K Senthil Raj said the state has not dropped its guard on blood screening. ""We have a robost screening programme. At least 60% of deliveries happen in GH. There is no need for women to panic,"" he said."

The meeting, which drew officials from administration, police, education and health departments, was convened in wake of back-to-back suicides by students over the past fortnight.

In the meeting, trainee IAS Devendra Kumar and trainee IPS Amrita were entrusted with the responsibility of carrying out social audit to dig into the reasons behind suicides committed by coaching students in Kota. The two officers were asked to study and analyse the deaths attributed to mental stress and depression and to submit their report to the district administration for necessary and preventive action.

The district collector, while stressing on the need to ensure stress-free environment, asked the participating officials to be pro-active in implementation of the guidelines for making the stay of young aspirants in Kota better and relatively with reduced stress. He asked the officials to ensure that the students arriving in Kota for coaching not face any hurdle or difficulty.

The decision to economically back up 'Hope Sansthan', the organisation already working to check suicides among the coaching students in Kota, and to extend them counselling in hour of need, was also taken up in the meeting.

It was decided that the Kota Municipal Corporation, UIT and the district administration will actively support the sansthan to carry out IEC activities for coaching students. Students of BSc nursing, sociology and psychology will also be trained to work as volunteers with the Sansthan to be able to reach out to the coaching students and trace any despondency among them.

There are over 115 accommodation units for faculty members on both new and old campuses where nearly 100 faculty members live.

Director of Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad (IIM-A) Professor Errol D'souza Friday spoke out against the new rent structure for accommodation of the faculty, saying it would affect the educational outcome of the institute and would force them to think of living outside the campus.

Prof D'Souza told The Indian Express on the sidelines of a media interaction that as per the revised rent for accommodation of faculty members on the campus, 15 cent of the salary is considered as the value of the house on which 30 per cent service tax has to be paid. Also, the accommodation will be looked upon as a perk. The new rent structure was introduced by the central government earlier this year.

At present, a faculty member pays a nominal rent of around Rs 5,000 for accommodation within the campus. There are over 115 accommodation units for faculty members on both new and old campuses where nearly 100 faculty members live.

ExplainedNew rent structure will push faculty out of campus

The high point of the IIM-A experience is its residential, self-contained campus, which the new rent structure strikes at in an indirect way. Faculty members are known to have opposed it and are seeing it something that will force them to live outside the campus. This would take away the bonhomie that they share with the students living on the campus.

""The institute's stand is that it will affect the educational outcome of the institute. We believe that our institute is like a gurukul system. Everyone is there and everyone benefits from everyone being there. If that (new rent structure) is implemented, we are not sure we will produce industry-ready students because one of the greatest advantages of our students is that we are just a call away. The industry values that because we train them that way. So we have said that it can be affected,"" said D'Souza.

""Our issue is that everyone on the campus has equal housing. Two persons living in equal houses will pay different taxes. This is not good in law,"" he added. ""Third thing we are saying is that the main function of our campus is that everyone lives on the campus. Once you go to this (the new) situation, people have already started thinking that may be I should live outside. Then the whole idea of our type of education will go because we have classes till 8 o'clock, 9 o clock in the evening. If that goes away then I think the value of the campus will also go,"" the director said.

""Since there are talks going on in the campus of such an exorbitant rent structure to be levied on the faculty members and thus a few of them have also heard saying that in that case they are thinking of moving out. This will adversely affect the existing system of the institute,"" said a senior faculty member of the institute.

D'Souza said it all started from Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore. ""This has happened in Bangalore (implementation of the new rent structure). Unfortunately, the institute caved in (gave in to the pressure), I don't know why. If they wouldn't have caved in then this wouldn't have started but their internal people told them to pay and they paid. Once IISc did, they (government) went to IIM-Bangalore, saying since you are in the same city so you also follow,"" he said.

Also, there is a case of a professor at IIT, Delhi on whom the the same (new) rent structure was imposed and the tax the professor was asked to pay was more than his salary. ""So the professor sort of represented (protested) and now they are looking at it a little seriously hopefully. There are loopholes in the law,"" he added.

Citing the ruling of the appellate tribunals in the case of IIMs in Indore, Bangalore and Calcutta pertaining to the service tax levied on the fee charged by the institute for four postgraduate programmes,D'Souza said that the GST council in their minutes have said that they have approved it (the exemption). ""Now the GST council in their minutes have said that they have approved it but not said from which date. My sense is that GST council may not be empowered to say in retrospect. In this case we may have to continue fighting,"" he said.

""We have now made representation to the Ministry of Finance but do not know whether they will respond or not,"" he said. The director ""hoping to get some positive response"" said that the secretary in (the Ministry of Finance) has been supportive and ""we hope such sort of support happens"".

He said, ""The interesting thing is that this is India after all and all the appellate tribunals have different views on this. So the advance ruling that we went to, rather we did not go, but we were caught with the things so we are fighting it. But as in the advance ruling for our PGPX (post graduate programme in management for executives), where Indore and Bangalore went for an advance ruling and they were told you have to pay a service tax. While Calcutta went for an advance ruling and they were told you do not have to pay. So the same tax guys have different views on that across the country. So we said okay if one tribunal has said can we apply (it to IIM-A), they said no you cannot apply in Gujarat. Gujarat might have been a different issue. So what is national law no one knows.""

On a lighter note, he said that it is an interesting thing so he has asked his faculty that they should write a case on this."

Days after a woman in Sivakasi, Tamil Nadu, contracted HIV through blood transfusion at a government hospital, a second woman has come forward, claiming she was infected by the virus while pregnant after blood transfusion at Chennai's state-run Kilpauk Medical College (KMC).

However, the KMC administration has claimed they have ""99 per cent"" ruled out the complaint, stating that they have tested one of two donors who had donated the blood when the woman had undergone a blood transfusion in the hospital in April. The second donor couldn't be traced by authorities. However, her baby has not been infected by the virus, according to preliminary tests after birth.

Talking to The Indian Express, the woman, who lives in the suburbs of Chennai, said she had raised multiple complaints with the hospital authorities and sent petitions to the state Health Minister C Vijayabaskar and Health Secretary J Radhakrishnan in early last month, seeking justice after she was detected with virus.

""I did not receive any reply from them. My attempts to meet the dean of KMC also was failed as they stopped me whenever I sought an appointment. I was HIV-negative when I had tested my blood sample in March 2018. I don't have money to file a case against the government now. Neither I had the courage. I am fully shattered now as even my close relatives and own sisters have abandoned me now. They haven't even touched my baby after delivery as they learnt that I am HIV-positive,"" the woman said.

Going by her medical records, the woman sought consultation at a public health centre (PHC) near her house in February, complaining of her menustral irregularities. In March, she had to return to the PHC citing health problems, and a blood test done in a private laboratory found that she was anaemic with haemoglobin levels far below standards. She was immediately referred to KMC for blood transfusion.

""I spent about 14 days in the hospital, where I had two units of blood transfusion including one on the day of admission, April 5, and the second transfusion another day. I also had about 10 injections for anaemia. I was five months pregnant then. After the blood transfusion, my haemoglobin levels improved and I was discharged,"" the woman said.

While her expected delivery date was on September 26, a medical scan taken as per the direction of the nearby PHC on eighth month of pregnancy found that the foetus had a complication. She was referred to KMC again on August 18.

As an outpatient, she was asked to go for a blood test, which found she was HIV-positive. Soon, her husband was also called in for a blood test and he was HIV-negative. Records show that KMC started ART (an Antiretroviral Therapy to prevent the virus growth) on her from August 20. ""I was heartbroken. When I denied having any other sexual relationships to the doctors when they probed, they themselves said that it could have been infected from the blood transfusions. In between, we went to a private hospital to verify the KMC results but the result was HIV-positive,"" she said.

She delivered her baby on September 15, and multiple tests on the baby proved that he was not infected of virus. ""I couldn't even feed my son. He has three more tests in coming months to rule out any chances of getting the virus,"" she said. Her elder son is five years old.

Reacting to woman's complaint that she got the virus due to blood transfusion, Dr P Vasanthamani, dean of KMC, said they have already probed the matter on direction from the Directorate of Medical Education after the woman sent complaints to the minister and the health secretary.

""We have tested her husband who was found free from virus. She was given two units blood during the transfusion sessions, which were donated in a blood donation camp. We traced one of the donors, a college student, and he was tested negative again,"" she said. Claiming that KMC has 4th Generation Elisa Test procedures, which is used for the early detection of HIV virus, she said the screening test results of the donors were far below the positive value during the screening before transfusion.

""The second donor whose blood was used for her couldn't be traced as his phone remains switched off. Our inquiry confirms that the hospital procedures had no lapses, I would say 99 per cent. Just 1 per cent remains as a question as the second donor couldn't be traced,"" Vasanthamani said."

But, he is right now the tallest leader among BNP leaders, who is leading the party's election campaign.

With Bangladesh Nationalist Party's chairperson Khaleda Zia in jail since February and her son and political heir, Tarique, living in London, a bespectacled 70-year-old man enters the party office in Gulshan neighbourhood, Dhaka's most posh locality as everyone stands in attention.

Dressed in a maroon sweater, stylish checked muffler and black coat, the man has a hoarse voice since he has given more than 200 speeches in the last two months of campaign. He asks for a warm water and settles down in one of the sofas.

""There is no campaign, it's a reign of terror, that too State terror,"" says Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, secretary general of the BNP, the main opposition party, in an exclusive conversation with The Indian Express. He is the man running the party, in the absence of the Zia family, and will play a leadership role -- if they win the elections.

A few months ago, he stitched up the Opposition alliance as he approached veteran secular icon, Kamal Hossain, and is challenging the Awami League-led ruling alliance under incumbent Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in the upcoming parliamentary elections on December 30.

A self-confessed spartan eater and of medium built, he is not a tall man. But, he is right now the tallest leader among BNP leaders, who is leading the party's election campaign.

His first complaint are about how the police is being used by the ruling party. ""bhoyaboho obostha (it's a dangerous situation),"" he says, with an air of resignation, as he narrates how his wife and daughter, a 32-year-old teacher, were also stopped by the police while campaigning. ""I can't conceive that such a situation can happen,"" he says.

Lodged in a 19th century rundown jail in old Dhaka, Zia is allowed to meet her family and party leaders once in 15 days. While her sister Selina Islam, brother Shamim Iskander and sister-in-law Kaniz meet her and give her fresh set of clothes, Fakhrul has been able to meet her three times since February.

""We took her permission before announcing our entry into elections,"" he says. He confers with Tarique, who also faces corruption charges and lives in London for a decade now, over encrypted apps. Tarique interviewed the candidates being given tickets for the polls from London over Skype.

So, in the absence of the Zia family, he is the face of the party. Zia is apparently suffering from multiple ailments, including joint pain, diabetes, and has been allowed an attendant in the jail.

""I represent people of Bangladesh, We are a liberal democratic political party."" ""We look forward to economic development, and social and economic progress,"" he says.

But, most importantly, he says, ""We believe in democracy"". He adds that the BNP re-introduced multiparty democracy in 1991, when Gen H M Ershad's regime ended.

""We tried to meet Indian leaders outside the country. We sought appointment from the Indian High Commissioner, sought and met three times, it's not the other way around,"" he says, but feels that Indian diplomats are not keen to meet and engage with the BNP leaders since they don't want to upset the incumbent government led by Hasina.

""We seek friendship with India. And contrary to the perception in India, we don't believe in communalism, fundamentalism,"" he says emphatically. ""That's a totally a false perception that we are anti-India, this is part of Awami League's concerted propaganda,"" he says.

But, many in Bangladesh remember the last BNP regime led by Khaleda Zia, from 2001 to 2006, when there were attacks against minorities in 2001 and subsequent anti-India activities.

Indian diplomats in Dhaka feel that BNP has lot to ""atone"" for what they did, when they were in power. But, Fakhrul is a pragmatic leader. ""We have been reaching out to India, including our Chairperson Begum Zia's visit to Delhi in 2012. We thought with BJP in power in 2014, things will improve. She had a very good meeting with Modi, but nothing happened after that. There was no follow up.""

""We were disappointed. We tried to fix up a meeting with BJP's general secretary Ram Madhav in Bangkok in August this year, but the Indian side chickened out,"" he told The Indian Express.

The BNP-Jamaat-e-Islami alliance between 2001 and 2006 has been a baggage for him, and he is trying hard to shed that image. ""When we are questioned about Jamaat, I tell you, See BNP is not Jamaat. BNP doesn't believe in Islamic laws, it doesn't believe in fundamentalism. We have no fascination for Jamaat,"" he says, but he realises that he has to walk the talk when they come to power.

While Jamaat-e-Islami is de-registered as a political outfit by the Bangladesh election commission, 22 leaders -- who were with Jamaat -- are contesting the elections on BNP's ticket.

""The tie-up with Jamaat is a strategic tie up. With them, we have an advantage in 50 seats where the margin is thin and the fight is tough. Without us, they are reduced to just three seats,"" he says, with complete real politik in his mind. But, will they be part of a future government. ""No way"", he says. During the 2001-2006 regime, the Jamaat-e-Islami, as a party, had been extremely vitriolic towards India, which Delhi is mindful of.

""BJP is a right-wing political party, RSS is also there. But we don't have a problem engaging with them,"" he says, without bringing in equivalence. ""Unfortunately, I don't know why India ignores the misdeeds of the Awami League government which includes torture, disappearances etc. India is being blamed by the common people, there is a perception that India is helping Awami League. Awami League is a hated political party. But, just because of India, it has survived, it's India which has strengthened Awami League,"" he said. He goes on to say that Bangladesh's police and bureaucracy have ""good connections"" with the Indian High Commission.

Fakhrul says that his main agenda is the ""right to vote"" and ""live freely"", so that no one is picked up by the police. Hailing from a political family, he entered student politics, and was part of progressive, left leaning East Pakistan students' Union, which played a role in the liberation war.

After studying economics in college, he said that during the liberation war, he crossed over and went to India to mobilise people. After liberation, he joined the education service in government and taught economics in college. After 18 years of teaching, he quit and joined politics. ""It is impossible to imagine BNP without the Zia family,"" he says, swearing his allegiance, and attributes it to the family's ""belief in Bangladeshi nationalism"".

""She is a real charismatic leader,"" he gushes, as his colleagues nod. He says that one of the first things will be to get her out of jail, if the BNP comes to power. So, will there be same treatment meted out to the Hasina family. He says, ""There won't be a politics of vengeance.""

In his free time, the septuagenarian loves to watch movies, especially Bangla classics starring Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen. Filmmaker Satyajit Ray's movies are his favourites, and he picks ""Apur Sansar"" as his most favourite, as well as Ritwik Ghatak's Meghey Dhaka Tara. He also likes Govind Nihalani's movies, ""I loved Tamas."" He also lists

Gautam Ghosh and Nandita Das, as some of his favourites.

As he sits in office, with a painting of a paddy field behind him, the BNP's topmost leader in Bangladesh, says, "" I never aspire to be PM. I will do whatever my party's leaders asked me to do.""A roadside bomb hit a tourist bus on Friday in an area near the Giza Pyramids, killing two Vietnamese tourists and wounding 12 others, Egypt's Interior Ministry said in a statement.

It said the bus was traveling in the Marioutiyah area near the pyramids when the crude roadside bomb, concealed by a wall, went off. The wounded included 10 Vietnamese tourists. The other two wounded were the Egyptian bus driver and the guide. The bus was carrying a total of 14 Vietnamese tourists, it added, saying only two of them escaped unharmed. Egypt has battled Islamic militants for years in the Sinai Peninsula in an insurgency that has occasionally spilled over to the mainland, hitting minority Christians or tourists. However, this is the first attack to target foreign tourists in almost two years.

The attack takes place as Egypt's vital tourism industry is showing signs of recovery after years in the doldrums because of the political turmoil and violence that followed a 2011 uprising that toppled former leader Hosni Mubarak. It will likely prompt authorities to further tighten security around churches and associated facilities ahead of the New year's Eve celebrations and next month's Christmas celebrations of the Coptic Orthodox Church, the dominant denomination among Egypt's estimated 10 million Christians.

The free for all situation has been severely and detrimentally affecting student community. ""The government should come out with a legislation for the setting up and functioning of tuition and coaching centres for children. It should be ensured that such institutions are child-friendly,"" the commission said.

The commission said its recommendations were based on a slew of complaints it received against the incidents of fleecing and gross violation of child rights at coaching and tuition centres. Though there were laws and rules for ensuring protection of child rights in schools, the absence of the same for coaching and tuition centres was proving to be a matter of grave concern, the commission said. The commission recommended that the general education department should come out with a set of rules restricting the functioning of tuition and coaching centres.

However, general education secretary A Shajahan said the government has set up a mechanism for school education and it doesn't recommend students or their parents to seek additional coaching or tuition outside the school. ""Private coaching and tuition centres thrive because parents think it is appropriate to engage their wards in such centres for additional coaching. In such case, the discretion purely lies with the students and their parents. The general education department doesn't endorse any such additional tuition or coaching.

These days, it is not unusual to see children, still sleepy, leave home before sunrise to sweat it out at tuition centres before racing off to school. School hours are, in many instances, sandwiched between expensive, back-breaking coaching sessions after which the children limp home -- bleary-eyed and exhausted -- by 8 p.m. or 9 p.m., or even later.

Acting on a set of complaints, the Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights on Friday issued orders to the State government to frame a law for regulating tuition/coaching centres and to ensure that children's rights are protected. The commission asked the Secretary, General Education, and the Director of Public Instruction (DPI), to ensure that such institutions are allowed to operate only in a child-friendly atmosphere.

Commission member Sreela Menon N., in her order, noted that while rules and regulations protected the rights of children in the school environment, no such framework protected them in tuition centres that have mushroomed in every nook and cranny of the State.

The commission's order came on two petitions filed by Sebi Joseph of Ancheri, Thrissur, and a group of parents. The petitioners, urging the commission's intervention, alleged that gross violation of children's rights was occurring at such institutions. They also wanted the commission to slap a ban on summer coaching classes that also have become a common feature.

Although the commission issued notices on the matter to the Secretary, General Education, and the DPI, it received the reply that the Education Department was helpless.

The Kerala Education Rules did not contain any provision to regulate tuition/coaching centres. In fact, Friday's order has come at a time when even veterans in the coaching classes sector have started to complain about excesses. P.C. Thomas of Thrissur, a pioneer in the field, welcomed the order, saying it was high time steps were taken to protect children. According to him, tuition/coaching centres have transformed into a 'mafia' in recent years.

""This has become a big business where the children are at the receiving end. There is no doubt that the rights of the children have to be protected. The government should introduce regulations and form inspection teams,"" Mr. Thomas said.

If the slogan of 'Pakistan Murdabad' raised by the youngsters at the funeral of martyred soldier Rajesh Dakua at Ravindranagar on December 27 accounted for their hurt owing to the Pakistan engineered violence in their homeland long back, the loud chants of 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' summed up their patriotic feelings for the country which, the Bengalis always felt as their own.

""We have 184 serving armymen at present and 384 retired soldiers,"" he added to indicate the comparatively higher incidence of Army jobs and the passion of the Bengali youths for serving the nation.

At present there are nearly 3,000 families inhabiting these camps which, they now want to be called as villages.

The vision document released by the NITI Aayog recommending reforms in the higher education sector has come as a boost for the State government's efforts to operationalise the proposed State Assessment and Accreditation Centre (SAAC).

The 'Strategy for New India @ 75' document, which proposes measures to overcome hurdles in order to achieve full potential in various sectors, has called for adopting accreditation as a mandatory quality assurance framework for higher education and to have multiple accreditation agencies for facilitating the process.

Pointing out that the accreditation coverage in the country has been inadequate, despite recording a two-fold increase in accreditation levels during the last five years, the NITI Aayog has also recommended fast-tracking and enhancing transparency in the accreditation mechanism.

Notably, the recommendations were in consonance with the University Grants Commission (Recognition and Monitoring of Assessment and Accreditation Agencies) Regulations, 2018, issued a few months ago.

The main objective of the regulation was to permit the formation of assessment and accrediting agencies government or semi-government agencies, apart from the existing accreditation institutions, viz., National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) and the National Board of Accreditation (NBA).

It is estimated that around 60% of students in the higher education sector in India were enrolled in private institutions which were mostly unaccredited.

Besides, only less than 20% of the around 40,000 higher education institutions in the country were currently accredited.

In Kerala, only 210 institutions out of the 1000-odd higher education institutions were accredited. A majority of the unaccredited institutions were in the unaided sector, according to Kerala State Higher Education Council member secretary Rajan Varughese.

Besides, NAAC grading has become a determinant for not only Central funding under the Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA), but has also become a necessity for the State's share of 40%.

Dr. Vaughese pointed out that the SAAC will function as a centre within the KSHEC in accordance with the provisions of the KSHEC Act, 2007. Its objective included enhancing the preparedness of the higher education institutions in the State to seek national-level accreditation.

SAAC is being designed in a manner that takes into account a State-specific criteria of evaluation.

""The national-level assessment and accreditation mechanism has never fully appreciated Kerala's equity-based distribution of scarce resources in the social sector. Therefore, efforts were under way to incorporate factors including social inclusiveness of institutions, rural-urban disparities, institutions in backward regions, and the instance of fledgling institutions,"" Dr. Varughese added."

Deputy Chief Minister G. Parameshwara has had to part with the portfolio and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has succeeded in having it assigned to his loyalist Mr. Patil, who was Water Resources Minister in his government.

Even during the process of Cabinet expansion, Mr. Siddaramaiah is said to have had a big say, with many of his loyalists from north Karnataka making their way into the Cabinet. Seven of the eight new Ministers are from that region.

However, speaking in Hubballi, Mr. Siddaramaiah said he had nothing to do with Dr. Parameshwara losing the Home portfolio.

Out of the 22 Congress Ministers, only Dr. Parameshwara and D.K. Shivakumar hold more than one major portfolio. While the former is holding four, Mr. Shivakumar is holding two.

It is learnt that Dr. Parameshwara was unwilling to give up Home Department and did so only after some ""gentle advice"" from Congress president Rahul Gandhi.

Kunhalikutty, MP, has evoked a barrage of criticism from various Muslim leaders and groups for staying away from Parliament during the voting on the triple talaq Bill on Thursday.

Mr. Kunhalikutty did not attend Lok Sabha when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and supporting parties pushed forward the crucial Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2018. When his colleague E.T. Mohammed Basheer, MP, voted against the Bill along with 10 other members, Mr. Kunhalikutty was attending a friend's wedding in the State.

Most scathing among the critics was Minister for Higher Education K.T. Jaleel, who said that all the perfume from Arabia would not be enough to cleanse the blemish on the IUML caused by Mr. Kunhalikutty's action.

""It's a mistake of gargantuan nature. He (Mr. Kunhalikutty) has caused a black chapter in the history of the IUML,"" he said.

Mr. Jaleel said the IUML should ask him to quit. ""He has no right to continue as an MP now. The Muslim Youth League, instead of taking out marches to my office and house, should march to his house seeking his resignation,"" he said.

Mr. Jaleel said that those not interested in attending Parliament, especially when their presence was essential, should not be given such a responsibility. ""The IUML should re-think its action of sending him to Parliament with broader and heavier responsibilities as a 'centre forward' of the party. The 'centre forward' has failed the party and the people miserably,"" he said.

The Sunni Yuvajana Sangham (SYS) said that it was irresponsible of Malappuram's MP to stay away from Lok Sabha when his presence was a must. ""He had stayed away during the vice presidential voting as well in the name of missing the flight. We can't believe that it was a mere coincidence. We suspect a mutual understanding between him and communal forces such as the BJP and RSS,"" said SYS leader Jamal Karulai.

The Indian National League (INL) too criticised Mr. Kunhalikutty for his action. ""He has failed the Muslim community and the trust reposed on him by the voters,"" said INL leader A.P. Abdul Wahab.

Meanwhile in Kozhikode, IUML leader M.K. Muneer justified the absence of Mr. Kunhalikutty saying the IUML was only a small party with two MPs in the Lok Sabha. The presence of Mr. Kunhalikutty would not have made any big difference since they were given little time to speak on the issue."

The first furnace of Rourkela Steel Plant began functioning in 1959 setting the foundation for building India's economic development. Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) today is a Maharatna company and the largest steel producer and also the highest iron ore miner in India. Steel is a deregulated sector and SAIL operates in open economy producing 21.4 Million Tonne Steel per annum and contributing 1.5 times of India's GDP and 6.8 times to employment generation.

A function was held in New Delhi today to commemorate the 60 year of steel production by SAIL. The function was addressed by Union Minister of Steel, Chaudhary Birender Singh, Minister of State for Steel, Vishnu Deo Sai, Secretary Steel, Binoy Kumar and Chairman SAIL, Anil Kumar Chaudhary. Top officials of Ministry of Railways and other Central Government departments were also present on this occasion.

Chaudhary Birender Singh said times are changing and SAIL must keep pace with the new and fast growing steel companies. He outlined four mantras for SAIL: Speed, Aggression, Innovation and Loyalty. The Minister said decisions, actions and projects need more speed and marketing. He said new areas and markets like North-East need to be explored and technology, thinking and working has to be innovative. The Minister further stated that all this will happen only if those associated with SAIL have loyalty and commitment towards the company and country.

The Minister exhorted SAIL to invest in Research and Development, technology development and production of high-grade, value-added steel as these are the priorities of the Government and SAIL has a crucial role to play in all these areas.

National Steel Policy 2017 has set ambitious target of 300 MT steel capacity by 2030-31 and SAIL with 1/6 of the proposed capacity is going to be a key contributor. However, all this must be done in a systematic and planned way. Each Plant and Unit has to adopt the culture of 'Safety First'. Stressing that the culture of safety has to be an integral part of our working, Chaudhary Birender Singh said the Ministry will observe one day of the year as Safety Day for the steel sector from 2019.

Minister of State for Steel, Vishnu Deo Sai expressed hope that with its continued hard work, SAIL will be able to fulfill the right expectations of the country in future too.

Secretary Steel, Binoy Kumar, said that SAIL has to always rethink its strategy and planning to remain a leader in the steel sector.

Steel produced by SAIL is used for railway tracks, defence grade steel for construction of Arjun battle tank and India's space programme of Chandrayaan and Mangalyaan also use SAIL steel. SAIL supplied around 35400 metric tonnes of steel for the construction of recently inaugurated India's longest bridge - Bogibeel Road-cum-Rail Bridge on the river Brahmaputra. This quantity is little more than 50% of the total quantity of steel supplied for the bridge.

SAIL supplied TMT rebars, plates and structural for this 4.94 KM long bridge, which has composite welded steel truss girders in its structures. Earlier, SAIL had supplied 90% steel for the construction of the Dhola-Sadiya bridge. SAIL's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities supports education sports and tribal population of 8 states."

The U.S. General Accountability Office (GAO) recently dismissed a protest by a state licensing agency (SLA) challenging the elimination of its proposal from the competitive range under a solicitation issued pursuant to the Randolph-Sheppard Act. In Georgia Business Enterprise Program-Vocational Rehabilitation Agency, GAO held that Randolph-Sheppard Act complaints about the evaluation of its price proposal that made no reference to the Randolph-Sheppard Act or implementing regulations were nevertheless subject to the U.S. Department of Education's (DOE) binding arbitration provisions and therefore could not appropriately be considered by GAO. Following this decision, contractors should be aware that GAO will not hear protests by SLAs seeking to benefit from the Randolph-Sheppard Act priority in food service procurements. SLAs can consider other procedures for raising and litigating their concerns, such as an agency-level protest and/or a DOE arbitration.

The Randolph-Sheppard Act is a federal law that mandates a federal priority for blind persons to operate ""vending facilities"" on federal government property. Vending facilities governed by Randolph-Sheppard Act regulations include cafeterias, cart service, snack bars and automatic vending machines. The Randolph-Sheppard Act directs the DOE to designate SLAs, which are state agencies responsible for recruiting, training and licensing blind individuals or persons with a vision impairment to manage vending facilities.

In practice, SLAs act as prime contractors and train and license blind individuals to act as managers of dining facilities. The blind vendor often works with a government contractor specializing in food services as a teaming partner. The government contractor assists the blind vendor in operations, provides expertise and helps with start-up costs.

The solicitation at issue in Georgia Business Enterprise Program stated that it would be conducted pursuant to the Randolph-Sheppard Act and that the procurement would be set aside for service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns. The solicitation was issued by the U.S. Army for food services at various dining facilities located on Fort Benning in Georgia. The designated SLA accordingly submitted a proposal in response to the solicitation.

As explained above, the Randolph-Sheppard Act mandates a federal priority for blind vendors to operate vending facilities on federal government property. However, the Army excluded the SLA's proposal from the competitive range because it ""was not one of the most highly rated proposals and does not have a realistic chance of receiving contract award."" Following its exclusion, the SLA timely filed a protest, arguing that its proposal was improperly excluded from the competitive range.

GAO declined to hear the case on the merits and dismissed the protest because it interpreted the Randolph-Sheppard Act and its implementing regulations as vesting authority with the Secretary of Education regarding SLA complaints concerning an agency's compliance with the act. Notably, the SLA did not reference the Randolph-Sheppard Act once in its protest and instead argued its proposal was improperly excluded from the competitive range. However, despite the noticeable absence of references to the Randolph-Sheppard Act in the protest itself, GAO still found that the SLA's protest implicated a potential violation of the act. Based on this interpretation, GAO concluded that it did not have bid protest jurisdiction to hear complaints subject to the Randolph-Sheppard Act's binding arbitration provisions -- despite the protester not referencing the Randolph-Sheppard Act once in its protest.

The obvious takeaway from the Georgia Business Enterprise Program decision is that it is likely futile for a SLA to file a protest with GAO related to evaluation of proposals under solicitations for which the SLA is seeking to invoke the Randolph-Sheppard priority. However, the Georgia Business Enterprise Program decision does not go so far as to say that contractors cannot utilize the GAO protest forum as a means filing a pre-award protest of improprieties in solicitations for food services unrelated to compliance with the Randolph-Sheppard Act.

Further, while GAO correctly notes that disappointed SLAs may initiate the binding arbitration process of the DOE, SLAs, their licensed vendors and support contractors should be aware that complaints filed to the Secretary of the DOE through this process are lengthy, take over a year or more, and do not result in an automatic stay. Another option available to disappointed SLAs is to raise concerns directly with the agency via an agency-level protest. While no guarantee exists the agency will respond to an agency protest, agencies have the flexibility to consider such concerns and take voluntary corrective action under the FAR 33.103 agency-level protest process as a matter of business discretion, notwithstanding the Randolph-Sheppard arbitration process. Filing an agency-level protest offers a much more expedited process than the DOE arbitration process.

It seems that former chief minister Siddaramaiah succeeded in his effort to give important portfolios to his loyalists.

Deputy chief minister G Parameshwara has had to part with the much coveted Home portfolio and it has gone to Siddaramaiah loyalist MB Patil. According to sources, Parameshwara was very reluctant to give up the Home department and only did so after a nudge from Congress chief Rahul Gandhi.

In return, he will continue being in charge of the cash rich Bengaluru development authority and will add IT-BT and law and parliamentary affairs to his kitty.

The list of portfolios was cleared by Gandhi and sent to Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy by KC Venugopal, AICC general secretary and Karnataka-in charge. Eight Congress ministers were inducted into the Kumaraswamy cabinet last week.

Venugopal, who was in Bengaluru this week to discuss and finalise portfolios, is said to have faced resistance from G Parameshwara for being asked to part with Home and siding with Siddaramaiah.

The deputy CM had reportedly left the meeting midway and asked CLP leader Siddaramaiah and others to ""take a call"", after expressing reluctance to give up any of his portfolios. He contended he had worked to get the deputy CM's post and the portfolios to suit the stature.

Even during the cabinet expansion, Siddaramaiah is said to have had his way as several of his loyalists made their way into the cabinet this time.

Both Parameshwara and Siddaramaiah have denied any disagreement. ""I had no problem in letting go of the portfolios for the newly inducted cabinet ministers. This formula will apply to all senior ministers. I will abide by the decision of AICC president Rahul Gandhi,"" Parameshwara said.

Other senior ministers have also had to give up some ministries to accommodate the new members of the cabinet. Medical education, which was under DK Shivakumar, has been given to E Tukaram, and Shivakumar will take charge of Kannada and Culture from Jayamala. He will also add Information and Public Relations to his portfolio.

Satish Jarakiholi, a newly inducted minister, has been given forest, which was with independent MLA R Shankar before he was dropped from the cabinet last week. MLA Ramesh Jarakiholi's municipal administration portfolio is now with CS Shivalli, who was also inducted in the cabinet during the latest expansion."

Talks of a rift within the party had been doing the rounds post a meeting on Wednesday, 26 December, in which former chief minister S Siddaramaiah and current Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara were said to have engaged in a war of words, after the former allegedly asked the latter to give up his coveted Home Ministry portfolio. This led to the deputy CM walking out of the meeting midway, asking the other party leaders to take a call.

AICC general secretary took a day to get Congress President Rahul Gandhi's go-ahead for finalising the portfolios. He is said to have met Gandhi in New Delhi on Thursday, 27 December for final approval.

Parameshwara Loses Home Ministry

If there was a fight for the home ministry portfolio between Parameshwara and Siddaramaiah, it would appear that the latter had the last laugh. Parameshwara had to give up his portfolio in favour of newly inducted minister MB Patil.

According to sources, Parameshwara was reluctant to give up the coveted profile, as he claimed that he has worked a lot to be in the position he is today. However, apart from the important task of governing Bengaluru as the city's development minister, Parameshwara was also given additional charges of IT-BT, law and parliamentary affairs.

DK Shivakumar Loses 1, Gains 2 Portfolios

DK Shivakumar lost the Medical Education Ministry which was given to newly inducted minister E Tukaram.

DKS will instead take over Kannada and Culture which was earlier being handled by Jayamala. She will now handle Women and Child Development & Empowerment of Differently Abled and Senior Citizens.

DKS also took additional charge of the Information and Public Relations department.

Satish Jarkiholi Gets Charge of Forest Dept

The turmoil and uncertainty of his brother Ramesh Jarkiholi's membership in the party notwithstanding, this Jarkiholi brother will now handle Forests, Ecology and Environment. This was being previously handled by MLA R Shankar, an independent MLA who was dropped last week.

Another new minister CS Shivalli will now take care of Ramesh Jarkiholi's municipal administration portfolio.

Ramesh Jarkiholi has been fueling rumours of defecting or quitting the party by expressing his disappointment at being dropped to mediapersons. This came after senior Congress MLA Lakshmi Hebbalkar spoke about her 'sorrow' at Ramesh Jarkiholi being dropped from the Cabinet.

What Did Other New Ministers Get?

RB Thimmapur (MLC from Bagalkot district ): Port and Inland Transport Dept; Sugar

CS Shivalli (Kundgol MLA): Municipal and Local Bodies (CMCs, TMCs and TPs)

PT Parameshwar Naik (Hoovina Hadagali MLA): Muzrai; Skill Development, Entrepreneurship and Livelihood

From darkness to light. Or so I thought when I heard about my shifting from the dark dungeons of coal mines, as coal secretary, to the bright lights of school education, as secretary for school education and literacy.

However, I discovered soon that in the coal sector, mining was underground and mafias operated above it, but in the minefield of school education, it was the other way round. All the education mafias existed underground, and they were all masked, masquerading as so-called noble giants. Having taken on some of the mafias of the coal sector and partly succeeded in bringing the sector to order, the task was now to handle these 'noble giants'. It was made more difficult as there was no public outrage against invisible scams in education as was in the case of coal.

Everything seemed to be apparently in order.

To make matters worse, I was the fifth person to hold the charge of secretary in the education department in just two and a half years. Most of my predecessors with impeccable credentials in the education sector did not continue or were not allowed to continue. The government apparently found in me to be the most 'educated' person (I had never worked in this sector except for a brief tenure of three months in 1997 in adult education in Uttar Pradesh) to handle this sector.

It would be an understatement to state that the education sector was in bad shape - both in terms of budgetary allocation and human resource management.

Also read: My friend told me the coal sector was like 'Gangs of Wasseypur': Former secy Anil Swarup

The budgetary allocation for school education was Rs 55,115 crores during 2014-15. This amount got reduced in subsequent years. For instance, the allocation for 2016-17 was Rs 43,554 crore.

On the human resource front too, the situation was alarming. The department had five secretaries between 2014 and 2016. A number of joint secretaries were also changed during this period. It was like musical chairs reminiscent of my days in UP where it was rumoured that the only industry flourishing was the transfer industry.

In the two biggest states of the country, the positioning of top management followed a peculiar pattern. Whereas in UP, there were two additional chief secretary-level officers manning school education and secondary education separately (creating huge coordination problems), in the state of Bihar, one officer looked after both the education and health departments. Consequently, the health of education continues to suffer.

In addition to this, the mafias were having a field day, eating into the system, like termites. Fortunately, like all mafias, those in the education sector too were not a majority, but played a dominant role in decision-making. They were extremely well connected and deeply entrenched. There were a host of mafias, but the prominent ones were operating in these areas:

There are around 16,000 B.Ed and D.El.Ed colleges in the country. A large number of these exist only in name. If you pay them well, you can get a degree without an effort. It was rumoured that if you pay them more, they could even arrange for a 'naukri' (a government job). Action was initiated by then chairman of National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) Santosh Mathews, an upright officer, by issuing notices to all the colleges to furnish the details of their existence on affidavits. The idea was to ensure that only those that actually existed got recognition and in case of wrong information they could be prosecuted. It worked initially, but the colleges realised that quite a few of them could be in trouble. Despite the support he got from most of the states, he was put under enormous pressure by the mafias who took the 'judicial' route to pin down the chairman. He had to quit.

In a few northern states of the country, a number of examination centres are given on 'theka' (contract) for copying. These centres are highly 'priced' as they facilitate mass copying or cheating during examinations. The current chief minister of UP, Yogi Adityanath, came down heavily on this mafia. This was last done by Kalyan Singh in 1991, but thereafter no chief minister could dare to do that. Consequent to the steps taken in UP in this year's exams, more than one million students chose not to give exams. It is a reflection of the 'addiction' to mass copying.

The publishing industry thrives on the education sector. People with vested interests want to maintain status quo as this benefits them. It happens at two levels. As respective state governments provide free books to students, there are various ways in which money is made. The 'mandatory cuts' in getting the books printed centrally constitutes a substantial portion. The initiative taken by the UP government in 2018 and the consequent savings thereunder lends credence to this allegation. The Bihar government is toying with the idea of direct benefit transfers recognising the 'dealings' inherent in central printing and distribution.

The other level of money making is done by a handful of private publishers who enter into an 'arrangement' with the private schools in the name of quality, and compel the students to buy almost four to five times more expensive books as compared to the NCERT ones. If all the students of around 20,000 CBSE-affiliated schools were to source NCERT books, there would be an estimated annual expenditure of around Rs 650 crores. Compared to this, if they source books from private publishers, it would cost around Rs 3,000 crores per annum. The difference is too great to justify the quality argument.

The NCERT did a wonderful job in the current academic year to ensure that books were available on time so that the students were not compelled to buy expensive books, but this effort will need to continue. The NCERT will always be under pressure from people with vested interests to be 'inefficient'.

Most of the private schools in India contribute enormously to imparting quality education. However, some of them are bringing a bad name to this segment. There are some extremely powerful individuals who are able to get away with the most immoral things in education. They violate various norms, legal and ethical, with impunity because having been part of the official machinery at some point in time they know the tricks of the trade.

Irrational hiking of fee, charging huge sums of money to 'lend' their brand, harassing the brand assignees are some of the many tricks they practice. The chairperson of the CBSE Rajesh Chatur who chose to take them on was shown the door in 2017. His successor, Anita Karwal, one of the finest civil servants, was also set to be 'sacrificed'. But she held her ground despite pressure.

The good news in all of this is yet again from UP where the state has enacted a law on the fee regulation after consulting all the stakeholders. Hence, the legislation has been welcomed by all. Hopefully, other states will follow suit.

""Parameshwara can now concentrate on Bengaluru and the IT-BT sectors. But he will lose the pan-Karnataka image that came with responsibilities of home,"" a source said.

KPCC president Dinesh Gundu Rao downplayed the issue. ""No party other than Congress can make a Dalit a CM or deputy CM. Parameshwara has become deputy CM because he is in Congress.""

Experts TNM spoke to say that the child is likely to be born without the infection, but the doctors will have to take extreme care and several precautions to ensure that happens.

""The transmission of HIV from a positive mother to an unborn child depends on the 'viral load',"" explains Dr Amrose Pradeep, Chief Medical Officer (CMO) at YR Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education (YRGCare Hospital) in Chennai. ""The highest risk of transmission occurs early on in the acute phase of exposure, because that is when there is a high viral load present.""

Viral load is a unit of measurement used by medical professionals to determine the number of viral matter (in this case the concentration of the HIV virus) in an individual's bloodstream. During the initial period following exposure to the virus - which it is now for the mother, a person is said to have a high viral load. Thus, it would seem that the chance of transmission of the virus to the baby much larger. However, the presence of a healthy placenta shields the child against the virus.

""The virus cannot cross a normal, healthy placenta, and as a result the child will not be affected by the virus at this point,"" he says, but warns, ""A loss of structural integrity of the placenta can result in the virus being transmitted to the baby.""

Placental complications are common during the third trimester of pregnancy. It is at this juncture, if a mother is known to be HIV positive, that extra caution must be taken to ensure that the child is safe. The mother must be started on antiretroviral (ART) medications which will help decrease the viral load and will prevent the onset of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS).

""As far as I know, the mother has been started on the ART therapy and that is the first step. This will ensure that there is less chance of it being passed on to the child at the time of birth,"" adds Dr Pradeep.

The second instance when the infection can be passed on from the mother to the child is during delivery. Since the child passes through the birth canal and is exposed to the mother's blood and secretions, all of which contain the virus, there is a very high chance the child will be infected. To avoid this, doctors recommend that a C-section delivery is done, to reduce contact with the same fluids.

""After delivery, the child has to be given preventive care as well. For 6 weeks, that is 42 days, a combination of medications must be given,"" said the doctor.

Speaking to media on Wednesday, Dr Radhakrishnan, Tamil Nadu Health Secretary, said that the mother and child would be given the necessary treatment and care to ensure that they are healthy. He added that the child would be started on prophylactic (preventive) medicines once born. ""Nevirapine syrup will be given for about 6 to 12 weeks along with other medications to ensure that the child is not affected,"" he said. Doctors at YRGCare, recommend that nevirapine be given along with another ART medication known as zidovidine.

The case pertains to a 23-year-old pregnant woman who was given a blood transfusion at a government hospital in Sattur of Tamil Nadu's Virudhunagar district. In an effort to improve her anaemic state, doctors recommended that she be transfused with a unit of blood. Days later, it came to light that the blood which she had been transfused with was HIV positive, and in an extreme lapse of processes and possible criminal negligence, it had not been detected by technicians responsible for screening of the blood. The three technicians responsible for the negligence have since been terminated.

Officials from the health department have stated that the cost for treatment would be borne entirely by the government. The mother is currently undergoing treatment and is being monitored by a team of doctors at Madurai's Rajaji Government Hospital."

Having now been a Secretary to the Government of India in the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation for two years and 10 months, I thought that this may be an opportune time to reflect upon the nature of the job and how the role of the secretary has evolved over the decades. Traditionally, having reached the pinnacle of his or her civil service career, secretaries to the Government of India broadly played the following main roles: Administrative head of the ministry, policy adviser to the minister, engaging with the Cabinet Secretariat and the Prime Minister's Office and representing the ministry before parliamentary committees. In today's fast-paced era, however, it is clear that the secretary's role has evolved well beyond the conventional and has become increasingly complex and multi-dimensional. In my view, these four new dimensions could be categorised into two Ts and two Cs: Travel and Technology, and Converge and Communicate.

Increasingly, the traditional distinction between policy advice and being accountable for its execution is getting blurred. When I joined as secretary in the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation on March 1, 2016, the major goal of the ministry had already been determined by the government through the prime minister's announcement of an open defecation-free country by October 2, 2019. The initial feedback I got from my ministry, however, was that sanitation being a ""state"" subject, our role as a central ministry should be limited to setting the policy framework and providing financial and technical assistance to states.

I remember being somewhat taken aback by the above argument and responding to my Delhi colleagues: ""Sure, sanitation is a state subject under the Constitution of India, but the central government also has a job to do."" Clearly, and at a very minimum, we needed to actively engage with the states and nudge them towards the goal of an open defecation-free India. We thus took on the ambitious task of proactively engaging with the states and districts to put sanitation higher up on their priority list and implement the Swachh Bharat Mission in campaign mode. This took a lot of travelling to the states, districts and villages by our central team and I have personally made over 130 visits to the field, covering all states in the country. There is no doubt in my mind that it has become critical for the secretary to travel frequently to states to be effective.

Another change in the job description of the secretary is the need to keep pace with the increasing role of technology. The use of video-conferencing for review and monitoring purposes has become de rigueur for secretaries. In the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, we also started ""virtual classrooms"" by using master-trainers from a studio in Delhi to virtually train district and field functionaries for triggering behaviour change in rural communities, where open defecation was practised. We also developed the Swachh App, a very handy tool to monitor on a daily basis the sanitation coverage in every village, district and state. The implementation of e-office in the Government of India also means that we no longer need to have cumbersome paper files. With mobile phones and laptops keeping us in touch with our office and colleagues across the country, there is no escape from work for a secretary even if he or she is travelling or on leave.

Advertising

With the major thrust of the government on delivering social sector programmes to improve the lives of poor people, it has also become crucial for secretaries to converge across silos (read ministries) for better delivery of flagship programmes. For example, effective implementation of the Swachh Bharat Mission meant that I had to continuously work with my counterparts from the ministries of school education, health, women and child development and rural development. In the days of yore, it was more common for secretaries to typically focus on their own ministries, neglecting convergence with the related programmes of other sectors. The government's formation of the Group of Secretaries has also provided a very effective institutional mechanism for joint work between secretaries to focus upon and come up with solutions to problems outside an individual secretary's purview.

Yet another important change I have seen in the role of a secretary is the increasing significance of the need to communicate to the outside world, especially the media, with respect to the policies and programmes of the ministry. The traditional role of a secretary, and, in fact, of all civil servants, was to remain faceless and anonymous. But in this era of the 24-hour news cycle on television and the advent of social media, it has become important to articulate the priorities and progress of national programmes. As the civil service head of a ministry, the secretary needs to play a proactive role here. Since the training and inclination of most civil servants is to remain anonymous, specialised communication training for secretaries would be useful.

Finally, from a ""veteran"" secretary to the Government of India, some unsolicited advice for freshman secretaries: Don't worry if you are in a ""bad"" ministry! Some jobs are perceived to be more equal than others, but the role of a secretary remains important across ministries, even if it has changed a little. Don't treat it as a gentle ending to a glorious career and get ready to fasten your seatbelts. This final stint is likely to be the most exciting yet demanding job of your career."

As per the Second Delta Ranking released by the NITI Aayog today, Kupwara has made a quantum jump from 108th slot in the first delta ranking released in June 2018 to 7th slot in the latest ranking achieving noticeable improvement on various parameters between June 2018 and October 2018.

The ranking is based on the incremental progress made by the Aspirational Districts between June 1, 2018 and October 31, 2018, across six developmental indicators of Health and Nutrition, Education, Agriculture and Water Resources, Financial Inclusion, Skill Development and Basic Infrastructure.

""We have constantly endeavored to ensure transparent, real-time measurement of qualitative development in Aspirational Districts through the use of third-party validated data. This will strengthen the spirit of competitive and cooperative federalism on the foundations of evidence-based policy making,"" said Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog while releasing the Second Delta Ranking.

The districts which have shown great initiative and displayed a qualitative jump in their scores during this period, have been dubbed as 'Fast Movers' by NITI Aayog and Kupwara has achieved the distinction of joining the league.

Baramulla, another Aspirational District in North Kashmir, has also improved its ranking from 55 to 30 in the latest rankings released by NITI Aayog.

On the specific parameter of Financial Inclusion, Kupwara and Baramulla have bagged the 1st and 2nd rankings respectively across the country and in Skill Development Baramulla has walked away with 5th rank among 111 aspirational districts.

According to NITI Aayog, the rankings for the first time factored in validated data from Household Surveys conducted by NITI Aayog's knowledge partners, TATA Trust and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The surveys were carried out in all Aspirational Districts during the month of June 2018 covering more than 1,00,000 households. These surveys were used to validate critical data-points and provide inputs for nine further data-points for which district-level data is not readily available at regular intervals.

The delta ranking of the Aspirational Districts combines the innovative use of data science with pragmatic administration, keeping the district at the locus of inclusive development. ""This positioning is expected to aid the District Development Commissioners to focus more on these sectors and improve their ranking in future,"" Kant said.

'Transformation of Aspirational Districts' programme was launched by the Prime Minister in January this year, to quickly and effectively transform some of the most underdeveloped districts of the country.

The broad contours of the programme include Convergence (of Central & State Schemes), Collaboration (of Central, State level 'Prabhari' Officers & District Collectors), and Competition among districts driven by a Mass Movement or a Jan Andolan. With States as the main drivers, the program focusses on the strength of each district, identify low-hanging fruits for immediate improvement, measure progress, and rank districts.

After several rounds of consultations with various stakeholders, 49 key performance indicators have been chosen to measure progress of the districts. Districts are prodded and encouraged to first catch-up with the best district within their state, and subsequently aspire to become one of the best in the country, by competing with, and learning from others in the spirit of competitive & cooperative federalism.

Meanwhile, Governor Satya Pal Malik has complimented the District Administration Kupwara for achieving major stride in Aspirational Districts Ranking by moving from 108th to 7th position in last 5 months.

The Governor has expressed the hope that other districts will also take a cue from Kupwara to push the developmental and welfare indicators in their respective districts.

He also complimented the district Administration Baramulla for moving up several notches on Aspirational Districts ranking and standing at the top in the specific indicator of Financial Inclusion.

Meanwhile, Chief Secretary, BVR Subrahmanyam has also felicitated the District Administrations of Kupwara and Baramulla for their remarkable show in All India Aspirational Districts Ranking.

The Chief Secretary said the Governor's Administration has initiated a slew of measures on developmental, welfare and governance fronts to bring a perceptible change on the ground and the District Administrations across the State are playing a key role in implementing these initiatives effectively for the larger good of the people."

""Until recently, NET was mandatory only to become a teaching faculty in colleges and universities and it was to ensure that only qualified staff enter the higher educational institutions. This is the first time, UGC has mandated NET to avail scholarship, meant for minorities,"" said a 27-year-old research scholar from the city.

Candidates belonging to minority communities, including Muslim, Christian, Sikh and Buddhist, who have enrolled for full time MPhill or PhD programmes in Indian Universities, institutions and colleges with UGC NET or CIST NET could apply for the fellowship, said the UGC notification which was released recently. The last date to apply for fellowship is December 31.

The notification comes days after students criticized its initial notification which stated that only those students who had cleared NET held in December 2017 and June 2018 were eligible to apply for fellowship.

Most of the times, students especially women, come forward to do doctoral programmes mainly because of the fellowships as it would make them financially independent, the scholar said, adding that the move is going to be a big blow to students.

The students who are from economically poor background and are completely dependent on fellowships to pursue further, could no longer opt for doctoral programmes as nobody would be willing to spend a year to crack NET, she said.

Just like NEET coaching classes, NET coaching classes might also come up in the cities, he added. ""It is definitely going to be a setback for the students from marginalized section. It is not the appropriate time to mandate NET as the ministry of human resource and development (MHRD) had made PhD compulsory for the teaching faculties from 2021,"" former general secretary of the Association of University Teachers (AUT) C Pichandy said.

If the commission wants to ensure that only qualified people complete PhD, then they should standardize PhD programmes, he added.

""It is not just with MANF, the central government has mandated NET even to avail Rajiv Gandhi National fellowship for scheduled caste. The move would exclude many students belonging to minority groups and dalits from getting the scholarships. It reflects the fundamental attitude of the BJP,"" national general secretary of Student Federation of India (SFI) Mayukh Biswas said.

It's very disturbing to know how the scholarship for minorities and dalits had been put under such special conditioning when their representation is in meagre numbers in higher education, he said, adding that the government should be creating more opportunities for the deprived communities."

For next two months, Government must hold these workshops for the elected corporators on regular basis. Institute of Management Public Administration and Rural Development (IMPARD), Directorate of Environment and Remote Sensing , State Forest Research Institute and Non Government Organsiations (NGOs) associated with waste management work and Information Education and Communication Programmes (IEC) must be involved by JMC in this regard.

Services of NGOs associated with Srinagar Municipal Corporation (SMC) can also be availed as they have a good expertise on waste management and IEC work from last one year. Unless corporators of JMC or even Srinagar Municipal Corporation (SMC) are well versed with scientific solid waste management, they won't be able to do justice with people of Jammu or Srinagar as both these cities continues to stink because of improper waste management.

The BJP government, he alleged, had ""blocked"" several big decisions of the previous Congress government and said his party would not emulate them.

""We won't block any good decision of the outgoing Raje government. The good work of the Vasundharaji's government, we will not block them in public interest.""

He said his government will take up all projects that can improve infrastructure and address problems of water, electricity, education, health and road. ""Our endeavour would be to provide growth in the state at a fast pace.""

The Rajasthan chief minister said the Congress government in the state has taken a big decision by waiving farm loans and it has been welcomed by all.

He alleged the state suffered due to ""mis-governance and misrule"" of the Raje government, which, he claimed did not deliver any development work despite getting a huge mandate.

Gehlot said the state Congress had already started preparations for the Lok Sabha elections and a meeting with PCC chief Sachin Pilot and AICC general secretary in-charge for the state Avinash Pande has already taken place.

He also expressed hope that a 'maha gathbandhan' (grand alliance) of opposition parties would soon be formed to take on and defeat the BJP, which he claimed was working to satisfy ""public perception"" and not doing any sincere and concrete work.

""Rahul Gandhi ji has said that we will exert pressure on the prime minister to waive farm loans as farmers were the most harassed, besides the youth of the country, whose aspirations were left unfulfilled.

""If this government comes again, then there is a threat to the country, the country's democracy and its Constitution. All opposition parties feel this and we are hopeful the 'maha gathbandhan' will be formed soon and will be successful,"" he said.

Gehlot said the Modi government will be remembered as a ""jumlon ki sarkar"" (a government of rhetoric) as it has only made promises and not fulfilled any, ""which the people have realised now"".

Prime Minister Modi has been claiming that farmers' income will be doubled by 2022, but his mandate is only till May 2019, Gehlot said. ""And it (the farmers' income) should have risen by at least three-fourths by now.""

Referring to Nitin Gadkari's recent remark that the BJP ""leadership"" should own up to ""defeat and failures"" also, days after his party lost polls in three states, Gehlot said, ""Maybe some more BJP leaders should speak their hearts out in the party's interest before the NDA government goes out of power,"" he said.

Bhopal: The newly-formed Congress government led by Kamal Nath in Madhya Pradesh is already grappling with dissent, as three party MLAs are up in arms over their exclusion from the state cabinet.

The three legislators are Sumawali MLA Adal Singh Kansana, Mandsaur MLA Hardeep Dang, and Manvar MLA Dr. Hiralal Alawa, who is the founder of the tribal outfit, Jai Adivasi Yuva Shakti (JAYS), and fought on a Congress ticket.

Alawa has openly accused the Congress of breaking its promises, and demanded a meeting with party president Rahul Gandhi.

Talking to a local news outlet, the MLA said Gandhi had promised him a role in the state government when he sought support from JAYS for the elections. Alawa also met Chief Minister Kamal Nath Thursday, and sources said that he sought the medical education portfolio.

His supporters have already begun protesting on the ground and on social media.

Kansana has blamed senior Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia and All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary Deepak Babariya for his losing out on a post in the cabinet.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday ordered filing of FIRs against the personal secretaries of three senior ministers following a sting operation conducted by a TV news channel purportedly showing the trio seeking bribes against favours, including transfers and contracts.

Taking cognisance of the news report based on the sting, Adityanath has ordered for immediate suspension of the three government staff and institution of a special investigation team (SIT) under additional director general of police (ADG) Lucknow zone, Rajeev Krishna, to probe the matter. Inspector general of police (IGP) of special task force (STF) and senior vigilance bureau department would also be part of the SIT.

The SIT would complete the probe and submit a report within 10 days to the government for further action after recording statements of all the concerned parties. Besides, the state secretariat administration would review similar cases as well so as to pre-empt such incidents in future.

The CM had on earlier occasions issued directives for ensuring transparency and fair play in government procedures. He has stressed zero tolerance by the government towards corruption cases and that prompt action would be taken if there is any complaint from any quarters. However, the sting operation has nonetheless caused massive embarrassment to the government.

The sting showed the personal secretaries of UP backward welfare minister Om Prakash Rajbhar, mnister of state for mining Archana Pandey and minister of state for basic education Sandeep Singh seeking monetary favours for facilitating contracts or transfers.

According to sources, the government would take sternest action in these matter if the accused are found guilty of graft charges so as to deter other government employees from indulging in corrupt practices, especially with the crucial 2019 Lok Sabha poll months away.

In the sting, the personal secretary of Rajbhar is shown allegedly seeking Rs 4 million for a transfer. Besides, there are recordings of the secretariat staff allegedly assuring the sting reporter, posing as a contractor, that a contract for school bag and uniform, would be manipulated by networking with the kin of other state minister. However, Rajbhar has washed his hands of the controversy saying he had nothing to do with the alleged deal and in fact asked his departmental head to probe the matter.

In another news report, the secretary of minister Archana Pandey is shown striking a deal with the sting reporter for getting mining contracts in several districts. Meanwhile, she has also recommended strict action against her staff if found guilty after the probe.

The personal secretary of Sandeep Singh, who is the grandson of Rajasthan governor Kalyan Singh, is purportedly shown tying to fix a deal pertaining to a hypothetical contract of supplying books and seeking his share."

The process of assigning portfolios, sources say, is being delayed, thanks to the tug-of-war between Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara and Congress Legislature Party leader Siddaramaiah.

K C Venugopal had to take the recommendation list back to New Delhi. With two senior state leaders not in agreement with each other, it is now left to party boss Rahul Gandhi to chart the next course of action.

Sources in the party say that

M B Patil -- one of the most senior leaders and newly inducted minister -- is refusing to settle for anything less than the Home Ministry.

""The question is whether seniors like Parameshwara, D K Shivakumar should part with portfolios they are currently holding. New portfolios can be created for the new ministers. Portfolios from other ministers who hold multiple departments like K J George and Krishna Byregowda could be taken,"" said a Congress source privy to the chaos that ensued in the meeting held at a luxury hotel on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, Parameshwara is said to have refused to part with Home or Bengaluru development departments. He is open to reassigning Youth Empowerment and Sports Department.""It is unfair on part of ministers holding more than one department to refuse to part with it. No ministers would like to hold an insignificant ministry,"" said a party source. ""The announcement will be made soon. We only need

to inform Rahul Gandhi of the decision,"" said K C Venugopal, AICC Karnataka in charge.

According to sources, the proposed allocations include municipal administration for C S Shivalli, housing for M T B Nagaraj, forest for Satish Jarkiholi, medical education for E Tukaram, skill development for R B Thimmapur and infrastructure development for Parameshwar Naik.

Nine Congress ministers currently hold more than one portfolio and seniors like Parameshwara and D K Shivakumar are supposedly unwilling to sacrifice either of their ministries and would like the party to take ministries from others or create new portfolios.""The CM has too many portfolios and those can be allocated too,"" suggested another Congress source."

Lokayukta stops flow of filth

On July 20, 2018, TNIE published three stories -- 'Bengaluru may reap toxic veggies, for froth it sows', 'We don't want another Bellandur' and 'Sheep are falling sick' -- on the impact of polluted water supplied to lakes in Chikkaballapur and Kolar districts from the KC Valley project. Based on these reports, Lokayukta Justice P Vishwanatha Shetty issued notices to the Secretary, Minor Irrigation Department, the Chairman, Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewerage Board, Chief Executive Officer, Lake Conservation and Development Authority, and commissioners of BBMP and BDA. The Lokayukta asked the respondents to submit their responses within four weeks, and take measures to remedy the situation.

Kere Kamegowda, man on a mission

On July 15, 2018, TNIE reported how an 82-year-old shepherd had singlehandedly developed 14 ponds in Daasanadoddi village in Malavalli taluk of Mandya district. Over a span of four decades, Kamegowda had turned an entire hillside in his village green. Witness to the barren land, scorching heat and sufferings of birds and animals alike, Kamegowda -- often referred to as a 'madman' -- dug ponds for two hours every day for 40 years. Recognising his service after it was reported in TNIE, the Karnataka government conferred on him the Rajyotsava Prashasti, the highest state award. Kamegowda declared that he would use the award to dig more ponds.

The new plant started functioning in the village, and villagers are happily drawing water from this facility now.

Martyrs' kin get their due

Lokayukta Justice P Vishwanatha Shetty asked officials concerned to take action after TNIE wrote about families of 13 martyrs awaiting benefits after the soldiers died on duty. The story, 'Families of martyrs from Karnataka wait endlessly for compensation,' published on July 19, narrated the plight of the martyrs' kin as the files were held up at the offices of the concerned Deputy Commissioners and Urban Development Authorities. Justice Shetty asked the government to dispose off the families' applications within 8 weeks. He also asked the Revenue department to submit the status report after securing the report from the deputy commissioners concerned and registered a suo motu complaint.

Gadkari takes note of smart suggestion on NH

Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari asked the National Highways Authority of India for a new Detailed Project Report after TNIE published a report about citizens' seeking a relook at the proposal to upgrade National Highway 766C. The February 15 report, 'Citizens suggest shortcut during highway upgrade,' featured people of Hosanagar and members of Kollur Mookambika temple suggesting a method to cut 19 km from the proposed highway by diverting the existing stretch between Hosanagar and Adogodi via Nagara and Sampekatte through Sutta and Bekkodi.

Rapist in dock; jawan, sister get justice

On May 23, TNIE wrote about the struggle of an Army jawan to get justice for his 20-year-old sister who was raped for one-and-a-half years by a rowdy. The jawan, hailing from Muddibehal, was posted in Assam, and discovered the alleged crime when he came home in 2017. He thrashed the accused and took him to the police, who refused to register a complaint. Taking notice of the TNIE report, titled 'Karnataka: Army jawan struggles to get justice for his sister who was raped,' the Indian Army wrote to the district police and administration, asking them to take action. Based on the letter, police registered a complaint and the case is in court.

No to amphitheatre, yes to college playground

A decision was taken to demolish an open-air theatre built by actress Bhavana Ramanna on a playground belonging to Government Arts College in Bengaluru after TNIE reported about it. The government is also mulling recovering the expenditure needed for the demolition work from the previous principal of the college who had allowed the work to begin. The Higher Education Minister was prompted to order an inquiry into the project following the TNIE report, 'Private open air theatre at government college sparks row', published on August 7. TNIE was the first to report a decision by the State government to allow the construction, which, the actress said, aimed to provide space for artistes to perform in the heart of the city.

Frothy lake grabs govt attention

After a story on the bad condition of Byramangala lake at Bidadi in Ramanagara district was published in TNIE on August 23, the Minor Irrigation Department ordered preparation of a Detailed Project Report for setting up a sewage treatment plant. The report, 'Bengaluru feeds its poison to Byramangala lake in Bidadi, gets back its taste,' highlighted how industrial and city waste was entering the lake through the Vrushabhavati river and polluting nearby villages, leading to health issues. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) also started sending officials to inspect industries in and around Bidadi to prevent them from letting untreated water into Byramangala Lake.

Water channel comes back to life, irrigates farms again

After a story on the unscientific road work taken up by the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj (RDPR) Department at Idu gram panchayat in Karkala taluk was published on December 22, RDPR engineers instructed the contractors concerned to dig the trench and make a channel to ensure resumption of water supply to fields. The story, 'Farms left parched as road project buries water channel,' highlighted how the 1.44km road, under 'Namma Grama Namma Rasthe' scheme, from Idu Palke to Batteni, had buried a traditional water channel that used to irrigate 70 acres of paddy fields. Ajith Kumar Jain, a farmer, told TNIE that farmers are happy now since the refurbishing of the channel began on December 24.

Reuniting a child with her foster mother

For seven years, Jayashree Guttedar had brought up an abandoned girl as her own, only to be told that she was raising the girl ""illegally"". The wailing baby that Jayashree had rescued from a bush near a private maternity hospital in Gubbi Colony in Kalaburagi years ago, was taken away by Women and Child Development department officials to an orphanage. Jayashree -- a mother of three who had accepted the girl as her own -- had to run from pillar to post, fighting to claim the child with proper documentation. Jayashree then reached out to district in-charge minister Priyank Kharge. On October 3, 2018, TNIE carried the story, highlighting the torment of the mother. Minister Kharge intervened, and the child was returned to Jayashree with coordination from the district commissioner."

A dancing team led by Zhao Yu, in China, has won multiple honours in art events nationwide, this year. But what makes this team or their teacher special? Well, all the students either suffer from visual, hearing impairment, or autism. Zhao Yu is a special educator, and as a a dance teacher at the Shijiazhuang Municipal Special Education School, she has to break down communication barriers with her students. Though her dancing team has won multiple honours in art events across the nation, it took a lot of effort and time to achieve cooperation.

Maral Yazarloo-Pattrick

Women in Iran are banned from motorbike riding because of their modesty laws. In a bid to change this attitude, Maral got onto her bike. She travelled solo across the world, and rode into her country triumphantly. She was not arrested. Now, she has the dubious honour of being the first Iranian woman to ride a bike.

In 2017, she set out from India, crossed seven continents and 64 countries in 17 months, concluding her trip in November, this year. In a BBC video, she said, ""The only message I want to send out is that if an Iranian woman, or any woman, thinks that she can't do something, she just needs to close her eyes and say 'I can, if I really want to'. And she definitely can.""

She is currently campaigning for Iranian women to get driving licenses and permission to ride motorbikes. She is also an advocate for creating awareness about rape and domestic violence on women."

The counsel for the applicants, Advocate Ranjeevan Singh contended that despite the fact that all the applicants were appointed on contractual basis in the department in 2002 in a transparent selection process against vacant sanctioned posts and are working since then without any break. Their services are not being regularised by the administration by way of framing a secure policy in light of Uma Devi's judgement rendered in 2006 which mandates all states/UTs are bound to consider the claim of regularisation of its contractual employees as one-time measure who are working since long without any break and that too on the posts which are of perennial nature.

The bench was apprised that till date the UT administration of Chandigarh has not framed any such policy despite repeated representations by the contractual teachers/employees who would become overage for any future employment with the passage of time."

The district inspector of school (DIOS) PK Upadhyay said two schools, Cambridge School in Sector 27 and Bal Bharti School in Sector 21, have agreed to return hiked fees. While Cambridge School management agreed to return hiked amount per semester (₹17,000), Bal Bharti School has decided to return ₹7,000 as hiked amount in one semester.

""We had served notices to the two schools regarding hiked fees in the past and they have now agreed to roll it back. Till now, we have got confirmation from two schools only. We are probing other schools which have also hiked fees,"" Upadhyay said.

The move comes after continued agitation by the All Noida Schools' Parents' Association (ANSPA) against ""arbitrary fee hike"" which is not in accordance with the Uttar Pradesh Self Finance Independent Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act. The ordinance was first brought into motion on April 9, 2018 and the Act was enforced in August this year.

According to K Arunachalam, general secretary of the ANSPA, they had sent a complaint to the DIOS regarding six private schools, namely Apeejay School, Somervillle School, Amity International School, Delhi Public School, Noida, Cambridge School and Bal Bharti School, for increasing fees in an alleged arbitrary manner.

""Although we have received information regarding two schools agreeing to roll back hiked fees, they have not done it yet. If schools really intend to adjust the hiked amount with the future fees, they have to do it in the next quarter. It has been four months since the Act has been enforced, however, no private school has followed it yet,"" Arunachalam said.

On November 3, the district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar had held a meet with principals of all private schools in the district and asked them to decided their fee structure as per the newly regulated Act and upload it on their school's website within a week's time.

Reacting to allegations of inaction by the district fee regulatory committee, Upadhyay said, ""We will decide in the next committee meeting on schools which do not follow the fees Act.""

However, Asha Prabhakar, principal of Bal Bharti School, denied claims made by the DIOS.

""We had already returned the hiked fees to parents in July this year. The ordinance came in April and we were told to roll back hiked fees. There was a rise of ₹7,000 in the first quarter and we returned the amount in the second quarter fees. The claims of DIOS that Bal Bharti School has agreed to roll back fees now only is untrue,"" Prabhakar said.

The management of the Cambridge School could not be contacted at the time of this report going to publication."

During his monthly Jan Samvad programme at Suchana Bhawan in Meurs' Road, Das took cognizance of a woman's complaint against Dumri CO Jagdish Kumar Pandey. Sunita Devi, the complainant, had accused Pandey of asking extra money for issuing correction slips.

Das asked state land reforms, registration and revenue secretary Kamal Kishore Soan to suspend the officer and order a probe to evaluate his ill-gotten assets. ""These are the officers who tarnish the image of the government. There assets must be seized and used to open schools and hospitals,"" Das said before ordering the department to transfer the CO and block development officers (BDO) every three years.

Ashish Kumar, a resident of Sahibganj, alleged that one Shibu Soren ST Intermediate cum Degree College was presenting forged documents to seek grants from the state department of higher, technical education and skill development department. To it, Das asked the department to investigate similar complaints from across Jharkhand and cancel their affiliations if found not compliant to the state government's directives. ""Institutions like these are out to spoil the future of the youth. These businesses must be stopped at once,"" Das said.

The CM spoke to farmers and residents of Thethaitangar block at Simdega district and encountered claims that 95 farmers had not received compensations for their crops, which were damaged due to excessive rain July 2015. The claims stood in contrast to the Das government's recent hectic parleys to the Union government to declare 129 blocks drought hit due to insufficient rains this year and seek grant of Rs 819 crore for carrying relief measures. Hearing this, Das ordered the deputy commissioner to camp in the area on December 30 and ensure their compensations are disbursed.

In what was the last Jan Samvad of 2019, Das praised police department for reigning left wing extremism and directed authorities to distribute blankets in the state run Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas so that its boarders can stay warm. The CM's instructions came at a time when cold related deaths are being reported from several districts but no relief measures being announced by the state disaster management department."

India's top intellectuals nominate the next generation. Here is their list of some of the brightest minds on the horizon.

Intellectuals are an essential component of an open society -- they bring their unique analytical insights to not only scrutinise the society in its immediate form but also help shape the ideas and ideologies of the future. They conduct research, deploy critical thinking, reason, teach, author books, challenge dogma and equip us with cognitive tools to engage with the world we inhabit -- just for the love of knowledge, or for the greater human good.

India has a rich and ancient tradition of producing such thinkers, teachers and philosophers who have contributed to the creation of new schools of thought that have travelled and established themselves far beyond Indian shores too. They have also passed on their learnings and discoveries to successive generations to preserve, innovate upon and further.

But who are the next generation of Indian intellectuals in the modern times we inhabit? The next Ramachandra Guha, the next Arvind Panagariya, the next Ashok Gulati, the next Raghuram Rajan, the next Makarand Paranjape, or the next Shashi Tharoor?

Over the last few months, ThePrint spoke to some of the biggest names in Indian intelligentsia and asked them who, in their opinion, are the brightest minds on the horizon -- in history, economics, sociology, political studies, law, strategic affairs, philosophy, public affairs, and inter-disciplinary studies, among others.

What follows is a long and impressive list of next-gen intellectuals who have begun to make a mark and given notice of their coming brilliance. Some of the nominees were directly mentored by the veterans who named them while the others are those whose work they track closely. This is by no means an exhaustive list and will be updated when more intellectuals respond to our requests.

Here's the list, in alphabetical order of the names of the nominators:

On his choices, Nandy said: ""All three have special relevance in the 150th year of Gandhi's birth.""

But he adds: Two warnings first. I am in my 80s now; I have seen four generations pass by. Those who look young to me do not look that young to others. Also, those in their 20s and 30s have not often got the chance to find themselves and to display their talent or promise. My own first book was published when I was in my 40s.""

Muralidharan, professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego, is a doctorate from Harvard University. His research focuses on health and education in developing countries.

Varshney said of him: ""His work is very technically economic, so in the larger public sphere, his presence is limited, unlike the economics profession, where he towers in his cohort. He has started writing a book for the larger audiences on India's economy. We might know more soon.""

Teachers had created more than 400 WhatsApp groups to mobilise support, said S Nirmala, a protester from Madurai.

Named Board of Higher Secondary Education (BHSE), it is estimated to having provided marksheets and certificates of classes X and XII to over 55,000 students for a hefty price.

Three people, including the ""chairman"" Altaf Raja, have been arrested. The two others, Shambhu Nath and Manoj Kumar, are school owners.

Additional commissioner (crime) Rajiv Ranjan said that the gang charged between Rs 10,000 and Rs 30,000 for the certificates. This syndicate was also involved in providing documents of higher studies from renowned institutes across India. ""A team led by DCP Rajesh Deo and ACP Jasbir Singh tracked down Raja after a complaint from Directorate of Education, Delhi government,"" he added.

A decoy customer was sent to Raja's office with a request for a marksheet and he was caught while delivering it. Raja used to collect the details of students over WhatsApp and receive the amount for providing fake documents through NEFT. The certificate would then be mailed to the student's address. During the raid at the Vikaspuri apartment, several fake marksheets and certificates were seized from him.

During interrogation, Raja told police that he left studies and started working in the office of one Dr Shiv Prasad Pandey in Lucknow. He came to know that Pandey posed as the chairman of Board of Higher Secondary Education, Delhi and ran a branch office in Lucknow. After Pandey's arrest last year, Raja decided to take over the board and started issuing certificates in his own name.

Police have also identified one Ashok Kumar Lakhani as the secretary of the board. He owns a school in the same building from which the board was being run.

Recently, Raja had issued a certificate to a woman who has enrolled with UP Police. UP Police has been informed about it to take legal action against her.

Surprisingly, the racket wasn't unknown to police. Last year, when Pandey was arrested, a probe revealed that the fake board's original owner Mange Ram Acharya was arrested in 2011 from Timarpur. He is currently in a jail in Rajasthan.

The board's operation continued even after the arrest of Pandey who was using the same website and the same name. The website was blocked for a few days, but the crooks somehow managed to reactivate it and continue with their scam."

After BJP's loss in the recent state assembly elections, Kishor Tiwari, chairman of the Vasantrao Naik Sheti Swavlamban Mission, a task force appointed by the state government to address farmers' distress, submitted a ten-point agenda to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis to address rural distress before the 2019 general elections.

Tiwari sought Rs 5,000 per person under the pension scheme for farmers, interest-free education loans for their children, and financial aid for the marriage of their daughters.

Tiwari said that the BJP led government had failed to resolve farmer issues. He said that farm loan waiver, watershed management project, crop insurance, etc failed to pacify rural unrest.

""We need to have a concrete plan that can give relief to farmers community,"" said Tiwari in his letter to the Chief Minister.

He said that the loss of the BJP in the five states could be attributed to the agrarian crisis, as the party had neglected their needs, and also failed to protect the interests of minorities.

He said that CM Fadnavis should appoint an agricultural minister and secretary who are experts in the field and genuinely interested in resolving farmers' issues.

""Like Telangana, the financial aid of Rs 5,000 per acre should be offered to farmers of non-irrigated land across Maharashtra. Most of the farmers are in a dire financial state.

This marks Trump's first-ever visit to a war zone. As President, he had not previously visited a combat zone for Christmas - a traditional presidential activity during the holidays.

""He's afraid of those situations,"" a former senior White House official recently told the Washington Post. ""He's afraid people want to kill him.""

The visit occurred on the same day that a New York Times report raised new questions about the bone-spur diagnosis that helped Trump avoid fighting in the Vietnam War.

Trump, who graduated from the New York Military Academy boarding school, received four Vietnam War draft deferments for education during college. Then after he finished school, he received a medical exemption for bone spurs, which kept him from being eligible for the draft.

""I had a minor medical deferment for feet, for a bone spur of the foot, which was minor,"" Trump told ABC News in 2015 during his presidential campaign. ""I was fortunate, in a sense, because I was not a believer in the Vietnam War.""

""I know it was a favor,"" Elysa Braunstein, the daughter of deceased podiatrist Larry Braunstein, told the Times. She said she wasn't sure whether Trump had bone spurs at all.

""If there was anything wrong in the building, my dad would call and Trump would take care of it immediately. That was the small favor that he got,"" Braunstein said.

Bone spurs form in joints, often in places where two bones meet, as a result of joint damage. Heel spurs, similarly, are ""little calcifications that start to form at the bottom of the heel bone,"" podiatric surgeon Jacqueline Sutera previously explained to Business Insider.

The bony projections are similar to plantar fasciitis and can be especially painful first thing in the morning, when a person's feet hit the ground.

""When you're resting, the soft tissue just relaxes and there's a swelling there,"" Sutera said. ""Then you go to stand up on it with all of your body weight, and it starts that inflammation all over again.""

In general, though, bone spurs are not a debilitating condition.

Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil) are both common pain-relievers to help with the swelling from bone spurs. Some people experience no pain from spurs at all, and may never even know they have them. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons estimates that one in 10 people have foot spurs, but only about 5% of those people ever experience foot pain.

Those that do have painful spurs may opt to treat them with stretches, cortisone treatments, physical therapy, orthotics, or surgery."

JAMMU, Dec 26: Strongly advocating for construction of Ram Mandir at Ayodhya, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Sarkarivah (national general secretary), Bhaiya Ji Joshi today said that Lord Ram is the matter of faith for millions of Hindus across the globe.

Addressing a religious function at famous shrine of Purmandal in Samba district today, the RSS senior leader said that Ram Mandir should be constructed at Ayodhya in UP because Lord Ram was born there and it is matter of Hindu faith as aspirations of crores of Hindus are linked to it.

The function was organised by Purmandal Sewa Niyas and a large number of people attended it.

He said as the faith of people is linked to religious shrine of Purmandal and Utterbehni likewise the faith of crores of Hindus is also linked to Ram temple where Lord Rama was born and they want that the temple should be constructed there.

Joshi said that India is a land of sages and saints, who worshiped at these religious places to attain spirituality and it is our duty to preserve these shrines for posterity. He said there are no contradictions in the Hindu Samaj on the construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya and it will be constructed there.

Maintaining that entire Hindu Samaj is one, he said this feeling keeps country and its people secure. Till Hindus are united no power on earth can harm the country and them, he added Stressing on protection of environment, he said since the Vedic and Puranic periods, Hindus have been worshiping rivers, streams, springs, trees, forests and there is great philosophy linked to it. The essence of protecting them was must for human survival and prosperity on the globe, he added.

The RSS national leader also stressed on respecting women folk saying that ""as per Hindu tradition we have been worshiping five mothers including mother Earth, Ganga Mata, Gow Mata (Cow), universe as a whole and women"". He asked the gathering present to take a solemn pledge to respect them henceforth as per Hindu tradition and culture.

Maintaining that a woman has highest place in Hindu philosophy, he said ""if we respect her as mother the atrocities on women folk will automatically vanish"". He said respecting these five mothers also will automatically rid the society from crime.

On the issue of cow slaughter and concern shown by the people over it, he said ""going by the Puranic relevance of the cow, Hindus have been worshiping her from times immemorial and if we will not sell her no body will slaughter her. We should not sell cow to save them from slaughter"", he added.

He, while referring to Purmandal religious shrine, said it has a lot of religious significance as lakhs of pilgrims visit this shrine whose faith is linked to it and on every Amawasiya of the month, thousands pay obeisance at this shrine.

On the occasion, Joshi also released a book on Purmandal, Utterbeni shrines. The people of the area on the occasion honoured the RSS leader.

The RSS Prant Pracharak J&K, Rupesh, Prant Sangh Chalak Brig (retd) Suchet Singh, Prant Karivah, Avtar Krishan and other office bearers of Sangh were present.

Earlier in the morning, RSS leader held a meeting with the representatives from Ladakh and Kashmir and discussed various issues concerning the State and their regions with them.

The delegation from Ladakh informed the Sangh leader about the problems being faced by the people in the Himalayan region especially with the intrusion from China's side.

They said that nomads living near LAC faced threat from the people and army across the LAC.

They said that with the help and support of Chinese Army, the people across the LAC intrude into Indian territory and push the nomads residing there back. Most of them have left the forward areas and migrated to Leh for eking out their living there.

This is dangerous trend and needs to be contained immediately. Otherwise entire border belt of Ladakh will be emptied and the nation would have to pay a heavy price for the same, they added.

They demanded that the people near LAC be provided all facilities like construction of roads, communication facilities, education and health care facilities, setting up of a Pashmina Processing Plant etc to boost their economy.

They also demanded that on the pattern of Sindhu Darshan a yatra to Chota Kailash in Ladakh be also started which is revered by both Hindus and Buddhists. This will help in income generation to local people also, they added.

The representatives of Ladakh also put up the demand for granting of UT status to the region for its development and progress. They said though the region has 49400 square Km area its population is only four lakh and under the present status of the State people from outside J&K can't settle there despite the fact that vast area of land is lying vacant in the region. For the settlement of the people from other states, UT status is must for Ladakh besides it will also pave way for proper development of the region, they added.

The representatives from the region while expressing concern over threat to demography of Ladakh with the settlement of outsiders there said that this issue should be dealt on war footing basis to maintain the age old culture of the region.

They also demanded construction of hostel for students of Ladakh at Jammu and Chandigarh so that the students from the region studying there don't face problems.

The delegation included CEC, LAHDC, Leh Jamyang Cherign Namgyal, MLC and former Minister, Cherign Dorjey, Vijay Chhelingpa, RSS Karivah Ladakh and Bhagwan Ji, another Karivah for Ladakh Vibagh.

The RSS leader took note of the all issues and concerns shown by people from the region.

A delegation of Kashmir also called on him and discussed prevailing situation in the Valley with reference to Hindu Shrines and religious places and stressed on their protection.

The issue of opening Sharda shrine for pilgrimage, problems faced by package employees in Valley and constant delay in implementation of employment package also figured in the meeting with RSS leader. Avtar Krishan Karivah, Ajay Bharti MLC and other Sangh activists from Kashmir attended the meeting.

Before leaving for New Delhi in the evening, the RSS leader held a meeting with prominent citizens of Jammu at Keshaw Bhawan Ambphalla and discussed various issues concerning the State with them also."

The arrested accused include Altaf Raja, the mastermind of the gang. He was earlier arrested in September 2017 for the similar offence, but started operating a fake education board in west Delhi's Vikaspuri again after coming out on bail. The board issued certificates for Class esX and XII.

The police said that the gang was operating the fake board under the name of Board of Higher Secondary Education, Delhi. The gang has cheated more than 10,000 students from UP, Bihar, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, and several other States. The fake board syndicate also provided documents of higher education from renowned institutes of different States in the country. Further investigation is under way.

Raja used to target students who were weak in academics and unlikely to pass the matriculation and intermediate examinations. He used to collect the details of the students through WhatsApp and promised them better results within two-three months. He asked them to transfer payments into his bank account.

Several fake mark sheets, certificates, provisional and migration certificates, answer sheets, question papers, register with the record of students, etc., have been seized.

On September 18, the police received a tip-off about the fake board issuing mark sheets and certificates for Class X and XII for ₹5,000 to 10,000. The police sent a decoy customer and nabbed Raja while he was delivering fake certificates.

During interrogation, Raja said that he along with Shiv Prasad Pandey and Ashok Kumar Lakhani used to dupe people. Started off in Lucknow, they have been running this racket since 2014, wherein Pandey posed as the chairman and Lakhani as the secretary of the board. They had also created around 25 odd websites, two of them being www.bhsedelhiboard.net and www.bhse.ac.in.

They were arrested in 2017. Pandey is still in jail, while the others were released later. After being released, they resumed operations.

Two other men, identified as Shambhu Nath and Manoj Kumar from UP's Deoria, have also been arrested for registering students in the aforementioned fake board. Both had opened a school and got it affiliated under the fake board.

Another man, identified as Rampal, who hails from UP's Rampur, was also arrested along with three others for producing fake certificates obtained from the fake board during the recruitment of UP Police in 2018."

The strike has been called by United Forum of Bank Unions consisting of all nine bank unions to protest against the Government's recent decision to merge Bank of Baroda, Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank into one single bank by closing down two banks.

The bank unions said post-merger of six banks with SBI in April, 2017, SBI has closed down 6,950 branches. The Bank of Baroda, Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank have together 9,000 branches. It is certain that thousands of branches will be closed after this proposed merger. India needs more branches and if ATMs and branches get closed, banking customers will find it difficult to carry out their banking transactions.

Owing to the strike, clearing operations are affected because branches are closed and cheques cannot be sent for clearance. Cash transactions are also affected because branches remain closed. Government treasury operations, import and export bill negotiations, money market operations, etc. will also be affected. About 30 lakh cheques worth about Rs 23 lakh crore will be held up without clearance due to the strike. In the strike, 21 public sector banks and 12 private sector banks have taken part with a total of 88,000 branches.

C H Venkatachalam, general secretary, AIBEA, told Telangana Today, ""Government wants to divert nation's attention from the increasing bad loans. We want Government to take tough action to recover bad loans. If loans are recovered all banks will be more profitable. Already all the 21 public sector banks have a cumulative operating profit of Rs 1,55,000 crores as on 31-3-2018. Only because of provisions for bad loans of up to Rs 2,30,000 crores, the banks are in net loss of Rs 85,000 crores. Government should review its policy.""

AIBEA said that merger of banks is unwarranted because it is not beneficial to the economy and people at large. It will also impact employment opportunities in banks as thousands of bank branches will be closed. There are thousands of villages where banks do not exist. It needs inclusive growth. India is not overbanked and thus needs no consolidation. Big banks will only give big loans and India needs agriculture and education loans which are small ticket loans.

""Mergers are proposed to make our banks bigger to cater to increasing demand for large-sized loans. Bigger the loan size, higher the risk. Already banks are suffering from big corporate defaults. Hence banks should not be made bigger by merging them. Hence mergers are not needed. Demonetisation has not helped the nation and it's the same case with mergers too,"" he said.

In BOB, Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank, total bad loans stand at Rs 80,000 crores. The merger will not ensure bad loan recovery, they point out.

""Post this strike we will meet the Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and tell that the employees of the banks are against the merger proposal and halt this exercise. SBI had been a classic example where the bank has witnessed losses for the first time after merger and its bad loans mounted. Recovery of bad loans has also fallen. We can't repeat the same mistake,"" he added.

Venckatachalam said, big banks have only allowed Nirav Modi and Mallya to gain and such big size defaults are going to hamper the banking system.

He observes, ""In the name of merger. Good performing banks are going to suffer. Vijaya Bank which is performing better than Bank of Baroda will be forced to merge. There is no method for merger, that the Centre is following."""

Kishore Tiwari, chairman, Vasantrao Naik Sheti Swavalamban Mission (VNSSM), on Wednesday said the scheme has flopped, and blamed banks and the bureaucracy for its failure.

Mr. Tiwari, who holds the Minister of State rank and is also one of the leading activists in Vidarbha on agrarian issues, has submitted 10 demands to the State to 'save farmers'. In his letter, Mr. Tiwari slammed the BJP saying it should not only concentrate on 144 urban seats but take note of anger in the rural areas as well. ""The government is focused on Mumbai-Nagpur road, Metro, cement roads, and development, which give commission to leaders,"" he said.

The letter has pointed out that the State does not have a full-time agriculture minister and agriculture secretary and their appointments need to be made soon. ""Banks and bureaucrats have ensured the failure of the loan waiver scheme of the State government. Therefore, the Centre and the State should introduce a scheme before April through a law which will waive the loan of 100% farmers without any condition,"" he said.

Mr. Tiwari said farmers and women self-help groups are harassed through micro-finance and private money lenders, and therefore waiving of their loans is a necessity. The loan waiver scheme named as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Shetkari Sanman Yojana (CSMSSY) was launched in June 2017 with a target to waive ₹34,000 crore loan of 80 lakh farmers. But, the government has disbursed only half the amount by December.

Among other demands raised by Mr. Tiwari are free education from KG to PG for farmers' children, ₹1 lakh for the wedding of farmers' daughter, and banning private companies from the Prime Minister crop insurance scheme.

Mr. Tiwari has cited examples of Telangana and Jharkhand where ₹5,000 per acre is given to farmers every season in the form of grant, and has demanded that a similar scheme be launched for farmers with non-irrigated lands in Vidarbha, north Maharashtra, Khandesh, and Marathwada.

The VNSSM was set up by the State government to ensure its schemes reach farmers, and it is also tasked with taking a review of existing schemes and submit a monthly report.

Government rejects separate time zone for NE States

Context: Govt rejects demand for different time zone for northeastern states for 'strategic reasons'.

The debate for a separate time zone for the northeast has been in existence for as long as the history of modern India goes. Amidst the pros and cons of having two time zones for the country, no implementable solution has been proposed so far.

Back in October this year, the CSIR-National Physical Laboratory (CSIR-NPL) and the National Measurement Institute (NMI) of India explored the possibility and also proposed an implementable solution.

The custodian of Indian Standard Time (IST) proposed two time zones IST-I and IST-II for the country as follows:

The borderline between two time zones would have been 89°52'E, the narrow border between Assam and West Bengal. States west of this line would have followed IST-I (UTC +5:30) while states east of this line (Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Andaman & Nicobar Islands) would have followed IST-II (UTC +6:30).

Earth is divided into 360 vertical lines or the longitudes. A shift in every longitude gives a time difference of four minutes; so, the planet is divided into 24 time zones.

Longitude is the angular distance between a point on any Meridian and the prime meridian in Greenwich. The time at Greenwich is called as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

India extends from 68°7'E to 97°25'E, with the spread of 29 degrees, which amounts to almost two-hours from the geographical perspective. For decades, legislators, activists, industrialists and ordinary citizens from India's northeast have complained about the effect of IST on their lives.

Following are the factors which compelled the people from northeast to demand a different time zone:

Loss of daylight hours and excess electricity usage. A different time zone would allow sunsets to take place later, allowing the citizens to better use their daylight hours.

Effect on biological clocks of citizens. The longitudinal extremes of the country are assigned a single time zone which not only creates the loss of daylight hours but also creates problems relating to the biological clock.

India has a huge population; if the country were divided into two time zones, there would be chaos at the border between the two zones. It would mean resetting clocks with each crossing of the time zone. There is scope for more dangerous kinds of confusion. Railway signals are not fully automated and many routes have single tracks. Trains may meet with major accidents owing to human errors. Just one such accident would wipe out any benefits resulting from different time zones in the country.

Partitioning the already divided country further into time zones may also have undesirable political consequences. Moreover, research shows that the energy saving from creating two time zones is not particularly large.

With a time difference of one hour in the mornings and in the evenings, there would be nearly 25% less overlap between office timings in the two zones. This could be important for banks, offices, industries and multinational companies which need to be constantly interconnected. This will be further detrimental to productivity and to the interests of the eastern region.

There is already a sense of alienation between the relatively prosperous and industrialised western zone and the less developed eastern zone. The people in the Northeast sense a distance from the mainland and a separateness in clock time may accentuate it.

Having a separate time zone for the eastern region will provide no energy or other benefits to the rest of the country. Moreover, India will continue to be in off-set time zones, five and a half hours in the west and six and a half in the eastern region ahead of.

Mains Question: Critically analyse the need for multiple time zones in India?

Context: Recently, Chairman of India's largest lender State Bank of India (SBI), Rajnish Kumar, said that loan waivers are not a permanent solution; instead, he argued for an investment scheme to increase the income of farmers on similar lines of Telangana's Rythu Bandhu.

In August this year, Telangana government launched 'Rythu Bandhu' investment support scheme for farmers.

The Rythu Bandhu (Agriculture Investment Support Scheme) takes care of initial investment needs of every farmer.

Aimed at relieving farmers of debt burden and cease them from falling into the debt trap again, the scheme provides a grant of Rs 4,000 per acre per farmer each season for the purchase of inputs like seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, labour and other investments in the field operations of farmer's choice for the crop season.

Context: Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MoMSME) has released its Strategy Action Plan on Unlocking the potential of MSME exports.

Despite a reasonable growth story and substantial share in overall exports, MSMEs are often faced with challenges that restrict their entry into the foreign market. Not only do these challenges need to be studied in detail but, an eco-system needs to be created in such a way that these enterprises shall be able to participate in the global value chain on its own and generate enough economies of scale.

Highlights of the strategic action plan proposed:

Aim: The strategy action plan prepared by the Ministry aims to create a sustainable ecosystem for entire MSME development.

The action plan aims to achieve the objectives of - Finance; Access to affordable trade finance; Target of USD 100 billion of exports from India by 2020; Evaluate readiness of MSMEs to export their products and services; Recognize areas where improvements are required in order to be able to export effectively and efficiently; Integration of MSMEs into Global Value Chain.

Governing Council: To ensure efficient and effective delivery of all MSME export related interventions, the Strategy Action Plan proposed to formulate a governing council that shall be chaired by Secretary, M/o MSME and Co-chaired by DC, M/o MSME.

Composition: The council shall comprise of senior officials and members from M/o MSME, Commerce, MSME Export Promotion Councils, Export Development Authorities, Commodity Boards, and other bodies.

The need of the hour is to study challenges in detail and create an eco-system in such a way that these enterprises shall be able to participate in the global value chain on their own and generate enough economies of scale.

Mains Question: For MSME sector, access to credit is one of the most significant challenge amongst the several challenges that the sector faces. Analyze issues related to credit availability for MSME sector and the role government is playing?

For Prelims and Mains: Overview and significance of the Achievements.

Context: The year 2018 is ending with spectacular success of Indian scientists and technologists in the space and defence sectors, with a series of high impact missions. Several scientific developments, new techniques and promising technologies -- in fields ranging from nanotechnology to space weather -- made headlines during the year.

A gel that can protect farmers from toxic pesticides: It is a protective gel -- poly-Oxime -- that can be applied on skin and can break down toxic chemicals into safe substances, preventing farmers from going deep into the skin and organs like the brain and the lungs.

World's thinnest material with novel technique: It is a material that is 100,000 times thinner than a sheet of paper. Researchers synthesized a two-dimensional material of just one-nanometre in thickness using Magnesium diboride -- a compound of boron. This is said to be the world's thinnest material. It can find a range of applications -- from next-generation batteries to ultraviolet absorbing films.

Gene editing applied to banana genome: Using the gene editing technique -- CRISPR/Cas9 -- researchers at the National Agri-Food Biotechnology Institute, Mohali, edited the banana genome. This is the first such work in any fruit crop in India. Banana is the fourth most important food crop after wheat, rice and corn in terms of gross value of production. Gene editing could be deployed to improve nutritional quality, agronomical important traits as well as pathogen resistance in banana.

Faster diagnostic tests for tuberculosis: Scientists have developed highly sensitive and rapid tests for detection of tuberculosis infection in lungs and surrounding membranes. Unlike current tests that use antibodies for detection of bacterial proteins in sputum samples, new tests use Aptamer Linked Immobilized Sorbent Assay (ALISA) and Electrochemical Sensor (ECS) for detection of a bacterial protein in the sputum.

New tool developed for autism screening: In many cases, autism is misdiagnosed as mental retardation and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Early identification and interventions may help children with autistic disorders. To help this process, scientists have developed an Indian tool for screening children for autism.

Hope for Alzheimer's and Huntington's patients: Scientists at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, have figured out the way memory deficit develops in early stages, resulting in Alzheimer's disease. They have found that early breaking down of a protein, fibrillar actin or F-actin, in the brain leads to disruption in communication among nerve cells and consequently memory deficits.

Green technique can address plaster of Paris pollution: A team of scientists at Pune-based National Chemical Laboratory (CSIR-NCL) has developed a technique that helps recycle plaster of Paris waste from hospitals in an eco-friendly and economical way. The new technique disinfects waste and converts it into useful products like ammonium sulphate and calcium bicarbonate. The technique can also be used to disintegrate PoP waste from idols immersed in water bodies.

Stone Age tools, genetic studies throw new light on early civilisation in India: The Stone Age tools discovered in a village near Chennai suggest that a Middle Palaeolithic culture was present in India around 385,000 years ago -- roughly the same time that it is known to have developed in Africa and in Europe. The discovery pushes back the period when populations with a Middle Palaeolithic culture may have inhabited India, and challenges popular theory that the Middle Palaeolithic was brought to India by modern humans dispersing from Africa only around 125,000 years ago or later.

Sikkim gets real-time landslide warning system: A real-time landslide warning system has been set up in the Sikkim-Darjeeling belt of north-eastern Himalayas which is highly vulnerable to landslides. The warning system consists of over 200 sensors that can measure geophysical and hydrological parameters like rainfall, pore pressure and seismic activities. The system is capable of warning about 24 hours in advance. It has been deployed by researchers of Kerala-based Amrita University and Sikkim State Disaster Management Authority.

Computing capacity for weather forecasting gets a boost: During the year, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) upgraded its computing capacity for weather forecasting and climate monitoring, taking its total high performance computing (HPC) power to as high as 6.8 Petaflop. With this, India rose to the fourth position, next only to United Kingdom, Japan and USA in terms of dedicated capacity for HPC resources for weather and climate proposes.

Scientists use silk polymer to develop artificial vertebral disc: Scientists at Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, developed a silk-based bioartificial disc that may find use in disc replacement therapy in future. The group has developed a fabrication procedure for a silk-based bioartificial disc adopting a ""directional freezing technique"". The disc mimics internal intricacy of human disc and its mechanical properties too are similar to those of the native ones. The use of a silk biopolymer to fabricate a biocompatible disc can reduce the cost of artificial discs in future.

Transgenic rice with reduced arsenic accumulation: To address the problem of arsenic accumulation in rice grains, researchers at Lucknow- based CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute developed transgenic rice by inserting a novel fungal gene, which results in reduced arsenic accumulation in rice grain. They cloned Arsenic methyltransferase (WaarsM) gene from a soil fungus and inserted it into rice genome.

Flowering mustard: TERI School of Advanced Studies has developed an early flowering transgenic variety of mustard.

Mains Question: Highlight the Achievements of Indian Scientists in the year 2018 and their significance for the society.

Context: A recently-declassified study of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) states that mobile towers do not have any negative effect on human health.

In international standards, ""thermal effect"" of radiation refers to the heat that is generated due to absorption of microwave radiation which causes cellular and physiological changes in living beings. This effect may be responsible for genetic defects, effects on reproduction and development, central nervous system behaviour and many similar serious health consequences.

Non-thermal effects of radiation have been shown to be responsible for fatigue, irritability, headaches, nausea, loss of appetite, sleep disturbance, disruption and other psychological disorders, memory loss and difficulties in concentration.

About International Commission on Non Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP):

The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) is an international commission specialized in non-ionizing radiation protection. The organization's activities include determining exposure limits for electromagnetic fields used by devices such as cellular phones.

ICNIRP is an independent non-profit scientific organization chartered in Germany. It was founded in 1992 by the International Radiation Protection Association (IRPA) to which it maintains close relations.

The mission of ICNIRP is to screen and evaluate scientific knowledge and recent findings toward providing protection guidance on non-ionizing radiation, i.e. radio, microwave, UV and infrared.

Mains Question: Does the radiation from cellphone towers damage human health? Discuss.

The Prime Minister Narendra Modi, dedicated the Bogibeel bridge in Assam, to the nation. Additionally, on the northern bank of the Brahmaputra, the Prime Minister also flagged passenger train passing through the bridge.

Since Dibrugarh is an important centre of healthcare, education and commerce in the region, and the people living north of the Brahmaputra, can now access this city, more conveniently.

Construction of the Bogibeel Bridge was agreed by the government as part of a 1985 agreement to end years of deadly agitation by Assamese nationalist groups.

The Bogibeel project was a part of the 1985 Assam Accord and was sanctioned in 1997-98.

The Bogibeel Bridge, which will have a serviceable period of around 120 years, is India's only fully welded bridge for which European welding standards were adhered to for the first time in the country.

Context: Haryana has renamed child care institutes being run in the state as Jagannath Ashrams.

Why? Since all child care institutions have a similar goal of all-round development of children, it would be appropriate to give a single name.

India's first music museum to be set up in Thiruvaiyaru:

Context: The country's first music museum will be set up with assistance from the Central government in Thiruvaiyaru, Tamilnadu, the birth place of Saint Tyagaraja, one of the Trinities of Carnatic music. The other two of the Trinity are Muthuswami Dikshitar and Syama Sastri.

Carnatic music, is a system of music commonly associated with South India, including the modern Indian states of Andhra Pardesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil nadu as well as Sri Lanka . The main emphasis in Carnatic music is on vocal music; most compositions are written to be sung, and even when played on instruments, they are meant to be performed in gyaki (singing) style."

Oxford picked ""toxic."" Merriam-Webster went for ""justice."" Collins chose ""single-use."" I'd zero in on ""misgovernment."" Surely, 2018 saw a staggering number of countries woefully misruled by the worst crop of world leaders in recent memory.

The most egregious examples are in the news every day. U.S. President Donald Trump tops the chart as he runs out of straws to clutch in trying to convince Americans that his election has been good for them. The stock market bump of which he was so proud is disappearing. The fiscal deficit is the highest since 2012. Trade wars notwithstanding, the trade deficit is at a 10-year high.

The turnover on the presidential staff has reached catastrophic levels: 65 per cent of Trump's ""A-Team"" had been replaced since his election as of Dec. 14, according to the Brookings Institution, and that doesn't even include cabinet members (12 of the 24 officials in the cabinet have been replaced and now a 13th, Defense Secretary James Mattis, is leaving). Trump is having trouble filling once-coveted positions, and the officials he fired and those who have resigned are sometimes unconstrained in criticizing him -- a situation that, were it to occur in a corporation, would have tanked its stock.

All this doesn't even scratch the surface of what Trump has done. The damage he has wreaked on the U.S. role in the world is only beginning to manifest itself. Almost everywhere (with a few exceptions such as Israel and South Korea) favorable views of the U.S. are declining, and people are becoming convinced that the U.S. doesn't care about other countries' interests. Alliances are loosening and the multilateral world order is creaking.

Almost as obvious is the misgovernment of the U.K. Blind to the reality of disappearing economic growth, slowing business investment and a growing trade deficit, Prime Minister Theresa May's government has persevered in trying to pull the country out of the European Union and in fantasizing about withdrawal terms that the EU rejected from the start. Destroyed by the EU's dream team of super-competent negotiators, May's bungling, ill-prepared representatives flailed about, resigned in exasperation and finally produced a deal nobody really wants -- not even the EU, though it's skewed heavily in its favor. With her support weak even within her own party and her negotiating options exhausted, May now is setting up the country for a no-deal Brexit scenario that would cause massive disruption to millions of lives -- anything to avoid the only reasonable option, a new vote on EU membership for a U.K. public that found out this year it had been misled by Brexit campaigners who lied about the consequences of withdrawal.

Not Just an Anglo-Saxon Thing

Even beyond these two most obvious examples of mismanagement and incompetence, things aren't looking much better. Last year, Emmanuel Macron of France looked like the Western world's great hope with his sweeping reform plans and a grand vision for a tighter-knit EU. He ends the year in retreat before what's looking like the most effective Facebook-driven revolt in a Western nation to date, the Yellow Vest movement that started as a protest against a small increase in fuel taxes but grew into a violent anti-elite rebellion. Macron has undermined his reform ambitions by making concessions to the Yellow Vests worth up to 11 billion euros ($12.5 billion) a year, and his popularity hasn't recovered, remaining at a dismal 27-percent approval in public opinion polls.

Another potential leader of the west, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, spent most of the year hobbled by an open revolt within her party, the Christian Democratic Union, and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union. The conservative rebels paralyzed the government demanding tougher immigration policies and forcing Merkel into exhausting backroom battles that left her drained, sometimes even apathetic. The Union performed badly in two important state elections, and Merkel was forced to give up the party leadership. Though her chosen successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, won the leadership election earlier this month, beating the more conservative Friedrich Merz, the split in the party hasn't been healed and a lame-duck Merkel hasn't acted as though the lifted burden of party politics has freed her up to be more assertive as chancellor. The best she's been able to do is ensure stability, which looks to many Germans like stagnation at a time when the country is falling behind others in technology and underinvesting in areas such as education and infrastructure.

This was a year of chaos in other democracies, too.

The populist government in Italy drew up a fantasy budget that included a version of a universal basic income and fought with the EU over it (only to end up lowering its unrealistic projections) while the economy slid toward recession.

In Spain, Mariano Rajoy's center-right government buckled under the weight of corruption scandals and the outgoing prime minister spent a whole day at a restaurant as Socialist rival Pedro Sanchez unseated him in a kind of parliamentary coup. Sanchez, however, isn't doing too well, either: His government is beset by scandals, he faces a reprise of troublemaking by Catalonian separatists that made it almost impossible for Rajoy to focus on anything else. Now, for the first time in decades, a nationalist-populist party, Vox, is gaining popularity and has won representation in Andalusia's regional parliament.

Sweden and Latvia are entering the new year without governments following inconclusive elections and months of coalition negotiations. In Sweden, established parties are trying to exclude an increasingly powerful populist rival. In Latvia the establishment would like to engage the surging populists to get around a strong party that's considered pro-Russian, but the results are the same: a political fracturing unprecedented in both countries' history.

In Belgium, the government has just been toppled by a nationalist party campaigning against a non-binding United Nations migration pact that Belgium approved along with 163 other countries.

Weakening Strongmen

It hasn't been a great year for strongmen and hybrid regimes, either. Russian President Vladimir Putin was re-elected, but has since seen a drop in popularity following a highly unpopular retirement-age increase. Russia's economy and Russians' incomes are stagnating, and Putin's been constrained overseas by a string of public failures by Russia's aggressive military intelligence service and an inability to build a working relationship with the U.S.

India's Narendra Modi goes into 2019 having lost elections in three states where his Bharatiya Janata Party was previously dominant. Modi's hubris and the lasting effects of his policy mistakes, such as the disastrous ""demonetization"" of 2016 in which Modi took 86 percent of the country's cash out of circulation, are partly responsible for his weakening hold on power. Urji Patel, the central bank governor, resigned earlier this month after Modi's repeated attempts to weaken the bank's independence and get control over its reserves. Though economic growth has been strong, it hasn't been inclusive as Modi had promised; unemployment hit a two-year high in October.

Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan consolidated his power with an election win, but he's mismanaging Turkey's economy. The Bloomberg consensus forecast sees the country plunging into recession starting this quarter. The lira is the world's second-worst performing currency after the Argentine peso, having lost about 29 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar.

Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, once feted as a bold reformer, has seen his reputation destroyed by the October murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The brutal act has undermined international support for MBS, as the prince is known, and thrown a monkey wrench into his plans to reduce the Saudi economy's oil dependence.

Saudi Arabia's arch-rival, Iran, isn't doing much better. Beset by domestic protests and hit again by U.S. sanctions from which European powers have been unable to protect it, the regime of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has had an awful year, even if it's not teetering yet.

Viktor Orban in Hungary, whose Fidesz party won a supermajority in an election in April, appears to have overplayed his hand with a series of moves aimed at consolidating his power over courts and media, as well as a recent law that has the potential to force Hungarians into working overtime for pay that would be delayed for three years. He's facing the most persistent protests of his rule and has been forced to resort to violence against the protesters.

The current crew of error-prone rulers makes for a fractious world with a growing potential for conflict, armed and otherwise, domestic and international. The elites, both democratic and authoritarian, are weak, and they invite backlashes against their mismanagement. Protest movements and anti-establishment parties have sprung up and are strengthening everywhere; they have different goals but are all bolstered by social-network technology that amplifies anger and violence.

Winners Lose Ground

Even the few notable exceptions to the misgovernment rule of 2018 don't inspire much confidence. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has made no major errors, but his popularity is trending down ahead of next year's election.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who vowed to clean up the country after the disheartening corruption that plagued it under Jacob Zuma, couldn't maintain ""Ramaphoria"" for long. Though he has restored investor confidence, his anti-corruption efforts haven't yielded quick results and fears of a land expropriation campaign continue to hang over the country.

Most intriguingly, Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has avoided major errors for years, may have made some in 2018. It's unclear whether accepting Trump's trade-war challenge was a good idea. For all its might, China is still a middle-income country that's extremely dependent on trade. Xi's battle against Trump may win him sympathy in Europe, but Europeans aren't natural allies for China. Xi's show of strength may be premature, and that will become clear in the next couple of years.

The shortage of competent, clear-headed, hubris-free leadership in today's world may be a freak accident. But if it's the new normal, living in this world will require new skills from ordinary people, too.

The dictionaries have decided on their 2018 words of the year. Oxford picked ""toxic."" Merriam-Webster went for ""justice."" Collins chose ""single-use."" I'd zero in on ""misgovernment."" Surely, 2018 saw a staggering number of countries woefully misruled by the worst crop of world leaders in recent memory.

The most egregious examples are in the news every day. U.S. President Donald Trump tops the chart as he runs out of straws to clutch in trying to convince Americans that his election has been good for them. The stock market bump of which he was so proud is disappearing. The fiscal deficit is the highest since 2012. Trade wars notwithstanding, the trade deficit is at a 10-year high.

The turnover on the presidential staff has reached catastrophic levels: 65 per cent of Trump's ""A Team"" had been replaced since his election as of December 14, according to the Brookings Institution, and that doesn't even include cabinet members (12 of the 24 officials in the cabinet have been replaced and now a 13th, Defense Secretary James Mattis, is leaving). Trump is having trouble filling once-coveted positions, and the officials he fired and those who have resigned are sometimes unconstrained in criticizing him -- a situation that, were it to occur in a corporation, would have tanked its stock.

All this doesn't even scratch the surface of what Trump has done. The damage he has wreaked on the U.S. role in the world is only beginning to manifest itself. Almost everywhere (with a few exceptions such as Israel and South Korea) favorable views of the U.S. are declining, and people are becoming convinced that the U.S. doesn't care about other countries' interests. Alliances are loosening and the multilateral world order is creaking.

Almost as obvious is the misgovernment of the U.K. Blind to the reality of disappearing economic growth, slowing business investment and a growing trade deficit, Prime Minister Theresa May's government has persevered in trying to pull the country out of the European Union and in fantasizing about withdrawal terms that the EU rejected from the start. Destroyed by the EU's dream team of super-competent negotiators, May's bungling, ill-prepared representatives flailed about, resigned in exasperation and finally produced a deal nobody really wants -- not even the EU, though it's skewed heavily in its favor. With her support weak even within her own party and her negotiating options exhausted, May now is setting up the country for a no-deal Brexit scenario that would cause massive disruption to millions of lives -- anything to avoid the only reasonable option, a new vote on EU membership for a U.K. public that found out this year it had been misled by Brexit campaigners who lied about the consequences of withdrawal.

Not Just an Anglo-Saxon Thing

Even beyond these two most obvious examples of mismanagement and incompetence, things aren't looking much better. Last year, Emmanuel Macron of France looked like the Western world's great hope with his sweeping reform plans and a grand vision for a tighter-knit EU. He ends the year in retreat before what's looking like the most effective Facebook-driven revolt in a Western nation to date, the Yellow Vest movement that started as a protest against a small increase in fuel taxes but grew into a violent anti-elite rebellion. Macron has undermined his reform ambitions by making concessions to the Yellow Vests worth up to 11 billion euros ($12.5 billion) a year, and his popularity hasn't recovered, remaining at a dismal 27-per cent approval in public opinion polls.

Another potential leader of the west, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, spent most of the year hobbled by an open revolt within her party, the Christian Democratic Union, and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union. The conservative rebels paralyzed the government demanding tougher immigration policies and forcing Merkel into exhausting backroom battles that left her drained, sometimes even apathetic. The Union performed badly in two important state elections, and Merkel was forced to give up the party leadership. Though her chosen successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, won the leadership election earlier this month, beating the more conservative Friedrich Merz, the split in the party hasn't been healed and a lame-duck Merkel hasn't acted as though the lifted burden of party politics has freed her up to be more assertive as chancellor. The best she's been able to do is ensure stability, which looks to many Germans like stagnation at a time when the country is falling behind others in technology and underinvesting in areas such as education and infrastructure.

This was a year of chaos in other democracies, too.

The populist government in Italy drew up a fantasy budget that included a version of a universal basic income and fought with the EU over it (only to end up lowering its unrealistic projections) while the economy slid toward recession.

In Spain, Mariano Rajoy's center-right government buckled under the weight of corruption scandals and the outgoing prime minister spent a whole day at a restaurant as Socialist rival Pedro Sanchez unseated him in a kind of parliamentary coup. Sanchez, however, isn't doing too well, either: His government is beset by scandals, he faces a reprise of troublemaking by Catalonian separatists that made it almost impossible for Rajoy to focus on anything else. Now, for the first time in decades, a nationalist-populist party, Vox, is gaining popularity and has won representation in Andalusia's regional parliament.

Sweden and Latvia are entering the new year without governments following inconclusive elections and months of coalition negotiations. In Sweden, established parties are trying to exclude an increasingly powerful populist rival. In Latvia the establishment would like to engage the surging populists to get around a strong party that's considered pro-Russian, but the results are the same: a political fracturing unprecedented in both countries' history.

In Belgium, the government has just been toppled by a nationalist party campaigning against a non-binding United Nations migration pact that Belgium approved along with 163 other countries.

Weakening Strongmen

It hasn't been a great year for strongmen and hybrid regimes, either.

Russian President Vladimir Putin was re-elected, but has since seen a drop in popularity following a highly unpopular retirement-age increase. Russia's economy and Russians' incomes are stagnating, and Putin's been constrained overseas by a string of public failures by Russia's aggressive military intelligence service and an inability to build a working relationship with the U.S.

India's Narendra Modi goes into 2019 having lost elections in three states where his Bharatiya Janata Party was previously dominant. Modi's hubris and the lasting effects of his policy mistakes, such as the disastrous ""demonetization"" of 2016 in which Modi took 86 per cent of the country's cash out of circulation, are partly responsible for his weakening hold on power. Urji Patel, the central bank governor, resigned earlier this month after Modi's repeated attempts to weaken the bank's independence and get control over its reserves. Though economic growth has been strong, it hasn't been inclusive as Modi had promised; unemployment hit a two-year high in October.

Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan consolidated his power with an election win, but he's mismanaging Turkey's economy. The Bloomberg consensus forecast sees the country plunging into recession starting this quarter. The lira is the world's second-worst performing currency after the Argentine peso, having lost about 29 per cent of its value against the U.S. dollar.

Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, once feted as a bold reformer, has seen his reputation destroyed by the October murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The brutal act has undermined international support for MBS, as the prince is known, and thrown a monkey wrench into his plans to reduce the Saudi economy's oil dependence.

Saudi Arabia's arch-rival, Iran, isn't doing much better. Beset by domestic protests and hit again by U.S. sanctions from which European powers have been unable to protect it, the regime of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has had an awful year, even if it's not teetering yet.

Viktor Orban in Hungary, whose Fidesz party won a supermajority in an election in April, appears to have overplayed his hand with a series of moves aimed at consolidating his power over courts and media, as well as a recent law that has the potential to force Hungarians into working overtime for pay that would be delayed for three years. He's facing the most persistent protests of his rule and has been forced to resort to violence against the protesters.

The current crew of error-prone rulers makes for a fractious world with a growing potential for conflict, armed and otherwise, domestic and international. The elites, both democratic and authoritarian, are weak, and they invite backlashes against their mismanagement. Protest movements and anti-establishment parties have sprung up and are strengthening everywhere; they have different goals but are all bolstered by social-network technology that amplifies anger and violence.

Winners Lose Ground

Even the few notable exceptions to the misgovernment rule of 2018 don't inspire much confidence.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has made no major errors, but his popularity is trending down ahead of next year's election.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who vowed to clean up the country after the disheartening corruption that plagued it under Jacob Zuma, couldn't maintain ""Ramaphoria"" for long. Though he has restored investor confidence, his anti-corruption efforts haven't yielded quick results and fears of a land expropriation campaign continue to hang over the country.

Most intriguingly, Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has avoided major errors for years, may have made some in 2018. It's unclear whether accepting Trump's trade-war challenge was a good idea. For all its might, China is still a middle-income country that's extremely dependent on trade. Xi's battle against Trump may win him sympathy in Europe, but Europeans aren't natural allies for China. Xi's show of strength may be premature, and that will become clear in the next couple of years.

The shortage of competent, clear-headed, hubris-free leadership in today's world may be a freak accident. But if it's the new normal, living in this world will require new skills from ordinary people, too. Vigilance and easy mobility in case a country deteriorates intolerably are two of them; a capacity for constructive protest is a third.

As many as 13 schools have recorded zero enrolment, while another 171 schools have fewer than 20 students. A total of 1,140 schools have fewer than 40 students.

These were the details furnished by the state in 2017-18 to the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), a database about schools in India, developed at the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA). According to officials, the reason for the low enrolment is parents' preference to private schools due to lack of infrastructure, teacher absenteeism, and poor quality education in government schools, among others.

This is in addition to 1,773 schools without buildings, which the government plans to merge with nearby schools with infrastructure. The merger plan comes after the state failed to land for the 1,773 schools. Most of these schools have been merged. Of them, 190 schools in Patna district alone.

The enrolment in government schools dropped to 1.8 crore in 2017-18 from 1.99 crore in 2016-17. The number is expected to drop further when fresh data is examined, diluting the government claim of more than 99% enrolment.

The most alarming trend reflected through U-DISE is that the dropout rate from Class 9 to Class 10- almost 25% of the total enrollment in 2014-15, which jumped to 39.73% in 2016-17, the period when there was unprecedented increase in the number of students failing in Bihar class 10 and 12 board exams.

One of the reasons for the drop, authorities admitted, is parents' preference for private schools for better education and infrastructure.

""If the incentives (such as scholarships, bicycles) attached with government schools are removed, the number will drop further. Many students get admitted to government schools to avail incentives but study in private schools. In 2011, when reports on inflated enrolments surfaced, it created a flutter,"" an education department official added.

Three years ago, the then principal secretary, department of education, Amarjeet Sinha, had said the duplication of enrolment in government schools could be up to 20%.

Bihar Education Project Council (BSEPC) director Sanjay Singh, however, said that the drop in students' number was due to government's drive to do away with duplication in enrolment. ""The number children availing mid-day meal has come down to 1.20 crore compare to previous years,"" he added.

Singh said that the sanctity of data was being maintained. ""Earlier, there was no data on private schools. Now, that is also being prepared. Around 12 lakh more students have joined private schools, not necessarily because they have suddenly opened, but because they are being documented,"" he added.

Singh said under the Right to Education Act, there should be a school within a kilometre for Class 1-5 students provided there are a minimum of 40 students. ""If that is not the case, teachers can be used elsewhere more effectively. Having 3-4 teachers for fewer than 40 children is not relevant,"" he said, adding he would do another appraisal in January after studying the reasons and reports of physical verification."

Photograph: Reuters

There is a predictable knee-jerk reflex of conventional economic pundits, on mentioning freebies such as free or concessional supply of electricity for agriculture, farm loan waiver, distribution of free laptops, television sets, grinders, bicycles, shoes and the like to students and others belonging to low-income groups and generally any food and agricultural subsidy and concession to the poor and needy:

It is to condemn it as squandering away tax-payers's money by ruling dispensations to pander to vote banks and as a subterfuge to come to, and remain in, power.

It is interesting to recall that when K Kamaraj as chief minister of (the then) Madras state introduced the mid-day meal scheme in schools, the same outcry ensued, but Kamaraj braved it and went ahead.

By now, it has earned high tribute from exalted international agencies like the World Bank for its contribution to improvement of vital parameters such as health and nutrition and reduction in child and maternal mortality, besides, of course, helping the spread of education among the poor by better attendance in schools.

Currently, the waiving of farm loans by the three newly elected governments of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, and Congress President Rahul Gandhi's insistent call to the National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre to adopt a similar course are agitating the voluble commentariat.

Many articles have appeared pontificating on the grievous damage such a nation-wide waiver would inflict on the economy.

R Jagannathan, for instance, who has a fan club of his own investing him with the authority and credentials to take the cudgels on such topics, in his mouthpiece, Swarajya , bluntly calls the pressure mounted by Rahul Gandhi 'an economic sabotage of growth' and Rahul himself 'an economic saboteur'.

Critics and sceptics of his ilk miss the fine print that appears year after year in the country's Budgets under the title 'Revenue foregone'.

As per information furnished to Parliament in reply to a question on December 20, 2018, a total of Rs 17,15,461 crore revenue has been foregone by the government due to tax incentives (direct and indirect taxes) in the last three financial years.

That amount represents the revenue readily given up by governments in favour of business and industry in the form of a variety of tax incentives and concessions, quite apart from non-performing assets (Rs 4 lakh crore) of banks (of which between 2012 and 2015, Rs 1.14 lakh crore has been written off) and what the business and industry tycoons default in the form of loans.

As against this, a cumulative farm loan waiver encompassing all the states comes to Rs 3.1 lakh crore.

But Jagannathan makes out a case against farm loan waivers by giving his version of the difference between corporate loans and revenue foregone on the one hand and farm loans on the other, to rub in the distinction between corporate and farm loans, and argue for a hard stand in regard to the latter.

Says Jagannathan: '...corporate bad loans are not written off across the board; only loans involving specific defaulters get written off when a business fails.'

'Farm waivers, on the other hand, are nearly universal.'

'Secondly, after the legislation of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, when bankers take haircuts, the businessperson who defaults loses his entire business assets. When farm loans are written off, no farmer loses his asset.'

In saying so, he seems to take no account of the realties on the ground of rural agricultural India and the daily struggle farmers have to wage to make both ends meet because of the rising burden of fixed and variable costs and the palpable erosion in agricultural income.

There are also extensive studies carried out by dispassionate academic scholars on how electricity, seed, irrigation and fertilizer subsidies have actually boosted agricultural production and income.

One such study Electricity Subsidy in Punjab Agriculture: Extent and Impact by Dr Karam Singh, published in the October-December 2012 issue of the Indian Journal of Agricultural Economics, typically has this to say:

'The decline in the gross margin (profit over operational costs), without electricity subsidy, from rice, would have been about 20 per cent to the all Punjab farmers and 25 per cent to the tubewell farmers in 2010-11. The decline in the profitability of wheat would be much lower at about 5 to 6 per cent.'

'In other words, the electricity subsidy increases the profitability of rice by as much as 25 per cent, because of its significantly larger requirement for irrigation than for wheat (and/or other crops).'

'It is also...... important that any containment of the electricity subsidy to the farm sector should accompany the matching visible improvements in the infrastructures and institutions that would cut down the farmers' fixed costs, reduce the market risks and improve the relative guarantee of profitability of their production efforts and alternatives, and thereby strengthen the base of growth of the farmers' incomes.'

The urban-cum-corporate biased analysts must remember that there is plenty to be gained by farm loan waivers in terms of food, nutrition and livelihood security and rural prosperity, considering the fact that as of 2014, the share of agriculture to GDP was 17.9 per cent, and India is the world's second largest producer of agricultural products.

India's rank is 12th in industry and 11th in services, their respective contribution to India's GDP is 24.2 per cent and 57.9 per cent.

Thus, in my view, farm loan waivers should not be regarded as expenditure but as incentive and investment.

Finally, a word generally about freebies:

I have personally witnessed during my visits to various places how TV sets have been great help in broadening the mental horizons of the poor people and in a sense, have served as agents of political awareness and social change on a conspicuous scale with low investment.

Similar are the benefits derived from laptops.

Well-to-do urban dwellers with most comforts found for them cannot imagine the self-esteem generated in people at or below the poverty line by ownership of such simple things as grinders and bicycles.

In such matters, our politicians, with their ears to the ground, have much greater empathy, sensitivity and imagination than the elitist, English-educated, Western-oriented intellectuals (so-called).

It is observed as Rock Day as the cyclonic monk meditated on the rock at Kanyakumari for three days beginning from Christmas in 1892 and sought answers from deep within the solutions to the problems which were plaguing India at the time.

The saints associated with Ramakrishna Mission Sewashram said that during his wandering years, Vivekananda had experienced the sufferings and problems his countrymen were facing.

""Poverty, lack of self-respect and lack of education caused him pain and he was resolved to restore the long lost self-respect and self-confidence of the people India. For the three days, the swami's mind was obsessed with the need of the Indians and means to charge them up again with the fire of self-faith to look the world in the face based on the glorious history the nation had lived for millennia. This is why December 25 is observed as the Rock Day,"" said Swami Dayadhipananda while speaking to The Pioneer.

""While recounting those days, Vivekananda said he had reached Kanyakumari on December 24 1892. However, his mind was still wavering over how he could help his countrymen bogged in distress. While at Kanyakumari, he swam across the ocean to reach a large mid-sea rock where he meditated on India's past, present and future for three days from December 25 to 27. Here, the 'vision of one India' unfolded and he came up with a solution in the form of resolution which is popularly known as the Kanyakumari resolve of 1892,"" he said.

The general secretary of Ramakrishna Mission Swami Nityashuddhananda said that Vivekananda had realised the need of food for the survival of the body. "" An empty stomach being no good for religion, the poverty-lashed Indians must be fed first. The day is thus marked with feasting with the poor in all the Sewashrams spread across the country,"" he said.

He further said, ""We have a long tradition of celebrating Christmas in the temple located in Sewashram premises. It started with Swami Atulananda whose pre-monastic name was Cornelius, a western devotee from Holland. He spent his last days in the mission in 1965. He inspired the ashram inmates to the tradition of celebrating Christmas. We accepted it heartily as our mentor Sri Ramakrishna embodied the principle of harmony of all religions. We have been celebrating major festivals of other religions too and of course, Christmas holds a special significance. The message of Jesus to 'love thy neighbour as thyself' needs to be reinstated in today's era of religious conflicts."""

In the early hours of 9 December 2018, Video Volunteer Community Correspondent Amit Topno was found murdered in Ghaghra area of Jharkhand, India. Topno, an Adivasi (indigenous) inhabitant of the conflict-prone region of Khunti, Jharkhand, had been with Video Volunteers (VV) since 2012, reported for Newscode and OK Times, and most recently drove a taxi for Ola Cab.

Topno reported fearlessly on issues like sand mining, illegal alcohol sales, Adivasi rights, education, sanitation, human trafficking, land rights, culture and most recently the Pathalgadi movement. His last report for VV was produced six months ago on the Pathalgadi, a movement in which Adivasi communities across Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh asserted their right to self-governance. The movement has its roots in creating awareness and ensuring implementation of the key provisions of the Panchayats (Extensions Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 that empower a village as an administrative unit.

Besides being a community journalist, Topno was a social activist too. He followed up his video reports with on-the-ground action to solve the problem he was reporting. He held community screenings, conducted village meetings, assisted the community in writing applications and approaching government officials and worked towards ensuring accountability. It made schools safer and encouraged the administration to deal with issues like the human-animal conflict in the area. He is remembered by those who knew him as an inquisitive, warm, fun loving and an extremely helpful and courageous individual. In a 2015 interview, Topno said:

Jharkhand is a land caught up in a frightful storm. Its people are being whirled around in a storm of starvation, conflict, and poverty. I am the headman of my village, Nichitpur, Jharkhand, and I'm tired of seeing my people die,"" said Amit in an interview in 2014.

Topno's body was found on the Namkum-Doranda road in Ranchi on 9 December. The autopsy report reveals that he was shot twice and one of the bullets was still lodged in. The autopsy report also states that there were no signs of struggle or scuffle, not even a scratch. His taxi, phone and identity cards were missing but money was not. No weapon was recovered from the scene of the crime. All of this points to a pre-meditated and professionally executed murder. Over 11 days have passed since his murder and no arrests have been made in the case yet -- though the police have said that they are closing on some leads.

On 14 December, more than a 100 people, including social movement leaders, activists, journalists, students and members of the VV network participated in a silent candlelight march to protest his murder. At the march, Jerrome Kujur, Dayamani Barla, Deepak Bara spoke out about the frequent threats and harassment of activists and journalists in Jharkhand. They urged the state to conduct a thorough investigation into this case and bring Amit Topno's murderers to justice.

On 15 December 2018, a delegation of civil society organisations including VV met the superintendent of police and urged him to conduct a thorough and speedy investigation into Topno's murder. The SSP assured that all possible angles will be investigated.

On 17 December 2018, the Jharkhand Jantantrik Mahasabha organised a peaceful protest in Jamshedpur. Friends and allies of Amit also submitted an application to the National Scheduled Tribe Commission urging them to take note of the gruesome murder. Civil society organisations appraised this matter to the Chief Secretary of Jharkhand government and other ministers on 19 December 2018. Arup Chatterjee, an MLA from Nirsa Dhanbad, was handed over documents related to Topno's work and he has promised to raise the issue in the upcoming winter session of the assembly starting on 24th December.

Though Topno did not inform his colleagues of any threats to him in the last 18 months, it cannot be ruled out that he was murdered because of his work as a journalist and social activist, raising issues affecting communities on the margins and working in an area where conflict over land resources is rife. In November 2018, another journalist from the same area was murdered. At a time when India ranks 14th on the Global Impunity Index, Topno's murder is a reminder that journalists who speak truth to power and report out of remote, rural areas are not safe."

Bhagwat was speaking after presenting the eighth annual Lokmata Sumatitai Smruti Pratishthan awards to honour outstanding social work at a function held at Scientific Society Hall, Laxmi Nagar.

Congratulating the awardees, Bhagwat pointed out that none of them had done social work for gaining recognition and said it was their inner urge that made them do it. ""Life that is lived without difficulties in no life as things easily got are the things you won't value much,"" Bhagwat said.

Present on the occasion were committee president Dr Uday Bodhankar, secretary Jyotsna Pandit and executive members Kundatai Vijaykar, Deodatta Dasture and Pravin Gadewar.

The awards were presented in three categories. The Lokmata award was presented to Padma Shri Dr Rani Bang, a gynaecologist, who has brought transformation in the life of tribals, especially in Gadchiroli area. She and her husband Dr Abhay Bang have revolutionized the way the poor are treated. Their projects have led to reduction in infant mortality.

Accepting the award, Dr Bang thanked three women in her life -- her mother for teaching her all the values, her mother-in-law for her unflinching support during her work and Bhagwat's mother Malatibai for lending support to her mother-in-law and making her believe that all will be well.

Lokmata NGO award was given to Saksham, an organization that works for visually disabled people. Accepting the award, the Saksham spokesperson highlighted the various projects that the NGO has done, like setting up a study centre equipped with text to speech facility to assist the visually challenged people.

Lokmata exemplary services award was conferred on social worker Anant Dhole and range forest officer Santosh Thipe. Dhole has been providing education to handicapped people while Thipe has been commended for his bravery for tackling and rescuing an injured leopard even after the animal attacked him."

However, a closer look at the new conditions in fine print reveals that the part-time teachers may not be able to earn the assured sum even in entire year.

As per the GR issued by department of higher and technical education on November 14, the colleges and universities compulsorily need to follow a lengthy procedure to decide number of part-timers they require before appointing them. The new system has held up appointments for this year and is likely to disrupt teaching activity next year too.

Going by the GR, colleges and universities won't be able to assign work to part-time teachers before February. The university exam would start from February 15, thus leaving 15 lectures in 2018-19 session, experts say.

Earlier, the universities and colleges had the liberty to appoint CHB teachers in July itself and get approval by December from the department. Henceforth, the appointments can't be finalized until the government and universities okay the workload, which is decided only at September end when admissions close.

This year, colleges under Nagpur University (NU) as well as other parts of the state have been unable to recruit part-time teachers even though the second term of academic year has begun because of the draconian rules.

Surprisingly, several principals and aspirants have been unable to decipher the details of the GR which would entail months of unemployment and classes without teachers.

""People are so happy about the hike in remuneration that they didn't realize its drawbacks. The government is working against the interest of the students and teachers,' said Rajendra Bhoyar, president of Maharashtra Principals' Forum.

The biggest setback for teachers is restriction on working part-time in more than one college besides possessing higher qualification not less the PhD, NET/SET.

""This is injustice to teachers in the name of increasing the pay,"" said Anil Dhage, former secretary of NUTA.

He added that the GR restricts the number of lectures for a part-time teacher to 9. Earlier it was 7 but teachers were allowed to work in any number of colleges.

Bhoyar said imposing such norms not only increases unemployment among youth but also leaves students without teachers. ""At several colleges, no classes have been held so far. We have demanded that instead the government allows us to recruit contractual teachers just like the Nagpur University has done. We are ready to pay Rs25,000 a month to contract teachers,"" he said."

For the past few days, authorities of the Alama Iqbal Library are not allowing students to enter the library wearing Pheran.

KU students said for the past two days, the library staff was not allowing them to enter the library wearing a Pheran.

According to students, the library staff is quoting Directorate of Internal Quality Assurance (DIQA) guidelines for not allowing them venture into the library wearing a Pheran.

However, they said when they demanded a written copy of guidelines from the library authorities, they refused their request.

Arif Maqbool, a law student, said, ""Two days ago, I went to the Iqbal Library but the library staff, on seeing me wearing a Pheran refused me entry.""

J&K Students Movement (JKSM) General Secretary, Naveed Bakhtiyar said, ""We want complete revocation of such guidelines and orders, which are adversely affecting our culture.""

He warned the KU authorities of stopping harassing students or be prepared for massive student protests.

KU's Chief Librarian, G M Peerzada said, ""The order of not allowing student to enter the library was in place for security reason.""

He said the authorities would install CCTV in the library in the coming months and when the cameras would be in place, students wearing any kind of dress would be allowed to sit inside the library.

""Many times, some mischievous students were found stealing books from the library while hiding them inside their pherans,"" Peerzada said.

Earlier, DSEK had banned 'Pheran' in its zonal offices in the Valley while a similar ban on the Pheran was in place in the civil secretariat at Srinagar.

The ban on pheran comes close on the heels of Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) removing Kashmiri from the online portal 'Basha Sangam' following a complaint by some Kashmiri Pandits.

All these decision of interfering with the Kashmiri language and indigenous Kashmiri dress are being looked at in the Valley as a cultural onslaught carried by New Delhi on the Kashmiri people."

Half a century later what has changed for Dalits in Tamil Nadu, a state defined by Dravidian politics espousing social justice?

The Keezhvenmani issue began as a labour dispute between the landowning upper caste communities and the Dalit agricultural labourers, supported by Communists, demanding higher wages. According to the writings of Mythili Sivaraman, CPM and women's rights activist, who played a key role in documenting the aftermath of the massacre, it was not just a labour dispute: the landlords were irked also by change in attitude of the workers from a subservient stance (Gentlemen Killers of Kilvenmani, 1973, EPW).

While some changes in wages and land ownership took place in the aftermath of the massacre, the struggle for Dalits remains focused on landless labour and caste discrimination. D Ravikumar, general secretary of VCK -- one of the mainstream Dalit political parties -- points out that land reforms are yet to be implemented in the state.

Activists and scholars note that Dalits still do not have seats in the decision-making tables. Ravikumar points out that there is rarely judicial intervention against any Dalit atrocity let alone punishment for the accused. Meanwhile, Ravikumar argues that till date, any agricultural belt has the most number of Dalits as they were known as the landless poor who would work for minimum wages. Agriculture involves skilled labour but still these workers only get 25 per cent of wages compared to unskilled labourers in urban sector, he said.

Writer and scholar Stalin Rajangam says the condition of Dalits hadn't changed much over the years. Since 1968, Dalits have been able to avail benefits, including the kissan commission and life insurance, but to retain land or get a share of it is till a struggle, he says. ""A few reasons that can be cited for the stagnation of the Dalit community is that the Dravidian parties claimed to have constraints as CPM has been raising its voice for the community. However, the CPM has never been in the ruling position to bring in changes.""

Writer Meena Kandasamy's scathing article 'No one killed the Dalits', highlights the view of the Dravidian ideologues to the issue. When the massacre was reported, then DMK CM, C N Annadurai reportedly had said, ""People should forget this as they forget a feverish nightmare or a flash of lightning"". Periyar, speaking a month later, reportedly said, ""wage is not something you can demand, a wage is that which is fixed by market conditions"". Rajangam argues that changes in education and employment status in the community have happened over time, not because of any specific interventions.

However, there has been change for the better, says K Samuel Raj, general secretary, Tamil Nadu Untouchability Eradication Front (TNUEF), noting that before the massacre, Dalits were treated as slaves and caste Hindus virtually took ownership of them. Only after the massacre did the government begin reforms, including laws to improve the livelihood of Dalits, he says.

Scholar Karthikeyan Damodaran, at the University of Edinburgh, points to changes in political representation. ""It would be really unjust to say that things haven't changed since Keezhvenmani, as major changes have happened at the political level especially in terms of representation,"" he said. ""Now we have full-fledged political parties which work among Dalits...parties with a more solid mass base than before. This is a major change because Dalits were largely either showcasing loyalty being part of Congress or the Dravidian parties,"" he says.

""However, contemporary Dalit politics is at the crossroads, with the very term and meaning of Dalit is getting remade with some Scheduled Caste leaders contesting their classification and laying claim to higher status. The Dalit aspiration towards autonomy in political terms is also palpably missing and parties like the VCK have become mere extensions of Dravidian parties."" Further, the populist nature of the Dravidian parties has resulted in an emphasis on immediate benefits rather than long-term economic changes, he argues."

Vehicle thefts worry police

For Patna Police, the unabated theft of vehicles remains a major cause of worry. Around 200 vehicles, including four-wheelers and motorcycles, get stolen in the capital city of Bihar every month, and the police manage to recover barely ten per cent of them. Kankarbagh and Patrakar Nagar police station areas in the city are the worst affected, as about 25 vehicles, including 15 motorcycles, get stolen there every month.

The thieves seem to have a special liking for Hero Passion and TVS Apache motorcycles, say the police. About 15,000 new motorcycles are sold in Patna every month, and barely 5,000 of them have high-security registration plates. Most of the stolen motorcycles are smuggled to Nepal and Bangladesh, police say.

More people paying power bills online

Consumers of electricity in Bihar are increasingly paying their power bills online. In the latest national survey of payment of power bills through the online mode, Bihar was ranked ninth among the best performing states. As many as 21.7 per cent of the state's electricity consumers are making their payments online. South Bihar Power Distribution Company Limited, with 25.3 per cent of its consumers preferring online payments, stands seventh in the country. North Bihar Power Distribution Company Limited, 15.8 per cent of whose consumers pay bills online, stands 20th in the country.

No bike to be sold without a helmet

Starting New Year's Day, no bike can be sold by dealers in Bihar without the customer buying a high-quality helmet certified by the Bureau of Indian Standards. With nearly half of the 5,000 deaths in road accidents in Bihar every year being caused due to bikers not wearing helmets, the state government has tightened the rules.

All district magistrates, SPs and district transport officers have been asked to make it mandatory for dealers to sell a helmet with every new bike.

The machines have already been installed in government schools across 13 districts.

""Order has been placed to install incinerators in all government girls-only and co-education schools, in Chennai and the project will be completed in due course,"" said Pradeep Yadav, principal secretary of the department.

The state government has allotted around 14 crore to acquire and install the machines in all government schools. The department has already installed 1,136 incinerators and has delivered 1,520 to schools. Most of the schools in Cuddalore, Villupuram, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur, and nine other districts have begun using the machines. Schools will bear the machines' maintenance cost.

The incinerators, as students claim, will be very beneficial. ""What is more inconvenient than the having periods is disposing the soiled napkins. We will not have to worry about maintaining hygiene in the campus anymore,"" said Prateeksha, a Class X student. The fully automated machine, prevents foul odour from used napkins and can burn 150 to 200 napkins a day. The department has also provided cupboard facilities in all schools to store toiletries including sanitary napkins, at 64.01 lakh.

While the state is busy promoting hygiene in government schools, there are complaints that incinerators at a few corporation schools are not being maintained. ""Based on complaints we repair the machines,"" said E Govindasamy, educational officer, Greater Chennai Corporation. The Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 mandates installing incinerators or special disposal dustbins to prevent pollution."

Thakur stressed that effective arrangements should be made to ensure adequate supply of drinking water and packed food for the beneficiaries invited to attend the rally. He added that a foolproof traffic plan should be prepared so that the general public does not face any inconvenience.

She warned that the education department will be forced to take up ""strong measures"" if the para teachers fail to take advantage of this opportunity.

Even as the education minister was appealing for talks, the para teachers refused to back down from the demand for job regularisation and hundreds of them gheraoed the state BJP office. However, it is yet to be known how their leaders will respond to Yadav's appeal.

Inviting them for talks, Yadav said, ""Since we are positive of solving the problems through a dialogue, we are opening our doors to the para teachers and their representatives for discussions till December 26. If they fail to turn up or approach us, we will be forced to take stringent action."" But she refrained from disclosing the exact nature of action planned against them. The para teachers' mass protest in the state will complete 40 days on Tuesday, with around 55,000 of the total 66,000 still continuing the strike and affecting thousands of schools.

In an indication of softening stand, the minister said it is open to strike a deal with the protesters within the norms and regulations. She said, ""We are even open to talks over increase of honorarium of untrained para teachers which wasn't included in the recent hikes announced. Besides, we also have agreed on setting up a 'welfare fund' of Rs 10 crore for the para teachers to meet their exigency expenditures, including medical emergencies.""

Yadav also extended her condolences to families of those para teachers who died during their ongoing protests. ""I have met the protesting para teachers at my home and personally on several occasions asked them to come for a dialogue. The temperatures are dipping and we are losing our teachers, which is very upsetting, given that they are stuck on the demands that are impossible to meet,"" she said, adding, ""Every time the teaching jobs are opened, 50% reservation is given to existing para teachers. No other state has such a provision. The para teachers should come ahead for talks taking all these into account and for the greater good of the students.""

However, school education secretary A P Singh reiterated that it will not be possible to implement a higher scale for honorarium at par with states like Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha, saying their operational models have no parallels with that of Jharkhand. ""Even on this date, we have 11,000 para teachers who are not only intermediate but untrained too. All of them will be forced out of their current jobs from April 2019 if they fail to complete teachers' training from the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS). Even then, the government is sympathetic and allowing them a provision for on-job training. Nowhere in the country is the government and the administration more sensitized towards the para teachers than in Jharkhand, but they continue to be in the denial state,"" Singh said."

From Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi to Tipu Sultan and Shehla Rashid, not many escaped fake news propaganda of 2018. ThePrint brings you some the year's best.

New Delhi: There had been a continuous flow of fake news on social media in 2018, the year preceding the Lok Sabha elections. Politicians, activists, leaders and even a few journalists -- irrespective of their ideological leanings -- have shared fake news on Twitter and Facebook throughout the year.

Here is the list of top 10 fake news items that were shared widely on various social media platforms:

Doctored video of Congress leader Sidhu's rally

A doctored video of a crowd shouting 'Pakistan Zindabad' (long live Pakistan) at a Congress election rally in Rajasthan's Alwar district was widely shared on social media earlier this month. Twitter handles of Zee News and a few other portals had shared the video. In the original video, the crowd can be heard screaming 'Pakistan Murdabad' (down with Pakistan), instead of 'Pakistan Zindabad'

Fake pictures of RSS workers helping Kerala flood victims

In August, Kerala witnessed one of its worst floods since 1924. Images of RSS workers helping the flood victims were widely shared on Twitter. People started shaming the Left government in the state saying the RSS is working harder to provide relief to the flood victims in a state that has seen killings of its members due to political violence. However, the pictures, although of RSS workers, were not from Kerala. A report said the pictures of RSS workers helping out the victims are from August 2017 during the Gujarat floods.

Jignesh Mevani shared photoshopped image of Shefali Vaidya

In May, a photoshopped image of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and columnist Shefali Vaidya was widely shared on Twitter after it was posted by Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani, also a Dalit rights activist. Although Mewani deleted the tweet later and apologised, Vaidya filed a case against him under section 500 of the IPC (defamation) the section 66 A of the IT act (punishment for identity theft).

Congress' Divya Spandana said Modi didn't study beyond high school

Congress social media and communications head Divya Spandana had in September tweeted an old video clip in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi says that he studied till high-school level. The video Spandana tweeted was made in 1998 when Modi was the general secretary of the BJP. Congress leader Rajeev Shukla, who was a journalist at that time, had interviewed Modi for his popular TV show Ru-Ba-Ru during which he asked him about his education. Later, Spandana admitted that she had posted an incomplete video.

Rahul Gandhi U-turn on farm loan waiver promise

A collage of videos claiming that Congress president Rahul Gandhi had gone back on his promise of providing loan waivers to farmers in Madhya Pradesh after winning the state election was doing the rounds. In the first video, Gandhi is seen promising loan waiver to farmers within 10 days if the Congress comes to power in Madhya Pradesh. In the second video, he can be seen saying: ""This is not the solution. The solution will be more complex and the solution will be one that supports farmers..."" It was later found that the second clip has been altered. MP Chief Minister Kamal Nath waived farmers' loan up to Rs 2 lakh the day he sworn in.

Doctored image of Modi wearing a skull cap

A photoshopped image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi wearing a Muslim skull cap was shared widely on social media in September. The Prime Minister had gone to Indore to address a gathering of Dawoodi Bohras, where he met the religious head of the community, Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin. However, in the pictures tweeted from the official handle of the Prime Minister, @narendramodi, one can see that Modi wasn't wearing any cap while exchanging greeting with the religious leader.

Fake image of Delhi's Signature Bridge

The Aam Aadmi Party's official handle tweeted a photograph of a bridge that it claimed was the much-awaited cable-stayed 'Signature Bridge', which was inaugurated later. The only hitch - the photograph was found to be that of Erasmus Bridge, which is located at the heart of Rotterdam in the Netherlands. The goof-up was pointed out by BJP spokesperson, Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga, who has 424.6 K Twitter followers.

Congress is the second most corrupt party in the world

In September, filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri and founder of Aarin Capital, Mohandas Pai, were among many others who tweeted a listicle claiming that a BBC survey had found the Congress to be the second most corrupt party in the world. However, this turned out to be a fake survey and the online editor of the BBC clarified that the premier news organisation never conducts such surveys.

BJP worker posted image of slave trader, claimed it was Tipu Sultan

In November, BJP spokesperson Ashwini Upadhyay tweeted an image of an African slave trader from the 19th century, claiming it's a picture of the 'real' Tipu Sultan. He tagged PM Narendra Modi among many other senior ministers in the tweet, which fetched more than 700 retweets overnight. The tweet came on the day the JD(S)-Congress government in Karnataka was celebrating Tipu Sultan's birth anniversary, against which the BJP had raised objections.

Shehla Rashid pocketing money meant for Kathua rape victim's kin

There were rumours on social media that JNU activist Shehla Rashid had embezzled funds collected for the family of an eight-year-old girl who was raped and murdered in the Kathua region of Jammu and Kashmir in January. Zee News had even run a prime time show on the issue. However, fact-checking website Alt News found that the money was transferred, but the family found it difficult to withdraw because of lack of PAN card and other documents and none of it went to Shehla.

""The event will highlight Gujarat's ability to provide a higher quality of life to its citizens and to those who have migrated here for work or higher education,"" added Kumar.

The event will be organized on January 19 at the Mahatma Mandir in Gandhinagar. It will provide a sneak peek into the investment opportunities opening up in Gujarat and an opportunity to the delegates to meet global corporate leaders and the strategy makers for jointly investing in Gujarat.

The state has directed universities to collaborate with 'I Access Rights Mission' -- a field action project of TISS -- to successfully offer barrier-free access to disabled students on their campuses, to address their needs in pedagogy and to offer equal opportunities.

TISS will conduct a needs assessment study in public universities and frame guidelines that will be unique to each university. Since the state does not have a machinery to conduct an audit of the facilities universities' boast about, the department of higher and technical education has sought expert help from TISS. The team from the institute which has been successfully running the I Access mission since 2013, will be meeting representatives of disabled students from across universities to understand their requirements.

Vaishali Kolhe, project director of the mission and an associate professor at TISS' Centre for Disability Studies and Action, said they have observed that students with disabilities find it tough to pursue higher education. ""If they do not get the required infrastructure, aid and appliances, it will affect their overall academic development. We wish to assist each of the non-agricultural universities and study students with disabilities in the next two years,"" said Kolhe.

While the university is expected to bear the funding, the team of I Access will provide the expertise for the action-based work. In a government resolution (GR) passed in 2017, the state identified 21 disabilities for the first time to be considered for offering concessions/ facilities in educational institutions.

In another GR passed in August this year, based on Supreme Court's directive, the state made it compulsory to offer barrier-free accessibility on campuses and monitoring of these facilities. The mission's 'call for action' guidelines has already been circulated to all non-agricultural universities in the state.

""While we have been issuing directives, the state does not have the machinery to monitor the progress in colleges and universities. Experts from TISS understand the problem in depth and they are empathetic to the issue. We, therefore, are asking universities to collaborate with them. The university will have to ensure the guidelines are implemented in affiliated colleges as well,"" said joint secretary of higher and technical education department, Siddharth Kharat.

Aconference held recently at TISS highlighted issues on disabilities, accessibility in the light of legislation and policies in the context of higher education. Experts also opined that the many disabled students, who seek admissions under reserved categories tend to drop out after a few months as they are unable to cope up, as there is a lack of awareness about the facilities"

Ratcheting up his criticism of the BJP-led government at the Centre, Shiv Sena Chief Uddhav Thackeray on Monday, 24 December, took potshots at Prime Minister Narendra Modi by borrowing, for the first time, the ""chowkidar chor hai"" phrase often invoked by the Congress. The Shiv Sena has always been a strong BJP ally, though the two fought the Assembly elections separately in 2014.

Addressing a rally of Shiv Sainiks in the temple town of Pandharpur, Uddhav recounted a meeting in Beed with a farmer who showed him a lime tree -- normally used to keep off pests -- itself getting infested. I told him, ""Halli paharekarich chorya karaylaa laagale aahet. (Today, security persons have themselves become thieves),"" he said. 'Paharekari' is the Marathi word for chowkidar (in Hindi) or 'guard'.

Uddhav also targeted Modi for what he described as his 'jumle baazi'. ""The Prime Minister recently said he will help double your income by 2022. Later, after the elections he will say it was jumle baazi,"" he said.

2. Centre Wants Fake News Traced

The government has sought public comments on the proposed amendments to the Information Technology (IT) Act that seek to make it mandatory for platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter to trace ""originator"" of ""unlawful"" information, while also removing such content within 24 hours after being notified.

It pointed out that a number of lynching incidents were reported in 2018 mostly due to fake news being circulated through Whatsapp and other social media sites.

As per the draft 'The Information Technology [Intermediaries Guidelines (Amendment) Rules] 2018' released on Monday, 24 December, the intermediary after being notified by the appropriate authority should remove or disable access to unlawful content within 24 hours in the ""interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality, or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence, on its computer resource without vitiating the evidence in any manner...""

3. India Takes Over Iran's Strategic Chabahar Port, Can Bypass Pak on Way to Afghanistan

India on Monday, 24 December, formally took over operations at Chabahar port in Iran, giving a major boost to the country's efforts to support war-torn Afghanistan, people familiar with developments said.

New Delhi's efforts to develop the port, which allows India to ship supplies to Afghanistan while bypassing Pakistan, received a fillip recently when Washington exempted Chabahar from Iran-related sanctions in November.

Iran formally handed over the port to India during a first meeting of the follow-up committee for the implementation of the Chabahar Agreement between Iran, Afghanistan, and India in the port city Tehran. The Indian side at the meeting was led by joint secretary (Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran) Deepak Mittal of the external affairs ministry, while the Iranian team was led by Mohammad Ali Hassanzadeh, the deputy head of the Ports and Maritime Organisation, the people said.

The Supreme Court is scheduled to take up a batch of petitions for hearing in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title dispute case on 4 January. The matter is listed before a bench comprising Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justice SK Kaul.

The bench is likely to constitute a three-judge bench for hearing as many as 14 appeals filed against the 2010 Allahabad High Court judgement, delivered in four civil suits, that the 2.77-acre land be partitioned equally among three parties - the Sunni Waqf Board, the Nirmohi Akhara and Ram Lalla.

The apex court on 29 October had fixed the matter in the first week of January before an ""appropriate bench"", which will decide the schedule of hearing.

5. Federal Front to Shape up Post Lok Sabha Polls

Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) president and Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is consulting leaders of several regional parties to see if they are interested in forming the Federal Front.

The formation of such a Federal Front would be possible only after the general election next year. At present there are two Fronts at national level -- the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) led by the Congress.

Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu is trying to unite all anti-BJP parties at national level to fight the BJP in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections. But Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is trying to form his Federal Front at national level to fight both the BJP and the Congress.

The mother of a Dalit girl who was set on fire by unidentified men last week near her village on Agra's outskirts and died a day later, sat on fast in front of her home on Monday, 24 December, demanding the immediate arrest of the accused.

""The police are trying to divert attention from the crime to my family disputes because they are not being able to crack the case. Politicians and officers are visiting my house every day with tall promises and financial support but none can tell us who killed my daughter,"" the mother, a widow, told reporters.

""I went hungry to give my daughter a good education. I have not cooked anything since the day she was set on fire. My two little kids are hungry but the politicians who visit my house demand water from me. How can I give them water?"" she said.

The dead girl, a Class X student, had two younger siblings, a brother and a sister.

7. Single Standard Rate of GST Ultimate Aim: Jaitley

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday, 24 December hinted that the country may eventually have a single standard rate of GST through merging of 12 and 18 percent slabs, adding that the 28 per cent slab will soon be phased out, except in case of luxury and ""sin goods"".

He said the country should eventually have a Goods and Services Tax structure which would have only slabs of zero and 5 percent and a standard rate, with luxury and ""sin goods"" as an exception.

""A future roadmap could well be to work towards a single standard rate instead of two standard rates of 12 and 18 percent. It could be a rate at some mid-point. Obviously, this will take some reasonable time when the tax will rise significantly,"" Jaitley said in a Facebook post.

8. PM Modi Takes Jibe at Odisha Govt, Says Demon of Corruption Strong in State

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, 24 December, lashed out at the Odisha government led by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik over the lack of development in the state at a public meeting at the foothill of the historic Barunei hill near Khurda.

The PM, who was in the state today to inaugurate the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Bhubaneswar and a slew of other projects, said that the ""demon of corruption"" has become very strong in the state.

Addressing a massive gathering of supporters of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the PM said, ""Who is feeding the demon [of corruption]? The demon of corruption has grown in chit fund, PC [percentage commission] culture... The truth of Odisha's development is not hidden. Farmers, women are raising their voice.""

Attacking the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) government, the PM asked why Odisha has not yet joined the Centre's healthcare schemes such as Ayushman Bharat and PM's Jan Arogya Scheme.

9. BJP Moves SC Over Bengal Yatra, Hearing in Early Jan

West Bengal BJP moved the Supreme Court on Monday, 24 December seeking protection of its political right to hold state-wide 'Save Democracy' 'yatras', permission for which was declined by the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress government.

The state BJP challenged the TMC government's decision to deny permission for 'Ganatantra Bachao Yatras', which were scheduled to start in three phases from three different locations to touch all 42 Lok Sabha constituencies, before the Calcutta HC.

A single judge bench had quashed the state's decision to deny permission on 20 December but a day later, a division bench tossed back the state's appeal to the single judge bench and requested it to examine the adequacy of material given by the state for denying permission.

BJP moved the SC through advocate Mahesh Agrawal, who told TOI that the court had agreed to hear the petition in the first week of January.

The HRD Ministry has revived plans of setting up its own school board for 'Ved Vidya' (vedic education), The Indian Express has learnt.

HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar hinted at this in his recorded message played before an audience at the inauguration of a residential school in Baruipur, West Bengal, last week. In his message, Javadekar stressed the need for imparting education with a mix of knowledge from the Vedas and modern education. He added that the government is working on setting up a school board to achieve this.

As first reported by The Indian Express on May 23, 2016, the HRD Ministry, then under Smriti Irani, had moved a proposal to set up its own school board for 'Ved Vidya', after rejecting a similar proposal moved by yoga guru Ramdev in 2015.

The proposal was submitted by the Haridwar-based Vedic Education Research Institute (VERI) run by Ramdev's Patanjali Yogpeeth. As per this plan, VEB, run and controlled by VERI, would allow affiliated schools to offer a blend of the traditional gurukul system and modern curriculum.

Advertising

This proposal was red-flagged by the then school education secretary S C Khuntia on the ground that the state's sanction for a private board would open the doors for similar requests from other unrecognised school boards.

After Ramdev's submission was shot down, the ministry quietly scripted plans for setting up its own board for vedic schools. However, this too was put on the backburner for two years, until it was revived in May."

The meeting was held to discuss, and subsequently announce, the much-awaited seat-sharing arrangement in the state for next year's Lok Sabha polls.

Low-key Affair

With both National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval and Union Home Secretary Rajiv Guaba missing from the event, the Intelligence Bureau (IB) lecture was a low-key affair. Union minister Nitin Gadkari, the keynote speaker, was accompanied by MoS (Home) Hansraj Ahir. In the past, the NSA and the Home Secretary have been part of the annual lecture series.

Reasoned Approach

Instead of confronting the government, the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) have lately adopted a more collaborative approach to resolve their disagreements with the HRD Ministry. This was evident two weeks ago when all IIM directors, in a meeting with the Higher Education Secretary, collectively urged the HRD Ministry to intervene on their behalf with the Finance Ministry on revenue authorities charging service tax on their programmes even after implementation of the IIM Act. In the meeting, the IIMs also requested the ministry to reconsider its stand on the entry criteria for BTech students seeking direct admission for PhD programmes.

Indian Union Muslim League State president Panakkad Hyderali Shihab Thangal on Monday came down heavily against the Sangh Parivar for its alleged attempts to undermine the Constitution, its secular values and its diversity.

Addressing a mammoth rally, organised by the Youth League to mark the valedictory of the of the one-month long youth yatra led by its president Munavarali Shihab Thangal here, the IUML supremo said protecting the rights of all sections of society was the very basis of democracy and unless minority communities felt safe, democracy would remain incomplete.

""India had secured its position in the comity of nations because it steadfastly upheld democracy, secularism and tolerance. The founding fathers of the nation had given shape to the Constitution to ensure that this vision was protected for all times to come. But the Sangh Parivar was trying to wreck the Constitution and undermine its diversity.

The weakening of secular values in a land which had been enriched by religious diversity is a matter of great concern,"" he said.

The Youth March, led by Munavarali Thangal, set off from Kasargod on November 26 on foot purportedly against communalism and the cult of political violence.

The capital city was choked on Monday with the Youth League lining up its 15,000 strong 'White Guards,' a voluntary organisation set up for relief work during disasters, for its valedictory.

The public rally began from the Museum junction and concluded at the Central Stadium next to the State secretariat.

Mr. Hyderali Shihab Thangal alleged that the Centre was interfering in the functioning of courts and making the functioning of parliament and legislatures farcical. People were being liquidated in the name of their food habits, beliefs, and dress. Killing people and protecting animals had nothing to do with politics or patriotism and it was nothing but fascism only, he said and called for a common platform that would express the sentiments of all sections of the people.

The Assembly elections results from five states has come as a great comfort and reflected how the country was thinking, he said.

Puducherry Chief Minister V. Narayana Swami was the chief guest, while Karnataka Medical Education and Water Resources Minister D. K. Shivakumar delivered the keynote address.

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, IUML all-India general secretary P. K. Kunhalikutty, IUML leaders Panakkad Sayyed Saddiqueali Shihab Thangal, E. T. Mohammed Basheer, K.P.A. Majeed, M.K.

In its first ever performance audit of 11 central universities the Human Resource Development (HRD) ministry on December 15, asked them to address their individual gaps -- by focusing on employment oriented courses in some cases; strengthening infrastructure in others; and hiring faculty, administrative officers, and statutory functionaries in still others.

""The ministry, UGC [the University Grants Commission, which regulates higher education] and the central varsities signed memorandums of understanding [MOUs] regarding key parameters [for the assessment] earlier this year,"" a government official said on condition of anonymity. ""This was the first review on the basis of these parameters. The universities have drawn a roadmap about the areas in which their performance needs to be improved.""

The vice-chancellors of central universities of Gujarat, Jharkhand, Kashmir, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, Orissa, Sikkim participated in the review. So did the heads of North-Eastern Hill University, Indira Gandhi National Tribal University (Madhya Pradesh) Mahatma Gandhi Central University in Bihar's Motihari and Guru Ghasidas Vishwavidyalaya or GGV (Chhattisgarh).

The official said the vice-chancellors made presentations at the December 15 meeting. Suggestions regarding the areas in which more was required were made after the presentations, he added. ""For instance, some of the universities have not filled up key posts like that of registrars or controller of examinations... [They] have been asked to do so."" The secretary (higher education) R Subramanyam and UGC chief D P Singh were there at the review.

The official added the GGV was asked to fill up statutory posts such as that of the controller of examination and the finance officer and to also focus on starting vocational courses. The focus was on the need to start employment-oriented courses in case of Ranchi's Central University of Jharkhand too. Dharamshala's Central University of Himachal Pradesh was asked to appoint key officials such as the librarian and a financial officer. The utilisation of a new campus was discussed in the case of the Central University of Kashmir.

The MOUs regarding the review signed with the varsities include 14 performance parameters, output targets and programmes of work.

The official said 39 central universities have signed such agreements. ""There will be a review of the remaining varsities as well. The varsities will be asked to set their own targets and then the progress can be followed up in consultations with them.""

The Delhi University is the only institution among the 40 central varsities under the UGC's purview that has not signed the pact yet. It is yet to get its executive committee approve the signing of the MoU.

Former UGC member Inder Mohan Kapahy called the review essential and desirable. ""However, it is to be recognised that central universities differ widely in terms of resources, history, accessibility, ready availability of competent academic and administrative personnel.

Ramdev's schools to be first beneficiary.

New Delhi: Yoga guru Baba Ramdev's long-drawn struggle to secure official recognition for Vedic schools and gurukuls is set to end soon, as the Modi government is ready with a Vedic Board along the lines of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).

The board will be in charge of granting affiliation to Vedic schools and gurukuls, apart from creating more such schools. The syllabus at a Vedic school is a mix of the traditional and the modern, comprising of Indian scriptures, Vedas, Upanishads apart from basic mathematics, economics and languages among others.

There are many such schools in India almost all of which are unregulated.

Sources in the Human Resource Development (HRD) Ministry said the guidelines for the board's functioning have been finalised and will be released soon.

""Apart from granting affiliation to existing Vedic schools, the board's mandate would also be to set up more schools that impart modern education along with teaching Vedas to students,"" said a source familiar with the development.

""The plan has been finalised but the government is cautious in releasing it at this time because of the upcoming elections.""

Sources in the ministry also said that Ramdev's schools will be the first ones to get affiliation under the board, likely to be functional from the 2019 academic year.

Ramdev had been pushing for a separate board for Vedic schools since 2015 after he decided to open a chain of gurukuls across the country. He and his team had also held consultations with the HRD Ministry to suggest ways in which the board can be formulated.

Ramdev runs Acharyakulam, a residential Vedic school for students between classes 5 and 12 at Haridwar. He plans to establish 700 such schools across the country that will follow the Acharyakulam model.

""Swamiji (Baba Ramdev) was trying for this for a very long time and finally the government has agreed to his opinion. He gave a number of representations to the government to prove the need of such schools in the Indian education system,"" Acharya Balkrishna, Ramdev's aide and business partner told ThePrint.

""Ten schools are already working presently, one in Ranchi will take off from the next academic session.""

The HRD Ministry had started working on the board in 2016 but the project was shelved after certain objections from the then secretary, education, S.C. Khuntia, who pointed out that establishing a board would open the doors to corruption in the school education sector, sources in the ministry said.

It was revived in May after HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar discussed the setting up of the board at the 'Virat Gurukul Sammelan' where the RSS top brass and other BJP leaders had gathered. Just two days ago, on 22 December, Javadekar announced the plan during the inauguration of a school at Baruipur in West Bengal.

""We want to create a board that imparts education with a mix of knowledge from the Vedas and modern education. We are working towards creating a board that can do this,"" the minister said.

A central government panel had earlier this year suggested that children studying in madrasas and Vedic schools should be considered ""out of school"". This was one of the major suggestions that emerged in the report of the Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE) sub-committee, which was submitted to the ministry. The CABE is the largest decision-making body on all matters related to education.

There are a large number of children attending unrecognised schools/institutions, which may or may not provide regular education. Children attending all such institutions like Vedic pathshalas, gompas, madrasas should be considered 'out of school', the report had said. The committee was headed by former MoS HRD Upendra Kushwaha.

Setting up of a separate Vedic Board will also help such schools in getting recognition."

The Class 12 board examination will start on February 15 and conclude on April 3 while the Class 10 board examination will commence from February 21 and end on March 29.

In a notification issued with the date sheet, the board said that it has tried to give students sufficient time between the exams of important subjects and kept in mind that dates of competitive examinations may not coincide with the boards examinations. The board further said that it has also taken care of the Delhi University admission schedule, as per orders of the Delhi high court, while preparing the board exams schedule.

However, students across India gave a mixed reaction, when HT asked them how satisfied they were with the boards examination date sheet released on Sunday.

Lucknow

In Lucknow, a number of CBSE students expressed unhappiness over the examination date sheet for examination. They were a little surprised with the date sheet and said that the gaps given in between the two difficult papers were far too less.

Swaraj Tiwari, a student of Class 12 at the GD Goenka Public School said in her opinion this year the date sheet was quite a surprise. ""As a student who has taken humanities with maths there will be no gap between my two major subjects, that is math and political science,"" says Swaraj. However, Swaraj believes that challenges such as these are essential and will prepare her for the challenges ahead and therefore welcomed the date sheet with open hands.

Pratyush Singh a Class 12 student of the same school said, ""The first core subject exam has been scheduled on March 2 for English and this would be fine as we can prepare ourselves well in advance. The second exam of physics is scheduled on March 5. I feel that we should have been given at least five days to prepare because physics is a vast subject and needs time. The fourth exam of Biology is scheduled on March 15. Here I feel that the gap is quite short and we would have to work a bit faster to prepare"".

""The fifth exam is of math is scheduled on March 18. In this exam I feel students would not find it difficult to prepare as there is enough gap for them, but for PCMB students the gap could have been a bit longer. The physical education paper has been scheduled for March 30 and I feel this gap could be shortened as it would not take so many days to prepare for physical education. The main concern is of the physics paper since the gap will not be enough to prepare the subject,"" he said.

Avinash Nair of Class 12 said being a PCM with physical education, he found it quite outrageous that CBSE gave them about a week to prepare for both chemistry and mathematics, and almost two weeks for physical education, but only two days for physics.

""We all know that physics is a very technical subject. This year, we have 15 chapters to prepare in physics, each one requiring some kind of detail, skill or special attention to it. Even if he has studied before, a mere two days is most definitely not enough to even revise the massive syllabus of the subject, let alone go through it thoroughly,"" said this student of GD Goenka Public School.

Bhopal

CBSE students from Bhopal mostly expressed satisfaction over the time table of the exams released by the board on Sunday.

A class 10 student Nandita Gaur said, ""We are happy with release of exam schedule eight weeks before exam. Now we will prepare accordingly.""

A class 12 science stream student Anurag Chauhan said, ""CBSE has given sufficient time between two consecutive papers to reduce pressure. I am satisfied with the time table.""

A Class 12 commerce student Abdul Sami said, ""I didn't see any flaw in the schedule. Now, we can start preparation accordingly.""

Sahoday group state secretary PK Pathak said, ""CBSE did commendable job by giving ample time to students for the preparation. The gaps are also sufficient.""

Chandigarh

Simran Singh, a student studying in Government Model Senior Secondary School, Chandigarh said, ""I think the date sheet of the board exams is fine, however, we were not expecting the exams this early. Usually exams start in March. It's very unusual.

Madhur Vaidya, a student in KBDAV sector 7, said, ""I am very nervous, especially for exams of Maths and science. This year there's hardly any time for preparing. Its December and within a month we have our board exams.""

Manpreet, a student of Government Model School Maloya said, ""This year there is not even a single gap between exams of political science and mathematics. I am worried how will students who have arts and mathematics as combination will study these, for Class 12.""

Kunal Kumar, another student of Government Model Senior Secondary School, Sector 37 said, ""I am very confident, I know I will pass.""

Prayagraj

Many students may have reached out to CBSE for rescheduling the Class 12 exam dates for biology, chemistry and physics and a few other examinations but many students in Prayagraj consider the time table to be perfect.

Saumya Maniyar, a Class 12 student of MPVM Ganga Gurukulam School said that she considers two days gap between chemistry and biology to be ideal.

""The chemistry exam is scheduled for March 12 and the Biology exam is on March 15, which is fine by me. This ensures that you remain in the rhythm of studies and the exam. The tightly spaced exam also means that the entire exercise gets over in a shorter period of time and someone like me can start preparing for the competitive exams like NEET set to be held on May 5, 2019.""

She maintained that most of her friends too were happy with the board exam schedule.

Navneeta Nandan, a Class 12 (commerce) student is also satisfied with her board exam schedule. ""My exams kick off on March 2, 2019 with English and would conclude on March 28 with my optional paper of IT. I have got good gap between my business studies paper on March 14 and next paper economics on March 27. As a result, for IT I have got no gap but the 12-day gap between business studies and economics exams gives my adequate time to revise IT,"" she maintained.

Navneeta also said that the fact that the exam gets over in a month, gives her adequate time to prepare for her college entrance exams that would start from May end or so. This would give students like her enough time to battle for a college or university of their choice.

Laxmi Mishra and Abhas Singh, both Class 10 students of MPVM Ganga Gurukulam school said that their exams were starting on February 21 and ending on March 29 and all subject exams have gap od a day or two, which was enough. ""The fact that the exams would get over in just a month, has all of us smiling,"" they held.

Jharkhand

Gayatri Kumari, a Class 10 student of DAV Public School Tenughat (Bokaro) said, ""Propone of the examination came as setback for us, as we were thinking that the examination would be held in March. Now, we have the pressure to complete the syllabus at the earliest. Early examination could impact our papers.""

Priyanka Kumar, a Class 12 student of DAV Public School, Sindri (Dhanbad), said, ""Now, we have to work hard for the examination. We were preparing keeping the target of March. But, we have to devote more time on revision to match the gap.""

Some students of Class 10 and Class 12 said CBSE should have announced the examination date sheet two or three months before so that students get time for revision.

DAV, Sindri principal, Ashutosh Mairh said, ""Now, we have bigger challenge to prepare the students for the examinations. Students are not psychologically ready for the examination in February. We have to make them mentally prepared so that they could appear fearlessly.""

Bihar

Neha Verma a Class 12 student of Notre Dame Academy, Patna said, ""My combination is PCBM and there is only two days gap between English and physics and in between biology and math. Physics and math are tough papers and we need more time to revise. However there is a gap of 11 days for physical education paper which is useless.""

Ask her if she has raised any objection on this, she says, ""Every year some or the other objection is raised by the students when the date sheet is out and nothing changes. So I think it is a waste of time to hope that anything will change now."""

The new regulations, once implemented, will make it mandatory for them to resolve complaints by students within 15 days of receiving them. The latest draft of UGC (Grievance Redressal) Regulations 2018 has now been put online for feedback from the public.

According to the existing system which follows UGC (Grievance Redressal) Regulations 2012, all higher education institutes are required to appoint an ombudsman for redressing grievances of students. But, according to complaints received by UGC, most institutes either do not have an ombudsman or if they have, they are appointed against the eligibility criteria.

""No university has an ombudsman as mandated by UGC. However, most of them have their own grievance redressal cells,"" said Mangat Sharma, principal secretary, Higher Education Department. He said the State government has approached the Vice-Chancellors of reputed universities to formulate feedback, that will be submitted through the State government.

""We have our own grievance redressal unit. There are different committees, each that handle sexual harassment, ragging and other kinds of issues. We also have a dean of students and dean of faculty, in order to channelise grievances,"" said a senior official from Anna University. He, however, refused to comment on the varsity's stance on the draft regulations.

However, much to the relief of higher education institutions, UGC has done away with the most controversial aspect of the regulation that the ombudsman has to be a retired district judge or above in rank. The latest draft policy advocates that this person now can be a retired VC or registrar or a faculty with 10 years of experience as professor. The norms also say there would be four-level grievance redressal panels.

Students can use the regulations to flag a variety of issues, including irregularity in admission process, non-publication of prospectus or furnishing false, misleading information in prospectus, withholding certificates and documents of students, demanding money in excess of what is prescribed in prospectus, non-payment or delayed payment of scholarship, breach of reservation policy, delay in conducting examination or publishing result and unfair evaluation practices.

In case of non-compliance of the regulation, UGC can withdraw 12B status, withhold any grant allotted to the institutions, declare the institution ineligible for consideration for any assistance, inform the general public declaring that the institution does not possess the minimum standards for redress of grievances, and recommend for withdrawal of affiliation."

As many as 65 top US universities, including Harvard and MIT, have challenged the Trump administration in a court against its new stringent visa policy for foreign students, warning that the new 'backdating' rule will have a detrimental effect on America's higher education system.

The new policy announced by the Trump administration in August places restrictions on overstaying a visa.

Under longstanding immigration policies, when an individual is no longer authorised to remain in the US such as when a visa expires a period of ""unlawful presence"" begins. After six months of unlawful presence, an individual can be forced to return to their country of origin and subject to a three year bar from the US.

Prior to the August policy change, individuals only began to accrue unlawful presence the day after the government issued an official determination that the visa holder was ""out of status"".

With the new rules, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can set retroactive start dates for unlawful presence that begin the day after an individual's degree programme is complete or the day after a person's visa expires.

The top institutions, including Harvard, MIT, Cornell, Yale, and Princeton signed onto an amicus brief filed Monday, arguing that the new rule puts visa-holding students in a position to make ""tough choices"".

These institutions argue that the new policy's use of a ""backdated unlawful-presence clock"" will render tens of thousands of F, J and M categories of visa holders subject to three and 10-year re-entry bars without any opportunity to cure.

According to the National Association of Foreign Student Advisors (NAFSA), international students contributed USD 39 billion to the US economy during the 2017-2018 academic year.

The same study found the economic activity of foreign students supported over 455,000 American jobs.

The 65 institutions and one higher education system Board, mostly member institutions of the Presidents' Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, signed the brief which urges the federal court to grant them motion for a preliminary injunction.

The brief explains that the new 'backdating' rule introduces considerable uncertainty into the calculation of unlawful presence and needlessly exposes international students to devastating reentry bans.

""The new rule will harm international students and scholars, as well as institutions which host them,"" it said.

It notes the new backdating rule by US Citizenship and Immigration Services will likely result in fewer international students, scholars and instructors contributing to the communities.

The brief supports Guilford College, et al in its lawsuit against US Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen M Nielsen et al. It was filed in the US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina.

""International students and scholars are vital members of our campus communities and important contributors to our nation,"" said John J DeGioia, Georgetown University President and Presidents' Alliance Steering Committee Member.

""The talents, perspectives, insights and passion to serve our world that they bring our campus communities benefits our nation and contributes to the common good that we all share,"" he said.

The brief argues that a 10 per cent rise in the ratio of foreign graduate students to total graduate students results in a 5.1 per cent increase in patent grants.

International students and scholars also continue to contribute to the US economy beyond their periods of enrolment.

For example, in a study of American startup companies valued at USD 1 billion or more, it was found that nearly one quarter of such businesses had a founder who first came to the United States as an international student, it said.

The backdating rule introduces significant uncertainty and punishes students for reasons that are frequently beyond the students' control.

In some cases, students and exchange visitors can fall out-of-status due to unwitting clerical and technical errors, often of someone else's making, the brief said.

In many cases, the infraction will not be discovered (or determined, as the F, M, and J regulations are not always clear and may be subject to varying interpretations) until the individual reapplies for another immigration benefit, such as an optional practical training allowance or an H-1B visa, it said.

""A ban, in turn, could have devastating immediate consequences for a student's course of study and would outright bar the student from reentering the US for any reason even for business purposes, or to see a child for a period of year,"" the brief said, adding that the new rule will diminish US' ability to compete for international students and scholars.

This decline in international student enrolment and in engagement with international researchers and professors will have a detrimental effect on the system of higher education in the United States.

Mysuru, December 24:- ""The education culture that we have in India can't be seen anywhere in the world. It has to be protected,"" said titular king of Mysuru, Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar.

He was speaking at the 20th annual day of Annappaiah Memorial Education Institution, Bhyraveshwara Primary and High School at Hebbal on Monday.

""Once Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar was going to Bengaluru from Mysuru and the railway crosssing gate was closed near Bidadi. Then the car driver asked the gate-keeper to open the gate as the king was going to Bengaluru. He had told that he would open the gate for the king of Mysuru after his king (train) passes. The driver said the same to the king. Hearing this, the king (Nalwadi) appreciated the gate-keeper and awarded him for his commitment towards work. When a woman complained to the king about a bus conductor scolding her, the king reprimanded the conductor and made him give change to the woman,"" Yaduveer recalled.

Yaduveer Wadiyar was felicitated by the organisation on the occasion.

Modi, who had sounded the bugle for the upcoming elections during his last visit to the State on September 22, is slated to visit Odisha twice in January.

""The PM will visit Baripada on January 5 followed by another trip to Balangir on January 16 where he will address two public meetings,"" BJP national general secretary and Odisha in-charge Arun Singh said. However, tour details of the PM for the January 5 and 16 visits are yet to be finalised, he said.

Asserting that winds of change are blowing across the State ahead of 2019 polls, Singh said, ""Ouster of Naveen Patnaik Government and formation of BJP Government in Odisha is certain. Nothing can stop the BJP from coming to power in the State.""

Undeterred by the setbacks to BJP in the three Hindi heartland States, Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said the party chose the foothills of Barunei as the venue for the PM's meeting symbolically to begin its fight for the rights of people of the State.

""The Paikas rebelled against the British rule 200 years back. The BJP will start its fight against the 19 years of misrule of Naveen Patnaik Government from this historic venue,"" Pradhan said.

He said the PM will unveil several infrastructure projects worth Rs 14,500 crore in line with his vision of 'Purbodaya' - a prosperous East for building a new India.

Recalling Modi's speeches during his 2014 election campaign, Pradhan said the former's idea of a new India would not be possible without the development of eastern States. Keeping his promise, the PM had sanctioned a large number of projects for Odisha besides providing generous financial assistance for all-round development of the State.

The Union Minister said Modi's visit on Monday will be followed by party's national president Amit Shah's trip to the State. Top leaders of the BJP including Union Ministers Rajnath Singh, Nitin Gadkari, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and others are scheduled to visit Odisha in coming months to take the BJP's fight against BJD to a decisive position.

During his brief visit on Monday, the PM will dedicate the new campus of IIT-Bhubaneswar at Arugul to the nation and launch a slew of projects in higher education, health, road and highways and culture via video conferencing."

As many as 65 top US universities, including Harvard and MIT, have challenged the Trump administration in a court against its new stringent visa policy for foreign students, warning that the new 'backdating' rule will have a detrimental effect on America's higher education system.

The new policy announced by the Trump administration in August places restrictions on overstaying a visa.

Under longstanding immigration policies, when an individual is no longer authorised to remain in the US -- such as when a visa expires -- a period of ""unlawful presence"" begins. After six months of unlawful presence, an individual can be forced to return to their country of origin and subject to a three year bar from the US.

Prior to the August policy change, individuals only began to accrue unlawful presence the day after the government issued an official determination that the visa holder was ""out of status"".

With the new rules, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can set retroactive start dates for unlawful presence that begin the day after an individual's degree programme is complete or the day after a person's visa expires.

The top institutions, including Harvard, MIT, Cornell, Yale, and Princeton signed onto an amicus brief filed Monday, arguing that the new rule puts visa-holding students in a position to make ""tough choices"".

These institutions argue that the new policy's use of a ""backdated unlawful-presence clock"" will render tens of thousands of F, J and M categories of visa holders subject to three and 10-year re-entry bars without any opportunity to cure.

According to the National Association of Foreign Student Advisors (NAFSA), international students contributed USD 39 billion to the US economy during the 2017-2018 academic year.

The same study found the economic activity of foreign students supported over 455,000 American jobs.

The 65 institutions and one higher education system Board, mostly member institutions of the Presidents' Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, signed the brief which urges the federal court to grant them motion for a preliminary injunction.

The brief explains that the new 'backdating' rule introduces considerable uncertainty into the calculation of unlawful presence and needlessly exposes international students to devastating reentry bans.

""The new rule will harm international students and scholars, as well as institutions which host them,"" it said.

It notes the new backdating rule by US Citizenship and Immigration Services will likely result in fewer international students, scholars and instructors contributing to the communities.

The brief supports Guilford College, et al in its lawsuit against US Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen M Nielsen et al. It was filed in the US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina.

""International students and scholars are vital members of our campus communities and important contributors to our nation,"" said John J DeGioia, Georgetown University President and Presidents' Alliance Steering Committee Member.

""The talents, perspectives, insights and passion to serve our world that they bring our campus communities benefits our nation and contributes to the common good that we all share,"" he said.

The brief argues that a 10 per cent rise in the ratio of foreign graduate students to total graduate students results in a 5.1 per cent increase in patent grants.

International students and scholars also continue to contribute to the US economy beyond their periods of enrolment.

For example, in a study of American startup companies valued at USD 1 billion or more, it was found that nearly one quarter of such businesses had a founder who first came to the United States as an international student, it said.

The backdating rule introduces significant uncertainty and punishes students for reasons that are frequently beyond the students' control.

In some cases, students and exchange visitors can fall out-of-status due to unwitting clerical and technical errors, often of someone else's making, the brief said.

In many cases, the infraction will not be discovered (or determined, as the F, M, and J regulations are not always clear and may be subject to varying interpretations) until the individual reapplies for another immigration benefit, such as an optional practical training allowance or an H-1B visa, it said.

""A ban, in turn, could have devastating immediate consequences for a student's course of study and would outright bar the student from reentering the US for any reason -- even for business purposes, or to see a child -- for a period of year,"" the brief said, adding that the new rule will diminish US' ability to compete for international students and scholars.

This decline in international student enrolment and in engagement with international researchers and professors will have a detrimental effect on the system of higher education in the United States.

""As of today international students continue to make this country the global leader in higher education, but the gap is closing. The United States' 'market share has dropped from 23 per cent in 2000 to 16 per cent in 2012' with China, Canada, Britain and Russia all vying for the same pool of talent,"" it said."

AMN / Jalandhar

ON the occasion of 95th birthday of Justice Rajindar Sachar, Socialist Party organized a one-day seminar on 22 December 2018, on the topic 'How to Save Constitutional Institutions and Values?' in Jalandhar city of Punjab.

Citizens from different parts of Punjab reached Jalandhar to pay their homage to Justice Sachar on this occasion.

The seminar was inaugurated by Dr. Prem Singh, president, Socialist Party. In his inaugural address, he said that neither the secularism nor the democracy can be saved by sacrificing the value of the socialism which is enshrined in the Constitution of India.

By adopting the New Economic Policies in 1991, the political and intellectual leadership of the country had dropped the constitutional value of socialism. With this, the path of corporate politics was cleared in the country. Constitutional values of secularism and democracy cannot be saved without correcting this blunder. To save the constitutional institutions too, the re-establishment of socialism and send-off of neo-liberalism is a necessity. Because these constitutional institutions were not set up to serve the private sector. Dr. Singh conveyed to the audience that the Socialist Party will organize seminars and discussions on the topics of education, constitution and mutual brotherhood in the small towns and cities of the country in the memory of its three late leaders - Bhai Vaidya, Rajindar Sachar and Kuldip Nayar. In this series, party's next program will be held in Indore in the memory of Bhai Vaidya and in the memory of Kuldip Nayar in Amritsar.

Chief guest/speaker at the program, ND Pancholi, vice president, PUCL, paid tribute to Justice Sachar remembering his unwavering loyalty to the Constitution. He told that PUCL and PUDR filed petition in the Delhi High Court on the 1984 Sikh massacre. Justice Sachar issued a notice to the government to respond to the questions posed in the petition. But the bench of hearing of the petition was changed and the High Court dismissed the petition. The Supreme Court did the same. Pancholi underlined the serious crisis to the constitutional values and institutions particularly during the present regime. He specifically cited the Congress's 1931 Karachi convention, saying that the values of freedom struggle contributed to the Constitution of India. Those who opposed the struggle of independence, they are destroying most the constitutional institutions and values. He emphasized that the constitutional institutions and values can be saved by uniting the peoples' power all over the country.

Lohian thinker Prof. SS Chhina while addressing the seminar said that the rapid privatization of education and health is a direct violation of the constitutional institutions and values. There are 12 private universities in Punjab and out of these 3 are situated in Jalandhar itself. Prof. Jagmohan Singh, an exponent/activist of revolutionary socialist ideology, said that the slogan of socialism was first given by Bhagat Singh and his comrades. He emphasized on the awakening of the revolutionary spirit in order to save the constitutional values and institutions. Several citizens/civil society activists from the audiences also took part in the discussion and expressed their views on the topic.

Balwant Singh Kheda, senior vice president, Socialist Party, presided over the seminar. Harendra Singh Mansaia, president, Socialist Party, Punjab, welcomed the delegates/guests and general secretary Om Singh Satiyana conducted the proceedings of the seminar."

As many as 65 top US universities, including Harvard and MIT, have challenged the Trump administration in a court against its new stringent visa policy for foreign students, warning that the new 'backdating' rule will have a detrimental effect on America's higher education system.

The new policy announced by the Trump administration in August places restrictions on overstaying a visa.

Under longstanding immigration policies, when an individual is no longer authorised to remain in the US -- such as when a visa expires -- a period of 'unlawful presence' begins. After six months of unlawful presence, an individual can be forced to return to their country of origin and subject to a three year bar from the US.

Prior to the August policy change, individuals only began to accrue unlawful presence the day after the government issued an official determination that the visa holder was ""out of status"".

With the new rules, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can set retroactive start dates for unlawful presence that begin the day after an individual's degree programme is complete or the day after a person's visa expires.

The top institutions, including Harvard, MIT, Cornell, Yale, and Princeton signed onto an amicus brief filed on December 23, arguing that the new rule puts visa-holding students in a position to make ""tough choices"". These institutions argue that the new policy's use of a ""backdated unlawful-presence clock"" will render tens of thousands of F, J and M categories of visa holders subject to three and 10-year re-entry bars without any opportunity to cure.

According to the National Association of Foreign Student Advisors (NAFSA), international students contributed $39 billion to the US economy during the 2017-2018 academic year. The same study found the economic activity of foreign students supported over 455,000 American jobs.

The 65 institutions, one higher education system board, mostly member institutions of the Presidents' Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, signed the brief which urges the federal court to grant them motion for a preliminary injunction.

The brief explains that the new 'backdating' rule introduces considerable uncertainty into the calculation of unlawful presence and needlessly exposes international students to devastating re-entry bans. ""The new rule will harm international students and scholars, as well as institutions which host them,"" it said.

It notes the new backdating rule by US Citizenship and Immigration Services will likely result in fewer international students, scholars and instructors contributing to the communities. The brief supports Guilford College, et al., in its lawsuit against US Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen M. Nielsen et al. It was filed in the US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina.

""International students and scholars are vital members of our campus communities and important contributors to our nation,"" said John J. DeGioia, Georgetown University President and Presidents' Alliance Steering Committee Member. ""The talents, perspectives, insights and passion to serve our world that they bring our campus communities benefits our nation and contributes to the common good that we all share.""

The brief argues that a 10% rise in the ratio of foreign graduate students to total graduate students results in a 5.1% increase in patent grants. International students and scholars also continue to contribute to the US economy beyond their periods of enrolment.

The backdating rule introduces significant uncertainty and punishes students for reasons that are frequently beyond the students' control. In some cases, students and exchange visitors can fall out-of-status due to unwitting clerical and technical errors, often of someone else's making, the brief said.

In many cases, the infraction will not be discovered (or determined, as the F, M, and J regulations are not always clear and may be subject to varying interpretations) until the individual reapplies for another immigration benefit, such as an optional practical training allowance or an H-1B visa, it said.

""A ban, in turn, could have devastating immediate consequences for a student's course of study and would outright bar the student from reentering the US for any reason -- even for business purposes, or to see a child -- for a period of year,"" the brief said, adding that the new rule will diminish US' ability to compete for international students and scholars.

""As of today international students continue to make this country the global leader in higher education, but the gap is closing. The United States' 'market share has dropped from 23 % in 2000 to 16 % in 2012' with China, Canada, Britain and Russia all vying for the same pool of talent,"" it said."

The population of Bengaluru within the next couple of years will cross over two crore within the city municipal council limits, hence the current supply of water will come nowhere close to meeting the demands of the future.

Money is being demanded for the purpose of public education as well. He recommended solutions such as rainwater harvesting, purifying 60 per cent drainage water, reducing water leakages etc.

Health News, Nation, (New Delhi), December 24:-Physiotherapists at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) may soon be providing robot-assisted physical therapy to patients.

The physiotherapy department of the institute is soon going to procure this new technology for the early rehabilitation of patients. This announcement was made on Sunday on the concluding day of the seventh International Conference of Physical Therapy AIIMS 2018.

Attended by more than 600 delegates from different parts of India and abroad, the two-day conference was inaugurated by Minister of State for Health Ashwini Kumar Choubey on Saturday.

The participating dignitaries said the role of physiotherapists would be well defined under Ayushman Bharat as it is an integral part of the government's wellness programme.

Choubey said the government will soon pass the Allied and Healthcare Professions Bill, 2018 and appealed the opposition to support it as the act would benefit lakhs of Indians.

Nirmal Kumar, organising secretary, said, ""With India's ever-growing aging population, it is inevitable for the physiotherapists to keep themselves abreast of latest trends and innovation while working with healthcare professionals and patients to provide best treatment for early rehabilitation.""

The aim of the conference was to stimulate collaboration between clinicians and academicians. Interactive scientific programmes and hands on workshops were conducted by renowned faculties from various fields of physiotherapy.

""The inclusion of robots in ICU's is set to be a game-changer especially for early rehabilitation of both upper and lower limbs of the patients,"" said Dr Prabhat Ranjan, senior physiotherapist, department of neurology, AIIMS.

He said people suffering from the after-effects of strokes, spinal cord injuries, trauma and other neurological and orthopaedic conditions would really benefit from the new technology and it will surely improve their physical, mental and sensory functions.

In developed countries, robotics is the latest tools in physical therapy and rehabilitation, Ranjan said.

Physiotherapists are quite upbeat after the cabinet approved the Allied and Healthcare Professions Bill, 2018 that seeks to regulate and standardise education, training and services of healthcare professionals including physiotherapists, he said.

Dr Sanjiv K Jha, president of Indian Association of Physiotherapists, said, ""The bill when it comes in force will regularise the system of registration, recognition, standard, quality of education in physiotherapy and will be able to check the unprofessional practice/quackery in physiotherapy by untrained professional.""

""We need a second independence movement. We have to clear the cobwebs in our own brain first,"" says Salil Shetty, former secretary-general of Amnesty International and previously director of the United Nations Millennium Campaign.

Back in India after spending most of the year as a fellow at Harvard University's Kennedy School, Shetty was in Mumbai last week to speak at IIT Bombay's Techfest on technology and freedoms for India's poor.

A graduate from the Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad and the London School of Economics, Shetty is a human rights campaigner with decades of experience.

In conversation with Rediff.com's Archana Masih, he discusses the anti-human rights discourse in the country and his plan to start a movement with India's youth, independent of religion or politics.

What have been the glaring examples of human rights violations in the last few years?

Encounter killings, lynchings, attack on civil society, silencing of the media, attempts to compromise the judiciary etc.

The thing we don't talk about is the highly discriminatory and ineffective criminal justice system.

Half a million people are in prison and 70% on detention without trial -- mostly Dalits, minorities. Two thirds are petty offenders.

It is a well known fact that even if you are not a criminal if you spend long years in jail you come out being one.

Rich people don't spend time in prison. The poor, low castes don't have money to pay for bail.

How has the State failed in protecting citizen rights?

The State's job is to protect people's human rights. Perpetrators in India are individuals, government, religious bodies and corporations.

Extractive corporations are worst because they function in the tribal belt. Greenpeace is constantly under attack in India because they raise their voice in the tribal belt.

If Greenpeace is attacked they fight back, but what when a Dalit or Muslim is attacked?

What are the challenges that human rights activists encounter that they did not face before?

The last few years has been exceptionally hard for human rights activists.

They are creating an anti-human rights discourse. The idea is to sow a seed of suspicion or doubt in those who are neutral.

We are in a desperate situation that need desperate measures. You have to campaign for the values you stand for and make people think hard before they cast their vote.

The killing of a police officer showed the impunity with which a mob could kill an officer of the law.

The Bulandshahr killing was exceptional. The killing of a police officer by Hindu fundamentalists which is in line with the current government's approach towards hypernationalism.

Hindutva politics is not new in this country, but these people have taken it to a different level.

The country needs urgent attention on more serious things -- education, health and water. The farmers, the poor in this country, are in a crisis and so much energy is going into all this.

Lynching is a major assault on human rights. How do you explain this phenomena because it is not only about the cow, but people have been lynched because they have been thought to be child lifters?

Once you open this can, then you lose control over it.

In UP over 1,000 encounter killings have taken place in nine months after Adityanath (Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Ajay Singh Bisht aka Yogi Adityanath) took over, which include 32 deaths.

If you ask people on the street they would probably say that something needed to be done as people are getting away with all sorts of crimes, so basically this leads to normalising such killings and actually makes it acceptable.

In a country that claims to be a democracy one has to follows due process even if that person has committed a crime.

People have lost faith in the mainstream system and are looking for shortcuts.

A couple of weeks after Human Rights Day, how do you see the situation in India today?

I left India in 1995. Twenty three years later what has changed and not can be classified into two -- freedom from want and freedom from fear.

Human rights is not one or the other. Often, people think of human rights as civil-political rights. There have been many important achievements and we shouldn't belittle them -- reduction in poverty, enrollment of girls.

Even on freedom from want, much as we have achieved, we are yet so far behind on global indices.

On the human development index, the most important human metric, when I left we were 139, we are still in the 130s out of 170, 180, in spite of this so-called macro economic growth.

Unfortunately, the trickle down logic has never worked in this country.

On the civil-political side -- I was in school when the Emergency was declared under Indira Gandhi. That was the fight of a lifetime. We thought we had won back all those freedoms.

It is the first time since then that we are seeing a flashback of that kind of behaviour.

Critics of that belief say you can freely criticise the PM which you could not do during the Emergency.

If we took the benchmark we can take away 1 or 2 differences, but there are far too many similarities. I hope we don't have to use 1975, 1976 as a benchmark!

The ambience is that you are not allowed to dissent in this country.

There is a systematic onslaught of trying to reframe what this country is about.

Has the human rights movement in India been marginalised? Are organisations not pushing hard enough like PUCL, PUDR did in the past?

It is being done systematically. India has never had a strong human rights NGO movement. It has had a few important ones. Each and every one has been under attack. They have managed to silence a lot of them.

I don't think human rights groups are not pushing for the cause of human rights, but they are small and weak to start with and have become even more smaller and weaker.

Anti-human rights narrative is much more mainstream, it is partly also global thanks to Trump.

Has the narrative of aggressive nationalism created a climate of hostility towards activists?

The mythology of ultra nationalism is that the only way they can create a Hindu identity is from a vote bank perspective. The only way to shore up your side is by having 'the other' who you can show as 'the other'.

Human rights organisations are a scapegoat to show that they are anti nationals and we are national -- and it seems to be working perfectly.

The question is: Can they sustain it?

You can't sustain a campaign of hate. You can't go on creating division and rhetoric of hate. It comes to roost. We are seeing the first glimpses of that in the state elections.

And it is not only about Hindutva. The violence against women -- rapes -- there are over 100 rapes a day of which more than one quarter are minors. The shocking part is that only one out of four cases lead to convictions.

What is the solution?

We need a second independence movement. A lot of independence is in our head. We have to clear the cobwebs in our own brain first.

There are people who are extreme right wing Hindutva and there are others who believe in the values of the Constitution, but there is a massive number in the middle that is totally confused, who can be pushed this way or that.

These are young, mostly educated, mostly unemployed and have a lot of frustration, anger so they are being pushed this way or that.

We have to work with them. It is a crucial moment for a pan India youth movement which is not political or religious -- for saving India.

How can ordinary Indians be more vocal about assaults on human rights? The Congress has also been silent on human rights violations.

Electoral politics can deliver only so much on fundamental, cultural and social change. It has to be an independent movement which has to attack frontally.

This country needs a youth movement not based on religion or politics but based on the ground of saving India.

What are the dangers to India's future by the attacks on minority human rights?

There are 200 million plus Muslims in India, the second largest Muslim country after Indonesia.

If you start attacking them through the NRC (the National Register of Citizens of India), lynchings, through commando TV channels, it is playing with fire.

What are your thoughts on the MeToo movement in India?

The status of women in India is a serious concern. I am delighted they are speaking up and all power to them. This is the tip of the iceberg. I don't know of a single woman who has not experienced this in India.

In the West it is 1/3rd of the women, here it is 100% who face sexual abuse. Imagine a MeToo movement of domestic workers -- if women start speaking up they will shake up the foundations of the country.

You can't let the State go scot-free in MeToo. It is also the State's responsibility to safeguard women.

The 24-year-old from Sangatpura village in Punjab's Patiala district had no clue that the morning of 11 December would change his life forever. At six in the morning that day, he woke up to the sudden death of his 45-year-old father, a farmer and village head, who drank pesticide while his mother was getting the tea ready. The father had run up a debt of ₹40 lakh following several years of losses in farming and dairy businesses, and a failed attempt to find Singh a job in Dubai, which cost nearly ₹14 lakh.

Singh, who holds a master's degree in history, returned from Dubai after a 11-month wait to find a driver's job and took to farming. He now gets up at four in the morning. The nights go by worrying how the family land mortgaged to banks can be freed. After a hard day's work tending to the cattle and the wheat crop, his eyes swell up by evening. Singh repeatedly grasps his hair while speaking. ""I am hoping my (younger) brother will find a job... but that may not be enough to pay back the arthiya (commission agents in wholesale markets who advance credit to farmers).""

Since April last year, eight state governments, including Punjab, have announced a staggering ₹1.9 trillion in farm loan waivers. However, no relief has reached the Singh family so far. In June 2017, the newly elected Punjab government led by Amarinder Singh of the Congress approved a farm loan waiver package estimated to cost ₹10,000 crore. However, a year and a half later, just a fraction of farmers has benefited because of the strict conditions put up by the state.

Exactly a week after the death of Singh's father, on 18 December, Congress president Rahul Gandhi upped the ante against Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Gandhi said he would not let Modi sleep till the centre announced a nationwide farm loan waiver. Gandhi cited the example of newly-elected state governments led by the Congress in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, which signed on farm loan waiver schemes within hours of taking charge, in line with the party's pre-poll promise, and said that the Congress would announce a national farm loan waiver scheme if the party were voted to power in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

The Punjab experience, however, does not inspire confidence. Till date, ₹3,500 crore loans of 428,000 farmers have been waived, according to Jasbir Singh Bains, director of agriculture in the state government. The farm loan waiver has covered less than a fifth of the 2.6 million farmers in Punjab. The total disbursal is just 35% of the promised ₹10,000 crore.

""During the election campaign, Amarinder Singh promised to waive loans of all farmers, but a set of conditions imposed during the rollout ensured that most were left out,"" said Jagmohan Singh, state general secretary of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, Dakaunda, a farmers' group.

The conditions for availing the farm loan waiver make little sense in a state like Punjab where the average landholding is more than three times the national average. For instance, according to the agriculture census released this year, the average landholding in Punjab is 3.6 hectares (ha), but the state government decided to waive loans up to ₹2 lakh for only small and marginal farmers, who own up to 2ha. This ensured that farmers like Jagdeep Singh, whose family owns 2.4ha, were excluded.

There's more. The conditions say that only those loans taken by small farmers (who own between 1-2ha) will be waived where the principal and interest overdue did not exceed ₹2 lakh. This meant that a 1.5ha farmer, who owed banks even a rupee over ₹2 lakh, was excluded.

""With costs of farming going up and returns plunging, a waiver of ₹2 lakh means little to us; we will be back to where we are in no time,"" said Nirmal Singh, a farmer from Narmana village in Patiala's Nabha block. ""But this farm loan waiver is more a formality and less a reality... it's like luring a hungry child with a toffee and then taking it back,"" he smirked.

A crowd of farmers gathered around Nirmal Singh complained that as most families did not divide their land between members (say, a 3ha farm is still shared by the father and an adult son and his family), the waiver has eluded them.

In retrospect, the Punjab farm loan waiver scheme appears skilfully designed to exclude more farmers than those included, driven by the lack of fiscal space to deliver on the poll promise (in August last year, the chief minister requested the centre that it be allowed a one-time exemption from the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2013, which restricts its borrowing to a maximum of 3% of state gross domestic product or just ₹12,819 crore, so that it can implement the debt relief scheme).

For the once-prosperous farmer in Punjab, the cradle of India's Green Revolution, a debt of ₹15-20 lakh is common and debts of more than ₹40 lakh in a single family are not unheard of. While part of this is driven by the need to keep up with societal pressures -- such as spending ₹25 lakh on a daughter's marriage -- the debt crisis deepened as a result of commercial banks flushing farmers with credit to meet their lending targets. Desperate for a solution, the government is now contemplating an Act that places a limit on the number of guests attending a marriage and a forensic audit of the agriculture credit portfolio of commercial banks.

Data from the draft state farmers' policy released earlier this year shows that Punjab's requirement of crop loans is around ₹24,000 crore per season, while outstanding loans advanced by banks is ₹60,000 crore.

""There are around 26 lakh (2.6 million) farmers in the state, but banks have issued more than 40 lakh (4 million) Kisan Credit Cards. Over a period of 11 years (2004-05 to 2015-16) the credit offtake has increased by around eight times, while the value of production rose just three times,"" said Ajay Vir Jakhar, chairman of the state farmers' commission.

Given the allegations levelled against the search panel formed to appoint a vice-chancellor for the Tamil University, Thanjavur, experts and teachers want the soon-to-be-constituted panels to be more vigilant while shortlisting names for the posts.

According to norms, search panels consist of three members -- nominated by the government, university syndicate (executive body) and senate (governing body of academic professionals). The government is yet to appoint its nominee to the panel to shortlist names for the post of V-C of BU, which fell vacant after the arrest of Ganapathi in February 2018 in connection with a bribery case.

As far as MKU is concerned, 196 have applied for the V-C post, which has been vacant since June. P P Chellathurai's appointment as V-C was set aside by the Madurai Bench of the Madras high court on the grounds that the selection rules were violated.

The vacancies have had an adverse impact on the functioning of the universities, particularly affecting academics, according to educationists. In the absence of a V-C, a committee headed by the state higher education secretary is formed to run the university.

It is primarily the duty of the V-C to demand grants or additional funds required for settling bills or meeting unforeseen expenditures. Without a V-C, the committee is able to just 'manage' the administration.

Distance education centres usually help universities get revenue. But the recent UGC direction allowed only four universities to conduct select courses in distance education mode has not the others.

To make proper representations on such issues to the government, universities need V-Cs. Committees can run only day-to-day affairs, not take policy decisions or promote research.

Even to conduct a convocation ceremony to distribute degree certificates to students, a person of authority is required. There have been instances where such events were postponed because there was no V-C.As far as the five universities are concerned, the V-Cs are at the fag end of their three-year tenure. The search panels, instead of just looking at the applicants' bio-data highlighting their academic performance, should check their administrative experience and integrity, inorder to curb corruption, say educationists.CR Ravi, a retired principal, said that it was high time the selection and appointment of V-Cs wasmade more transparent. Universities should not be used as cash cows. It is to be remembered, he said, that a former Anna University V-V, a fomer Chairman of IIT Kanpur and a present panel member of the search committee in MKU had verified that Rs 50 crores was paid to a Minister, he added."

(PTI)

The newly formed Congress governments in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh may not have adequate fiscal space or funds left to implement other poll promises in the current financial year after announcing farm loan waivers, according to officials in the three states. The outgoing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) governments in the three states have spent up to 70% of the funds allocated in the last budget in the first seven months of this financial year, which will end on March 31.

Madhya and Chhattisgarh announced the waiver on Monday last. Rajasthan followed suit two days in line with Congress chief Rahul Gandhi's poll promise of waiving farm loans of up to Rs two lakh within 10 days of forming the governments in three states.

Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan waived all short-term crop loans while the Chhattisgarh government will pay for loans farmers have taken from the state's Gramin Bank. The waivers will cost between Rs 35,000 to Rs 38,000 crore in Madhya Pradesh, Rs 18,000 crore in Rajasthan and Rs 6,100 crore in Chhattisgarh.

Officials said market borrowing was among the options the governments were exploring. ""We are working out the modalities,"" said a Madhya Pradesh finance department official.

Officials cited the limited fiscal space and said it will be difficult to implement other major poll promises in the current financial year. Budgets in the three states will be presented in February-March next year, months before the national polls due in April-May 2019.

The other promises include unemployment allowances of Rs 10,000 and Rs 3,500 each to a member of a family in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. The Congress has also pledged a stipend of an unspecified amount in Chhattisgarh.

It has also promised power bills' waiver for the poor and reduction in electricity tariffs by half for others. The other pledges range from free education and medicines to increasing minimum support price for farm produce in the three states.

In Chhattisgarh, the party has also promised liquor prohibition that, too, will lead to revenue losses.

Officials said the outgoing BJP governments have spent between 50% to 70% of funds allocated in the last budget.

Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath and his Rajasthan counterpart, Ashok Gehlot, have blamed the previous BJP governments for emptying the coffers and have said that they will look for new avenues to generate revenue.

The BJP has maintained there was enough money if the new governments wanted to implement their poll promises.

In Madhya Pradesh, the farm loan waiver burden would be about one-fifth of the total expenditure of Rs 1,86,683 crore for 2018-19, of which around Rs 1,25,000 crore has been spent till October end.

Officials pointed out the previous government has availed 90% of the borrowing capacity of Rs 60,000 crore to fund sops before the polls.

Madhya Pradesh's principal secretary (agriculture), Rajesh Rajora, said most money provided for different schemes in the budget has been spent. ""We are looking at different options to fund the farm loan waiver,"" he said

In Rajasthan, the farm loan waiver burden would be around one-sixth of the total budget of Rs 1,07,865 crore, of which about Rs 77,000 crore has been spent.

University of Rajasthan's economics professor, V V Singh, said around 25% of the budget will be spent on meeting these poll promises.

He added any additional spending will result in an increase in the fiscal deficit, which is 3.01% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP).

Gehlot on Tuesday insisted his government has a borrowing capacity of Rs 36,000 crore as per the present budget. T

he state has already taken over Rs 25,000 crore loan. Gehlot admitted to the fiscal constraints.

The state's outstanding liabilities are 27.57% of its GSDP, which is above the 25% limit the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act has set.

Rajasthan finance commission's former chairperson, Jyoti Kiran Shukla, called the implications of the waiver announcements on the state budget huge. Shukla said the state has to determine what revenue base it will generate to meet these expenditures.

In Chhattisgarh, the farm loan waiver and increasing the minimum support price of paddy and maize to Rs 2,500 per quintal would take away one-tenth of the state's budget of Rs 83,179 crore.

A Chhattisgarh finance department officer hoped they would be able to implement the promises without breaching the fiscal deficit target.

""Some promises may find reflection in the next budget. The political leadership will take the decision.""

He added implementing prohibition in the current financial year will be impossible as it needs a new legal framework like in Gujarat and Bihar.

Economists have spoken against the farm loan waivers saying they will increase non-performing banking assets. State Bank of India's group chief economic advisor Soumya Kanti Ghosh estimates the collective burden will range from Rs Rs 60,000 crore to Rs 70,000 if the election-bound states, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Haryana, in 2019 decide to waive farm loans."

GPCC president Girish Chodankar told reporters that the state government is functioning illegally as Parrikar had allegedly given the CM's powers to his secretary and principal secretary without any government notification.

He was referring to Manohar Parrikar's note authorising his principal secretary to clear files. ""Goa is not Parrikar's personal property,"" he said. ""The decision is illegal, arbitrary and unconstitutional. It is going to put Goa in deep trouble and there is going to be a standstill in future affecting many people,"" he said.

The chief minister holds important portfolios like finance, mines, education, corporation, home and industries besides being the chairman of important corporations and bodies. As a finance minister, he has to give a number of expenditure sanctions, financial concurrence on a number of files.

Chodankar said that the CM can give his approvals only after physically perusing matters before he takes a crucial decision and signs.

The signature given after oral instruction is totally illegal,"" he said."

How can it be disrupted is their aim.""

If we can march ahead then who will stop us? We will do according to our mission with our chief minister to advance development works in West Bengal.""

It was a year of several landmark decisions for the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA). In pursuance to objective of providing greater "" Ease of Doing Business"" to all stakeholders, bring about greater transparency in corporate structure and better corporate compliance to enhance efficiency of the processes under Companies Act, 2013, the MCA took several initiatives over the last one year.

The important ones are Companies (Amendment) Act 2017, Companies (Amendment) Ordinance 2018, establishment of National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA), amendments in Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, eKYC drive for Directors of all companies and speedier processing of incorporation related applications, uniformity in application of rules and eradicating discretion.

And it is not for nothing that India's rankings in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business has been lifted up. India has improved its ranking on the World Bank's ""Doing Business"" 2019 report released on 31st October, 2018. As per the report, India has moved up 23 spots to 77th position as compared to 100th position in 2017 by improving its rank in six out of ten parameters relating to starting and doing business in India. The ministry can legitimately claim its share of credits towards starting a business, insolvency resolution and protection of minority interests. But it is the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code or IBC, which claimed limelight for MCA even over the quick action over IL&FS resurrections jointly done by Ministry of Economic Affairs and then taken forward by MCA.

INSOLVENCY & BANKRUPTCY

In year 2018, the President gave assent to promulgate Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amen­dment) Ordinance, 2018.

Insolvency and Bankruptcy process has taken good shape since 2017 and is a fast evolving legislation. A major factor behind the effectiveness of the new Code has been the adjudication by the Judiciary. The Code provides strict time limits for various procedures under it. In this process a rich- case law has evolved reducing the scope of legal uncertainty.

The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2018 notified on 19.01.2018 replaced IBC (Amendment) Ordinance which further amended provisions relating to prohibition on certain persons from submitting a resolution plan, so as to provide more clarity. Further, second amendment was also done by the way of Ordinance in August, 2018 on the recommendations of Insolvency Law Committee. The Ordinance was promulgated to amend the code to balance the interests of various stakeholders in the code, especially interests of home buyers and micro, small and medium enterprises, promoting resolution over liquidation of corporate debtor by lowering the voting threshold of committee of creditors and streamlining provisions relating to eligibility of resolution applicants.

It was the most vital work of MCA and the most prominet among the MCA credits are amedments to the IBC. According to E&Y, these amendment gives relief to home buyers. Home buyers and other real estate buyers were not recognized either as ""financial reditors"" (FC) or ""operational creditors"" prior to ordinance. Ordinance now provides that they will be treated as FC. As FC, they will have right to participate in the Committee of Creditors (CoC) through authorized representatives and have voting power to the extent of their outstanding. They would rank as other FCs and would get recovery in line with them, in case of liquidation scenario With RERA in place along with powers given to home buyers under IBC, the regulator has provided a level playing field to the home buyer.

It also allowed Initiation of CIRP by Corporate Applicant saying special resolution must be passed by shareholders of corporate debtor with at least ¾th majority mandatory for filing application. This meant the board of directors or authorised representative cannot unilaterally take the decision to file under IBC and the directors and officers would need to be mindful of provisions in the IBC, which impose civil and criminal sanctions on erstwhile directors and officers of the company for wrongful trading.

CoC voting threshold was also reduced from 75 to 66 per cent for major decisions and it did faciliate quick decision making and improve prospects for approval of viable resolution plan.

Applying for an extension for the CIRP period from 180 to 270 days, appointment and replacement of a resolution professional, approving a resolution plan, certain actions requiring approval of CoC and passing a resolution for liquidation while voting threshold reduced to 51 per cent for routine decisions. It also facilitated creditors to invoke personal or corporate guarantees during the CIRP that would provide better co-operation from promoters during resolution process. In a relief to financial creditors having substantial equity shareholding in corporate debtor, the amendment also provided for the regulated financial creditors who became a related party solely on account of conversion of debt into equity/ instruments, convertible into equity shall be exempted from the prohibition.

The most important amendment was reducing the scope of connected person. Prior to the ordinance, several financial entities having connected persons through their investee companies in India or abroad which suffered from the disqualifications (especially relating to NPAs) listed in Section 29A. Relaxation was provided to these financial entities including foreign financial investors. Relaxation of Section 29A should result in more resolution applicants for distressed corporate debtors and improve competition and value.

While some quarters say the IBC has been slow in giving either resolutions or recovery, the government says otherwise. According to corporate affairs secretary Injeti Srinivas, IBC has catalysed the recovery of around Rs 3 lakh crore from various default cases, directly or indirectly, since its inception in 2016. Creditors have recovered Rs 49,783 crore, or almost 56 per cent of their admitted claims, from 32 stressed companies where insolvency resolution plans were approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) by the end of June, showed data compiled by the insolvency regulator.

The average recovery in the 60-odd insolvency cases that have seen resolution over the past two years has been to the tune of 46 per cent against just 26 per cent under the earlier Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) regime, Srinivas said, highlighting the effectiveness of the nascent insolvency framework.

Explaining the numbers, the secretary said while the resolution of the 60 cases have so far yielded around Rs 71,000 crore, some Rs 50,000 crore is expected to be recovered from Essar Steel, which is at the advanced stage of being resolved. These apart, around 3,500 cases involving defaults of Rs 1.2 lakh crore were withdrawn from the National Company Law Tribunals (NCLTs) before applications were admitted by the adjudicating authority, suggesting that creditors might have recovered money from debtors by just issuing threats of the IBC.

Non-performing assests (NPAs) worth another Rs 45,000-50,000 crore were converted to standard accounts after the borrowers had paid back, ostensibly due to fears of the IBC being invoked by the lenders. The IBC regulator IBBI says there is a need for greater bonding between the partners of this syste. Its chairman MS Sahoo was critical of the tendency of some stakeholders to blame the oversight mechanism for any delay in resolution. He pitched for greater coordination and cooperation between the committee of creditors and resolution professionals to speed up the process. Srinivas too seeks to ask the principal stakeholders of the insolvency ecosystem -- the NCLTs, the committee of creditors and resolution professionals -- to work towards expediting the resolution process.

Despite the average 44 per cent haircut that the creditors in general had to take in these cases, analysts said the IBC has performed much better than the earlier system where the recovery process was strenuous and yielded too little. Of course, the headline numbers are good primarily because of Bhushan Steel, which accounted for close to 64 per cent of the total claims by these 32 firms and an equal amount in recovery.

""The IBC as a system has worked better from the old systems under RBI where recovery used to take a lot of time, and wherever a one-time settlement took place, the amount was usually not more than 20 per cent . In many stressed firms were allowed debt restructuring, which only worsened their state of health. In contrast, the IBC 's time-bound resolution of default cases, is more decisive,"" an analyst said.

So far, 1,198 corporates admitted under IBC, 52 cases resolved and 212 cases resulted in liquidation, says (IBBI) whole time member Navrang Saini. Nevertheless, once these old cases -- where chances of a grand turnaround without massive investments are remote -- are settled and new cases come in, recovery would be much higher, a senior government official said. This is because creditors can invoke insolvency proceedings against defaulting firms very early when chances of turning them around would be much higher and easier.

NATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING AUTHORITY

In the wake of accounting scams and frauds in the corporate sector, National Financial Reporting authority (NFRA) was notified as an independent regulator for auditing profession, which is one of the key changes brought in by the Companies Act 2013. NFRA will review the quality of corporate financial reporting in certain classes and subclasses of companies and take disciplinary action against auditors/audit firms for not discharging their statutory duties with due diligence. The decision is expected to result in higher foreign/domestic investments, acceleration of economic growth while supporting greater globalization of business by conforming to international standards and assisting in the evolution of audit profession. The jurisdiction of NFRA for investigation of chartered accountants and their firms under section 132 of the Act would extend to listed companies and large unlisted public companies, the threshold for which shall be prescribed in the rules. The Government has constituted this authority and has prescribed NFRA (Manner of Appointment and other Terms and Conditions of Service of Chairperson and Members) Rules, 2018 and NFRA Rules, 2018. R. Sridharan and Dr Prasenjit Mukherjee, have been appointed as chairperson and full time member respectively of NFRA on 1st October, 2018.

During the year, MCA allowed exemption of its fee for company incorporation where a government process of re-engineering has been implemented where zero fee for incorporation of all companies with authorized capital upto Rs10 lakh or those companies with no share capital but have upto 20 members.

The other key step towards more transparency and accountability was the eKYC drive for directors of all companies. . This drive is aimed at verification of individual directors and weed out non-existent/dummy ones and ultimately to clean up the Directors' e-Registry. The KYC process is obtaining additional details such as AADHAAR, passport, personal mobile mumber and personal email ID. Further, for stakeholders who do not possess AADHAAR, an exception management is provided. There are around 33 Lakh DINs in the registry and around 15.88 Lakh DIN (Director Identification Number) holders have filed DIR KYC as on 30thNovember, 2018. In this drive, MCA managed to seed 11 lakh Aadhar card holders. This is one of its kinds of drive carried out anywhere in India.

NATIONAL COMPANY LAW TRIBUNAL

To speed up matter related to resolution of bankruptcy and insolvency, MCA proposed setting up 8 special courts under the National Company Law Tribunal to deal with the insolvency cases. These courts are proposed to be set up in the busiest cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata and Hyderabad. The proposal aims to reduce the mounting burden on the tribunal despite it having 11 benches all over India. To facilitate timely resolution of IBC cases, it is envisaged to set up exclusive IBC Courts under the NCLT benches of Delhi, Mumbai to start with and step up infrastructure of NCLT. The aim is also to strengthen the insolvency process for faster resolution of NPAs.

INDIAN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In order to bring more transparent accounting, MCA notified Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) 115 which would be effective from 1st April 2018. Ind AS 115 is a new revenue recognition standard for customer contracts in line with the international financial reporting standards which will help in more transparent accounting of revenues with an impact on companies operating in diverse sectors, including technology, real estate and telecom. The objective is to establish the principles that should be applied when reporting useful information to users of financial statements. The standard requires an entity to recognize revenue ""to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services""

UNLISTED PUBLIC COMPANIES

In order to bring about greater transparency in Corporate structure and in view of advantages of dematerialisation of securities, especially in terms of KYC and investor protection, the government's focus on ""Digital India"" and the enabling provisions available under section 29(1)(b) of the CA-13, the Ministry has amended the relevant rules to apply the dematerialisation requirements to unlisted public companies, in addition to listed companies. Consultation was held in this regard with all stakeholders and rules were amended on 10th September, 2018 to mandate, w.e.f. 2ndOctober, 2018, issue and transfer of securities by unlisted public companies in demat form only.

INVESTOR EDUCATION

The Investor Education & Protection Fund (IEPF) Authority unveiled its new logo in 2018 to provide for strong brand presence and recognition. The IEPF authority also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the CSC e-governance Services India, wherein the latter would identify village level entrepreneurs for investor awareness projects, among other activities. MCA is actively looking at further reforms in IEPF.

To review the existing claim settlement processes a committee of practicing company secretaries was constituted through the Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI). The committee had reviewed the existing processes and have recommended that the entire process should be made online with e-verification of the claims by the companies, online PAN based verification of the claimant etc.

A new portal namely www.iepfportal.in has been developed for increasing the outreach of IAPs and monitoring the programmes conducted by the professional institutes, CSC e-governance and other partner institutions. The portal provides access to the partner institutions like ICAI, ICSI, ICoAI& IICA and CSC e-Governance for uploading the details of past & future programmes.

COMPETITION MATTERS

To enlarge the scope of debate of competition in India and to bring the best practices from around the world on competition issues, Competition Commission of India (CCI) successfully hosted the 17th International Competition Network (ICN) Annual Conference in March 2018 in New Delhi. Around 500 professional attended the conference from 70 plus countries, which included heads of competition agencies, representatives and stakeholders consisting of legal and economic professionals, international organizations and academics.

The MCA constituted an Inter-Ministerial Committee for carrying out ""Competition Assessment of existing policies"" under the chairmanship of Shri. Ramesh Abhishek, secretary, Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion with representation from seven other ministries/organizations on dated 1st June, 2018. The prime focus of the committee was to conduct a review of select Acts/Rules/Policies/Regulations formulated in the recent past and some upcoming acts to look into issues of anti-competition aspects and to focus on any restrictions/provisions in laws that pose great threat to competition.

Further, in pursuance of its objective to ensure that legislation is in sync with the needs of strong economic fundamentals, the Government constituted a Competition Law Review Committee under Injeti Srinivas, secretary Corporate Affairs on dated 1st October, 2018. The Committee is mandated to review the Competition Act/Rules/Regulation, to look into international best practices and sectoral interfaces etc.

Competition Commission of India (CCI) has amended the Combination Regulations. The post amendment regulations among others includes permitting withdrawal of notice and refilling the same by parties, allowing submission of voluntary modifications in response to notice, appointing agencies to supervise implementation of modification etc.

As part of competition Advocacy initiative at national and state level, CCI organised roadshows in Mumbai, Delhi and Ahmedabad, including a National Conference on ""Public procurement and Competition Law."" Similar roadshows with focus on competition matters are being held periodically and more are planned to be held in the coming months.

MCA did an effective job in 2018, Mostly IBC resolutions , fraud control , NPA recoveries through IBC will put it to test again in 2019. And not to forget the success of IL&FS plan of action by MCA."

In an interview with Deccan Chronicle, Mr Reddy for once did not shy away from naming senior leaders who had deprived him of what he had always coveted - a cabinet berth.

""According to my knowledge, seniors like me, Roshan Baig and H.K. Patil were not considered to give an opportunity to those who have not become ministers despite being elected to the state assembly a second or third term. Okay fine. If this is the yardstick, why has it been made applicable to only me, Mr Baig and Mr Patil? Why not Major Industries Minister K.J. George, Water Resources and Medical Education Minister D.K. Shivakumar, newly sworn-in minister M.B. Patil and Deputy Chief Minister Dr G. Parameshwar who have been ministers more than five times? I want to know why this special rule is imposed on us and not on others,"" said the former minister, baring his anguish on being left out.

And who does he blame for this injustice? Was it because the Reddy quota was already taken over by another Reddy - Shivshankar Reddy - leaving him with no slot? ""Community is definitely not the reason I was left out. My observation is that under the garb of giving representation to North Karnataka Congress legislators, the party has given the ministerial berths to those who had threatened to join the BJP.''

He also suspects that the ""lies"" conveyed by Deputy CM Parameshwar and RDPR Minister Krishna Byre Gowda to those who matter did him in and spoilt his prospects.

Question and Answer with Ramalinga Reddy veteran Cong MLA.

Why 'berths for new faces only' not applicable to Dr G, DKS, KJ?

The cabinet expansion done to fill up the vacant berths in the Congress quota has caused severe heartburn among senior party leaders. One among the upset leaders is former minister and BTM layout MLA R Ramalinga Reddy who wields huge influence in Bengaluru assembly constituencies. He spoke frankly with Deccan Chronicle and said a few leaders who are unable to stomach his growing popularity in state politics, are trying to sideline him. But it's not possible as long as people are with him. His daughter and Jayanagar MLA Sowmya Reddy refused to accept the post of parliamentary secretary saying that veteran Congress leaders, including her father, have been ignored by the party high command. Here are excerpts from an interview with Ramalinga Reddy.

Why were you denied a berth in the Congress-JDS coalition government?

The reason for this is simple. According to my knowledge, seniors like me, R Roshan Baig and H.K. Patil were not considered to give opportunity to those who have not become ministers despite being elected to the State assembly a second or third term. Ok fine. If this is the yardstick, why has it been made applicable to only me, Mr Baig and Mr Patil? Why not Major Industries Minister K.J. George, Water Resources and Medical Education Minister D.K. Shivakumar, newly sworn-in minister M.B. Patil and Deputy Chief Minister G. Parameshwar, who have been ministers for more than five times? I want to know why this special rule is used on us and not on others. This point has not been brought to the notice of the Congress high command and All India Congress Committee President Rahul Gandhi. I know quite well that both Dr Parameshwar and Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister Krishna Byre Gowda have spoken lies on us. I don't have a personal grudge against them as they are 'experienced' and it's a 'honour' to have them in the council of ministers.

Your leaders say that Mr Shivashankar Reddy has been made a Cabinet minister under the Reddy quota. So, they haven't considered your name. Your comments?

What sort of logic is this? Mr Shivashankar Reddy was elected from Chikkaballapura district and made a minister to give representation to that district. If caste had been considered, how come KPCC President Dinesh Gundurao, revenue minister R.V. Deshpande and Legislative Assembly Speaker K. R. Ramesh Kumar, who are all Brahmins, in top posts? How are Health and Family Welfare Minister Shivananda Patil and Mr M.B. Patil who are both Lingayats, in the Cabinet? Let state Congress leaders have the heart to admit discrimination has been done to me. It is being done systematically to sideline and push me into a corner in state politics.

Were you promised a minister post before the recent cabinet expansion?

In my 40-year political career, I have never begged anyone to make me a minister. I did not lobby when the coalition government came to power this year. I have never asked anyone for a minister's post and I will not do this in future too.

Has the Congress neglected senior leaders in the recent cabinet expansion?

Not all of them but some of them have been definitely neglected or sidelined. Apart from this, I cannot say anything.

Is it true that seniors like you have been given a raw deal in a bid to give more representation to north-Karnataka region keeping in view the coming Lok Sabha polls?

I would have definitely kept quiet if it was the real intention. It's true that North Karnataka region has been neglected and it should be given a big chunk. But my observation is that under the garb of giving representation to North Karnataka Congress legislators, the party has given the minister posts to those who had threatened to join the Bharatiya Janata Party. The state leaders have identified such legislators and appeased them. It's purely appeasement politics by some of our party leaders.

Why are your party leaders against you?

I know very well that a few leaders are conspiring against me to keep me out of Bengaluru politics. All sorts of baseless allegations are being hurled at me to portray me badly before the high command.

A lot of Congress councillors in BBMP are protesting against the Congress for denying you a berth in the state cabinet. Will you continue to take an active role in strengthening the relationship between Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) in the BBMP?

I am indebted to all my friends (followers) for reposing faith in me. I have already appealed to them not to hold any rally or dharna against the Congress. It's true that they are very sad that I was not made minister.

Having being denied the cabinet berth, will you campaign for the Congress in the coming Lok Sabha polls?

I have complaints against a few individuals and not against the Congress which has given me everything. I will definitely work to ensure a majority for the party in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

According to you, what played the most important role during the cabinet expansion- was it money or caste?

I totally rule out money in the selection of ministers. Seniority has been totally neglected and there was partiality in this exercise. It is nothing but a pick and choose method adopted to select MLAs for minister posts."

With admissions for the pre-primary classes getting underway, Secretary, Punjab Education, hit the road and went door to door asking the parents to send their kids to government schools. This unusual drive is part of the department's efforts to ensure that admissions in pre-primary classes cross the figure of one lakh students.

In past four days since the admissions began, over 25,000 children between ages 3 to 6 have been admitted in the pre-primary classes.

On Saturday, Secretary Education, Punjab, Krishan Kumar, along with the staff of Education Department visited homes in Mohali District area to make the parents aware about pre-primary classes being offered at government schools.

""It is quite unusual as hardly any senior officer would go door to door like Secretary, Education, who is one of the senior most officers of Punjab not only in Education Department but otherwise,"" said a teacher who accompanied the secretary along with several other staff members, adding that due to his efforts over several government schools in Punjab have already got a much better infrastructure.

The teacher added that by the end of this year over 4000 schools would be given the same facelift.

Those accompanying the Krishan Kumar carried a placard that read: ""Na koi fees, na koi basta, sarkari school sab ton sasta (no fee nor bag, government schools are the cheaper places to teach you wards), in their hands. He appealed the parents do teach your children. He also said that each one should bring one child to school.

Pre-primary classes were started in the 12,500 primary and elementary schools of Punjab last year when 1.70 lakh children were admitted in nursery and kindergarten classes. This year in district teachers' have been asked to ensure maximum admissions from their areas, said Secretary Education. In villages, announcements are also being made from religious places urging parents to get their children enrolled."

After it was 'abandoned' a decade ago, the school had become a den for anti-social elements to play cards, booze and indulge in prostitution.

The state government has recently passed an order to start a government girls' high school in the building, which was inaugurated last week by the state school education minister K A Sengottaiyan.

The school was started in 1957 in a tile-roof building at Perumanallur. It was upgraded as government higher secondary school. When the strength increased, lack of infrastructure in the school became an issue. So, the students were shifted to a higher secondary school functioning on Kanakkampalayam Road, around 10 years ago. But the old school building was 'abandoned'.

""Especially women would fear to go near the school building because of the anti-social elements. Apart from the prostitution activities, many college students would camp in the dilapidated classrooms and involve in gambling. Despite continuous complaints, numerous incidents were happening in the school building. A few months ago, a class VIII girl was allegedly molested,"" said P Mouleeswaran, secretary, alumni association of the school.

""After our continuous requests to restart the school, the school education minister Sengottaiyan visited the abandoned school building. Quickly, the government passed an order to divide Perumanallur government higher secondary school, among four other government schools in the state, and separate the girl students from the school. Now, Perumanallur government girls' high school was started in the abandoned building,"" he said.

""A group of alumni of the school has come forward and helped to restore the buildings and established a smart classroom. With 10 classrooms, a well-furnished toilet facility, equipped with sanitary napkin incinerator. The alumni have, so far, spent, more than Rs 40 lakh,"" said Mouleeswaran, the 1981-batch student.

""It is commendable that the alumni were putting their hearts out in reviving the school. The government has ordered to transfer 249 girls, between class VI and class X, from Perumanallur government higher secondary school to this school, which is now Perumanallur government girls' high school. After completion of half-yearly exam holidays, the school will start functioning on January 2,"" M Dhanabaggiam, headmistress of the new school told TOI.

Mouleeswaran said, ""The school education department will soon avail loan of Rs 1.36 crore from the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), for the revived school. More classrooms will be constructed soon. The government has also promised to upgrade the school as higher secondary school soon."""

Going by the bustle, a first time visitor would think preparations were on for Christmas, but regular travellers on the Keezhvelur-Thiruthuraipoondi State Highway know what the frenzy is all about.

Welcome to Keezhvenmani, where survivors and kin of victims of caste oppression are trying their best to put behind them memories of the gory night of 25 December 1968 when 44 Dalits were burnt alive for raising their voice against the dominant community.

Influenced by Marxist-Communist ideology, Dalit farm labourers were involved in a standoff with upper caste landlords. As the night unfolded, riots broke out in which at least 44 villagers, including 16 women and 23 children, were burnt to death in a hut belonging to one Ramaiyan, where the labourers sought refuge to escape the marauding gangs allegedly let loose by the landlords.

""We will celebrate the anniversary on a scale never seen before. For us, the victims are martyrs of Communism who fought capitalism, and not just victims of caste oppression,"" said A Sivakumar, district president of DYFI, and a Venmani resident. It is a race against time as the locals try to complete the new memorial they planned to inaugurate on the 50th anniversary of the massacre. But for the cyclone, the memorial would have been ready well in advance.

Fifty years since the dark night, there is not much development in the village as more than half of the families live in huts. Some of them, including survivors and kin of the victims, though own lands thanks largely to efforts of Krishnammal Jagannathan and her organisation called Land for Tillers' Freedom (LAFTI).

""My husband and I travelled to Keezhvenmani, the day after the incident. The gory scenes and misery broke my heart. I sent my husband back and lived the life of Keezhvenmani villagers,"" said Krishnammal Jagannathan, who is now 92-years-old and lives in Chennai. For three years after 1968, she ate with the villagers and rested with them.

""But, there was still much to do,"" she said.

In the days after the massacre, Krishnammal persuaded the landlords into negotiation and secured 55 acres of land for the victims' kin. G Pazhanivel, now 70, is one among them. He escaped with hack wounds on his left leg and remains the history book of the incident. Though there has not been any other flash point since, elders in the village remain wary.

""Most marriages take place within the caste or community. The children have turned progressive, but we do not have the strength to see any other caste conflict,"" said G Ruthirapathi, a retired school teacher and Pazhanivel's elder brother.

Pazhanivel's children are well educated and inspired several others to follow in their footsteps. While his only daughter is married and settled near Nagapattinam, Pazhanivel's first two sons are marine engineers, and his fourth and youngest son completed PhD and works in a university. His third son came back from abroad to take over farming activity from his father.

On the social front, there is a hint of change. There have been few intercaste marriages in the surrounding villages. The first was a love marriage that took place 24 years ago between N Anbuselvan, a Dalit in Keezhvenmani and R Jyothi, from a dominant caste in Irinjiur.

""It was not easy. Although my wife's family did not object, the others threatened to burn me alive. Thankfully everything became alright,"" says Anbuselvan who now is a Panchayat Secretary and lives in Thevur. The couple has two children.

Meanwhile, at Irinjiur village in Anakkudi Panchayat, the family of Gopalakrishna Naidu, the landlord who allegedly orchestrated the massacre has sought police protection this year, considering this is the 50th anniversary of the incident. Gopalakrishna Naidu was murdered 38 years ago. His brother, Govindaraja Naidu and his four sons died over the years. Only two of Govindaraja Naidu's sons Krishnamurthy, aged 70 and Pappaiyan, aged 63 are alive.

When this reporter visited their house, Krishnamurthy's wife Kirubalini and his nephews were reluctant to answer him and cited health conditions of elders to avoid speaking. Eventually they relented. ""Our uncles do not give interviews anymore, as our words (quotes and television bytes) often get trimmed out of stories, We were projected in such a negative manner that people who did not know us but came for the anniversaries in recent years abused us severely. Our side of the story was ignored,"" said R Senthil Kumar, Govindraja Naidu's grandson.

Krishnamurthy denied his family's involvement in the massacre and said the perpetrators were from Irukkai village. Further, he pointed out that he and a few other land owners still employ farm labourers from Venmani during Samba season.

""In the ten years after the incident, we found it very difficult to find people for farm work. Eventually, we adopted direct sowing method, which is not labour intensive. We continue to employ farm hands irrespective of castes for sowing, weeding, and harvesting. Even during the drought in 2016, we ensured good wages for people who took part in whatever farming activity we could involve in,"" said Krishnamurthy.

The villagers are still affiliated to Communist Party of India - Marxist, very much like their ancestors. The village remained a stronghold of the Left. So is Keezhvelur constituency, under which Venmani falls.

""We will always be loyal to the Communist Party of India - Marxist, as it is those principles which taught us to stand against oppression and persecution,"" said U Selvaraj, a Venmani resident.

Pazhanivel sighs at the sight of the dilapidated memorial which was built in the place where Ramayan's hut stood, two years after the incident.

""I was fortunate to see the daylight. I now wish to see a more revived Keezhvenmani with developments such as social harmony rural development, education, self-employment, and standard of life before my time is up.""

By doing so, the party is trying to assuage the sense of alienation among its leaders in the region, but in the process, party biggies in Bengaluru have been left fuming.

Senior leaders and former ministers Ramalinga Reddy, Roshan Baig and Krishnappa were among the aspirants for a ministerial berth. Though Baig and Krishnappa have not expressed their displeasure, Reddy's daughter and Jayanagar MLA Soumya Reddy has not minced words in expressing her displeasure.

ALSO READ | Karnataka CM Kumaraswamy to expand ministry; discontent grows in Congress

Having realised that the balancing act has not gone down well with Reddy, the party leadership tried to accommodate Soumya as Parliamentary Secretary. She rejected the post. Sources said Reddy, seven-time MLA who had held the Home and Bengaluru Development portfolios in the Siddaramaiah government, was shocked with the party's decision to ignore him during the ministry expansion. ""He felt insulted and decided to stay away from party work,"" sources said.

Reddy's decision to stay away from party work in the state capital can have an adverse impact on its prospects during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Given its good performance in Bengaluru during the assembly elections and its alliance with the JD(S), the Congress is confident of winning Bengaluru Central and North LS seats. For that to happen, the Congress needs to put up a united front against the BJP, which won all three LS seats in the city during the 2014 elections.

Now, with Reddy grumbling and leaders like Baig not taken into confidence, it is not going to be an easy task for the Congress to take on BJP. According to many leaders in the party, Reddy understands the dynamics of city politics well and has been playing a crucial role for the Congress in Bengaluru. He had ensured his daughter's victory from Jayanagar assembly segment without any assistance from senior party leaders, and also played a key role in the city corporation elections.

According to political analyst Prof Sandeep Shastri, ministry expansion will not solve the Congress' problems, as infighting will persist. Congress plans to use senior leaders like Ramalinga Reddy, Roshan Baig and others for party work, but is not sure how they will take it, he said.

However, a crisis in the Congress is unlikely to help the BJP. ""They need to put their house in order before they try to fish in troubled waters. They have their own share of internal problems,"" he added.

Political analyst Prof Harish Ramaswamy, however, said that senior leaders like Reddy and HK Patil, who had worked as ministers earlier, should now focus on strengthening the party ahead of LS polls.

Happy with role of campaign panel chief, says HK Patil

Senior Congress leader H K Patil, who was an aspirant for a ministerial berth in the coalition government, has been appointed state Congress campaign committee chief ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Water Resources and Medical Education Minister D K Shivakumar was the party campaign committee chief during the assembly elections earlier this year.

Sources close to the leader, however, said Patil was not happy with the party high command's decision not to include him in the ministry and give him the party job. When contacted, Patil said he is happy with the new assignment given to him. ""I am happy with the party's decision as I also wanted some change after handling four portfolios continuously,"" he said. Patil said senior leaders in the party had consulted him before taking the decision.

As chief of the campaign committee, Patil will closely work KPCC president Dinesh Gundu Rao and other top leaders in the state. Along with the KPCC president, the campaign committee chief also plays a crucial role in ensuring proper coordination between different units of the party and also its alliance partners during elections."

He assured that the issue of shortage of nurses and other medical staff at Kidwai will be sorted in the next 10 days. He asked the institute's Director, Dr C Ramachandra, to submit a list of how many nursing and other staffers were needed to run the new block efficiently.

Various associations of school teachers in the state have already registered protests against the recommendation.

Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, the other day, gave a slew of recommendations in the Niti Ayog's 'Strategy for New India @ 75' and one of his recommendations was a complete overhaul of the school education system by improving the standards of teachers and revising the curriculum.

According to office bearers of Kerala School Teachers Association (KSTA), the recommendations will only lead to teachers losing their confidence.

""The periodical examinations to test the efficiency of teachers will only create differences among them. Also conducting the test is practically impossible. We will not allow this to be implemented in the state. We have many additional duties apart from teaching. If the quarterly examinations are implemented, there will be more pressure on teachers. Hence we will stage a protest to stop the Centre's move,"" said K C Harikrishnan, general secretary, KSTA.

He also said the Union Government's recommendation could be on the basis of the increase in the number of unqualified teachers in many schools in North India. "" In Kerala, the appointment of teachers are being made in a transparent manner and all are qualified too,"" Harikrishnan added.

The unaided school teachers and private school teachers have also echoed the opinion of KSTA and they said they can not handle more pressures and this will adversely affect the academic performance of the students.

""The Union Minister said in the recommendation that this will improve the education standards. But as far as Kerala is concerned, the academic performance of students are moving in the right direction.

""The teaching is also far better compared to other states. So there is no point in implementing the recommendation here,"" said Sreekanth (name changed), a private school teacher.

In the report, the Union Government has recommended that the spending on education should be increased to at least six per cent of GDP by 2022. Niti Ayog has addressed the key areas such as school education, higher education and vocational education.

The report has also made recommendations to improve enrollment, learning outcome, employability, and reduce stress on school children.

Meanwhile, A Shahjahan, General Education Secretary told Express that the state had not been intimated by the Centre on the recommendations so far.

""We have not been told so far to implement the recommendations. Firstly, we will be consulted and will discuss the practical possibilities. After the discussion, we will decide whether to proceed or not with the Centre's recommendations,"" he said."

This is covered under Section 93 of the Act which says the central government shall take all necessary measures as enumerated in the 13 Schedule for the progress and sustainable development of the successor States within a period of 10 years from the appointed day.

Schedule 13 of the Act is again divided into two portions, one relating to education and other relating to infrastructure. Under education heading it is made clear that Government Of India shall take steps to establish institutions of national importance in the successor State of Andhra Pradesh. These include an IIT, IIM, NIT, IISER, Central University, Petroleum University, IIIT, Agricultural University, AIIMS, Tribal University and NIDM. The Act envisages a period of 10 years for these institution to be set up in the State.

It goes to the credit of both the Centre as well as the State government that most of these institutions got established and became operational by 2015-16 though in temporary accommodation. The Act in fact provides full 10 year period for establishing these institutions. When the State government was keen on starting these institutions from the academic year 2015-16 even if they were to start in a temporary accommodation the Secretary in government of India concerned was very particular that these institutions should only be established after proper infrastructure was made available probably after four to five years.

But the State government was very keen and was able to politically work out establishment of these institutions even in temporary accommodation. If the central government was not forthcoming and cooperative these institutions would have taken their own time in getting established as is the case when they are established in other states. Having insisted on starting these institutions even in temporary accommodation immediately it is now unfair of the State government to accuse the central government of running them in temporary accommodation.

The second accusation with reference to these institutions of national importance is that they require about '10,000 crores for their proper establishment and at the rate of the present budgetary allocation it may take about 15 years for their completion. This accusation is baseless and mischievous.

The budgetary allocations keep on going up from year to year depending upon the progress of the works and in any case no institution can absorb huge amounts in the very first year of its existence and with enhanced allocations most of these institutions would be completed within a specified period of time.

This is not the first time such institutions are established in the country and they are established in a number of other states and same procedure will be followed here as well. In any case there will be directors for these institutions whose responsibility is to pursue with the Centre for their early completion. Ignoring all these facts taking upon themselves the responsibility which is not their the State government is unnecessarily making it an issue and trying to show government of India in bad light.

Regarding the institutions mentioned under infrastructure except Dugarajapatnam port development all others as mentioned in the Act only talk of examining the feasibility of establishing those institutions and the time given for establishing them if found feasible is 10 years. Out of them the airports and the Vizag Chennai corridor as per my understanding are progressing well.

As far as Durgarajapatnam port is concerned central government seems to have requested the State government to suggest an alternative site in view of the environmental issues involved. The other organisations are in different stages of examination by the central government. All of them require huge investments and the Act provides a 10-year period for the Centre to take a decision.

Aware of the huge investments involved in setting up those institutions and their commercial nature the then Congress government seems to have left it vague in the Act to examine the feasibility of setting up of these institution instead of specifically stating that they should be established.

When such are the provisions of the Act and when the Centre has done so much in establishing these institutions under Schedule 13, the State government has somehow successfully misrepresented the facts and made it look to the public as if nothing has happened under this head."

For the first time in the history of Kerala a mass movement is building up against hartal which eats up around Rs 2,000 crore direct and indirect revenue of the state. Now, an anti-hartal movement is gaining momentum with numerous organisations coming out against this age-old mode of protest. The Joint Action Council Against Hartal (JACAH) hopes to put pressure on political parties to end such strikes, which paralyse normal life.

Stakeholders in sectors like industry, tourism, retail, transport, realty, hotels and education have already expressed their resentment toward hartals. The JACAH, which comprises TiE, KMA, IMA, CII, FICCI, KSSIA, coir manufacturers, Kerala Chamber of Commerce, Cochin Chamber of Commerce, Indian Chamber of Commerce, NASSCOM, KTM, CREDAI, Private Bus Owners Association, Vyapari Vyavasai Ekopana Samithi, Hotel and Restaurant Association, Bakers Association and CBSE School Association, has decided to unitedly move against hartal in the state. Interestingly, there are around 10 villages in the state which do not cooperate with hartals.

Raju P Nair, who spearheads 'Say No To Hartal' campaign, said a collective effort from the public will put pressure on the political parties against announcing hartals. 'Say No To Hartal' began in 2010 and its members arrange transport facilities for those stranded on hartal days. ""Already, the public protest against hartal has forced political parties to reduce the number of state-wide hartals. Now, mostly district and regional-level strikes are being called by political outfits.

However, such a strike is an infringement of the rights of the public. So, by collective effort, the public should put pressure on political parties. There may be setbacks initially, but if the resistance lasts long, the political parties will have to give up hartals,"" said Raju, who is also the Congress DCC secretary.

According to him, during the tenure of the UDF Government, there was a study conducted about the losses incurred during a hartal. The direct loss for the government was estimated to be around Rs 900 crore from one hartal. If indirect revenue generation is taken into consideration, the loss is more than Rs 2,000 crore.

Dr S Sajikumar, Confederation of India Industry (CII) Kerala State Council chairman and MD of Dhathri Ayurveda Pvt Ltd, said the loss from the hartal is between Rs 2,000 and Rs 3,000 crore. ""When attempts are made to attract new investors and industries to Kerala, hartals are affecting the perception of investors about the state. The production loss for the industries is severe during hartal days. The worst affected are daily wage workers. If the political parties have any consideration for these daily wage workers, they should give up this kind of protest,"" he said.

S Gopakumar, president of Better Kochi Response Group which is also part of JACAH, said attempts will be made for a political solution to tackle the hartal menace. Discussions have to be held with political parties against the total shutdown during such strikes.

""Our intention is to create a collective conscience against hartal among the public. We want the public to come out against hartals. There is a general fear among the public they will be attacked and vehicles will be destroyed. If a collective drive against hartal emerges, no one can forcefully stop people from going to work or opening shops. We are looking to counter hartal using the legal channel as well.

The person who announces a hartal should be held responsible for the damage. Insurance coverage for the destruction is under discussion which will help traders and bus operators to function during hartal days,"" he said.

Private Bus Operators Association president M B Sathyan said private buses are ready to operate on hartal days. A discussion will be held with traders' organisation over sharing the damage incurred while operating buses on a hartal day. For bus owners, the hartal is a nightmare. It is estimated a bus owner suffers a loss of Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 from a hartal.

""A bus owner has to pay a tax of Rs 30,000 for three months, and the insurance amount is in the range of Rs 60,000 to Rs 80,000. The buses are bought by taking loans from banks for which a hefty interest is paid. For operators, the daily collection is important for survival and such strikes severely affect the revenue. Political parties have nothing to lose from the hartal. Already, due to low profit, the number of private buses is coming down annually. Earlier, when there were 30,000 private transport buses in the state, it has come down to 14,000 now,"" he said.

The tourism industry is the worst hit from frequent hartals as it incurred a loss of Rs 300 crore per day. As the tourist footfalls have already come down due to the Nipah scare and the flood, the industry cannot afford frequent hartals. ""Each day, there are around 70,000 tourists staying in the state.

On a hartal day, a huge number of tourist are jailed in their hotels. After suffering from the hartal, the tourists will not prefer to visit Kerala again. During a hartal last month, a convoy of German tourist was attacked at Kozhikode. Such incidents will directly affect the tourism industry,"" Abraham George, convenor of Kerala Tourism Task Force and member of National Tourism Advisory Council, said.

Recently, tourism stakeholders held a meeting in Kochi and passed a six-point resolution to withstand hartals in future. They also decided to file contempt of court against non-implementation of directives by the Supreme Court and High Court against hartal. Kerala Vyapari Vyavasai Ekopana Samithi (KVVES) which held a meeting at Kozhikode decided to observe 2019 as a hartal-free year. KVVES president T Naseeruddin said traders will cooperate with hartals no more.

""We have directed all the traders to open the shops on a hartal day. The buses will operate and industries will function. Only a joint effort can put an end to this practice,"" he said.

Driving with headlights on during day to register protest against hartal

Kochi: In a novel way of protest, those opposed to hartal will drive their vehicles with the headlights turned on during the day on Monday. Already publicised through social media, Say No To Hartal, the organiser of the event, is looking for mass participation.

Raju P Nair, who leads Say No To Hartal, said people who are against hartal can keep the headlight of their vehicles on during the daytime. ""By joining the campaign, people are not only expressing their protest against hartal, but also emphasising protection of human rights. Every Indian citizen has the freedom to work and travel which is violated during hartals. We expect all the persons who support the campaign to keep the headlights of the motorbike, car and bigger vehicles on during the daytime on Monday,"" he said.

A vehicle rally will be carried out at Kaloor Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium premises protesting against hartal around 9 am. Apart from it, district-level protests will also be carried out in the coming days. Say No To Hartal has been actively campaigning against hartal for the past eight years. The campaign is gaining popularity as more number of people are joining it every year."

Subrat Sahu, general secretary of Bargarh Cooperative Sugar Mills Employees' Union, said they have been facing severe financial crunch. ""We need money to manage our kids' education, running the kitchen and daily expenses of our families. We are in a miserable condition for the past 21 months,"" Sahu said.

""Our monthly salaries ranged between Rs 10,000 and Rs 20,000. Whatever savings we had, we have spent it. We desperately need our salaries and the mill too needs to be developed,"" he added.

""The state government had sanctioned Rs 6 crore in its supplementary budget this year for renovation of the mill. But nothing has been done so far for the development of the mill. We suspect the state government may have diverted the fund to Aska sugar mill in Ganjam,"" Sahu alleged.

He said in 2014 they had given a proposal to the state government to set up country spirit bottling plant in the sugar mill premises with an estimated cost of Rs 30 crore. ""This plant will change the fate of the mill and it can start making profit. But the proposal is in cold storage,"" he added.

The mill was crushing 1250 metric tonne of sugarcane to produce 8.5 tonne of sugar daily. It has stopped production since last year, a source said.

Cooperation minister S N Patro said the mill faced crisis due to depleting sugarcane production.

""Farmers in Bargarh are interested in paddy crop, so they do not bother about sugarcane crop. And this has caused the downfall of the mill. It became a loss-making unit and failed to pay the salaries of its employees,"" Patro said.

He further said the state government has sanctioned Rs 9 crore in two phases to pay the arrears and develop the mill's infrastructure. ""We are hopeful of sorting out the issue. We will have a meeting with the board of directors of the sugar mill and come up with a solution,"" he added."

But she realised that this education would have a lasting impact when digitised and integrated to a technology platform. To increase accountability, the foundation, in 2017, launched a single technology platform for the entire cycle of its training process -creating a plan, assigning resources, capturing the training sessions in real time as well as the metrics associated with them. ""No industry has a single technology platform that can do this, more so in the rural areas where Healing Fields operates,"" says Bosco.

Bosco leads a preventive health education program reaching over five million families in India. Her NGO is perhaps the only one producing and distributing sanitary napkins through community health entrepreneurs (CHEs). The foundation has commissioned its first fully automated sanitary napkin unit in Jigna in Mirzapur, Uttar Pradesh. The unit produces about 7,200 napkins a day, which the CHEs sell to have an income. ""It's not just about selling sanitary napkins. Our CHEs also educate women and girls on their use and safe disposal,"" says Bosco, who is also the secretary general of Healing Fields Foundation.

She concedes that finding dedicated trainers to work in the remote rural areas is a challenge as more lucrative opportunities are available elsewhere.

When he got married and had children, he found himself a job in a tea garden to take care of his family.

It was only in 2001 when his mother suffered a stroke and died because he could not get her to a hospital in time that Haque decided to do something. The Mal block (West) where he lives has a population of 400,000 and the nearest primary health centres are 15 kms away. That is if one is willing to cross the 590 metre wide Chel river on a makeshift bamboo bridge. The Mal subdivision hospital is a 45 km journey through Odlabari forests which also happens to be an elephant corridor. The health centres open for a few hours and there are no ambulances.

When a friend of his at the tea garden fell sick, Haque borrowed his manager's bike and took him to the hospital. And so began the journey of Bike Ambulance Dada.

Taking a loan from the owner of the tea garden, Haque bought a TVS bike and had a red cross sign and 'ambulance' painted on it. Some flashy lights and a blue beacon later, he was ready to ferry patients, mostly cases of snake bite, fire and road accidents as well as those who needed help. He also took training in first aid, enabling him to offer preliminary treatment for snake bites and burns.

Haque has ferried some 5,500 patients to hospitals till date. His services are available round the clock. Impressed by his efforts, Bajaj Auto gave him a bike with a sidecar that he got covered for protection against rain. He also had an oxygen cylinder and a medicine box fitted on to the bike.

Haque now wants to build a three-storeyed hospital and an old-age home for the poor with the money he will get from a planned biopic on his life. He also acts as a facilitator, connecting deserving students with wealthy patrons who sponsor their education; he has hel­ped 12 girls in this manner.

When the Union secretary called him up one day in 2017 and told him, ""Aapko Padmashri milne wala hai,"" Haque thought it was a prank call and said he did not want to meet either of them, Padma or Shri. Only when watching television later did he realise that he had won the national award. Political parties have offered him tickets and money, but he wants neither."

For generations, they passed on their history, poetry, folksongs and ancient wisdom that way. Much of this vast treasure trove of knowledge and information has already been lost because of the dying art of storytelling and the zeal of the early Christian missionaries. ""Though they introduced script to the Naga people, the early missionaries saw everything traditional as anti-Christian and prohibited it, from traditional songs to hairstyles to rice beer,"" said Tuisem Ngakang, a doctorate on Naga culture and former assistant professor with Hindu College in Delhi University.

So, camcorder in hand, 42-year-old Ngakang goes to distant Naga villages, interacts with elderly residents and requests them to sing old songs. ""Among Nagas, it is considered a duty of the elders to pass on what they know to youngsters. So, these people, mostly in their 70s and 80s, are only too happy to share,"" he said. Ngakang is on a mission -- to document and preserve whatever is left of the fast-vanishing folklore of the indigenous people.

A deep sense of urgency is visible among Naga tribes as they race against time to record whatever they can. But it's not easy, going by the vast number of local languages and dialects they have. There are about 35 Naga tribes in Nagaland, Manipur, Assam and Arunachal. D Koulie, professor of linguistics at Nagaland University, said there are 89 dialects in 89 villages of just the Angami Naga people. Koulie is also secretary of the Ura Academy which works to preserve Tenyidie -- the mother language of 10 tribes, including Angami, Chakhesang, Rengma and Zeliang.

In earlier times, when villages got congested, a member would venture out to establish another settlement. But it was taboo to set up a village without a new language. So, the same tribe would speak different languages in different villages, giving rise to numerous dialects. ""These dialects are morphologically similar but different phonologically. To preserve folklore, we ask students to visit their village homes, listen to the elderly and document stories and poetry,"" Koulie added. The Ura Academy regularly brings out journals and books documenting poetry, stories and dramas in Tenyidie. Easterine Kire, one of the foremost writers from the northeast, has collected 200 poems in Tenyidie that had been passed on orally.

Tangkhul Nagas of Manipur have embarked on a similar mission. Members of the Hao Folklore Society (HFS), formed in March this year, have visited 15 Tangkhul villages in the last five months. ""We met senior residents, recorded and archived folksongs, folktales, histories and genealogies,"" said HFS president Raising Shimri. HFS also tries to preserve traditional houses and artefacts. Members of the society include lecturers, media professionals, photographers and lawyers, and live in cities across India but return to villages to document and record the oral history of their people. Armed with sound recorders, DSLR cameras or just their cellphones, HFS members fan out looking for elderly people and requesting them to perform traditional songs and dances.

But there is a Himalayan task ahead of them -- they need to cover about 206 Tangkhul villages, each with different dialects.

Not all tribes, however, are so organised. The Konyak tribe of Mon district in Nagaland were the last to get introduced to the modern education system. Only some individuals have taken it upon themselves to preserve their folklore. Phejin Konyak has written a book on the last of the tattooed headhunters of her tribe, describing in detail the rituals involved and what the tattoo patterns mean. ""It is a solo effort,"" said Phejin.

Nzanmongi Jasmine Patton, an assistant professor at Gargi College in Delhi, too has taken the solo route. She has published a collection of 30 stories from her Lotha tribe in 'A Girl Swallowed By A Tree: Lotha Naga Tales Retold'. Though Lotha Nagas have Kyong Academy that is supposed to work towards preserving their culture, the 35-year-old writer said most effort regarding documentation is being made by Lothas individually.

As early missionaries prohibited institutions like morungs (traditional Naga youth hostels) and indigenous rituals, songs and music too disappeared soon. ""We have lost most of ritual music associated with events like rice-pounding or house-building,"" said Ngakang.

Koulie, who has written 21 books of which 18 are in Tenyidie, said, ""If you look at school curriculum, there is no material on tradition and folklore. Every Sunday we gather for sermons, but have no time for traditional stories,"" he said.

H Khehovi Yepthomi, advisor to the Nagaland government for tourism, art and culture, admitted nothing much has been done till now and Naga folklore ""is going to be extinct"" if proactive steps aren't taken. ""I have asked cultural officers to identify heritage sites and look for experts willing to document oral history."" The government has now decided to hold three-day mini Hornbill festivals in all the districts spread all though the year.

But hope comes with anxiety. Shimri said, ""Time is against us. It is disappointing when we reach a particular village to find a majority of the elderly have passed away, and along with them stories that have got buried forever."""

Vala.

While this fills the Congress quota in the coalition government's Cabinet, Janata Dal (Secular) has chosen to keep its options open on its quota of two Ministers.

Ahead of the 2019 general elections, the decision of the Congress to give prominence to north Karnataka has assumed significance as the JD(S) is largely focussing on its electoral base in the southern districts of the State. This is also aimed at addressing the constant complaints of neglect of the people of north Karnataka.

While M.T.B. Nagaraj (Hoskote, Bengaluru Rural) is the lone MLA to become Minister from the southern part of the State this time, the other newly sworn-in ministers are M.B. Patil from Babaleshwar in Vijayapura district; R.B. Timmapur, MLC; Satish Jarkiholi from Yemkanmardi in Belagavi district; C.S. Shivalli from Kundgol in Dharwad district; P.T. Parameshwar Naik from Huvinahadagali in Ballari district; E. Tukaram from Sandur in Ballari district; and Raheem Khan from Bidar North.

All eight were administered the oath of office and secrecy at the Raj Bhavan in the presence of Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, Deputy Chief Minister G. Parameshwara and several Congress and JD(S) leaders. All eight are of Cabinet rank.

Forest Minister R. Shankar and Municipal Administration Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi have been dropped from the Ministry.

Protest

There were rumblings of discontent from some legislators not inducted into the Cabinet even as the oath-taking ceremony was on. Supporters of the Congress MLA, Ramalinga Reddy, protested near the Raj Bhavan to demand his induction into the Cabinet.

With the Ministry's size fixed at 34, the Congress has filled its full quota (22) and the total strength of the Council of Ministers has increased to 32. Only two seats are vacant and both belong to the JD(S) quota.

Of the eight inducted, four have become Ministers for the first time. Mr. Satish Jarkiholi, Mr. Patil, Mr. Thimmapur, and Mr. Naik had served in the previous Siddaramaiah government.

Caste equation

The Congress struck a balance by providing fair representation to all major castes/communities. There are two Ministers from Kuruba community (Mr. Shivalli and Mr. Nagaraj), two from the Scheduled Castes (Mr. Naik and Mr. Thimmapur), two from the Scheduled Tribes (Mr. Tukaram and Mr. Satish Jarkiholi), one from Lingayat (Mr. Patil), and one Muslim (Mr. Khan).

To contain dissidence, the Congress has given postings to 31 legislators, including eight Ministers, nine parliamentary secretaries, and 19 heads to boards and corporations. The Congress has recommended to the government names of 19 MLAs to appoint as heads of various government boards and corporations.

The party has appointed three MLCs and six MLAs as Parliament Secretaries. Sharanappa Darshanapur, MLA for Shahpur in Yadgir, has been appointed as Deputy Chairman of the Planning Board.

Senior leader and former Minister H.K. Patil has been appointed as Chairman of the campaign committee of KPCC. He has replaced Minister for Water Resources and Medical Education D.K. Shivakumar.

Jewargi MLA Ajay Singh has been appointed as the special representative of the government in Delhi, while V. Muniyappa, MLA, is the Political Secretary to the Chief Minister."

Trilochan Mohapatra, Secretary of the Department of Agricultural Research and Education and Director General of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), has called upon farmers in the State to explore the potential of integrated farming with maximum diversification to meet challenges in the agriculture sector.

Opening a seminar on 'Fair agricultural practices' as part of the launch of the Advanced Facility for Post Harvest Technology at the Indian Institute of Spices Research (IISR) here on Saturday, Mr. Mohapatra, a prominent agricultural scientist, pointed out that the possibilities of combination crops should be tried at all possible fields, and that their export potential for more revenue should be explored.

""The Indian agriculture sector has grown to unparalleled heights, and we are not just producers to meet our own demands now. For a majority of farmers, export is a source of steady revenue to flourish,"" said Mr. Mohapatra. He added that research and inventions by agricultural scientists were opening doors to such a coverable progress in the country in terms of increased agricultural production and marketing.

""The only challenge now is the yet-to-be proportionate growth in revenue for farmers despite a rise in production. It is a problem of plenty which we can survive with better planning and marketing strategies,"" he pointed out.

According to him, focus should be laid on efforts to make farming lucrative with newer marketing strategies.

Speaking on research activities taken up by ICAR, Mr. Mohapatra said climate change had emerged as a major concern for farmers where researchers can contribute more in the future.

""The development and supply of seed varieties with strong resistance to unexpected climate changes continue to be a major area of research, and we have plenty of such newly developed plant varieties to support farmers,"" he said.

On the Centre's move to equip all research organisations better with the most effective tools for farmers, Mr. Mohapatra said one of the priority areas while facing unexpected challenges was the development of seed farms with public-private partnership. ""In the case of Kerala where the floods hit farmers' livelihood, the department had made all possible efforts to supply them with the required quality seeds and plants to venture again with confidence. We also initiated an impact study in the State to offer suggestions on addressing farmers' concerns,"" he said.

In 2016-17, the Department of Collegiate Education (DCE) procured laptops at ₹14,490 a piece which were distributed to 32,000 students belonging to the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities. It was during the 2017-18 budget that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah announced the distribution of 1.5 lakh free laptops for all first-year degree students and those pursuing professional courses.

Snags and red tape

The tender for the laptops for the previous academic year was initially called in February and there were no bidders. Manufacturers had reportedly sought changes in technical specifications. There was also a delay because of the model code of conduct for the Assembly elections.

A House committee was formed to look into the matter after the former Commissioner of the DCE M.N. Ajay Nagabhushan had objected to floating a tender with four packages.

He had written to the then Chief Secretary stating that a single tender for the laptops should be called. He had also pointed out that calling for a tender in four packages would lead to huge cost variations and increase the cost per laptop.

""Some States such as Tamil Nadu have procured laptops for around ₹12,500 a piece. So we have written to the department to see if we can call for one tender for both the academic years,"" the said a source."

Dr. Clark in Nagaland -- at Molungkimong village in 1872 -- was godsend.

The preacher's arrival in Nagaland, Rio said, had transformed Naga society through the spread of Christianity and education. The chief minister was at Molungkimong village to inaugurate the first 'Baptistery Annexe' on Saturday.

The Baptistery Annexe at Molungkimong is where the first Baptism in Nagaland took place on Dec. 22, 1872 when Clark baptised the first fifteen Christian converts.

Rio said that Nagas were headhunters then, living in isolation without a ruler or a government. The arrival of the American preacher during that time, he asserted, transformed Naga society.

The chief minister also said that though the Christian community in India constitutes only 2.5% of the country's population, no government in the Centre could ignore them because 'Christians are the most advanced community.' He added Nagas are part of that 'special and powerful community.'

Speaking on the current context of Naga society, Rio observed that Naga groups, both 'underground and overground', are thoroughly divided. He said that Nagas still have traits of ""animal instinct and barbaric attitude"" that causes quarrel and fight among them instead of learning from the teachings of Jesus Christ.

The chief minister encouraged the people to ponder whether they will remain mere followers of the Christian religion or be true Christians in spirit following the values and teaching of Jesus Christ.

""As Christian, we believe in God. But if our belief and our action do not go together, I think we are destroying ourselves,"" Rio asserted.

He also expressed hope that the differences among the Nagas can be solved, and the people united through the common platform of Christianity.

Rio also called upon the church leaders to remind themselves about Naga history and rededicate their life to Christ.

On behalf of the state government, the chief minister also extended Christmas greetings to the people of Nagaland. ""Let this Christmas be a special Christmas for every individual,"" he said.

The chief minister was accompanied by ministers: Tongpang Ozukum, Metsubo Jamir, CM Chang and advisor Imnatiba.

Rio also visited the monolith placed at the 'First Gospel Path' in memory of the 60 warriors from Molungkimong who first escorted Clark; the 'First Gospel Gate'; the 'First Chapel Monument' and Rev. Dr. EW Clark monument. Later in the day, Rio held a public meeting with the villagers.

The Indian Institute of Spices Research (IISR) has come up with three new research products to fight various diseases affecting the production of cardamom, ginger and black pepper in Kerala.

The three products -- Lecanicillin-G, Bacillich and Pochonin-L -- were released by Trilochan Mohapatra, Secretary of the Department of Agricultural Research and Education and Director General of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), during his visit to the IISR campus on Saturday.

Lecanicillin-G will be available to farmers for the biological control of cardamom thrips.

The field application technology was developed using a naturally occurring entomopathogenic fungus isolated from cardamom thrips and identified as Lecanicillium psalliotae.

Scientists associated with the technology say the treatment with the fungus is on a par with synthetic chemical insecticides.

The second product, Bacillich, is useful in controlling bacterial wilt in ginger caused by Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum.

The bacteria was isolated from the apoplastic fluid of ginger and identified as Bacillus licheniformis. According to scientists, the use of this technology is eco-friendly and very effective in combating bacterial wilt pathogen.

Pochonin-L, a liquid formation for biocontrol, is effective in preventing root knot which is prevalent in south India's pepper gardens.

Currently they are managed through the application of chemical nematicides.

The fungus attacks all stages of nematode egg, parasitizes the eggs and sedentary females.

Scientists with the IISR associated with the research say the development of liquid formulation technology is a huge success.

The provisional patent application is with the patent office and the technology is ready for commercial application, they add."

A government order released in connection with this stated that there will no more re-employment of teachers who retired at the age of 58. The practice of re-employing retired teachers began in 1959 when there was a shortage of teachers and government found it difficult to find replacements in the middle of an academic year.

Earlier, on Saturday the state government had denied permission saying there was an apprehension of a law and order situation if the yatra was carried out. The state also said that if the yatra was carried out for 45 days with the participation of organisations such as RSS and Bajrang Dal, it could give rise to communal flare-ups.

Following this BJP resorted to High Court again and a single bench of Justice Tapabrata Chakraborty gave the conditional permission on Thursday.

The lawyer for state police cited Lal Krishna Advani's rath yatra during the 90s which sparked much violence and claimed 13 lives including that of a police officer. He said that it was not an ordinary rally or meeting and was rather a mixture of politics and religion.

However, after today's order there is uncertainty once again over the 'yatra' that was to cover all 42 Lok Sabha constituencies in the state ahead of the 2019 general elections.

The division bench of Chief Justice Debasish Kargupta and Justice Shampa Sarkar Friday quashed the single bench order and asked it hear the case afresh to consider intelligence inputs by the state agencies. The division bench also asked the single bench to dispose of the case expeditiously.

State education minister Partha Chatterjee said that people were not in BJP's support. ""They themselves are trying to deteriorate law and order situation here. Any such attempts will be strictly dealt with,"" he said.

CPI(M) MP Md Salim said that it was only a poll campaign for BJP and the TMC had ended up providing them a lot of support. ""If they want to carry out a poll campaign why veil it with a 'rath yatra'? The TMC has destroyed democracy in Bengal and that has helped in the ascent of BJP here,"" he said."

During the event, three technical sessions were organised on themes such as ""Transformation in Higher Education through Technological Innovations: Recent Trends and Future Scope for a Knowledge Society"", ""Creating Workforce for Tomorrow: Need to Exploit Industry-Community Collaborations"" and ""Technology, Law and Excellence for Sustainable Development"".

The business session discussed important issues concerning higher education and made a set of recommendations to AIU.

The universities commenced first-semester classes of degree programmes by June end after completing the centralised admission process, which included three rounds of allotment. The first, third and fifth semester examinations were completed in the months of November and December.

Steps were also initiated to publish the third and fifth-semester degree results in December and that of the first semester by January 2019. For this, centralised valuation camps were organised by all universities in November by providing holidays for 10 days for affiliating colleges.

All universities have begun efforts to conduct the final-semester degree examinations in March, of which the results are expected to be published before April 30 to provide adequate time for graduates to pursue higher studies. Besides, Kannur University has gone a step further by focusing on declaring the third-semester results of postgraduate courses by January 10.

The Pro Vice Chancellors resolved to share inputs of the best practices implemented in the universities in the realm of academic and examination reforms.

The bar-coded answer scripts used by Kannur University and the method followed by the Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat) for preparing the academic and examination calendar were cited in this regard.

It was also observed that the the system of split vacation (November-May), practised by the Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit (SSUS), improved the conduct of examination and publication of results.

As per the report -- released on October 31 -- India moved up 23 spots to 77th position as compared to 100th in 2017 and improved its rank in six out of ten parameters relating to starting and doing business in the country.

The Corporate Affairs Ministry has contributed towards starting a business, insolvency resolution and protection of minority interests.

To provide greater 'Ease of Doing Business' to all stakeholders, bring about greater transparency in corporate structure and better corporate compliance so as to enhance the efficiency of the processes under Companies Act, 2013, the Corporate Affairs Ministry took several landmark initiatives during the year.

Among the significant ones were Companies (Amendment) Act, 2017, Companies (Amendment) Ordinance 2018, establishment of National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA), amendments in Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, eKYC drive for directors of all companies and speedier processing of incorporation related applications, uniformity in application of rules and eradicating discretion.

Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2017 was assented by President Ram Nath Kovind on January 3, 2018 and was enacted as the Companies (Amendment) Act, 2017 (CAA-17).

The Act contains total 93 sections of which 92 have been brought into force along with relevant rules.

Framework reviewed A committee to review the existing framework dealing with offences under the Companies Act, 2013, in its report recommended that the existing rigour of the law should continue for serious offences, covering six categories, while for lapses that are essentially technical or procedural in nature, mainly falling under two categories may be shifted to in-house adjudication process.

This would serve the twin purposes to promote Ease of Doing Business and better corporate compliance.

It would also reduce the number of prosecutions filed in the Special Courts, which would, in turn, facilitate speedier disposal of serious offences and bring serious offenders to book.

Based on its recommendations, the Government decided to promulgate an Ordinance.

Accordingly the Companies (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018 was promulgated on November 2, this year.

The Ministry also proposes to introduce a Replacement Bill (Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2018) to replace the Companies (Amendment) Ordinance 2018 in the ongoing Winter Session of Parliament.

During the year going by, the President also gave assent to promulgate Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance.

Insolvency and Bankruptcy process has taken good shape since 2017 and is a fast evolving legislation.

A major factor behind the effectiveness of the new code has been the adjudication by the judiciary.

The Code provides strict time limits for various procedures under it.

In this process a rich-case law has evolved reducing the scope of legal uncertainty.

The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2018 notified on January 19 replaced IBC (Amendment) Ordinance which further amended provisions relating to prohibition on certain persons from submitting a resolution plan, so as to provide more clarity.

Insolvency Further, second amendment was also done by the way of ordinance in August, 2018 on the recommendations of Insolvency Law Committee.

The Ordinance was promulgated to balance the interests of various stakeholders in the Code, especially interests of home buyers and micro, small and medium enterprises, promoting resolution over liquidation of corporate debtor by lowering the voting threshold of committee of creditors and streamlining provisions relating to eligibility of resolution applicants.

The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 has replaced IBC (Amendment) Ordinance.

In the wake of accounting scams and frauds in the corporate sector, National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) was notified as an independent regulator for auditing profession which is one of the key changes brought in by the Companies Act five years ago.

The NFRA will review the quality of corporate financial reporting in certain classes and sub classes of companies and take disciplinary action against auditors/audit firms for not discharging their statutory duties with due diligence.

The Government has constituted this Authority and has prescribed NFRA (Manner of Appointment and other Terms and Conditions of Service of Chairperson and Members) Rules, 2018 and NFRA Rules.

R Sridharan and Dr Prasenjit Mukherjee were appointed as Chairperson and full-time member respectively of NFRA on October 1, this year.

The Ministry to provide for faster and transparent processes, introduced a web base service named as 'Reserve Unique Name' to make the Name Reservation process speedy, smooth, simple and reduce the number of procedures with effective from January 26, 2018 for companies and from October 2, 2018 for LLPs (Limited Liability Partnership).

Re-engineering It also introduced steps such as re-engineering the process of allotment of DIN, exemption of MCA fee for company incorporation, deployment of e-forms due to IFSC & exemption notifications, amendment to Companies Act, CRL-1, implementation of Condonation of Delay Scheme, eKYC drive for directors of all companies, Integrated form for LLP (FiLLiP) incorporation, and setting up Central Registration Centre (CRC) for 'name reservation' and 'incorporation' for LLPs.

During the year, the Ministry in order to speed up matter related to resolution of bankruptcy and insolvency, proposed setting up of eight special courts under the National Company Law Tribunal to deal with the insolvency cases.

These courts are proposed to be set up in Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata and Hyderabad.

To facilitate timely resolution of disputes, it is envisaged to set up exclusive IBC Courts under the NCLT benches of Delhi, Mumbai to start with and step up infrastructure of NCLT.

The aim is also to strengthen the insolvency process for faster resolution of NPAs.

To bring more transparent accounting, the Ministry has notified Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) 115 which would be effective from April 1, 2018.

Ind AS 115 is a new revenue recognition standard for customer contracts in line with the International Financial Reporting Standards which will help in more transparent accounting of revenues with an impact on companies operating in diverse sectors, including technology, real estate and telecom.

As part of bringing about greater transparency in corporate structure and in view of advantages of dematerialisation of securities, especially in terms of KYC and investor protection, the Government's focus on 'Digital India' and the enabling provisions, the Ministry has amended the relevant rules to apply the dematerialisation requirements to unlisted public companies, in addition to listed companies.

In the latest case, District Child Protection Officer Kanhu Charan Rout has lodged a complaint against Maa Ambika SC/ST Residential School, Sidhal for running a school by producing forged documents, harassing and humiliating students.

The school was opened in 1992 and the management of the residential school had obtained NOC by submitting a fake land document and other infrastructure. After obtaining NOC from the District Education Officer, Jagatsinghpur, the Board of Secondary Education gave permission to conduct examinations. Meanwhile, the villagers brought allegations of lack of facilities and harassment of students by engaging them in the agriculture field or domestic work.

They alleged that school authorities have pressed the children, including girls, in domestic work and cultivation of paddy crops in the land. The students were also tortured when they refused to do these activities. The parents also alleged that though the strength of the residential school is about 170 from Classes I to X, the stipend of Rs 1,200 was being availed against 300 students.

Acting on the complaint, Collector Yamini Sarangi sought details on the school's infrastructure like toilets, kitchen, drinking water facilities, boundary wall, safety measures and other documents in August.

The school was also asked to comply with the shortcomings within 15 days but the management failed to do so following which the administration obtained permission from the Government and closed the school.

Despite the closure of the school, the management was running it illegally. Inspector-in-charge of Jagatsinghpur police station Rajani Kant Mishra said after receiving allegations, police registered a case against the president, secretary and headmaster of the school as their names are mentioned in the FIR under Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act and an investigation is on."

The single bench of Justice Tapabrata Chakraborty said that the BJP has to ensure that peace is not disturbed and the party has to take responsibility, along with the state government, for any damage caused to public property during the yatra.

The court has also asked the state government to ensure tight security for the programme and asked the BJP to inform district officials concerned 12 hours before the entry of the raths in the respective districts.

Justice Chakraborty also asked BJP to ensure that their programme does not cause traffic woes.

Rubbishing the state government's apprehension that the yatra will cause communal tensions, the court observed that the programme couldn't be stopped based on a single intelligence input from Coochbehar.

The court dismissed the state government's cancellation of permission to the rath yatra on December 15.

Hailing the verdict, Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh, ""There will be no violence from our side. But the state government has to ensure that we are not attacked during the rath yatra. If they fail to provide security, we have to protect ourselves.""

New Delhi: Former coal secretary Anil Swarup has told ThePrint that former Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) Vinod Rai was wrong in ""determining loss to the public exchequer"" in the coal block allocation scam and had made ""a public spectacle relying on half-truths"".

Swarup admitted that there was something wrong in the allocation of coal blocks between 2004 and 2009 but slammed Rai for releasing the CAG report on the issue in a press conference (in 2012), saying that as a civil servant, one's job is to do work quietly and not ""go to town"" with reports such as these.

""It is true that something wrong had been done committed and it was the duty of the CAG to detect it and bring it before Parliament,"" Swarup said. ""However, making it a public spectacle was uncalled for. The grand-standing was inappropriate.""

The former civil servant also tweeted that Rai's stance had ""devastating consequences"" for governance.

The CAG report on the scam, popularly dubbed Coalgate, suspected illegal allocation of coal blocks between 2004 and 2009 when the UPA was in power under then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The CAG initially estimated the loss to the exchequer to be around Rs 10.7 lakh crore but later revised this figure to Rs 1.86 lakh crore.

Swarup disputed the CAG's figures on the loss, saying the cost of coal mining varies greatly depending on several factors, which include the type of mine, transportation cost and quality of coal.

He underlined that the CAG arriving at an average cost was inappropriate, adding that the ""faulty calculations"" led to the cancellation of even those mines for which there were no takers subsequently.

""The cost of coal mining by Coal India (CIL) ranges between Rs 400 and Rs 4,000 a tonne,"" he said. ""Every mine is different and the cost of production is different, so the audit of each mine too should be different. One cannot average it out.""

Swarup said that the cost of mining is usually determined by ""overburden"", which he explained as the rock or soil above a coal mine.

""The deeper the coal, the more expensive the mining process gets,"" he said. ""So each mine is different and when one talks of auditing, then for a proper calculation, each mine has to be looked at individually, something that was completely ignored by the CAG.""

He also stated that despite the then coal secretary mentioning before the Parliamentary Committee about a significant difference in the quality of coal in the blocks with the CIL and those given to private parties for captive mining, CIL numbers were used as the benchmark.

Swarup said that the average numbers were used in a rush to give a report.

""If they would have done a mine-wise analysis, allocation of only those mines where there was a windfall gain would have been cancelled,"" he said. ""There were mines where there were huge margins and their allocation deserved to be cancelled but since all mines were treated the same and we ended up dumping all the allocations.""

CAG Rai, Swarup alleged, appeared to be on a fault-finding mission, even in situations where none existed.

""The CAG was trying to find differences where they did not exist. Some of the mines did not even have any losses but still they were taken into account, which shows that he was deliberately trying to find faults where there were none,"" he said.

He stated that Vinod Rai wrote in his book, Not Just An Accountant, that ""all the records showed was that the committee met, deliberated and merely recorded the name of the block allotted to a company, and the state where the end-use plant existed"". This, Swarup said, is how the minutes of a meeting are actually recorded.

Swarup said that the arrest and conviction of officers such as Harish Chandra Gupta, former coal secretary, was ""ridiculous"" as the law he has been booked under has been amended and there is no evidence of him having received any gratification.

""The law under which he (Gupta) was arrested stands changed. It was amended because it was unjust,"" Swarup said. ""Also, the substantive part is that there is no evidence in the case of any quid pro quo.""

He further stated that Gupta could have been booked for an ""administrative lapse"" but cannot be booked for criminal liability.

""To book him under a criminal case like this, there has to be some ill intent, malafide intent, which cannot be proven in this case,"" he said. ""So, it is absolutely unjustified to arrest a civil servant and shatter his confidence.""

After merger of 4,600 primary schools, the Jharkhand government is planning to shut over 6,466 middle schools (classes 6 to 8), having less than 100 students.

These schools would be merged with upgraded high schools in phases, starting with the institutions, which have less than 50 students, education department officials said on Thursday.

Initially, 3,732 middle schools having less than 50 students would be undertaken for merger. The process of merging has already been started.

""Merger is an effort to provide quality education to students in a better educational ambience. Jharkhand has around 411 such middle schools where number of students is less than 10. If these schools are merged with high schools, students would get better education,"" said state education secretary AP Singh.

""As per the rules in the right to education (RTE), there should be at least three trained graduate teacher (TGT) in middle schools where number of students is less than 100. It means, we would have to afford additional Rs 18 lakh on teachers' salary even in the schools where number of students is less than 10, which is not logical,"" he added.

The decision comes at a time when the opposition parties and critics have been criticising the state government for merging the primary schools. Several ruling party elected representatives have also been lobbying with the government against the move. There have been protests in several parts of the state as well, against merger of schools.

The officials, however, argue that, ideally, there should be one middle school and five to seven primary schools in a panchayat. As many as 6,466 middle schools have been identified in Jharkhand, which could be merged with high schools within a 5-km radius in a panchayat, Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) officials said.

The state government has decided to offer bicycles to the students, who would be shifted to other schools so that they do not face any trouble in commuting to the school.

Meanwhile, the JEPC officials said they have completed the merging exercise of 4,600 primary schools.

JEPC director Uma Shankar Singh said there were 39,600 schools in 2016-17 under education department in Jharkhand. ""Of them, 18,000 schools had 60 or few students. These schools had an average of 1 or two teachers per school. Providing quality education was a major challenge. One teacher was handling four to five classes at a time. How could one expect a better education in these schools,"" he said.

The council said four-step process including field inspection, cross-district verification, block and district consultation and final notification to merge the schools.

Singh said 98% students from the 4,600 primary schools have been shifted and 96% students have expressed satisfaction with the consolidation. ""We faced difficulty to shift 150 students due to some technical reasons. Now, the issue is resolved and 120 students were shifted,"" he said.

The reorganisation of primary schools benefited seven lakh students with better teachers' availability and reduced the requirements of teachers by 4,500. Besides, the process saved government's Rs 400 crore through reduced teachers and infrastructure requirements, JEPC officials said.

Education Dept ropes in IIM Ranchi for merged school evaluation

State education secretary AP Singh said the department has roped in Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ranchi, for evaluation of the merged schools. The IIM, Ranchi would see if the reorganization process brought any difference in improving the education of students, who were shifted in merging process.

He said IIM Bangalore has also expressed willingness for a study of the reorganization process and its benefit."

At the urging of George Simkins, a local dentist, Kiser invited Charles Sifford, an African American pro golfer, to play the tournament that year. It was a bold move because the Professional Golfers' Association had a ""Caucasians only"" clause in its membership requirements.

""It was a significant moment and followed closely on the heels of the sit-ins,"" said Irwin Smallwood, former managing editor of the News & Record who covered golf at the time.In a 2001 interview, Kiser told Smallwood that the Sedgefield Country Club, where the tournament was held, did not allow African Americans. The club told Kiser, who was a member, that Sifford couldn't come through the front door and couldn't eat in the dining room. Kiser said he wasn't going to let club policy keep him from giving Sifford status treatment.""I told him that when you get here, I'm going to meet you out front and you and I are going to walk into the pro shop together,"" Kiser said in the interview.He said that is exactly what they did.Kiser's move to let Sifford play the tournament brought criticism. He even got an anonymous threat to his family.""There were hecklers in the crowd. There were threats,"" said former mayor Jim Melvin who served with Kiser on the Jaycees. ""The tournament still went off without a hitch. He did a great job.""Six months later, the PGA lifted its exclusion of African Americans.Kiser was a golf advocate and was secretary of the International Golf Sponsors Association and member and former president of the Green Coat Club.As much as Kiser is remembered for the 1961 ground-breaking tournament and his time with the Jaycees, he is perhaps better appreciated for his support of the Fellowship Hall, a private residential treatment facility for those recovering from alcohol and drug addiction.During his 30-year affiliation with the facility, Kiser was a member of the board of directors and served as the secretary, vice president and president.

""He was a dear, dear person,"" said Altina Layman, director of development for the facility. ""He was a strategic thinker. His passion was helping other people.""In addition to his own support, he helped raise funds for the facility, which named an addition after him.""He gave it a lot of leadership and got it over some difficult times,"" Melvin said. ""That was his cause in his later life.""Kiser's ability as a fundraiser came naturally; he had a career in sales and marketing for several companies including Boren Clay Products.From 1988 to 1992, he served several positions, including president, for the Brick Association of North Carolina, which at the time was the largest such organization in the country.

Kiser was a graduate of Greensboro High School, now known as Grimsley High.

This shows that the department itself has not taken any major step besides issuing advisory in the case. ""She did not delay taking the action. The moment parents of the survivor told her, she immediately reported the incident to the police,"" a senior official told TOI.

However, this does not match with the statement the in-charge gave to the CCPCR. In her statement, she had said that after the parents reported the matter on October 22 she handed over the case to the school's sexual harassment committee. Then the in-charge telephonically reported the matter to the DEO office. However, a letter was also given to the DEO on October 25. On October 26, media reported the case and then the FIR was registered. CCPCR had sent letters recommending strict action on December 17 while the transfer orders were issued on December

18. The reason stated for the transfer was ""mistresses (being senior most) are hereby assigned the duties of the in-charge in the schools."" Another person has been made in-charge of the school in her place.

Earlier the CCPCR, despite being the right authority, had refrained from acting tough against those responsible for the delay in reporting of the case and had left the onus to decide action on authorities concerned.

As per former members of the commission, inclusion of officials from the UT education department, health and other departments in the CCPCR has led to show leniency in a serious case.

Amit had been with Video Volunteers (VV) since 2012 and reported for Newscode and OK Times and sometimes also drove a taxi for Ola Cabs.

Amit Topno was shot dead on 9 December in Ranchi.

Amit reported fearlessly on issues like sand mining, illegal alcohol sales, adivasi rights, education, sanitation, human trafficking, land rights, culture and most recently the Pathalgadi movement. His last report for VV was produced six months ago on the Pathalgadi, a movement in which adivasi communities across Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh asserted their right to self-governance. The movement has its roots in creating awareness and ensuring implementation of the key provisions of the Panchayats (Extensions Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 that empower a village as an administrative unit.

Like many of VV correspondents, besides being a community journalist, Amit was a social activist too. He followed up his video reports with on ground action to solve the problem he was reporting. He held community screenings, conducted village meetings, assisted the community in writing applications and approaching government officials and worked towards ensuring accountability. His efforts solved 45 percent of the problems he reported on. It made schools safer and encouraged the administration to deal with issues like the human-animal conflict in the area.

Those who knew Amit remember him as an inquisitive, warm, fun loving and an extremely helpful and courageous individual. ""Jharkhand is a land caught up in a frightful storm. Its people are being whirled around in a storm of starvation, conflict and poverty. I am the headman of my village, Nichitpur, Jharkhand, and I'm tired of seeing my people die,"" Amit had said in an interview in 2014.

Amit's body was found on the Namkum-Doranda road in Ranchi on 9 December. The autopsy report reveals that he was shot in the head and the bullet was still lodged in. The nature of the injury revealed that he was shot at close range. The autopsy report also stated that there were no signs of struggle or scuffle, not even a scratch. His taxi, phone and identity cards were missing but not the money. '

All of this, points to a pre-meditated and professionally-executed murder. It has been over 11 days since his murder, but no arrests have been made in the case yet, even though the police have said that they are closing on some leads.

On 14 December, more than a 100 people, including social movement leaders, activists, journalists, students and members of the VV network participated in a silent candlelight march to protest his murder. At the march, Jerrome Kujur, Dayamani Barla, Deepak Bara spoke out about the frequent threats and harassment of activists and journalists in Jharkhand. They urged the state to conduct a thorough investigation into this case and bring Amit's murderers to justice.

On 15 December, 2018, a delegation of civil society organisations, including VV, met with the superintendent of police and urged him to conduct a thorough and speedy investigation into Amit's murder. The SP assured that all possible angles will be investigated.

On 17 December, 2018, the Jharkhand Jantantrik Mahasabha organised a peaceful protest in Jamshedpur. Friends and allies of Amit also submitted an application to the National Scheduled Tribe Commission urging them to take note of the gruesome murder. Civil society organisations appraised this matter to the Chief Secretary of Jharkhand government and other ministers on 19 December 2018. Arup Chatterjee, an MLA from Nirsa Dhanbad, was handed over documents related to Amit's work and he has promised to raise the issue in the upcoming winter session of the assembly starting on 24th December.

Though Amit had not informed his network of any threat or danger to him in the last 18 months, it cannot be ruled out that he was murdered because of his work as a journalist and social activist, raising issues affecting communities on the margins and working in an area, where conflict over land, resources is rife. In November 2018, another journalist from the same area was murdered. At a time when India ranks 14th on the Global Impunity Index, Amit's murder is a reminder that journalists who speak to truth to power and report out of remote, rural areas are not safe.

A Muslim woman from North Goa on Thursday alleged denial of right to appear for the National Eligibility Test (NET) with hijab by the authorities in Panaji.

In a complaint addressed to Nila Mohanan, Secretary for Education, with copies marked to various other authorities, Safina Khan Saudagar (24), a writer and a post-graduate degree holder in Psychology, narrated the entire sequence of events that allegedly led to her being denied entry to write the NET earlier this week.

At a press conference in Panaji on Thursday, she said she would write to Union Minister for Human Resource Development Prakash Javadekar and approach Goa State Human Rights Commission over the issue, ""so that such injustice does not affect other persons, irrespective of communities, in future"".

She said women of different faith have had to bear the brunt of ''derogatory'' rules and forced to remove their belts, hair-clips, jewellery and sacred threads.

Upon reaching the gates at 1:30 pm on Tuesday, Ms Saudagar said she was denied entry during the security check and was asked to remove her hijab (religious head covering) to go ahead for the examination. When she informed the man that she cannot take off her hijab as it pertains to her religious belief and modesty, he insisted that she remove it. His senior officer, a lady, asked her to comply or she would not be allowed to answer her exam, she said.

""She informed me that my ears need to be visible for a photograph and I agreed to it. I asked them to show me to a washroom to be able to redo my hijab to accommodate their request, but they refused and instead asked me to do it in the open with no privacy,"" said Ms. Saudagar.

She was further told that she would have to sit through the entire exam without her headscarf or she would not be allowed to answer, she added

""Article 14 of the Indian constitution provides that I be treated equally. Article 21 of the Indian constitution provides that I cannot be deprived of my personal liberty. Articles 25-28 provide that I have freedom to practice my religion. Therefore, such behaviour is unacceptable in a secular State and is a matter of harassment,"" Ms. Saudagar said in her complaint.

She further said that there were no rules specified on the NET website or elsewhere with regards to restrictions on the hijab or a particular dress code. If there were changes made to the rules, the candidates should have been informed of the same much prior to the examination date, she said.

Ms. Saudagar also pointed out that she was in a hijab in the photograph attached to her online application, and if there had been a change in rules, her application should not have been accepted and the reason should have been specified.

""It has cost me time, effort, money and has also raised questions on my religious identity, humiliated me and belittled my beliefs. Furthermore, I have appeared for NET exam previously, there were no such restrictions forced upon us then. I would like to know on what basis was I not allowed to appear for the exam when there are no specific rules mentioned,"" she asked the authorities in her complaint.

""I would want to know on what authority did the officials at the gate decide to restrict me from answering. I would like to know if it were a matter of security, why weren't arrangements made to protect a woman's modesty or religious belief with no disregard to security measures when it could have been made possible,"" she asked.

When contacted for her reaction to the complaint, Ms. Mohanan initially said that she could not comment till she saw the complaint. When contacted later in the evening on Thursday, Ms. Mohanan added that she had been extremely busy with a Cabinet meeting on Thursday and had not seen the complaint till then.

However, she assured The Hindu that she would see Ms. Saudagar on Friday, discuss with the Department and then respond."

With the objective to recognise the dynamism and enthusiasm shown by the government and major enterprises in aggressively pursuing their plans of digital transformation, The Indian Express Group and the Government of West Bengal jointly organised the Emerging Tech Conclave, in Kolkata. The two-day conference saw partcipation of senior leaders from the state government, including Dr Amit Mitra, Minister-in-Charge, IT, Electronics and e-Governance; Finance; Industry, Commerce & Enterprises; Micro Small and Medium Enterprise and Textiles, Government of West Bengal, and Debashis Sen, IT Secretary, Government of West Bengal, along with many illustrious names from the Indian corporate sector.

In his keynote address, Sen focused on the use of emerging technologies, e-commerce model for e-rickshaw services, a hackathon and Python coding classes in schools. ""We are having a hackathon which we call 'Bengalathon'. One of the problems that we have given to the participants to solve is 'totos-on-call'. Can we not have an e-marketplace for totos? Most of these totowallahs don't have smartphones, and no app runs on a non-smartphone. So how do we solve it? That is the challenge that we have posed in our hackathon, or Bengalathon,"" Sen stated.

Further, Sen spoke about creating an ecosystem for emerging technologies which will directly provide jobs and development in the economy. ""The government, through Webel, has already started an animation academy called Webel DQE Animation Academy. Moreover, we are eager to propose that 'Bengal means Blockchain', and are considering blockchain use cases in the government sector for property, financial transactions, crowdfinancing the public projects, and much more,"" he mentioned.

The conclave was also attended by Anant Goenka, Executive Director, The Indian Express Group and other dignitaries. A panel discussion, 'Idea Exchange with CEOs', was moderated by Goenka. Manish Prakash, Managing Director - Healthcare, Education and Public Sector, Microsoft India; Kamal Nath, CEO, Sify Technologies; Deepak Maheshwari, Director - Government Affairs, India, ASEAN & China and Srikanth RP, Group Editor, Express Computer & CRN, were part of the panel. The panelists discussed various challenges faced by government organisations and how emerging technologies could help in solving those issues. Nath said, ""Emerging technologies are the next big wave to bring about change; they are unavoidable for economies and nations. These will create new jobs and would need a new and smart approach. Artificial intelligence would require a lot of data made available to everyone, everywhere, and tools and algorithms to provide smart intelligence from data."" The panel discussion concluded by giving the success recipe for West Bengal to be the technology hub.

Emerging technologies

A panel discussion on 'Using emerging technologies (AI, blockchain, IoT, analytics) for digital transformation' was moderated by Kirti Patil, Executive Vice President & CTO, Kotak Life Insurance. Basant Chaturvedi, Head - Information & Communication Technology, Perfetti Van Melle India spoke about the capabilities of AI to churn huge data and how organisations with structured data can bring beneficial results. Hiren Shah, Head- IT, Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management and Bhupendra Pant, former CIO & VP, IT, Welspun Corp were the other panelists. ""Businesses need to first identify the business pain point to roll out AI. It is also critical to clean up data. If data is treated the right way, then it can be next to oil. Startups are at the edge, with the best technologies. Businesses need to change their vendor strategies,"" Chaturvedi added.

In his session, Alok Khanna, Executive Director - IS, Indian Oil Corporation, spoke about how technology can make an impact, with the government and the public sector taking firm decisions to bring about change.

People-centric applications

The highlight of ETC 2018 was a fireside chat between Goenka and Dr Mitra, who highlighted how the West Bengal government is focusing on people-centric applications in adopting emerging technologies and its goal is to take these technologies to the grassroot level.

Responding to a question raised by Goenka on how difficult it had been for the state government to work with major IT companies, Dr Mitra stated, ""After seeing the transparent tendering process here, technology companies are flocking to Bengal to compete for orders.""

Speaking about adopting emerging technologies, the Minister said, ""We are looking at where we can apply blockchain. We have massive amounts of land records and want to explore whether it is possible to use blockchain for this; and the healthcare sector. We are also looking at adopting blockchain in the city's traffic control system."" In the process of soil testing for agricultural growth in the state, the government will explore high-end technologies like AI.

The Minister said it was not easy for the Trinamool Congress government to change the mindsets of the people and the government employees after coming to power in 2011, by defeating the 34-year-old Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left Front. ""I think the change has been huge, the challenge was also huge. The year before we came to office, the man-days lost were '78 lakh due to strikes. It took two years to bring that to around 5,000 man-days lost in a full year. Within the fourth year, it reduced to zero, and has persisted to be zero,"" said Dr Mitra.

The keynote address on the second day was given by VS Parthasarathy, Group CIO & Group CFO, Mahindra & Mahindra, who spoke about how traditional businesses get disrupted by just one spark of the digital. ""Emerging technologies are impacting the society, people, governance and businesses,"" he said, adding that he believed in the federation and enabling the workforce, by allowing them to learn and re-learn.

A power discussion by Avaya, was attended by IT leaders from across the country. Adarsh Kaul, India & SAARC Lead Marketing, Avaya spoke about the perceptions organisations consider when they are looking at deepening the customer experience. He further interacted with the participants in order to understand their approach on digital to enhance the customer experience.

Bibek Agarwala, CFO, Raymond won the 'Express Digital CFO Awards,' hosted at the conference.

Rise of the digital CFO

The conference explored the rise of the digital CFO, who plays a strategic role in data-driven value creation (turning data into insights), cross-functional collaboration (enabling real-time virtual collaboration while being compliant) and cybersecurity. For CFOs, digital technologies will also play a key role in capital allocation, measurement of value creation and in proactively addressing risk and better management using centralised dashboards and digital workflows; and getting real-time alerts using analytics. A panel discussion on 'How CFOs are using digital technologies to transform finance' was moderated by V S Parthasarathy, Group CIO & Group CFO, Mahindra & Mahindra. The participants were Rajendra Kamath, Group CFO, Reliance Retail; Ramesh Bafna, Senior Director Finance, Flipkart; Indroneel Dutt, CFO, Cleartrip; Bibek Agarwala, CFO, Raymond; and Rashmi Joshi, CFO and Whole Time Director, Castrol India.

Joshi said, ""AI and robotics will reduce the decision-making time. Emerging technologies offer numerous pockets to drive the business, provided the technology is chosen carefully."" Agarwala, added, ""Do not forget the existing business, please adopt the technology and do not just straight away change. Be flexible, take the risk, but not at the stake of compliance.""

In his special session on 'New age CFO: Digital transformation - strategy, approach, and tools', Srinivas Phatak, Group CFO, Hindustan Unilever spoke about the new dimensions introduced by data and technology, which are leading to value creation and protection. ""In this digital world, CFOs are required to be pragmatic and disruptors, at the same time, being reluctant and risk-taking. Harnessing the power of data is an asset for organisations. The fundamental change is coming through the adoption of technology to create and protect the value. Finance roles have to be strategic leaders who partner with the business and run it,"" he said.

In a special address on 'Best practices from digital transformation,' Jayanta Banerjee, Global CIO, Tata Steel, affirmed that digital transformation cannot happen without a strong IT background, as digital has to ride on a fundamental IT backbone. ""IT and digital vision is aligned to the organisation's long-term objectives and has to move the transformation from instinct to initiative. We have gone 100 per cent on the cloud, which is giving the company scale, speed and agility,"" Banerjee mentioned.

""IT and finance; one is blood and other is flesh, and together they keep the organisation breathing and beating,"" stated Parthasarathy in his closing remarks.

That's nature. The chill springs a surprise sometimes and prolongs. Such a situation warrants better insulation -- which in political terms is called introspection, a review of the wrong steps to put the best foot forward. That's precisely what the BJP is doing after losing three Hindi heartland states in the assembly elections, barely six months before the party goes to the voters for a second term of Narendra Modi's government.

The defeat in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the states the BJP was ruling for more than a decade, and in Rajasthan has made the larger Sangh parivar restless. After enjoying the shared fruits of power, the signs of disaffection are showing and voices of dissent are getting expressed openly. The Rashtriya Swyamsevak Sangh (RSS), the BJP's ideological fountainhead, had trained itself to peacefully co-exist with the Modi government in the past four years. It is getting impatient too. Questions are asked about what the government plans to do in the next four months to stem the tide and stay in the reckoning for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

It was the obvious question, but the answers are fairly unconvincing as of now. ""The assembly election results are being analysed to study the impact of issues like agrarian distress, GST, Dalit anger, upper caste disillusionment and the Ram Mandir. Only then a strategy will be fine-tuned for the big battle,"" says a party general secretary. Then again, he parries this poll defeat as nothing ""serious"" for the BJP, although it lost to its principal political rival, the Congress, which is staging a comeback after the face-loss in the 2014 parliamentary polls. ""Rajasthan has the tradition of changing the government every election. It was touch and go in Madhya Pradesh. Chhattisgarh had a BJP government for long and people probably wanted change,"" he explains.

A senior Sangh functionary that Outlook spoke to was more forthright. His analysis includes the Prime Minister and party chief Amit Shah. The RSS leader portends a big change even if the BJP comes to power in 2019. ""It will be a BJP government and not a Modi government."" He digs out Shah's statement at the party's national executive in Delhi in September that the BJP will win 2019 and ""no one will be able to remove us for 50 years"". And takes a dig at it. ""Tall promises and poor delivery have led to a crisis of confidence in the Modi government. A crisis of perception can still be fought electorally but not that of credibility. The way things stand today, a second term for the party looks difficult, leave alone a 50-year-rule for the BJP. You can't brag about ruling the country for half a century; you let your work do the talking.""

""Ram Mandir will continue in the backdrop, though the message to rein in fringe elements has gone out to the leaders on the ground.""

But most BJP and Sangh leaders do not foresee any major change of track ahead of the general elections. ""It's too late for the leadership to change their attitude even if they want to. The attacks on Congress and Rahul Gandhi will continue. The Rafale row will have to be handled smartly to stump the Congress. With the government a step closer to getting Vijay Mallya, that will be bandied about as a feat even if he does not return before the polls. Ram Mandir will continue in the backdrop, though the message to rein in fringe elements has gone out to the leaders on the ground,"" a party general secretary reveals.

Moreover, there could be a renewed and gentler ­attempt to keep the NDA allies happy and reach out to new friends. Party leaders agree that the alliances need to be worked on and it is also required to keep internal dissent under check. The general feeling is that though not much can be done about new policies at this stage, the government will reaffirm its existing schemes such as the Ujjwala subsidised cooking gas for poor families or the Swachh Bharat cleanliness drive. The Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme will be the focus area. ""Healthcare policies have won and lost elections the world over. The government will try and get it in order before the elections,"" says a BJP leader.

Since economic policies are perceived to have dented the BJP's fortunes in the assembly elections, crisis management may be done to signal a course correction. The Swadeshi Jagaran Manch (SJM), a Sangh affiliate, believes the government has focused more on industry rather than agriculture, and is paying for it. The SJM national convener Arun Ojha says farmer unrest and unemployment were factors that went against the BJP. ""We are not in favour of farm loan waivers. It is not a good tradition. A farmer takes a loan and avoids repaying, thinking the next government is going to write it off anyway. Instead input costs must be reduced as these have increased substantially,"" he says. There are reports that farmers in Chhattisgarh, where the Congress promised a loan waiver, had not only stopped repayment of loans but also the sale of paddy in the hope of getting a higher value later.

The Bharat Krishak Samaj, which has been working closely with the BJP, agrees with the SJM argument. Its executive chairman Krishan Bir Chaudhary says the Modi government promised remunerative prices for crops while the Congress announced loan waiver in three states where it came to power. ""Loan waiver cannot be the answer to address farm distress; neither is announcing higher MSP (minimum support price) for crops. In any case MSP helps less than 10 per cent of farmers. The only way to help farmers is to fix compulsory reserve price with a strict penalty clause, for crops, particularly staples like onion, potato and tom­ato, and also milk. This alone will help improve farm income and address farm distress,"" he suggests.

The government lost no time in appointing Shaktikanta Das, a former finance ministry point man, as RBI chief after Patel quit.

The BJP had promised education reforms and more job opportunities ahead of the 2014 polls. These remained the government's major drawbacks. ""Today a person with an engineering degree is unemployable. No effort has been made to link education with jobs. The government's term is almost over and it hasn't been able to come out with its education policy,"" says SJM's Ojha. He suggests creating jobs through small and medium industries, another sector unhappy with the government because of issues such as the goods and services tax (GST) and the 2016 demonetisation of two high-value notes that wiped out more than 80 per cent of the cash in circulation.

Among the myriad issues besieging the government, the economy is pinching the most. The government is already on damage-control mode with the Prime Minister announcing plans to bring 99 per cent of goods in the sub-18 per cent GST slab. ""Basically in Madhya Pradesh and to some extent in Chhattisgarh, the vote was against GST. Demonetisation could have been a part of it, but GST definitely influenced the vote,"" says Dr Narendar Pani of the National Institute of Advanced Studies. Opinion on this is divided, though. Anirban Ganguly, director of the Syama Prasad Mookerjee Research Foundation (SPMRF), says: ""The government had the gumption to take hard decisions as long-term strategy, including demonetisation or GST. It is essential to keep persisting on the discourse of development.""

BJP leaders believe the political discourse has graduated to the next level. It is now about performance and development, though these are hidden under a narrative of brutal barbs politicos throw at each other. The advisers are keen that development, particularly efforts to improve the lot of the deprived classes, should remain the focus of attention in the months ahead. The head of a government-affiliated financial think-tank feels that ""there's little economic option before the government. It is too late to spend money to make an impact. It is too late for the government to be able to create a counter-narrative to the Opposition's campaign and promises of farm loan waivers and other assurances"".

Upset over the trend of 'competitive politics' that banks on populist measures, Ganguly says the BJP's stand ""has always been pro-farmer because consistently and incrementally we have been focusing on them. Modiji's focus has always been on the marginalised and we are going to persist with that. How it is going to be seen on the ground is difficult for me to say"".

Besides the farm sector, the government seems keen to uplift the business mood with more money. Ahead of the state election results, the government appointed former economic affairs secretary Shaktikanta Das as the new RBI governor after predecessor Urjit Patel stepped down. At a discussion org­anised by the SJM, several participants expressed hope that the new RBI boss would ease interest rates, bring more liquidity in the market, give impetus to lending in the MSME (micro, small and medium enterprises) sector, and review and restructure non-performing loans (something that came to a pause after the federal bank took a tough position against restructuring bad loans in February). A point of contention during Patel's tenure was the government's reported demand for Rs 3.5 lakh crore from the RBI reserves to tide over the financial crunch.

This may remain a niggling topic. ""Even if the government receives money from the RBI, it will take time for the state machineries to be geared up, get the programmes rolling. The government would have to improve the delivery system, including direct cash transfers,"" an official source says. ""In case of farmers, they would have to have the support of state governments. As it is, all the universal welfare schemes that reach out to the people have already been applied.""

BJP leaders admit that a large section of the party is keen that the delivery system of government programmes has to be improved in the next four to five months to bring about a change in public perception. But they also admit that the task is tough. It is well-known why delivery does not happen. Is it not a little late in the day to rectify the situation to make a difference on the ground and win back electoral support? The answer perhaps will come next summer.

In pursuance to objective of providing greater "" Ease of Doing Business"" to all stakeholders, bring about greater transparency in corporate structure and better Corporate compliance so as to enhance the efficiency of the processes under Companies Act ,2013 , the Ministry of Corporate Affairs ( MCA) has taken several landmark initiatives / decisions during last one year ( January-November ,2018) .

The important ones are Companies ( Amendment ) Act ,2017 , Companies ( Amendment) Ordinance 2018 , establishment of National Financial Reporting Authority ( NFRA) , amendments in Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code , eKYC drive for Directors of all companies and speedier processing of incorporation related applications , uniformity in application of rules and eradicating discretion.

India has improved its ranking on the World Bank's ""Doing Business"" 2019 report released on 31st October, 2018. As per the report, India has moved up 23 spots to 77th position as compared to 100th position in 2017 by improving its rank in six out of ten parameters relating to starting and doing business in India. Ministry of Corporate Affairs has contributed towards starting a business, insolvency resolution and protection of minority interests.

The details of Year-long achievements for Ministry of Corporate Affairs are as below:

Till date, all sections of the Companies Act, 2013 [CA-13] except one section viz. Section 465 have been notified. Part of section 2 [clause 67(ix)] and part of section 230 [sub-section (11) and (12)] are yet to be commenced.

COMPANIES (AMENDMENT) ACT, 2017:

Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2017 was assented by Honourable President of India on 3 January, 2018 and got enacted as the Companies (Amendment) Act, 2017 [CAA-17]. The CAA-17 contains total 93 sections. Till date, out of total 93 sections of CAA-17, 92 sections have been brought into force alongwith relevant rules. Commencement of one section (section 81 - relating to Nidhis) and parts of section 23 and 80 of CAA-17 requires amendment in 3 sets of Rules and Forms notified under the Companies Act, 2013 which requires examination in the Ministry and is likely to take some more time. The Ministry proposes to notify section 81 of CAA-17 and part of section 23 of such Act along with relevant rules by 31 December 2018.

The Committee to review the existing framework dealing with offences under the Companies Act, 2013 and related matters submitted its report to the Union Minister for Finance & Corporate Affairs Shri Arun Jaitley. The Committee broke down all penal provisions into eight categories based on the nature of offences. The Committee recommended that the existing rigour of the law should continue for serious offences, covering six categories, whereas for lapses that are essentially technical or procedural in nature, mainly falling under two categories may be shifted to in-house adjudication process. This would serve the twin purposes promoting of Ease of Doing Business and better corporate compliance. It would also reduce the number of prosecutions filed in the Special Courts, which would, in turn, facilitate speedier disposal of serious offences and bring serious offenders to book. The cross-cutting liability under section 447, which deals with corporate fraud, would continue to apply wherever fraud is found. Most sections under review and recommendation have been notified for commencement. Based on the recommendations of the Committee and to achieve objectives of promotion of Ease of Doing Business and better Corporate Compliance the Government decided to promulgate an Ordinance. Accordingly the Companies (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018 was promulgated on 2.11.2018.

The MCA proposes to introduce a Replacement Bill (viz. Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2018) to replace the Companies (Amendment) Ordinance 2018 in the Winter Session (2018) of Parliament.

INSOLVENCY & BANKRUPTCY

In year 2018, the President gave assent to promulgate Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018.

Insolvency and Bankruptcy process has taken good shape since 2017 and is a fast evolving legislation. A major factor behind the effectiveness of the new Code has been the adjudication by the Judiciary. The Code provides strict time limits for various procedures under it. In this process a rich- case law has evolved reducing the scope of legal uncertainty.

E-GOVERNANCE

To provide for faster and transparent processes, the MCA took the following major initiatives towards Ease of Doing Business and standardisation:

a. Introduction of ""RUN - Reserve Unique Name"" web service for name: Introduced a web base service name as ""RUN - Reserve Unique Name"" for making the ""Name Reservation"" process Speedy, Smooth, Simple and reducing the number of procedures with effective from 26 January 2018 for Companies and from 2 October 2018 for LLPs (Limited Liability Partnership).

b. Re-engineering the process of allotment of DIN: Re-engineering the process of allotment of DIN by allotting it through the combined SPICe form only at the time of an individual's appointment as Director (in case he/she doesn't have a DIN).

c. Exemption of MCA fee for company incorporation: A Government process of Re-engineering has been implemented where zero fee for incorporation of all companies with authorized capital upto Rs10 lakh or those companies with no share capital but have upto 20 members.

d. Deployment of e-forms due to IFSC & exemption notifications, amendment to Companies Act, CRL-1, implementation of Condonation of Delay Scheme (CODS): 16 e-form changes were deployed on account of IFSC notification related changes, Exemption notification related changes, and Companies Act amendment along with deployment of CRL-01 (Information to the Registrar by company regarding the number of layers of subsidiaries) and CODS 2018 in the month of Feb-Mar '2018.

e. eKYC drive for directors of all companies: MCA has introduced a mandatory eform viz. DIR-3 KYC for all DIN holders who have been allotted DIN on or before 31st March 2018 and whose DIN is in approved status. This drive is aimed at verification of individual DIN holders and weed out non-existent/dummy DIN holders and ultimately to clean up the Directors' e-Registry. The KYC process is obtaining additional details such as AADHAAR, Passport, personal Mobile Number and personal E-mail ID. Further, for stakeholders who do not possess AADHAAR, an exception management is provided. There are around 33 Lakh DINs in the registry and around 15.88 Lakh DIN holders have filed DIR KYC as on 30 November, 2018. In this drive, MCA managed to seed 11 lakh Aadhar card holders. This is one of its kinds of drive carried out anywhere in India.

f. Integrated form for LLP (FiLLiP) incorporation: Introduction of a new integrated Form christened FiLLiP (Form for incorporation of Limited Liability Partnership) replacing the erstwhile Form 2 (Incorporation document and subscriber's statement) combining therein 3 services of name reservation, allotment of Designated Partner Identification Number (DPIN/DIN) and incorporation of the LLP.

g. Setting up Central Registration Centre (CRC) for ""name reservation"" and ""incorporation"" for LLPs: CRC for ""Name Reservation"" and ""Incorporation"" of Companies has been successfully implemented. As operation of CRC has been stabilised, since past two years, Ministry has taken up similar GPR exercise for ""Name Reservation"" and ""Incorporation"" for LLPs (Limited Liability Partnership) and brought under the operation of CRC. The Government Process Re-engineering (GPR) exercise is in pursuance of the ministry's objective of providing greater ""Ease of Doing Business"" to all stakeholders and has resulted in speedier processing of incorporation related applications, uniformity in application of rules, and eradicating discretion.

NATIONAL COMPANY LAW TRIBUNAL

To speed up matter related to resolution of bankruptcy and insolvency, MCA proposed setting up 8 special courts under the National Company Law Tribunal to deal with the insolvency cases. These courts are proposed to be set up in Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata and Hyderabad. The proposal aims to reduce the mounting burden on the tribunal despite it having 11 benches all over India. To facilitate timely resolution of IBC cases, it is envisaged to set up exclusive IBC Courts under the NCLT benches of Delhi, Mumbai to start with and step up infrastructure of NCLT. The aim is also to strengthen the insolvency process for faster resolution of NPAs.

INDIAN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In order to bring more transparent accounting, MCA has notified Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) 115 which would be effective from 1st April 2018. Ind AS 115 is a new revenue recognition standard for customer contracts in line with the International Financial Reporting Standards which will help in more transparent accounting of revenues with an impact on companies operating in diverse sectors, including technology, real estate and telecom. Objective of Ind AS 115 is to establish the principles that should be applied when reporting useful information to users of financial statements. The standard requires an entity to recognize revenue ""to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services""

DEMATERIALISATION OF SECURITIES OF UNLISTED PUBLIC COMPANIES

In order to bring about greater transparency in Corporate structure and in view of advantages of dematerialisation of securities, especially in terms of KYC and investor protection, the Government's focus on ""Digital India"" and the enabling provisions available under section 29(1)(b) of the CA-13, the Ministry has amended the relevant rules to apply the dematerialisation requirements to unlisted public companies, in addition to listed companies. Consultation were held in this regard with all stakeholders and rules were amended on 10 September, 2018 to mandate, w.e.f. 2 October, 2018, issue and transfer of securities by unlisted public companies in demat form only.

INVESTOR EDUCATION & PROTECTION FUND

The Investor Education & Protection Fund (IEPF) Authority unveiled its new logo in 2018 to provide for strong brand presence and recognition. The IEPF authority also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the CSC e-governance Services India, wherein the latter would identify village level entrepreneurs for investor awareness projects, among other activities. MCA is actively looking at further reforms in IEPF.

To review the existing claim settlement processes a committee of practicing company secretaries was constituted through the Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI). The committee had reviewed the existing processes and have recommended that the entire process should be made online with e-verification of the claims by the companies, online PAN based verification of the claimant etc.

A new portal namely www.iepfportal.in has been developed for increasing the outreach of IAPs and monitoring the programmes conducted by the professional institutes, CSC e-governance and other partner institutions. The portal provides access to the partner institutions like ICAI, ICSI, ICoAI& IICA and CSC e-Governance for uploading the details of past & future programmes.

COMPETITION MATTERS:

To enlarge the scope of debate of competition in India and to bring the best practices from around the world on competition issues, Competition Commission of India (CCI) successfully hosted the 17th International Competition Network (ICN) Annual Conference in March 2018 in New Delhi. Around 500 professional attended the conference from 70 plus countries, which included heads of competition agencies, representatives and stakeholders consisting of legal and economic professionals, international organizations and academics.

The MCA constituted an Inter-Ministerial Committee for carrying out ""Competition Assessment of existing policies"" under the chairmanship of Shri. Ramesh Abhishek, Secretary, Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion with representation from seven other Ministries/Organizations on dated 1st June, 2018. The prime focus of the Committee was to conduct a review of select Acts/Rules/Policies/Regulations formulated in the recent past and some upcoming acts to look into issues of anti-competition aspects and to focus on any restrictions/provisions in laws that pose great threat to competition.

Further, in pursuance of its objective to ensure that legislation is in sync with the needs of strong economic fundamentals, the Government constituted a Competition Law Review Committee under Shri Injeti Srinivas, Secretary Corporate Affairs on dated 1st October, 2018. The Committee is mandated to review the Competition Act/Rules/Regulation, to look into international best practices and sectoral interfaces etc.

Competition Commission of India (CCI) has amended the Combination Regulations. The post amendment regulations among others includes permitting withdrawal of notice and refilling the same by parties, allowing submission of voluntary modifications in response to notice, appointing agencies to supervise implementation of modification etc.

As part of competition Advocacy initiative at national and state level, CCI organised Roadshows in Mumbai, Delhi and Ahmedabad, including a National Conference on ""Public procurement and Competition Law."" Similar Roadshows with focus on competition matters are being held periodically and more are planned to be held in the coming months."

In the chapter ""Hail Caesar!

""However, he is known to be more interested in powerpoint presentations than in reading voluminous files. This is a pity. It means that he does not grasp the nuances that are stored in institutional memory.

He says the government of India administration is driven by three centres: one, the prime minister and his PMO; the finance minister and his ministry; and three, the Planning Commission.

A politician used to head the Planning Commission earlier, but now it has been silenced and replaced by the Niti Aayog, where Modi has placed people who have zero influence on governance, Sinha says adding that leaves only two drivers of government.

The veteran politician, who had quit the IAS to join politics, observes that everyone knows how the finance minister's influence in government has declined to almost zero and he is unable to push things even in his own ministry.

""After all, why his finance secretary Hasmukh Adhia was involved in the infamous demonetisation exercise, the finance minister himself was in the dark.

Modi, he says, is unfortunately a man who is impatient with institutions. His faith in himself blinds him to the fact that he is not a king, that he is only the head of a parliamentary party with a majority that enabled it to form a government, and which is prescribed with limits by the Constitution that has inbuilt checks and balances.

Sinha says the cabinet is collectively responsible to parliament. But as an institution it has been turned into a rubber stamp for the prime minister's decisions.

""It is said that most cabinet ministers are not allowed to speak unless an item of their ministry is up for a decision.

The November 2016 demonetisation of high-value currency, for instance, was revealed to the cabinet only minutes before it was announced to the nation -- at no stage was it discussed with the collective political brains trust of the government.

He feels perhaps a wider discussion would have made it more effective in achieving any of the goals that Modi set for it again and again during that surreal winter.

Sinha refers to another big decision which took the concerned minister by surprise was the BJP's withdrawal of support to the PDP government in June this year with whom it was in a coalition government in Jammu and Kashmir.

""The home minister, who historically has been so important that he (L. K. Advani) has also been deputy prime minister, had just days earlier visited Jammu and Kashmir energetically with a peace initiative in mind. As soon as he heard the decision -- like everyone else, as it was breaking -- he scampered off home, unwilling to face his bureaucrats or the media.""

Sinha also refers to the ""most cavalier treatment"" of External Affairs minister Sushma Swaraj who was the leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha. ""She is trolled by lunatics on social media, and Modi goes on to congratulate some of those trolls for their activity on the internet on his behalf. She is not only kept out of important policy decisions, she does not even travel abroad with her Prime Minister.""

This, he says, was in stark contrast to Vajpayee, who invited Sinha as foreign minister to accompany him on every foreign trip. He also observes that Modi did not take the Defence Minister into confidence while deciding on buying 36 Rafale fighter planes from France. ""Vajpayee would never have done such a thing. But then it is my mistake to compare Modi to Vajpayee.""

Writing about the campaign carried out by him along with former minister Arun Shourie and activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan on the Rafale deal, Sinha says, ""despite Anil Ambani sending a 'cease and desist' notice to all and sundry on this clear case of undue favouritism, the nation awaits Modi's response."""

Irate family members and relatives of a 16-year-old boy who died at the Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital on Thursday resorted to a road blockade on the Vazhuthavur Road alleging medical negligence on the part of the hospital.

The victim A. Manibharathi, hailing from Velan Nagar in Saram, was studying Plus One in the Navalar Nedunchezhian Government Higher Secondary School in Lawspet. Manibharathi was returning from school on Monday when he consumed a chocolate offered by a stranger. However, he fell ill after consuming the chocolate and his mother Jayalakshmi and sister Manju took him to the Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital at Kathirgamam. The doctors on duty treated him and sent him home. As his condition did not improve, the family again went to the hospital for the next two days and he was treated as an outpatient and sent home.

When Manibharathi's health deteriorated on Wednesday, his family rushed him again to the hospital where he died while undergoing treatment.

On information, the victim's relatives, along with Kathirgamam MLA N.S.J. Jayabal and former MLA Ashok Anand, resorted to a road blockade in front of the hospital on Vazhuthavur Road on Thursday alleging medical negligence.

Mr. Jayabal expressed his displeasure over the shortage of doctors and lack of facilities at the hospital and said this had resulted in the death of several patients visiting the hospital over the last one year. He said the doctors on duty had not provided proper treatment to Manibharathi and accused them of negligence.

The agitators also demanded that disciplinary action should be initiated against the doctors who were on duty and that the post-mortem examination should be conducted under the supervision of a magistrate at Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (Jipmer).

Later, Mr. Jayabal and Mr. Ashok Anand, accompanied by the relatives of the victim, met hospital director Dr. V. Govindaraj demanding an investigation into the boy's death. Dr. Govindaraj said that a report would be submitted to the Health Secretary and if any negligence was found on the part of doctors, action would be initiated against them.

The hospital also agreed to the relatives' demand that the post-mortem examination be conducted at Jipmer following which they withdrew their protest. Traffic was disrupted on the Vazhuthavur Road for over an hour due to the blockade."

Chudasama gave credit for the achievement to the efforts by Vice-Chancellors of Universities and faculties for enabling Gujarat top in the state. He also said that coordination between Education department, Industries department and Department of Science and Technology has been key to encourage startups, particularly student startups in the state.

State education secretary Anju Sharma told DNA that in about one and a half years, state government has reached out to 74 institutions as a part of outreach exercise to draw students towards startups, reaching out to over 2.45 lakh students.

""It is for the first time that students in tier 2 and tier 3 cities have got a level playing field to convert their ideas into startups. We have created entire pipeline for converting ideas into startups,"" said Sharma. Till now students have proposed 1,879 projects, of which 540 reached Proof-of-Concept stage, 351 patents have been filed so far and 51 startups have emerged out.

However, other actors in the startup ecosystem say that Gujarat has a lot to do to really emerge as an attractive hub for startups.

Sunil Parekh, who played a key role in the execution of state's Startup Policy said that involvement of local industries is lacking.

""The way IT businessmen in southern states have integrated themselves with startups is not happening in Gujarat. That informality and connection is inevitable to create a sustainable startup ecosystem,"" Parekh told DNA.

He, however, acknowledged that of late serious startups have also come up, which is an early indication of emergence of a mature ecosystem for startups.

Manish Shah, vice-president of LJ Group of Institutes said that efforts to link startups with markets are badly needed.

Government, local companies and chamber of commerce should also try to act as a market for startups. On why Gujarat does not have any blockbuster startup, Shah said that such startups are in the field of IT where Gujarat is lagging behind and so there is no such startup to be showcased."

The Lok Sabha on Thursday passed the long-pending Consumer Protection Bill 2018, paving way for effective protection of consumer rights and safeguarding their interests.

Speaking to DNA, Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general, Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), said, ""Since the introduction of the crucial bill in the Parliament, we have lobbied a lot for its passage at the earliest. It is noteworthy that the bill has been passed by the Lok Sabha. Hopefully, it would be passed in the Rajya Sabha soon.""

The bill focuses on three important points. One, it aims at strengthening the rights of the consumers and it is important that the consumer rights need to be protected. Second, the inclusion of severities in the bill against misleading advertisement. Third, the bill will check adulteration.

The development is crucial especially in the current scenario wherein consumers are forced to go through the hassles of getting defective products replaced and/ or claiming refunds in addition to misleading through deceptive advertisements.

The bill puts the liability of product quality on manufacturers, said Pritee Shah, chief general manager, Consumer Education and Research Centre (CERC). While e-commerce marketplaces will be responsible for the sale of counterfeit products, celebrities will also be responsible, along with the advertisers, for endorsing a product.

""Manufacturers will have to be diligent before the launch of products. They will have to mandatorily recall faulty products. In the case of misleading advertisements, companies will have to withdraw advertisements and bring in corrective advertisements. Celebrities will not be able to blindly endorse products. They can seek clinical reports from manufacturers before endorsing,"" said Shah.

When contacted, executives from HUL, ITC, Dabur, Marico, Mondelez, Godrej, Samsung, LG and Panasonic were not available for comment. Queries emailed remained unanswered at the time of going to print.

It certainly is a necessary a wake-up call for consumer goods makers to become more responsible, said N Chandramouli, chief executive officer, TRA Research, a brand insight company. The onus gets clearly pinned on the company, but more importantly, if convicted, the brand's trust also will get impacted.

""Consumer should be the ultimate yardstick for judging any such act. And if the consumer has a better say, it's a good thing. However, there can be truant customers too, and companies will have to deal with a small portion of such false claims. All-in-all, if the companies become more responsible towards consumers, it is a good move,"" said Chandramouli.

The bill proposes the creation of five bureaus catering to different consumer verticals. These bureaus will have suo motu authority to take actions against unfair trade practices and even force companies to recall products. Moreover, the jurisdiction has been liberalised. Cases of up to Rs 50 lakh will be dealt with District Forums, those up to Rs 10 crore by State Commissions and those beyond Rs 10 crore will be dealt with by Central Commission. With online sales getting traction, e-commerce marketplaces will be liable for selling counterfeit and illegal products as well.

The bill has strong provisions to check adulteration and misleading ads penalise manufacturers with a hefty fine as well as imprisonment. ""False claims in advertising is as bad for customers as false news is for readers. Such falsity misuses inherent vulnerabilities in the consumer, who inherently trusts brands, till proven otherwise. Claims must be based on strong research by credible third-party studies and not by the brand's own studies. This is perhaps the most important part of the bill,"" said Chandramouli.

Knowing the loopholes in the law, consumer companies have been misusing it so far. Be it packaging, advertising or POPs, the gullible consumer is being taken for a ride by many big and small brands alike. ""We've all been taken in by claims like -- 'Strongest', 'Best', 'Improved', 'Extra iron added' so far. Now it's time for brands to be cautious about claims like this,"" said Chandramouli.

The Consumer Protection Bill has strong provisions to check adulteration and misleading ads, and to penalise manufacturers with hefty fine as well as imprisonment. Making use of the loopholes in the law, consumer companies have been misusing it so far."

These days, Sagar Singh frets about the academic future of his daughter who studies at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Delhi's Cantonment area.

""There are hardly any teachers there. She often tells me that kids sit clueless as teachers are forced to teach subjects they themselves don't understand well. I wonder if she will remain underprepared for challenges ahead in life, he said.

Singh sums up the crisis in Delhi government schools which have only 35,034 regular teachers against a sanctioned strength of 64,096. A shortage of 29,062 regular hands (45.34 per cent) has left the teachers exhausted and students vulnerable. A total of 15,04,627 students are enrolled in 1,024 schools run by the AAP government.

There are 22,016 guest teachers that take the existing number to 57,050 but they work on daily-wage contracts that must be renewed every year. Even if guest teachers are factored in, Delhi government schools are short of 7,046 (10.99 per cent) teaching hands.

Saroj Sharma, a primary teacher at a Greater Kailash school said, On several occasions, I have had to teach higher-secondary class subjects. We are overworked and stressed. We are filling in for many others. School heads are aware of the crisis, but nothing has been done.

Neeru Loriya, a teacher coordinator at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in RK Puram Sector 4, also said that several subjects are not being taught properly. Barkha Kumari, a Class VI student at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Rohini said, My Class has 50 students. We need more teachers to ensure we're taught well. It's not that the government isn't working at all. After the Aam Aadmi Party came to power in Delhi in 2014, the government has built 48 schools.

But where are the teachers? We have sent several reminders to the government. Nothing has happened, said a teacher at a Pusa Road school. Most regular posts are filled through promotions. But they have not happened since 2013, he said.

Sanjay Goel, head of the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) told Mail Today, We're aware of the problem. Each year, guest teachers are being enrolled to minimise the shortage. Avdhesh Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, also said, There is a problem. But the government is hiring guest teachers to tackle it.

But facts tell a different tale. In July, the Delhi government had announced that schools would get 9,000 guest teachers by mid-August. It did not happen. Hiring guest teachers is anyway no solution to this huge crisis, said Ajay Veer Singh, general secretary of the last Government School Teachers' Association (GSTA) elected in 2014. GSTA elections have not taken place since 2014.

So its demands have not been heard effectively, its office-bearers claim. We have asked for elections. But education department officials have not paid any heed. The future of government school teachers is dark, said Singh. GSTA has a three-year term.

Radhakrishnan on Thursday told the Commission of Inquiry looking into the death of Jayalalithaa that ambulances were not stationed outside the Poes Garden residence of the former Chief Minister as she was a private person who did not want others to know about her health condition.

N. Raja Senthoor Pandian, lawyer for V.K. Sasikala, said that Mr. Radhakrishnan had told the Justice (retd.) A. Arumughaswamy Commission that he had said that he had not known that Jayalalithaa's health had deteriorated alarmingly. Mr. Radhakrishnan, who had appeared as a witness for the second time, recalled that the late Chief Minister had attended two events the day prior to her hospitalisation: one where she distributed books to government schools and another where she flagged off two new lines of the Chennai Metro, attended by then Union Urban Development Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu.

Mr. Radhakrishnan said had he known that the late Chief Minister's condition was as bad as it was later revealed, he would have had an ambulance on standby outside her residence, despatched a team of government doctors to attend to her and taken her to a hospital. He said that the downturn in the Chief Minister's health was unexpected.

Mr. Radhakrishnan clarified why he reached Apollo Hospital only at 5 a.m. on September 23, 2016; Jayalalithaa had been admitted the previous night.

The Health Secretary clarified that he had stayed away as the late Chief Miniser had not wanted any government officials present during a visit to the Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research the previous year. At the time, Jayalalithaa had returned home the same day; Mr. Radhakrishnan decided to visit Apollo after he realised that the late Chief Minister had indeed been admitted.

Later, during an interaction with journalists, Mr. Radhakrishnan mounted a passionate defence of the treatment provided to Jayalalithaa as he had noticed mistakes in news reports on the treatment and death of the former CM.

He said that there was no conflict between the opinion of the doctors of Apollo and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. Mr. Radhakrishnan pointed to multiple reports of AIIMS doctors -- even on the day before the Chief Minister's cardiac arrest -- to say that Jayalalithaa did not need interventional procedures, including an angiogram.

Mr. Radhakrishnan said the option of taking Jayalalithaa abroad for treatment was discussed in the first week of October. The health secretary said that London-based intensivist Dr. Richard Beale was of the opinion that the facilities provided to Jayalalithaa in India were no less in comparison to what would have been made available to her abroad. To add to that, moving her at the time was considered highly risky as she was on a ventilator and hence, no decision was taken. The Health Secretary said that, as far as he knew, the Chife Minister declined to be taken abroad once she was conscious."

Kushwaha told a crowded news conference held at the Congress headquarters in Delhi that his party will contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections as part of the Mahagathbandhan (Grand Alliance) in Bihar.

Apart from the Congress and the RLSP, the other major parties in the grand alliance are the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM).

The alliance is expected to pose a challenge to the ruling NDA that comprises the BJP, the Janata Dal (United) of Nitish Kumar and Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), which has served the BJP with an ultimatum of finalising a seat-sharing pact by December 31.

Seat-sharing talks between the constituents of the Mahagatbandhan are expected to begin soon.

The Kushwaha community constitutes 6% of Bihar's 100 million-population, according to the 2011 Census.

The RLSP won three of the four seats it contested in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. It defeated the RJD, which finished second in all the three constituencies. In all, the NDA won 31 of the 40 Lok Sabha seats from the state.

Kushwaha's party also enjoys electoral support in other regions of the state. In the 2015 assembly elections, the party contested in 23 constituencies spread across 17 Lok Sabha seats. While it managed to win just two of them, it came second in 19 seats and third in one. Its vote share was more than 20% in most of these seats.

On the day the UPA displayed its renewed strength, the BJP stepped up its efforts to placate Paswan and his son Chirag. BJP chief Amit Shah met Paswan while party general secretary in-charge of Bihar Bhupendra Yadav held discussions with Chirag. Finance minister Arun Jaitley attended a meeting of the leaders at Shah's house. ""There is no unhappiness [in the NDA],"" Paswan told reporters at Parliament complex earlier in the day.

According to BJP?leaders aware of the developments, Jaitley is likely to hold another round of talks with Paswan and Chirag. He will have a separate meeting with Bihar CM?Kumar, who is expected to arrive in Delhi on Friday. An announcement on seats is expected before December 31.

Shah announced last month that the BJP and Nitish Kumar's Janta Dal (United), which returned to the NDA last year, will contest equal number of seats in Bihar. He did not disclose the number, but leaders in the two parties claim the BJP and the JD(U) will contest 17 seats each. This formula leaves the LJP with six seats, which is one less than its 2014 share.

On December 10, Kushwaha announced his resignation from the Union council of ministers and the NDA after seat-sharing talks with the BJP for the 2019 elections failed to take-off.

Thursday's press conference announcing his admission into the alliance was attended by Congress treasurer Ahmed Patel, Loktantrik Janata Dal leader Sharad Yadav, HAM president and former Bihar chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav and Congress party's Bihar in-charge Shaktisinh Gohil. Sharad Yadav's party is also part of the alliance.

The Opposition has also planned a rally in Bihar on February 2 that will be addressed by Congress president Rahul Gandhi and other senior leaders of the bloc.

Kushwaha said the Prime Minister has failed to deliver on his promise during the 2014 election campaign that he would address the issues of education, jobs and healthcare for the people of Bihar.

""There was a difference between his talk and action. I never believed there could be so much difference,"" he said.

Kushwaha went on to praise Congress president Rahul Gandhi for delivering the promise of loan waiver for farmers in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. ""The first step of Congress governments in these states was to write off of the loans of farmers.""

Asked about the possibility of the LJP joining the UPA, Tejashwi Yadav said, ""Whether or not to join the grand alliance is their decision. But the country's [political] climate is changing, you need to wait and see.""

He said the BJP has lost allies in the north, west, south and east of the country and a ""Mahagathbandhan"" against the NDA across India is in the making.

""This [Mahagathbandhan] is not the alliance of political parties. It is an alliance of the hearts of the people. It is the alliance of the new agreement of farmers and youths. This is the alliance of the commitment to social justice. This alliance is against dictatorship and mobocracy. It is the alliance for the people of the people,"" he said.

The RJD leader too praised Gandhi, saying he had implemented his promises and was patiently building up a coalition of the Opposition parties.

However, he was evasive about whether his party was open to the idea of Gandhi being the prime ministerial face of the combined Opposition. ""The issue is not who will be the Prime Minister, the issue is whether our Constitution, our country will be will be protected or not from the BJP onslaught.""

""If we don't unite, people will not forgive us,"" Tejashwi Yadav said exuding hope that Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party (SP) and Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) would sooner or later become a part of the grand alliance.

""Like-minded parties opposed to the BJP are steadily uniting. Both the SP and the BSP need not be told, they know what they should do. And I believe their decision will be based on what the people of the country want, which is to get rid of the Modi government,"" he said.

Patna-based political analyst Shaibal Gupta termed Kushwaha's move a ""big disadvantage"" to the NDA. ""In the backdrop of a photo-finish in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, every vote will matter. That should not be ignored. It's advantage to UPA even if his [Kushwaha'] support base is limited,"" he said."

Inaugurating the fourth annual session of the Kerala History Congress at the Karyavattom campus of University of Kerala on Thursday, Dr. Jaleel accused Right-wing fundamentalist outfits of attempting to distort history and challenging the founding ideals of the country. Secularism, a core value of the Constitution, came under unprecedented threat in the process.

""The concept of secularism had figured in the edicts of the Emperor Ashoka, much before it became familiar to the world. However, doubts have been raised regarding the country's fundamental ideals since the days of the Independence movement. The imperialist forces remained firm on their stance that the country with its religious, linguistic, and cultural diversity could not prosper. This reasoning behind the two-nation theory had led to the Partition of India. However, Pakistan would not have witnessed a bifurcation, which led to the formation of Bangladesh, if religion alone could hold a nation together. Now, concerted efforts are being made to project India as a Hindu nation by distorting history,"" Dr. Jaleel said.

The Minister was highly critical of Indian Railways' decision to erase a mural on the Wagon Tragedy at the Tirur railway station, with scant regard for the historical account. ""By bowing to the pressure of Right-wing fundamentalists, Railways have done a disservice to the country. Efforts were made to portray the tragic episode as a communal clash and not part of the freedom struggle,"" he said.

Kerala History Congress president Rajan Gurukkal presided over the function. Prominent historian K.N.

Following the outrage over Deputy Mayor's remarks, Government Medical College (GMC) Srinagar has sought action against him, while State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) Thursday served him a notice seeking his reply in a week's time. The move came a day after the Deputy Mayor, Srinagar Municipal Corporation, Sheikh Imran's video at Chest Disease Hospital went viral in which he has used unparliamentary language like ""bloody and b..ls..t"" with a group of on-duty doctors.

Principal GMC, Dr Samia Rashid said they have taken up the matter with Advisor K Vijay Kumar and have also written to the Commissioner Secretary Health and Medical Education Department.

""I have already taken up the issue with the Advisor. I have written a letter to him, including the Commissioner and have urged them to take necessary action in this regard,"" she said.

Dr Samia said what Imran did on Tuesday at the hospital was not his domain. ""His job is to take care of drains and roads. He cannot intervene into the matters of the hospital,"" she said.

She also said that she has talked with the doctors of the CD hospital and asked them to perform their duties and not to worry about such attacks.

Meanwhile, the rights body, SHRC, has taken suo-moto cognizance of the matter observing that disturbing news reports have appeared in the press while as a video has also gone viral on social media about the Deputy Mayor's visit to the CD hospital.

The Commission said, ""It is well settled that exercising powers by any authority which are not available to him in law amounts to breaking of rule of law and as such violation of human rights.""

SHRC said in a statement said that reports prima facie suggest that the Deputy Mayor's remarks were ""humiliating"" to members of every respectable and notable profession.

Taking cognizance of the matter, SHRC issued a notice to the Deputy Mayor asking him to reply by 26 December 2018.

Imran's video went viral triggering outrage on social media and leaving doctor fraternity fuming.

Assaults against doctors continue in hospitals amid security and CCTV surveillance. On Wednesday night doctors at SMHS Hospital averted three assailants at the emergency ward.

""I had to avert three assaults on my residents by unruly attendants. The working of medical emergency reception was stopped twice and the emergency ward was in chaos for nearly an hour due to which I could not attend a sick patient,"" said a doctor at SMHS Hospital.

On September 17 this year, a lady doctor was ruthlessly beaten up by over a dozen men at Lalla Ded hospital after a patient delivered a dead baby.

In December last year, a consultant surgeon at Community Health Centre, Zainapora, Shopian, was harassed by an administrator after he was coming out of the theatre.

Over the years, doctors in Kashmir have been asking the government to bring an ordinance to make the violence against doctors a non-bailable offence but the government is yet to wake up.

""We want an ordinance to avoid violence against doctors in hospitals in the State. The same has been enacted by 22 States in India and it is much needed here,"" president Doctors Association Kashmir (DAK), Dr Suhail Naik told the Rising Kashmir.

He said the much-needed move will bring discipline in the Valley hospitals as 'doctors face some form of violence at work.'"

Below are my key picks for the defining moments of the year.

Elon Musk, Mars, and a roller coaster year for billionaires: On 6 February, Elon Musk's Falcon Heavy rocket blasted into space from Florida and sent a cherry-red Tesla roadster hurtling toward Mars. It was a powerful statement about the influence and ambition of a new generation of tech billionaires.

Overall, however, 2018 would be a rough year for the group, and Musk was no exception. By July, he was embroiled in a high-profile spat with a British cave rescue diver over a miniature submarine he had hoped would help rescue 12 boys trapped underground in Thailand, just one of a series of increasingly negative headlines.

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg had scarcely a better year, his firm plagued by its own stream of scandals and political headwinds. Google, whose chief executive Sundar Pichai became the latest tech chief summoned before Congress, faces a mutiny from some workers on multiple topics. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos faces mounting criticism over working conditions and low tax payments.

Yet none of this looks set to stop tech firms from continuing to radically disrupt the world. Expect these battles to grow in 2019.

Trump fires advisers, tightens his grip: One billionaire learning his way around the political system in 2018 was US President Donald Trump. After reports of growing frustration with some of his most senior officials, March saw him fire secretary of state Rex Tillerson and national security adviser H.R. McMaster. Both had been viewed as moderating influences on Trump, with successors Mike Pompeo and John Bolton perceived as less prone to questioning him. December's departure of White House chief of staff John Kelly leaves defence secretary James Mattis the key restraining influence.

Overall, Trump seems increasingly keen to trust his own judgement rather than that of establishment-based gatekeepers or Republican insiders.

POTUS woos Kim and Putin. Elsewhere, diplomacy unravels: In Singapore in June and in Helsinki in July, Trump upset many in his own administration with the warmth of his meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The friendliness of the summits stood in stark contrast to the G7 gathering of Western and allied leaders in Canada, also in June. There, Trump appeared more isolated than ever before on topics, including climate change, protectionism and relations with Russia. The G7 leaders were unable to agree on a communiqué, with the six non-US members making their own statement independent of Washington.

Khashoggi killed as authoritarian states take the gloves off: The world's authoritarian states appeared at least equally as focused on stifling dissent and opposition. Nowhere was that clearer than in the case of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered and reportedly dismembered in his own country's consulate building in Istanbul. Like the suspected Russian nerve agent assassination attempt on a former double agent in the UK town of Salisbury the previous year, the killing sparked international outrage and some diplomatic isolation of Riyadh -- but little in the way of convincing apology from those believed responsible.

A string of autocratic governments appear increasingly dismissive of human rights, openly taking draconian action against critics and enemies alike. Russia is continuing its ruthless military campaign against remaining rebel enclaves in Syria, and a Saudi-led coalition has persisted in its war in Yemen -- at catastrophic cost to civilians.

China is cracking down on its Muslim Uighur minority, with a UN report citing estimates Beijing has interned up to one million in ""re-education camps.""

G20 meets as Paris burns: November's G20 gathering in Argentina was perhaps the year's most successful multilateral gathering, with world leaders managing to agree on a largely bland communiqué on reform of global trade. Trump's meeting with China's Xi brought some temporary relief from the two countries' trade war, even as Ukraine tensions and Robert Mueller's Russia probe made a Trump-Putin meeting impossible. There was still no shortage of disagreements on show, however -- and as the leaders met, riots in Paris were grabbing global headlines.

Almost every Western leader in Argentina returned home to an existential political crisis. French President Emmanuel Macron has since bowed to some of the demands of the ""yellow vest"" protesters. German chancellor Angela Merkel has signalled she will shortly leave politics, although she has seen some success in appointing a protegé to lead her party. Trump went back to Washington to face the fallout from former lawyer Michael Cohen's admission of lying to Congress about a Trump Tower project in Moscow; British Prime Minister Theresa May has so far failed to find a Brexit deal she can get through Parliament.

Solving those issues will be tough -- and more disruption feels inevitable through 2019 and beyond."

A special team has been formed under the leadership of Sadar Sub-Divisional Police Officer (SDPO) to investigate the incident, said Sambalpur Superintendent of Police, Sanjeev Arora.

The SP said, a case has been registered under various sections of IPC in connection with the torching of BSE office and the police team has begun the investigation to identify the people involved in the incident.

Action will be taken against those found involved, he said adding that the police team has also been directed to collect CCTV footage of the nearby area of the BSE office for identification of the culprits.

The incident took place in the afternoon on Wednesday. Around 8 to 10 unidentified people barged into the BSE office when the staff were working, police said.

They asked the office staff to leave the building and allegedly set the office on fire after ransacking it. Many important documents, furniture besides certificates were gutted in the fire, police said.

Deputy Secretary of the BSE, Sambalpur Zone, Suryamani Majhi said: ""we are yet to assess the loss. We will check the office in presence of police on Friday. The actual data on loss of documents besides certificates could be ascertained after the checking."""

If he can become the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Timbuktu he would do so whether it is necessary and impactful or not, says former Union Minister Yashwant Sinha.

There is one thing he has done which no Prime Minister has done before -- he has taken most of the existing government programmes and renamed them, so that the credit and glory accumulate to him, observes the former BJP leader in his book ""India Unmade: How Modi Government Broke The Economy"", a devastating essay on Modi and his government in the last four and a half years.

Sinha, who has been critical of the BJP-led government, has dedicated the book, published by Juggernaut Books, to ""All those who are not afraid to pursue the truth"".

In the chapter ""Hail Caesar! Modi's Style of Functioning"", the 81-year-old bureaucrat turned politician who was Minister of Finance and External Affairs in the Vajpayee government says Modi has centralised all decision-making powers in the government of India in himself, assisted by a few chosen officers in his PMO.

""However, he is known to be more interested in powerpoint presentations than in reading voluminous files. This is a pity. It means that he does not grasp the nuances that are stored in institutional memory. Perhaps it suits a man whose intellectual training lacks rigour at best (indeed, no one has seen his higher education degree in 'entire political science'),"" Sinha says in the book co-authored with journalist Aditya Sinha.

He says the government of India administration is driven by three centres: one, the prime minister and his PMO; the finance minister and his ministry; and three, the Planning Commission.

A politician used to head the Planning Commission earlier, but now it has been silenced and replaced by the Niti Aayog, where Modi has placed people who have zero influence on governance, Sinha says adding that leaves only two drivers of government.

The veteran politician, who had quit the IAS to join politics, observes that everyone knows how the finance minister's influence in government has declined to almost zero and he is unable to push things even in his own ministry.

""After all, why his finance secretary Hasmukh Adhia was involved in the infamous demonetisation exercise, the finance minister himself was in the dark. The finance secretary's proximity to the Prime Minister goes back to their days together in Gujarat.

""Everyone familiar with the functioning of the finance ministry is aware that independent political leadership of that ministry is absolutely essential to get things moving in the government.""

Modi, he says, is unfortunately a man who is impatient with institutions. His faith in himself blinds him to the fact that he is not a king, that he is only the head of a parliamentary party with a majority that enabled it to form a government, and which is prescribed with limits by the Constitution that has inbuilt checks and balances.

Sinha says the cabinet is collectively responsible to parliament. But as an institution it has been turned into a rubber stamp for the prime minister's decisions.

""It is said that most cabinet ministers are not allowed to speak unless an item of their ministry is up for a decision. Modi stands on a different plane from the ministers, and he has no time for them, because they don't matter. Only he does, and he will rule through bureaucrats -- this appears to be his mantra,"" says Sinha.

The November 2016 demonetisation of high-value currency, for instance, was revealed to the cabinet only minutes before it was announced to the nation -- at no stage was it discussed with the collective political brains trust of the government.

He feels perhaps a wider discussion would have made it more effective in achieving any of the goals that Modi set for it again and again during that surreal winter.

Sinha refers to another big decision which took the concerned minister by surprise was the BJP's withdrawal of support to the PDP government in June this year with whom it was in a coalition government in Jammu and Kashmir.

""The home minister, who historically has been so important that he (L. K. Advani) has also been deputy prime minister, had just days earlier visited Jammu and Kashmir energetically with a peace initiative in mind. As soon as he heard the decision -- like everyone else, as it was breaking -- he scampered off home, unwilling to face his bureaucrats or the media.""

Sinha also refers to the ""most cavalier treatment"" of External Affairs minister Sushma Swaraj who was the leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha. ""She is trolled by lunatics on social media, and Modi goes on to congratulate some of those trolls for their activity on the internet on his behalf. She is not only kept out of important policy decisions, she does not even travel abroad with her Prime Minister.""

This, he says, was in stark contrast to Vajpayee, who invited Sinha as foreign minister to accompany him on every foreign trip. He also observes that Modi did not take the Defence Minister into confidence while deciding on buying 36 Rafale fighter planes from France. ""Vajpayee would never have done such a thing. But then it is my mistake to compare Modi to Vajpayee.""

Writing about the campaign carried out by him along with former minister Arun Shourie and activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan on the Rafale deal, Sinha says, ""despite Anil Ambani sending a 'cease and desist' notice to all and sundry on this clear case of undue favouritism, the nation awaits Modi's response."""

Among those protesting are Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Indian Institute of Technology (Mumbai), Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Pune, Bangalore University, among others.

Apart from the campus protests, they also plan an offline campaign by flooding twitter using #HikeResearchFellowship and tagging the concerned authorities. However, if all their efforts go in vain, researchers plan on sending Re 1 cheque to the Prime Minister as well.

The demands include an annual increment in fellowship in accordance to inflation and inclusion of research scholars under Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) or State Government Health Scheme (SGHS) to avail the medical facilities.

""We are doing research at these institutes but many of us don't get any stipend. Out of the 820 institutes under the UGC, barely 65 come under the universities with potential for excellence and only they get the fellowships, the remaining are left out,"" said Arghya Das, a research fellow at the International centre for Theoretical Science (ICTS).

Scholars from various institutes in Bengaluru will gather at the IISc campus and form a human chain to mark their non-violent protest. This will be replicated in other campuses in cities like Pune, Mumbai , Kolkata and Lucknow. Researchers from the national capital will gather outside the Department of Science and Technology (Ministry of Science and Technology).

In an attempt to pacify the researchers, Ashutosh Sharma, the secretary of Department of Science and technology, had tweeted on December 16 assuring them that the process for a hike in their fellowship is ""fully on track.""

However, the researchers are in no mood to be pacified.

Sachin Pandey, a PhD Student from IISc, Bengaluru, said that the demand has been pending for months. ""We have approached the MHRD as well as the Department of Science and Technology but, we are given false promises every time. This will be a nationwide protest and if our demands are not met we will even protest in front of MHRD,"" said Pandey.

Earlier, research fellows from IISc had sent around 500 post cards to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) with the same demand."

A politician used to head the Planning Commission earlier, but now it has been silenced and replaced by the Niti Aayog, where Modi has placed people who have zero influence on governance, Sinha says adding that leaves only two drivers of government.

The veteran politician, who had quit the IAS to join politics, observes that everyone knows how the finance minister's influence in government has declined to almost zero and he is unable to push things even in his own ministry.

""After all, why his finance secretary Hasmukh Adhia was involved in the infamous demonetisation exercise, the finance minister himself was in the dark. The finance secretary's proximity to the Prime Minister goes back to their days together in Gujarat.

""Everyone familiar with the functioning of the finance ministry is aware that independent political leadership of that ministry is absolutely essential to get things moving in the government.""

Modi, he says, is unfortunately a man who is impatient with institutions. His faith in himself blinds him to the fact that he is not a king, that he is only the head of a parliamentary party with a majority that enabled it to form a government, and which is prescribed with limits by the Constitution that has inbuilt checks and balances.

Sinha says the cabinet is collectively responsible to parliament. But as an institution it has been turned into a rubber stamp for the prime minister's decisions.

""It is said that most cabinet ministers are not allowed to speak unless an item of their ministry is up for a decision. Modi stands on a different plane from the ministers, and he has no time for them, because they don't matter. Only he does, and he will rule through bureaucrats -- this appears to be his mantra,"" says Sinha.

The November 2016 demonetisation of high-value currency, for instance, was revealed to the cabinet only minutes before it was announced to the nation -- at no stage was it discussed with the collective political brains trust of the government.

He feels perhaps a wider discussion would have made it more effective in achieving any of the goals that Modi set for it again and again during that surreal winter.

Sinha refers to another big decision which took the concerned minister by surprise was the BJP's withdrawal of support to the PDP government in June this year with whom it was in a coalition government in Jammu and Kashmir.

""The home minister, who historically has been so important that he (L. K. Advani) has also been deputy prime minister, had just days earlier visited Jammu and Kashmir energetically with a peace initiative in mind. As soon as he heard the decision -- like everyone else, as it was breaking -- he scampered off home, unwilling to face his bureaucrats or the media.""

Sinha also refers to the ""most cavalier treatment"" of External Affairs minister Sushma Swaraj who was the leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha. ""She is trolled by lunatics on social media, and Modi goes on to congratulate some of those trolls for their activity on the internet on his behalf. She is not only kept out of important policy decisions, she does not even travel abroad with her Prime Minister.""

This, he says, was in stark contrast to Vajpayee, who invited Sinha as foreign minister to accompany him on every foreign trip. He also observes that Modi did not take the Defence Minister into confidence while deciding on buying 36 Rafale fighter planes from France. ""Vajpayee would never have done such a thing. But then it is my mistake to compare Modi to Vajpayee.""

If he can become the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Timbuktu he would do so whether it is necessary and impactful or not, says former Union Minister Yashwant Sinha.

There is one thing he has done which no Prime Minister has done before -- he has taken most of the existing government programmes and renamed them, so that the credit and glory accumulate to him, observes the former BJP leader in his book ""India Unmade: How Modi Government Broke The Economy"", a devastating essay on Modi and his government in the last four and a half years. Sinha, who has been critical of the BJP-led government, has dedicated the book, published by Juggernaut Books, to ""All those who are not afraid to pursue the truth"". In the chapter ""Hail Caesar! Modi's Style of Functioning"", the 81-year-old bureaucrat turned politician who was Minister of Finance and External Affairs in the Vajpayee government says Modi has centralised all decision-making powers in the government of India in himself, assisted by a few chosen officers in his PMO. ""However, he is known to be more interested in powerpoint presentations than in reading voluminous files. This is a pity.

Breakfast at schools was a campaign pledge of President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih and launching a pilot programme was included in the new administration's 100-day action plan.

The aim is to expand the programme to all 212 schools within five years, the minister said. Under the pilot programme, breakfast will be served in classrooms but long-term plans include developing kitchens and dining halls in schools.

Ten menus have been created with the help of United Nations Children Fund, the Health Protection Agency and nutrition experts. The options include omelettes, sandwiches, baked beans or flat bread and various forms of mashuni (shredded coconut mixed with other ingredients such as tuna and onions), all of which would be served with a full cream milk packet.

According to reports, BSE staff were working in the office as it was the last day for filling up forms for correspondence matriculation examinations. Some school teachers, who had come to submit forms, were also present in the office when the arson occured.

Deputy Secretary of BSE, Sambalpur zone, Suryamani Majhi said eight to 10 persons barged into the office at around 2 pm and ordered them to vacate the premises. Then they ransacked the office and set it on fire. They also set ablaze two motorcycles parked on the office premises before fleeing the spot.

Majhi said that the office had been closed since November 19 due to the ongoing lawyers' stir. It was opened on Wednesday for filling up of examination forms. They had intimated the District Bar Association, Sambalpur beforehand that they would open the office due to the important work. Moreover, he had also discussed with the District Collector in this regard.

Two fire tenders and 15 personnel were engaged to douse the fire. The miscreants set five rooms on fire and destroyed furniture and articles in the hall of the building.

The strategy, set out in an immigration White Paper, was tabled in the House of Commons on Wednesday by UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid.

It removes any cap on highly-skilled migrants from anywhere in the world and improves the post-study work offering for international students.

The proposals, set to be phased in from December 2021 after the proposed transition period for Britain's exit from the European Union (EU), claim to level the country's immigration playing field with the end of free movement for people from within the 28-member economic bloc.

""As we leave the European Union, free movement will endThis will be a system where it is workers' skills that matter, not which country they come from,"" British Prime Minister Theresa May said in her foreword to the strategy.

""We are taking a skills-based approach to ensure we can attract the brightest and best migrants to the UK,"" added Javid, who made a reference to his own Pakistani origins as the ""son of immigrant parents"".

Under the new proposals, an annual cap of 20,700 on the number of skilled work visas issued will be removed, likely to benefit doctors and IT professionals from India, among others. There will also be a new 12-month visa route for workers at any skill level for a temporary period to allow businesses to hire the staff they need on a time-bound basis.

""People arriving on this route will not be able to bring family members with them, won't accrue rights to settle in the UK and will have a 12-month cooling off period once their visa expires,"" the UK Home Office said.

The onerous requirement for labour market tests by employers wanting to sponsor an overseas skilled worker are also to be done away with.

The plans were broadly welcomed by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), which said the White Paper recognises the value offered by skilled workers from countries like India.

""Indian Industry has long called for a fair, transparent and skills-based immigration system, and today's proposals go some way to achieving these goals, said Jim Bligh, of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Chair of CII's UK India Business Forum.

""Tackling the UK's skills gaps, particularly in digital and technology, must remain a key focus for government and it is welcome that this paper recognises the value that skilled workers from overseas can bring to helping improve the UK's skills base, he said.

Under changes proposed to attract international students to the UK, the government said it would ""improve the current offer"" to those who have completed a degree who want to stay on in the UK to work after they have completed their studies by offering six months' post-study leave to all Master's students and Bachelor's students studying at an institution with degree-awarding powers. This is aimed at giving them more time to find permanent skilled work and to work temporarily during that period.

""We will also allow for students studying at Bachelor's level or above to be able to apply to switch into the skilled workers route up to three months before the end of their course in the UK, and from outside of the UK for two years after their graduation,"" the White Paper notes.

Universities UK International, the representative group for the country's higher education institutions which has been campaigning for a better post-study offer, said the proposals recognise the important contributions made by international students to the UK.

""Allowing graduates to stay on for longer to find work in the UK sends the message that international students are welcome here, and we value the skills they bring. These changes will have a real, positive impact on the students who come here to study and their opportunities after graduating,"" said Vivienne Stern, Director of Universities UK International.

However, the group added that it will continue to campaign for a longer two-year post-study work visa.

As part of some of the more contentious aspects of the new immigration White Paper, the government will hold a consultation on a minimum salary requirement of 30,000 pounds for skilled migrants seeking five-year visas and low-skilled workers may be able to apply for short-term visas of up to a year.

The document forms the basis for the Immigration and Social Security Coordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill, to be published on Thursday, which ends free movement for EU nationals and creates the legal framework for a future UK borders and immigration system after Brexit. It also creates parity in the way migrants can access the country's benefits system, which will apply equally to both EU and non-EU nationals.

The new system will be implemented in a phased approach from 2021, following an extensive 12-month programme of engagement with businesses, stakeholders and the public, the Home Office said.

While it does not make a specific reference to the ruling Conservative Party's manifesto pledge to bring immigration down to the tens of thousands annually, the government stressed that the target remains in place.

The state cabinet also decided to repromulgate four ordinances since it could not be passed in the recently concluded Assembly session. In addition to this, an ordinance to amend the Kerala University Act for the temporary arrangement of senate and syndicate has been approved by the cabinet.

It has also been decided to sanction Rs 9.60 lakh towards payment of air ambulance bill incurred for airlifting Swathi Shah, a college student from Thiruvananthapuram, who met with an accident in Madhya Pradesh during his all-India solo motorcycle expedition for supporting flood-hit Kerala. Shah suffered serious injuries in the accident and the state government intervened to ensure that he got the best treatment."

If you want to see an Indian farmer on screen, tough luck. You might have to buy a ticket to an international film festival. The farmer has all but disappeared from the mainstream Hindi film industry, the same industry which gave us Mother India, Do Bigha Zameen, and Upkar. While smaller films focussing on the plight of the Indian farmer have been made (and feted elsewhere), you are unlikely to know of them.

They barely get a wide release, and the entertainment media do not want to touch them - the Indian farmer and his stories simply do not appeal to the candyfloss imagination that Bollywood caters to. How can one have an item number shot in Monaco in a story about a farmer in Vidarbha?

The rural landscape itself seems to have vanished from the stories we tell on celluloid. Can you think of one big 'Bollywood' film in recent times that has featured a big star and focussed on the lives of rural Indians? There was Lagaan, but cricket was its hook. There was Kadvi Hawa last year, but did you watch it? Peepli Live, in recent memory, came closest to addressing the issues of the farmer to a mainstream audience largely due to it being an Aamir Khan production.

In this 2010 film by Anusha Rizvi, Natha, a farmer, is encouraged by his own brother to commit suicide so his family could get a loan waiver and financial compensation after his death. The news of his impending suicide somehow attracts media attention, and reporters, OB vans and all, descend upon his village to capture the drama. While Natha, now obligated to kill himself, clearly does not want to, and runs away, even as another villager away from the spotlight Hori, who digs dirt for a living, dies.

The seen and unseen stories of Natha and Hori play out in the real world in similar ways - the inability of farmers to pay off debts and therefore resorting to suicides is a narrative we hear all too loudly ahead of any election, but the underlying reasons - the unseen - of a mental health epidemic in rural India, of poor agrarian reforms, of rising input costs and diminishing returns, of fragmented land holding, are barely ever spoken of.

The plight of the farmer, though, finds itself in centre stage in the run up to any election in India. Politicians of every stripe make promises of farm loan waivers ahead of every election. But barely heard are promises to usher in long term agrarian reforms.

Farm loan waivers are like a unicorn - it is the promise of the magical that hides the realities of the practical. They are also like Andy Warhol's fifteen minutes of fame. Loans waived for now... but what next? And how do they impact the larger economy? These are the questions we will address as we dig deeper into the issue of farm loan waivers.

Competitive populism

Hours after being sworn in as the 18th Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, ending the 15-year-long drought for the Congress in the state, Kamal Nath sanctioned the waiver of farm loans up to 2 lakh rupees in the state, as was promised in the election manifesto, and announced by Congress President Rahul Gandhi in June earlier this year.

Rajesh Rajora, Principal Secretary, Farmers' Welfare and Agriculture Development Department, issued an order soon after which read, "" Madhya Pradesh Government has taken a decision to write off short-term crop loan of eligible farmers up to the limit of Rs two lakh, as on March 31, 2018, from nationalised and cooperative banks."" Rajora said an estimated 34 lakh farmers will benefit from the loan waiver whose size he pegged between Rs 35,000 crore and Rs 38,000 crore.

Gandhi tweeted soon after: ""1 done. 2 to go.""

Chhattisgarh, where Congress won as well, followed next with Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel announcing the waiver of short-term agriculture loans to the tune of over Rs 6100 crore of over 16.65 lakh farmers drawn from cooperative banks and Chhattisgarh Gramin Banks. Fulfilling another pre-poll promise, the cabinet in Chhattisgarh decided to hike the minimum support price (MSP) of paddy to Rs 2,500 per quintal.

Upon being asked if loan waiver was the best option to revive the agrarian economy, Kamal Nath, who believes farm loan waivers are ""a necessity"" had a now-familiar tune to sing: When nationalised banks can write off 40-50 percent of loans of big industrialists, why can't cultivators get the same relief? The anger of the rural-dweller has recently manifested in massive farmer protests in the both the national capital and the country's financial hub this year.

One of their most important demands - complete loan waiver. In a year marked by high-profile scams in the banking sector in the country, to the farmer, his demand doesn't sound illogical at all. Loan waivers, whether farm loan or corporate NPAs, both represent a moral hazard, true. That corporate NPAs are a different kettle of fish is not a nuance an angry farmer faced with his dire realities is prepared to understand. And what the farmer dangles before the government is his vote. One wheat farmer in Madhya Pradesh, echoing millions others, said to Reuters: ""I will vote for the party that will write off our loans."" Quid pro quo.

The election results in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are being read as a rebuke to PM Modi. The Indian Express noted, ""The Congress' relentless pursuit of boxing in the Modi government over agricultural issues seems to have paid off as out of a total of 424 rural seats in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, the BJP won just 153 seats as compared to 294 in 2013 - nearly 50 per cent fewer seats.""

With little time left before the general elections, and to ensure the support of India's 263 million farmers and their dependants, reports indicate that the Modi government may be announcing a massive loan waiver - something it has not done since coming to power - to the tune of about Rs 4 lakh crore ($56.5 billion). Congress Chief Rahul Gandhi, on Tuesday, said that if his party is elected at the centre in 2019, it would waive of all farm loans. Gandhi also said that he ""won't let the Prime Minister sleep"" till a nationwide farm loan waiver is announced. Gandhi's farm-loan-waiver promise has certainly paid the Congress rich dividends this election season.

And with a new governor at the RBI, and the possibility of tapping into the excess capital reserves of the central bank now seeming easier than it did during Urjit Patel's time, it's not hard to see what Modi's next step might be.

In a completely unpredicted development, the theme for the 2019 elections, ladies and gentlemen, is farm loan waivers.

Farm loan waivers - A brief history

Gone are the days of free television sets and gold trinkets. Farm loan waivers, it seems, are the new political currency.

Farmers make up over half the labour market in India and are crucial in elections. The first national loan waivers date back to 1990, when the union government waived Rs 100 billion ($5.6 billion) in farm loans. In 2008, the government announced another major round of loan waivers totalling Rs 650 billion, about 1.3 percent of India's GDP.

Over the following nine years, until 2017, the central and state governments waived nearly Rs 890 billion ($14 billion) in loans to 48 million farmers. Since 2017, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Chhattisgarh have all announced (or completed the promised) farm loan waivers. Tamil Nadu, under Jayalalithaa, had done so in 2016. Karnataka, with a waiver announced of Rs 44,000 crore tops the list, with

Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra following closely behind, each with upwards of 30,000 crore rupees waived. This brand of competitive populism, ahead of 2019, has spread to Gujarat and Assam as recently as today with these states also announcing a waiver of farm loans and electricity bills.

In 2017, waivers announced in the four states of Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, and Karnataka, came at a cost of $13.6 billion. By 2019, farm loan waivers will amount to 2-2.5 percent of the GDP, or about $40 billion, said BofA-ML last year.

As Nilanjan Banik writes in the Economic and Political Weekly (EPW), ""Waivers of farm loans may help any political party win an election once. For them to win an election twice, however, it is important to undertake policy measures that will make a real difference to the life of poor farmers.""

What are waivers useful for? Garnering votes. Agriculture employs nearly 45 percent of India's workforce even though its contribution to the GDP is about 15 percent.

Research studies, like Banik's, over several years have indicated over and over again that farm loan waivers are at best a Band-Aid solution and at worst instruments that engender moral hazard. Additionally, formulae to waive farm loans are not uniform across states.

Rajasthan, for example, calculates waivers based on amount of crop damaged, size of land holdings, and harvest volume. Other states have fixed limits for the amount to be waived. The UPA government 2008 waiver covered only marginal and small farmers (those holding less than 2 hectares of land). Others got a 25 percent waiver. On the flipside, many farmers who do own more than 2 hectares of land are rendered ineligible even though much of the land owned may be uncultivated.

From a macroeconomic perspective, ex-RBI Governor Urjit Patel stated that the farm loan waiver scheme ""undermines an honest credit culture, impacts credit discipline, blunts incentives for future borrowers to repay, in other words, waivers engender moral hazard.""

The RBI also warned that loan waivers will crowd out private borrowers in favour of government lenders and will worsen inflationary risks, limiting the RBI's ability to lower interest rates. His predecessor Dr Raghuram Rajan also reiterated this concern and added that the waivers often go to the ""best connected rather than to the poorest.""The Economic Times put it succinctly when it listed seven reasons why farm loan waivers do not make sense:

Politician promises taxpayer money to waive farmer's loans in exchange for his vote. Taxpayer money is then used to repay these loans thus denting the fiscal standing of the government promising these loans. Writing for Firstpost, Dinesh Unnikrishnan says, ""Since banks do not get money on time from governments, this puts them on a back foot, forcing to go slow on further lending to farmers.""

A report from Kotak Institutional Equities pointed to a strong dip in agricultural loans in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh two-three years after the announcement of waivers there. The report adds, ""While the available data does not clearly substantiate our hypothesis given the other extraneous variables like monsoon, other government initiatives, etc., back of the envelope calculations suggest a modest slowdown.

Additionally, agriculture loan growth has been broadly strong in the years prior to the announcement of a loan waiver in most cases apart from Punjab. Additionally, the growth of agriculture loans in these states has been higher than the industry average or their regions prior to the announcement under most circumstances.""

State governments that have announced these waivers have since seen their debt-to-GDP ratio increase, Unnikrishnan points.

Unfortunately, however, agriculture is a season-dependent trade. Should there be another spell of poor rains, or a glut resulting in lower market prices, the farmer is yet again saddled with loans he cannot repay, and yet again, the politician enters to cash the farmer's vote for a waiver.

Who benefits from farm loan waivers, even if for the short term?

Rich upper caste farmers. Or at any rate, farmers with access to formal bank credit, meaning farmers with some functional financial literacy. And politicians seeking power.

The work of C Shankar Rao, assistant professor at the Council for Social Development, Hyderabad, published in the Economic and Political Weekly (EPW), sheds more light on this. More than 85 percent of India's farmers are either small (0.1 to 1 hectare total land farmed) or marginal (1.1 to 2 hectares). Semi-medium to large landowners constitute the remaining 15 percent of the farmer population in the country. This distinction is crucial to understand the debt-seeking patterns within the farmer community.

There are three main sources of credit for farmers: among formal sources, Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) and co-operatives; among informal sources, private money lenders (PMLs).

It should come as no surprise then that small and marginal farmers mostly borrow from PMLs as they are less likely to have anything to offer in terms of collateral to formal sector credit sources. As SCs constitute the largest chunk of small and marginal farmers, it is also them that have the smallest formal sector credit.

More than a fourth of the total credit taken by Indian farmers came at interest rates of 36 percent per annum - clearly interests levied by private money lenders. Upper castes often also have an advantage accessing cooperative credit, research has gone to show.

(It is to be noted, however, that rich SC farmers, too, do better when it comes to accessing formal credit.)

Nilanjan Banik in the EPW again: ""Loan waivers are not the solution to the farming crisis. In the year following loan waivers, small farmers lose out on three counts: lower access to formal loans, falling agricultural revenue because of higher informal loan cost, and falling agricultural productivity.""

The Times of India reported the stories of several farmers from across the country who were eligible for waivers but eventually only ended up receiving a fraction of what was promised owing to the fine print in these loan waiver schemes.

Simply put, farm loan waivers are only helpful to those who have taken loans from a formal credit source. 85 percent of the country's farmer population constitutes of small and marginal farmers, a large section of whom most often do not even have access to formal bank credit and are at the mercy of private money lenders who levy exorbitant interest rates.

Even more simply put, loan waivers impact those who are in the system. The tragedy though is that the section of the farmer population that is in direst need of help is out of the system and therefore stands to gain nothing.

PRS Legislative Research reiterated this point: ""Marginal and small farmers accounted for 82 percent of all indebted households and 56 percent of the outstanding loans by value. However, only a small proportion of the indebted marginal and small farmers had taken loans from institutional sources such as banks and cooperatives.

Informal sources such as moneylenders, family and friends accounted for 62 percent of indebted households among marginal farmers. Such farmers would not benefit from any scheme that restructures debt taken from banks and cooperatives.""

How does it impact the economy?

The fiscal standing of the governments granting these waivers suffers as a result of loan waiver schemes. Tanika Chakraborty and Aarti Gupta of IIT Kanpur, presenting their research in Ideas for India, went on to note: ""Our research provides evidence that a blanket waiver scheme is detrimental to the development of credit markets.

Repeated debt-waiver programmes distort households' incentive structures, away from productive investments and towards unproductive consumption and wilful defaults. These wilful defaults, in turn, are likely to disrupt the functioning of the entire credit system.""

Let's examine the impact on banks first. In the aftermath of every loan waiver announcement, a spike in NPAs has been observed, simply because even honest taxpayers stop repayments in the hope that their liabilities too might get included in the waiver package. A Kotak Institutional Equities report states an example: ""As we saw in Karnataka, gross NPLs in MP have been rising in recent years. It was at 8 percent in FY2017 which increased to 11 percent prior to the elections."" That phrase again - moral hazard. Moral hazard, which incentivises defaulting on loans. In Dec 2017, The Times of India reported that in some states, the default rate had increased by up to 50 percent in the aftermath of a loan waiver announcement. HFDC Bank reported a 60 percent rise in agricultural loan delinquencies in the quarter ending June 30, 2017.

Public sector banks (PSBs) will be the most negatively affected by the loan waivers. As of 2017, Nomura estimated that state-owned banks hold two-thirds of loans to be waived. The loan waivers would further exacerbate the PSBs asset quality problems and their already weakened capital levels.

The Hindu Business Line noted, ""Economists caution that farm loans waivers would widen a fiscal deficit the government has aimed to cap at 3.3 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), or Rs 6.24 lakh crore. Even without the farm loan waiver, some credit rating agencies have estimated the country's fiscal deficit at Rs 6.67 lakh crore - or 3.5 percent of GDP, on muted tax collections. The loan waiver also risks deepening the malaise at public sector banks saddled with most of India's $150 billion in stressed loans.""

In its 2016-2017 annual report, the central bank cautioned against such ""unconditional bailouts"", saying they could affect fiscal credibility in the medium term. The report also noted that the benefits of the waivers were ""highly skewed and concentrated in states where concentration of land holdings was low on account of land reforms."" It added that such random policy shocks ""have an enduring impact on market borrowings of governments, as evident from past episodes of such waivers. They increase the interest rates the governments need to pay for the loans they borrow.""

As for states granting these waivers, some have already seen their fiscal deficits worsen due to the impact of the UDAY (Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana) scheme, which passed on a part of the debt burden of state electricity distribution companies onto the state government. Compromises on productive spending are inevitable - something's gotta give. The states' fiscal deficit widens, as has already been seen. As per the RBI, the gross fiscal deficit (GFD) rose to 3.1 percent breaching the threshold of 3 percent GFD/GSDP ratio recommended by the Finance Commission.

What then are the alternatives to farm loan waivers?

In a nutshell, it is safe to say that farm loan waivers are nothing more than a temporary dike made of mud in the face of a deluge of problems faced by the agrarian sector. It is no more than a populist ploy aimed at getting votes. As P Sainath said, ""waivers are merely a tool, not a transformation; mechanism not a solution; relief not an answer to the greater problem.""

M S Swaminathan, Father of the Green Revolution, said in an interview to Al Jazeera, ""Loan waivers, though temporarily necessary for the revival of farming, do not provide conditions for a secure credit system in the long term.""

Even in large scale reforms, patience is a virtue. It is beyond any doubt that India finds herself in the grip of an agrarian crisis. But the need of the hour is thoughtful long-term planning. Surgery, not band-aids. To incorporate the many reforms that have been suggested is beyond the scope of this piece, and will therefore be dealt with on a follow-up piece, but let's take a quick look at some of them.

Many experts have suggested the implementation of the National Commission on Farmers (NCF). Chaired by M S Swaminathan, it recommended minimum support price for grains, protection of small farmers and addressing risks in overtaking agriculture as a profession. The commission observed that farmers need to have access over resources such as land, water, bio-resources, credit and insurance, technology and markets and that agriculture needs to be shifted to the concurrent list instead of the state list at which it is currently at.

Nilanjan Banik wrote about some reforms from a cost-benefit perspective. He wrote, ""The government can spend money for building more canals and warehouses, on rural electrification, and to operate more e-markets. Each one of these interventions comes with a cost and an associated benefit. As an economist, one would argue government should spend each additional rupee to alleviate farm distress in a way where the impact is more, with a higher benefit-to-cost ratio.""

Noting that 20 percent of India's fresh produce is wasted because of storage problems, he advocated the building of more warehouses and storage facilities. ""The National Centre for Cold Chain Development (NCCD) has estimated Rajasthan's total requirement for storing milk, fruits and vegetables at 74,889 tonnes.

Providing pack houses and trucks would cost ₹5,985 crore. The benefits in terms of the reduced wastage in milk, fruits and vegetables, are worth more than 15 times that figure."" Research also shows that e-markets could result in better prices for farmers. A similar view was echoed by researchers at ICRIER.

Fragmented land holding, depletion of water table level, poor irrigation systems, deteriorating soil quality, rising input costs and diminishing returns, the vagaries of monsoon... these are only a few of the issues faced by the Indian farmer, none of which are truly addressed by loan waivers. What loan waivers do is address a temporary problem with a temporary, and largely ineffective, solution.

For effective long term reform, and to realise the government's dream of doubling farmer income by 2022, policymakers ought to think beyond electoral politics and enact structural changes that go beyond election season rhetoric and populist schemes.

The recent farmer protests seen in Mumbai and New Delhi hint at another crisis within the agrarian community - a crisis of identity. The socio-economic transformation that India has seen post-liberalisation has largely been felt in urban India. The traditional dominance of the farming community is being threatened in the new economic order where formal education and jobs matter more than farm incomes do.

Adding to the crisis of collective identity is an epidemic of mental health disorders. Farmer suicides are tragic, this is undeniable. And most narratives tend to cite poor farm outcomes and burgeoning loans as the reasons for these suicides, sidestepping another brewing crisis within the agrarian community - that of clinical depression.

For the record, as of 2011, the latest year for which suicide data were computed, suicide mortality is lower among farmers than non-farmers (Basu, Das and Misra, EPW, 2016). Dr Neeraj Kaushal, Professor of Social Policy at Columbia School of Social Work, has gone on to note that while the economic distress of a poor harvest may no doubt contribute to the farmer suicides, it is also just as important to address the mental health problems that the community may be suffering from, but is too afraid to address.

Any reform in the agrarian sector would be incomplete if it didn't also consider the well-being - physical and mental - of the agriculturist.Jai Jawaan Jai Kisaan, otherwise, would be merely lip service."

The UK government has released a White Paper on its post-Brexit visas and immigration strategy, which is expected to benefit Indian students and professionals as it focuses on skills rather than country of origin.

The UK's future skills-based immigration system, tabled in the House of Commons on Wednesday by UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid, removes any cap on highly-skilled migrants from anywhere in the world and improves the post-study work offering for international students.

The proposals, set to be phased in from December 2021 after the proposed transition period for Britain's exit from the European Union (EU), claim to level the country's immigration playing field with the end of free movement for people from within the 28-member economic bloc.

""As we leave the European Union, free movement will endThis will be a system where it is workers' skills that matter, not which country they come from,"" British Prime Minister Theresa May said in her foreword to the strategy.

""We are taking a skills-based approach to ensure we can attract the brightest and best migrants to the UK,"" added Javid, who made a reference to his own Pakistani origins as the ""son of immigrant parents"".

Under the new proposals, an annual cap of 20,700 on the number of skilled work visas issued will be removed, likely to benefit doctors and IT professionals from India, among others. There will also be a new 12-month visa route for workers at any skill level for a temporary period to allow businesses to hire the staff they need on a time-bound basis.

""People arriving on this route will not be able to bring family members with them, won't accrue rights to settle in the UK and will have a 12-month cooling off period once their visa expires,"" the UK Home Office said.

The onerous requirement for labour market tests by employers wanting to sponsor an overseas skilled worker are also to be done away with.

The plans were broadly welcomed by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), which said the White Paper recognises the value offered by skilled workers from countries like India.

""Indian Industry has long called for a fair, transparent and skills-based immigration system, and today's proposals go some way to achieving these goals, said Jim Bligh, of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Chair of CII's UK India Business Forum.

""Tackling the UK's skills gaps, particularly in digital and technology, must remain a key focus for government and it is welcome that this paper recognises the value that skilled workers from overseas can bring to helping improve the UK's skills base, he said.

Under changes proposed to attract international students to the UK, the government said it would ""improve the current offer"" to those who have completed a degree who want to stay on in the UK to work after they have completed their studies by offering six months' post-study leave to all Master's students and Bachelor's students studying at an institution with degree-awarding powers. This is aimed at giving them more time to find permanent skilled work and to work temporarily during that period.

""We will also allow for students studying at Bachelor's level or above to be able to apply to switch into the skilled workers route up to three months before the end of their course in the UK, and from outside of the UK for two years after their graduation,"" the White Paper notes.

Here are some important features from the proposed visa policy and how:

2- There will also be a new 12-month visa route for workers at any skill level for a temporary period to allow businesses to hire the staff they need on a time-bound basis. ""People arriving on this route will not be able to bring family members with them, won't accrue rights to settle in the UK and will have a 12-month cooling off period once their visa expires,"" the UK Home Office said.

""We will also allow for students studying at Bachelor's level or above to be able to apply to switch into the skilled workers route up to three months before the end of their course in the UK, and from outside of the UK for two years after their graduation,"" the White Paper notes.

This is aimed at giving them more time to find permanent skilled work and to work temporarily during that period.

5- As part of some of the more contentious aspects of the new immigration White Paper, the government will hold a consultation on a minimum salary requirement of 30,000 pounds for skilled migrants seeking five-year visas and low-skilled workers may be able to apply for short-term visas of up to a year.

Part of EU Withdrawal Bill

The document forms the basis for the Immigration and Social Security Coordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill, to be published on Thursday, which ends free movement for EU nationals and creates the legal framework for a future UK borders and immigration system after Brexit.

It also creates parity in the way migrants can access the country's benefits system, which will apply equally to both EU and non-EU nationals.

The new system will be implemented in a phased approach from 2021, following an extensive 12-month programme of engagement with businesses, stakeholders and the public, the Home Office said.

While it does not make a specific reference to the ruling Conservative Party's manifesto pledge to bring immigration down to the tens of thousands annually, the government stressed that the target remains in place.

London: The UK government has released a White Paper on its post-Brexit visas and immigration strategy, which is expected to benefit Indian students and professionals as it focuses on skills rather than country of origin.

The UK's future skills-based immigration system, tabled in the House of Commons on Wednesday by UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid, removes any cap on highly-skilled migrants from anywhere in the world and improves the post-study work offering for international students.

The proposals, set to be phased in from December 2021 after the proposed transition period for Britain's exit from the European Union (EU), claim to level the country's immigration playing field with the end of free movement for people from within the 28-member economic bloc.

""As we leave the European Union, free movement will end This will be a system where it is workers' skills that matter, not which country they come from,"" British Prime Minister Theresa May said in her foreword to the strategy.

""We are taking a skills-based approach to ensure we can attract the brightest and best migrants to the UK,"" added Javid, who made a reference to his own Pakistani origins as the ""son of immigrant parents"".

Under the new proposals, an annual cap of 20,700 on the number of skilled work visas issued will be removed, likely to benefit doctors and IT professionals from India, among others. There will also be a new 12-month visa route for workers at any skill level for a temporary period to allow businesses to hire the staff they need on a time-bound basis.

""People arriving on this route will not be able to bring family members with them, won't accrue rights to settle in the UK and will have a 12-month cooling off period once their visa expires,"" the UK Home Office said.

The onerous requirement for labour market tests by employers wanting to sponsor an overseas skilled worker are also to be done away with.

The plans were broadly welcomed by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), which said the White Paper recognises the value offered by skilled workers from countries like India.

""Indian Industry has long called for a fair, transparent and skills-based immigration system, and today's proposals go some way to achieving these goals, said Jim Bligh, of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Chair of CII's UK India Business Forum.

""Tackling the UK's skills gaps, particularly in digital and technology, must remain a key focus for government and it is welcome that this paper recognises the value that skilled workers from overseas can bring to helping improve the UK's skills base, he said.

Under changes proposed to attract international students to the UK, the government said it would ""improve the current offer"" to those who have completed a degree who want to stay on in the UK to work after they have completed their studies by offering six months' post-study leave to all Master's students and Bachelor's students studying at an institution with degree-awarding powers. This is aimed at giving them more time to find permanent skilled work and to work temporarily during that period.

""We will also allow for students studying at Bachelor's level or above to be able to apply to switch into the skilled workers route up to three months before the end of their course in the UK, and from outside of the UK for two years after their graduation,"" the White Paper notes.

Universities UK International, the representative group for the country's higher education institutions which has been campaigning for a better post-study offer, said the proposals recognise the important contributions made by international students to the UK.

""Allowing graduates to stay on for longer to find work in the UK sends the message that international students are welcome here, and we value the skills they bring. These changes will have a real, positive impact on the students who come here to study and their opportunities after graduating,"" said Vivienne Stern, Director of Universities UK International.

However, the group added that it will continue to campaign for a longer two-year post-study work visa.

As part of some of the more contentious aspects of the new immigration White Paper, the government will hold a consultation on a minimum salary requirement of 30,000 pounds for skilled migrants seeking five-year visas and low-skilled workers may be able to apply for short-term visas of up to a year.

The document forms the basis for the Immigration and Social Security Coordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill, to be published on Thursday, which ends free movement for EU nationals and creates the legal framework for a future UK borders and immigration system after Brexit. It also creates parity in the way migrants can access the country's benefits system, which will apply equally to both EU and non-EU nationals.

The new system will be implemented in a phased approach from 2021, following an extensive 12-month programme of engagement with businesses, stakeholders and the public, the Home Office said.

While it does not make a specific reference to the ruling Conservative Party's manifesto pledge to bring immigration down to the tens of thousands annually, the government stressed that the target remains in place. - PTI"

In pursuance to objective of providing greater "" Ease of Doing Business"" to all stakeholders, bring about greater transparency in corporate structure and better Corporate compliance so as to enhance the efficiency of the processes under Companies Act ,2013 , the Ministry of Corporate Affairs ( MCA) has taken several landmark initiatives / decisions during last one year ( January-November ,2018) .

The important ones are Companies ( Amendment ) Act ,2017 , Companies ( Amendment) Ordinance 2018 , establishment of National Financial Reporting Authority ( NFRA) , amendments in Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code , eKYC drive for Directors of all companies and speedier processing of incorporation related applications , uniformity in application of rules and eradicating discretion.

India has improved its ranking on the World Bank's ""Doing Business"" 2019 report released on 31st October, 2018. As per the report, India has moved up 23 spots to 77th position as compared to 100th position in 2017 by improving its rank in six out of ten parameters relating to starting and doing business in India. Ministry of Corporate Affairs has contributed towards starting a business, insolvency resolution and protection of minority interests.

The details of Year-long achievements for Ministry of Corporate Affairs are as below:

Till date, all sections of the Companies Act, 2013 [CA-13] except one section viz. Section 465 have been notified. Part of section 2 [clause 67(ix)] and part of section 230 [sub-section (11) and (12)] are yet to be commenced.

Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2017 was assented by Honourable President of India on 3 January, 2018 and got enacted as the Companies (Amendment) Act, 2017 [CAA-17]. The CAA-17 contains total 93 sections. Till date, out of total 93 sections of CAA-17, 92 sections have been brought into force alongwith relevant rules. Commencement of one section (section 81 - relating to Nidhis) and parts of section 23 and 80 of CAA-17 requires amendment in 3 sets of Rules and Forms notified under the Companies Act, 2013 which requires examination in the Ministry and is likely to take some more time.

The Committee to review the existing framework dealing with offences under the Companies Act, 2013 and related matters submitted its report to the Union Minister for Finance & Corporate Affairs Shri Arun Jaitley. The Committee broke down all penal provisions into eight categories based on the nature of offences. The Committee recommended that the existing rigour of the law should continue for serious offences, covering six categories, whereas for lapses that are essentially technical or procedural in nature, mainly falling under two categories may be shifted to in-house adjudication process. This would serve the twin purposes promoting of Ease of Doing Business and better corporate compliance. It would also reduce the number of prosecutions filed in the Special Courts, which would, in turn, facilitate speedier disposal of serious offences and bring serious offenders to book. The cross-cutting liability under section 447, which deals with corporate fraud, would continue to apply wherever fraud is found. Most sections under review and recommendation have been notified for commencement. Based on the recommendations of the Committee and to achieve objectives of promotion of Ease of Doing Business and better Corporate Compliance the Government decided to promulgate an Ordinance. Accordingly the Companies (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018 was promulgated on 2.11.2018.

These courts are proposed to be set up in Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata and Hyderabad. The proposal aims to reduce the mounting burden on the tribunal despite it having 11 benches all over India. To facilitate timely resolution of IBC cases, it is envisaged to set up exclusive IBC Courts under the NCLT benches of Delhi, Mumbai to start with and step up infrastructure of NCLT. The aim is also to strengthen the insolvency process for faster resolution of NPAs.

INDIAN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In order to bring more transparent accounting, MCA has notified Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) 115 which would be effective from 1st April 2018. Ind AS 115 is a new revenue recognition standard for customer contracts in line with the International Financial Reporting Standards which will help in more transparent accounting of revenues with an impact on companies operating in diverse sectors, including technology, real estate and telecom. Objective of Ind AS 115 is to establish the principles that should be applied when reporting useful information to users of financial statements. The standard requires an entity to recognize revenue ""to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services""

DEMATERIALISATION OF SECURITIES OF UNLISTED PUBLIC COMPANIES

In order to bring about greater transparency in Corporate structure and in view of advantages of dematerialisation of securities, especially in terms of KYC and investor protection, the Government's focus on ""Digital India"" and the enabling provisions available under section 29(1)(b) of the CA-13, the Ministry has amended the relevant rules to apply the dematerialisation requirements to unlisted public companies, in addition to listed companies. Consultation were held in this regard with all stakeholders and rules were amended on 10 September, 2018 to mandate, w.e.f. 2 October, 2018, issue and transfer of securities by unlisted public companies in demat form only.

INVESTOR EDUCATION & PROTECTION FUND

The Investor Education & Protection Fund (IEPF) Authority unveiled its new logo in 2018 to provide for strong brand presence and recognition. The IEPF authority also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the CSC e-governance Services India, wherein the latter would identify village level entrepreneurs for investor awareness projects, among other activities. MCA is actively looking at further reforms in IEPF.

To review the existing claim settlement processes a committee of practicing company secretaries was constituted through the Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI). The committee had reviewed the existing processes and have recommended that the entire process should be made online with e-verification of the claims by the companies, online PAN based verification of the claimant etc.

A new portal namely www.iepfportal.in has been developed for increasing the outreach of IAPs and monitoring the programmes conducted by the professional institutes, CSC e-governance and other partner institutions. The portal provides access to the partner institutions like ICAI, ICSI, ICoAI& IICA and CSC e-Governance for uploading the details of past & future programmes.

COMPETITION MATTERS:

To enlarge the scope of debate of competition in India and to bring the best practices from around the world on competition issues, Competition Commission of India (CCI) successfully hosted the 17th International Competition Network (ICN) Annual Conference in March 2018 in New Delhi. Around 500 professional attended the conference from 70 plus countries, which included heads of competition agencies, representatives and stakeholders consisting of legal and economic professionals, international organizations and academics.

The MCA constituted an Inter-Ministerial Committee for carrying out ""Competition Assessment of existing policies"" under the chairmanship of Shri. Ramesh Abhishek, Secretary, Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion with representation from seven other Ministries/Organizations on dated 1st June, 2018. The prime focus of the Committee was to conduct a review of select Acts/Rules/Policies/Regulations formulated in the recent past and some upcoming acts to look into issues of anti-competition aspects and to focus on any restrictions/provisions in laws that pose great threat to competition.

Further, in pursuance of its objective to ensure that legislation is in sync with the needs of strong economic fundamentals, the Government constituted a Competition Law Review Committee under Shri Injeti Srinivas, Secretary Corporate Affairs on dated 1st October, 2018. The Committee is mandated to review the Competition Act/Rules/Regulation, to look into international best practices and sectoral interfaces etc.

Competition Commission of India (CCI) has amended the Combination Regulations. The post amendment regulations among others includes permitting withdrawal of notice and refilling the same by parties, allowing submission of voluntary modifications in response to notice, appointing agencies to supervise implementation of modification etc.

As part of competition Advocacy initiative at national and state level, CCI organised Roadshows in Mumbai, Delhi and Ahmedabad, including a National Conference on ""Public procurement and Competition Law."" Similar Roadshows with focus on competition matters are being held periodically and more are planned to be held in the coming months."

The action plan needs to focus on the teacher who plays a pivotal role in imparting education.

Beginning in 1968, India has had two education policies. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government constituted a committee under the chairmanship of late T.S.R. Subramanian to evolve a new policy. By the time the committee submitted its report, the Union HRD minister was changed.

So, another committee was constituted, this time under the chairmanship of K. Kasturirangan to formulate the new education policy. In July this year, the committee got a third extension.

The current government has only a few months to go. One fervently hopes that this report also does not meet the same fate as the one by T.S.R. Subramanian.

However, the key question is whether there is a need for a new education policy at all? It is undoubtedly true that what has so far happened in the education sector leaves a lot to be desired. What also needs to be considered is whether the dismal performance is on account of policy gap or are there other factors that are responsible for the current state of affairs? What is the rationale for a new policy in the school education sector?

During the past decade, the educational infrastructure (like school buildings) has certainly shown remarkable improvement, although there is still a long way to go. And, thanks to the midday meal, we have managed to get the child to the school. However, the quality of education that is imparted in most of the government schools has left a lot to be desired.

The learning outcomes have actually come down during the past decade despite an enormous amount of investment. The number of teachers has gone up substantially and the average pupil-teacher ratio comes close to the required levels. However, this has not solved the problem of quality.

To begin with, a large number of teachers are not qualified to teach, yet they are teaching. According to a rough estimate, out of 8 million teachers around 1.4 million fall in this category. Politics has seeped into this cadre in the most insidious manner resulting in the skewed distribution of teachers in most of the states as the tendency is to hang in and around urban areas.

The Right to Education Act did precious little to salvage these shortcomings. In fact, in some cases, like no-detention policy and mandatory provision relating to qualification and number of teachers, it created more problems than it solved. A tedious process of amendment had to be resorted to correct some of the wrongs.

Most of the action relating to education lies in the states. Moreover, India is too diverse to consider a single mandate by way of policy for the entire country. If a teacher does not go to a school in Kerala, there are chances that he or she will be punished, but some states in northern India are notorious for teacher absenteeism. Although the situation is now improving, it remains a big challenge in many states. Many teachers get away with playing truant. There are also instances of teachers employing a 'substitute' to represent them and even teach on their behalf. What quality of education can be expected from such so-called substitute teachers?

Can a new education policy solve the problems that beset this sector? Problems vary from region to region. If policies were to solve the problems of the country, they would have all been solved long ago. There should be just a short policy statement outlining the objectives: Providing quality education to every child in the country. Instead, what is actually required is an action plan clearly outlining what needs to be done, how will it be done, who will do it, and, by when will it be done? The roles of respective entities should be clearly defined so that the performance can be assessed.

The action plan needs to focus on the teacher who plays a pivotal role in imparting education. The entire value chain needs to be looked at, understood, and interventions clearly outlined. Beginning with pre-service training, to selection process, to in-service training, transfer and posting, engagement of teachers in non-educational activities, their promotional avenues and morale will need to be looked at. An action plan for each state will have to be worked out in detail, clearly outlining the roles of the central government and the respective state governments.

A beginning was made in this regard for the states of Jammu and Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh. The one relating to J&K is apparently being implemented, but UP is languishing. Such plans will have to be made for and in consultation with each state and their execution closely monitored. Intervention for each state will vary.

Unlike the current dispensation, there will have to be sufficient flexibility in the central schemes to accommodate the differences among states. The whole approach has to be outcome-based rather than input-based, as has been the case so far.

Our country has been obsessed with the Western world. We had looked at Finland, England, Scotland, New Zealand, Holland and all the lands of the world, but not at our own motherland. A lot of wonderful work is being done within the country, but has so far gone unnoticed. A new 'policy' can't help in this regard. What needs to be done is to facilitate identification, understanding and scaling of successful practices. If these homegrown practices have succeeded in the prevalent objective conditions, the chances of their replication and scaling are pretty high as compared to an 'imported' idea or practice. What is also required is to learn from states, like Rajasthan, that have turned it around through some remarkable state-level interventions both at administrative and financial levels.

Policy debates are always welcome and should happen, but what is required urgently is an action plan in consultation with all the stakeholders as has been done for a couple of states already. What is required is making things happen on the ground.

Imran had earlier given a dressing down to doc­tors at Chest Disease Hispital Srinagar asking them to improve the healthcare following death of a patient allegedly due to their negligence.

Imran said that he did'nt misbehave with the doctors, but rather asked them to im­prove the healthcare. He said that he visited the Chest Dis­ease hospital to ""improve the situation there.""

""I want to seek forgiveness in case I have used any abu­sive language but I want to urge the doctors not to go for strike as it will only add to the miseries of the patients"", Imran said.

He added he has not fired any public servant but has sought that the matter of negligence of the doctors that left an ailing woman dead should be taken up with the Chief Secretary.

""In case I have used any un-parliamentary language, then I am very sorry for that but don't make the people suffer,"" he said.

""I understand there are shortcomings so far as infrastructure is concerned and I want concerned to bring it in our notice"".

""The change has begun and we will not tolerate suffering of people any more"", he claimed.

In a video that had earlier gone viral, Deputy Mayor had during his visit to the hospital asked that doctor that instead of sitting in his room, he should have attended the duties. The video shows a patient also complaining about the lack of healthcare in the hospital.

Imran had also asked the doctors that it was their duty to attend to the patients and said that there was ""no way they could have justified the lack of patient care"" at the hospital. In the video, he is seen to have been seeking an explanation from the doctor.

It has been on in the district for a month now owing to a strike called by lawyers who have been demanding a high court bench in western Odisha.

Two fire tenders and 15 fire department officials were pressed into service to douse the flames. Several important documents are said to have been destroyed in the fire.

Wednesday was the last day for filling up forms for matriculation examination through correspondence. Some of the office-bearers were inside the building, located near Jail Chowk in the city, along with some teachers of schools under the Sambalpur zone, who had come to BSE office with students' application forms.

Suryamani Majhi, deputy secretary of BSE Sambalpur zone said, ""At around 2 in the afternoon around eight to 10 people barged into the office and asked us why we have opened it. They shouted at us to leave the office. All the staff, including me, as well as the visiting teachers came out of the office. The men then ransacked the office and set it on fire. They also set fire to two bikes which were under the portico, and fled the spot.""

Since November 19 all central and state government offices have been shut in the district owing to the lawyers' strike.

Majhi said the BSE office too had been closed since November 19. ""But since the filling up of forms for the correspondence exam was required, we had gone to the office on Wednesday. We had informed the Sambalpur Bar Association that we would open the office to complete the form fill-up work. Moreover, I had discussed it with the district collector as well. But some unknown people came to the office and set it on fire,"" Majhi alleged. He said he had never seen the people who carried out this act.

The Sambalpur Bar Association was having its general body meeting when the incident took place. ""We saw smoke coming out of the BSE office building when we came out of the meeting,"" Pradeep Bohidar, chairman of the action committee of Sambalpur Bar Association, said.

He said the incident is no way related to the ongoing strike for a high court bench. ""We strongly condemn the incident. The matter should be investigated properly and strong action should be initiated against those who involved in setting the BSE office on fire."" When asked about the extent of the damage, Majhi said they are yet to enter the office. ""Several official papers, furniture, books as well as certificates were there inside the office,"" Majhi added.

A check and (batch) mate game appears to be on in the first bureaucratic reshuffle of 40 IAS officers by the Gehlot government.

The 1993 batch officers who were holding the top most portfolios in the chief minister office and the secretariat till now have been replaced by their juniors belonging to the batch of 1994, and there is reason for this.

When former chief minister Vasundhara Raje assumed office on December 13, 2013, she appointed Tanmay Kumar as her secretary within a week. A 93 batch officer, Tanmay emerged a power centre and gripped his clutches in the CMO and the secretariat.

After his appointment to the highest office, his batch mate IAS officers, who got training along with him -- Akhil Arora, Aparna Arora, Shikhar Agrawal and Alok -- got appointment on cream posts.

Arora, who has been made principal secretary in social department in Tuesday's transfers, was till now appointed in planning department while Agrawal, after returning from deputation from New Delhi, was rewarded the post of Jaipur Development Commissioner (JDC), a much sought after post among the bureaucrats. Alok, meanwhile, served in important departments including Energy, Revenue and Energy till the time Tanmay was the CM secretary.

As the Gehlot government resumed office, the 94 batch officers fell out of favour and all were shunted out. It could be called a coincidence or a 'deliberate' exercise that their one batch junior officers of 93 batch were appointed on important posts as the new government took charge.

Kuldeep Ranka was appointed principal secretary to the CM, replacing Tammay who got posting as Commissioner of Command Area Development. Along with Ranka, his batch mates were 'crowned' with important portfolios.

Naresh Pal Gangwar, principal secretary planning, Roli Singh, principal secretary higher and technical education and Sreya Guha, principal secretary tourism, all Ranka's batch mates, were appointed in the latest reshuffle. The 93 batch officers, barring some exceptions, have returned to the 'power' finally.

""It happens that any officer appointed as CM secretary works to get plum posts to the batch mates. The trend may be witnessed in coming reshuffling,"" said an IAS officer on the condition of anonymity."

Nicholas Slatten was convicted of killing Ahmed Haithem Ahmed Al Rubia'y, one of 14 civilians slain when Blackwater guards opened fire in Nisur Square on Sept. 16, 2007, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia said in a statement.

Slatten is being held pending sentencing and faces a mandatory life prison term, the U.S. Attorney's Office said.

His murder conviction came a year after a federal appeals court vacated his initial 2014 conviction, saying he should have been tried separately from three other Blackwater guards involved in the incident.

Prosecutors allege that Slatten, of Sparta, Tennessee, fired the first shots and intentionally set off a shooting rampage that killed or wounded 31 civilians, beginning with the death of the driver of a white Kia, Ahmed Haithem Ahmed Al Rubia'y, 19. The dead included 10 men, two women and two boys, ages 9 and 11.

The shooting stood out for its brutality even in a city in the grips of a bitter sectarian war, and sparked debate over the role of private security contractors such as Blackwater working for the U.S. government in war zones.

Slatten and his fellow guards were travelling in a heavily armed, four-truck Blackwater Worldwide convoy and had been trying to clear a path for U.S. diplomats after a nearby car bomb.

At Nisur Square, they opened fire on Iraqis, including women and children, with machine guns and grenade launchers.

The U.S. Justice Department has long pursued accountability for the Nisur Square shooting.

The Justice Department's case against Slatten hinged on him having fired the first shots because of a general animosity toward Iraqis. But some evidence suggested an unnamed co-defendant might have fired the initial shots.

The appeals court also ordered the three other Blackwater guards to be resentenced, saying their 30-year terms were too long. That resentencing is pending, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. Slatten had received life in prison in the initial conviction.

Blackwater, which was founded by former Navy SEAL Erik Prince, the brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, was later sold and now operates as Virginia-based Academi.

The video has triggered outrage from doctors from across the valley. However, Imran Wednesday in a press conference said he will mend his mistake.

""If b..ls..t and bloody word is unparliamentary, I apologize and I am extremely sorry for that. I was emotional when I saw a dead patient there,"" he said.

In the presser, the Deputy Mayor took a dig at CD Hospital authorities stating that the hospital was worst hit and ""it has taken a toll on patient care.""

""The hospital faces lift problem, it has an improper heating arrangement, dog menace is rampant and it is without any fence. There was no ABG analyzer when I went to the hospital,"" he said.

As a mark of protest, the doctors at CD hospital Wednesday observed a pen-down strike for one hour.

""The uploaded video is edited one. Whatever happened behind scenes is not in the video. He has not shown all things. A patient expired at that time when the Deputy Mayor forced a doctor to walk from ward-to-ward. The patient was to be referred to the emergency,"" said a doctor at the hospital.

The video has triggered outrage from doctors and netizens, who condemned Imran's remarks, called it unfortunate and sought action against him.

Doctors Association Kashmir (DAK) called Deputy Mayor's remarks as ""unruly behaviour"" and expressed a strong resentment.

""It has now become a routine as ward members, Panchs, Sarpanchs and now Deputy Mayor is interfering in hospital affairs to get political mileage, because hospitals remain flooded with patients,"" said DAK president, Dr Suhail Naik.

He said the on-duty doctor was busy and was filling a referral form of a 60-year-old female patient at the hospital.

""It was better for him to focus on hospital sanitation and electricity. We warn them to mind their own work and not interfere in technical issues of the medical profession,"" Naik said.

""From his physical and verbal gestures, it seems he has received education from a western country. It was better for him to get moral education from some primary school here,"" he said.

DAK urged secretary Health and Medical Educations, Atal Dulloo to take strong note and act against the erring and unruly behaviour of Deputy Mayor.

Society of Dental Surgeons J&K (SDSJK) has also condemned the Deputy Mayor's behaviour stating that he surpassed service domain and was blatantly indecent in his approach.

""His primary job is to look beautification of the city and not to gain political mileage. His approach was totally uncalled for. He humiliated doctors by his unparliamentary behaviour,"" said president SDSJK, Dr Imtiyaz Banday.

""The inhuman behaviour shown by him clearly depicts that State's machinery does not run as per the rules and anybody can ride it for its vested interests,"" he said.

Banday appealed the Medical Superintendent CD Hospital to formally lodge FIR against Deputy Mayor so that he is booked for his 'unethical, illegal and rogue' behaviour.

Doctors Association Kashmir headed by Dr Nisar Ul Hassan has also criticized the behaviour of the Deputy Mayor and demanded an independent inquiry into the matter.

""He should have contacted the hospital administrator if he had a problem or there was an issue. There is a way to talk to a doctor,"" said its spokesperson Dr Riyaz Ahmad Daga.

Condemning the incident, he said the doctors are leaving Kashmir because of these reasons, mental torture and harassment faced by them in the hospitals.

Medical Faculty Association of Government Medical College, Srinagar and Government Dental College Srinagar also condemned the behaviour of Deputy Mayor towards the doctors on duty in CD Hospital Srinagar."

Global gender gap index is a part of this which measures gender equality across four pillars- they are economic opportunity, political empowerment, educational attainment and health and survival.

India needs to get more women into senior and professional roles to make more improvement in the rankings.

Mains Question: The World Economic Forum Global Gender Gap Report 2018 ranked India at 142 out of 149 countries on the economic participation and opportunity gap. Analyse the present status of women economic participation and opportunity gap in India.

Context: The Lok Sabha has passed the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2016 to give transgender persons equal rights and protection under law through a voice vote.

The Bill had gone to the standing committee, and as many as 27 amendments have been accepted by the government.

The amendments passed include a change in the previous definition of transgender persons as ""neither wholly female or wholly male"", which was criticised as being insensitive.

According to the new definition, a transgender person is somebody ""whose gender does not match the gender assigned to that person at birth and includes trans-men or trans-women, persons with intersex variations, gender-queers, and persons having socio-cultural identities such as kinnar, hijras, aravani, and jogta"".

Several civil society groups have been vocal about their opposition to the Bill The Bill disregards many of their suggestions as also some of the crucial points raised by the standing committee report of July 2017.

The Bill must recognise that gender identity must go beyond biological; gender identity is an individual's deep and personal experience. It need not correspond to the sex assigned at birth. It includes the personal sense of the body and other expressions such as one's own personal inducing proceeds.

Mains Question: Critically examine why the recently passed Transgender bill fails to address the systemic discrimination faced by transgenders in India.

Context: Women and child development ministry has drafted a policy dedicated to the protection of children. Until now, protection of children was only a part of the broader National child policy 2013.

The Supreme Court had asked the centre to consider framing the national policy on protection of children.

Key provisions and highlights of the draft policy:

The Policy should address four aspects- creating awareness, prevention, reporting and responding. The draft needs to go into all these aspects, especially reporting structure involving various nodal bodies and monitoring mechanism for implementation of the guidelines.

The policy makers should take the opportunity to go beyond the role of Institutions and look at the role of individuals.

The norms should be designed in such a way that organisations can customise the policies according to the nature of their work.

Context: A group of researchers at Nagpur-based Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology have developed a new technique which promises to help produce high value graphene from discarded dry cells batteries.

Since graphene is made out of graphite, its production is both expensive and has significant environmental impact. The new technique helps both reduce the cost and preserve environment.

Graphene has been touted in the global electronics industry as a ""miracle material"" given its strength, electrical conductivity and elasticity, and has been seen as an alternative to lithium-ion batteries since its discovery in 2004. It is a form of carbon that can be used to develop smaller, slimmer batteries but with higher capacity.

Graphene is a carbon material that is one atom thick. Its thin composition and high conductivity means it is used in applications ranging from miniaturised electronics to biomedical devices. These properties also enable thinner wire connections; providing extensive benefits for computers, solar panels, batteries, sensors and other devices.

Context: The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) has started the process of ""comprehensively amending"" the backbone of forest governance in India -- the Indian Forest Act, 1927 (IFA).

According to the 1996 Supreme Court order, the dictionary definition of the word forest is taken to be the legal definition too. It covers all statutorily recognised forests, whether designated as reserved, protected or otherwise for the purpose of Section 2(i) of the Forest Conservation Act (1980). As per the Court order, the term forest land, occurring in Section 2, will not only include forest as understood in the dictionary sense, but also any area recorded as forest in the government record irrespective of the ownership.

The Indian Forest Act, 1927 was largely based on previous Indian Forest Acts implemented under the British. The most famous one was the Indian Forest Act of 1878.

Many reports like the MB Shah report of 2010 and the TSR Subramanian report of 2015, have talked about amending the IFA.

Mains Question: The recent amendments to the Indian Forest Act, 1927 will create new markets & jobs for poor communities. Critically analyze.

Context: The Tamil Nadu government has distributed 200 Navic- powered satellite- enabled communication devices developed by ISRO to 80 fishing boat groups.

NAVIC is an independent regional navigation satellite system designed to provide position information in the Indian region and 1500 km around the Indian mainland.

IRNSS would provide two types of services, namely Standard Positioning Services available to all users and Restricted Services provided to authorised users.

It is a regional system and so its constellation will consist of seven satellites. Three of these will be geostationary over the Indian Ocean, i.e., they will appear to be stationary in the sky over the region, and four will be geosynchronous - appearing at the same point in the sky at the same time every day. This configuration ensures each satellite is being tracked by at least one of fourteen ground stations at any given point of time, with a high chance of most of them being visible from any point in India.

Why it is necessary to have indigenous global navigation system?

Having a global navigation system bolsters the ability of a nation to serve as a net security provider, especially through the guarantee of such assurance policies. It can also play a significant role in relief efforts post disasters such as the tsunami in the Indian Ocean region in 2004 and the Pakistan-India earthquake in 2005.

Mains Question: Write a note on the objectives and significance of NAVIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation).

The 7 round of India - South Korea Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) negotiations were held in South Korea from 11 to 13 December, 2018.

South Korea imports around 15 lac tones of raw sugar annually and the Indian sugar industry is making efforts to export raw sugar from India during 2018-19 sugar seasons.

India and South Korea will reduce duties on 11 tariff lines in a bid to expand bilateral trade by updating their existing free-trade agreement, called the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA).

In 2017-18, India exported goods worth $4.4 billion to South Korea while imports from the latter were worth $16.3 billion.

CECA - Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement

CEPA - Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement

The major ""technical"" difference between a CECA and CEPA is that CECA involve only ""tariff reduction/elimination in a phased manner on listed/all items except the negative list and tariff rate quota (TRQ) items. CEPA also covers the trade in services and investment and other areas of economic partnership"".

So CEPA is a wider term that CECA and has the widest coverage.

Usually CECA is signed first with a country and after that negotiations may start for a CEPA.

A government order on December 17, 2018, states that the SLAC will comprise the Vice Chairman, Kerala State Higher Education Council, as chairman, and Vice Chancellors of all State universities and Member Secretary of the council (convener) as members.

The Hindu has learnt that the decision to replace the members of the earlier body with Vice Chancellors was taken following opposition from universities, which feared that such a committee will have an overarching role over it.

Eight of the 15-member SLAC approved by the government on November 1 were experts in various fields representing reputed institutions across the country.

Anurag Kumar, Director, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore; Balan Nambiar, artist and former chairman of Kerala Lalithakala Akademi, New Delhi; and C.P.

The UK's future skills-based immigration system, tabled in the House of Commons by UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid, removes any cap on highly-skilled migrants from anywhere in the world and improves the post-study work offering for international students.

The proposals, set to be phased in from December 2021 after the proposed transition period for Britain's exit from the European Union (EU), claim to level the country's immigration playing field with the end of free movement for people from within the 28-member economic bloc.

""As we leave the European Union, free movement will end."" This will be a system where it is workers' skills that matter, not which country they come from,"" British Prime Minister Theresa May said in her foreword to the strategy.

""We are taking a skills-based approach to ensure we can attract the brightest and best migrants to the UK,"" added Javid, who made a reference to his own Pakistani origins as the ""son of immigrant parents"".

Under the new proposals, an annual cap of 20,700 on the number of skilled work visas issued will be removed, likely to benefit doctors and IT professionals from India, among others. There will also be a new 12-month visa route for workers at any skill level for a temporary period to allow businesses to hire the staff they need on a time-bound basis.

""People arriving on this route will not be able to bring family members with them, won't accrue rights to settle in the UK and will have a 12-month cooling off period once their visa expires,"" the UK Home Office said.

The onerous requirement for labour market tests by employers wanting to sponsor an overseas skilled worker are also to be done away with.

The plans were broadly welcomed by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), which said the White Paper recognises the value offered by skilled workers from countries like India.

""Indian Industry has long called for a fair, transparent and skills-based immigration system, and today's proposals go some way to achieving these goals, said Jim Bligh, of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Chair of CII's UK India Business Forum.

""Tackling the UK's skills gaps, particularly in digital and technology, must remain a key focus for government and it is welcome that this paper recognises the value that skilled workers from overseas can bring to helping improve the UK's skills base, he said.

Under changes proposed to attract international students to the UK, the government said it would ""improve the current offer"" to those who have completed a degree who want to stay on in the UK to work after they have completed their studies by offering six months' post-study leave to all Master's students and Bachelor's students studying at an institution with degree-awarding powers. This is aimed at giving them more time to find permanent skilled work and to work temporarily during that period.

""We will also allow for students studying at Bachelor's level or above to be able to apply to switch into the skilled workers route up to three months before the end of their course in the UK, and from outside of the UK for two years after their graduation,"" the White Paper notes.

Universities UK International, the representative group for the country's higher education institutions which has been campaigning for a better post-study offer, said the proposals recognise the important contributions made by international students to the UK.

""Allowing graduates to stay on for longer to find work in the UK sends the message that international students are welcome here, and we value the skills they bring. These changes will have a real, positive impact on the students who come here to study and their opportunities after graduating,"" said Vivienne Stern, Director of Universities UK International.

However, the group added that it will continue to campaign for a longer two-year post-study work visa.

As part of some of the more contentious aspects of the new immigration White Paper, the government will hold a consultation on a minimum salary requirement of 30,000 pounds for skilled migrants seeking five-year visas and low-skilled workers may be able to apply for short-term visas of up to a year.

The document forms the basis for the Immigration and Social Security Coordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill, to be published on Thursday, which ends free movement for EU nationals and creates the legal framework for a future UK borders and immigration system after Brexit. It also creates parity in the way migrants can access the country's benefits system, which will apply equally to both EU and non-EU nationals.

The new system will be implemented in a phased approach from 2021, following an extensive 12-month programme of engagement with businesses, stakeholders and the public, the Home Office said.

While it does not make a specific reference to the ruling Conservative Party's manifesto pledge to bring immigration down to the tens of thousands annually, the government stressed that the target remains in place. Tags: Brexit India UK"

""Das can work under any government. He follows the rule book,"" the Minister added.

Well, Das's critics may hold a different view, but being a true-blue Babu seems to have worked in his favour. In times of difficulties, it's always the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officials who seem to be the fall-back persons of ministers.

Yet, take stock of the year gone by and bureaucracy seems to have lost its sheen. Many who are still serving have been tossed around from one ministry to another or prematurely repatriated without being given an opportunity to explain. Some have been intimidated by politicians -- take the case of Delhi Chief Secretary or the shocking sentencing of former coal secretary HC Gupta.

Jawhar Sircar, a former IAS officer who has held key positions as Culture Secretary and CEO of Prasar Bharati, feels that usually working in the Centre is more systematic and impersonal than in the States. But that has changed now, with a pall of fear over the civil servants. Transfers and repatriations happen without any prior warning.

Talent expert Hemant Sharma, former HR head of Sun Microsystems, feels that bureaucracy is losing its sheen is because it is no longer an aspirational job for the brightest minds of our country. ""Till the eighties, getting into the IAS was the dream of educated youths and attracted the best minds of the country. Initially, post Independence, people joined the government, driven by ideals of contributing to nation building. Later, in the 1970s, the power of these roles was a big draw,"" he analyses. Today, the role models for the brightest minds are the Satya Nadellas and Sundar Pichais of the world.

In short, what civil servants today need is a role model -- their own Nadella or Pichai.

To be fair, the Department of Personnel & Training (DOPT) has been attempting to introduce meritocracy in promotions, with concepts like SPARROW -- Smart Performance Appraisal Report Recording Window -- and a 360-degree feedback tool for officers in line to become Additional Secretaries or Secretaries. This June, it even came out with ads for lateral recruitment to senior positions in the government for 10 Department/Ministries.

Although the ad attracted 6,097 applicants, the candidates seem to have fallen short of expectations. Now the task of sifting through the applications has been given to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). On December 11, UPSC asked the candidates to fill a Detailed Application Form, the last date to submit which is January 1, 2019.

But, despite all these moves, some serious rethinking is needed when it comes to management of the bureaucracy. Sharma suggests building employer branding to attract better quality talent. ""While they are called public servants, there is, however, no customer orientation or service orientation in the bureaucracy,"" he says.

Most feel there needs to be greater consistency in postings and specialised expertise is much needed, particularly for the social sector. As Sircar says, ""Today, unfortunately, the officers are not making use of even half of their capabilities because of fear of uncertainties which can follow them even after their retirement.""

Says Dhir Jhingran, Founder Director of Language and Learning Foundation, ""I favour offering specialisation opportunity to interested IAS officers early in their career so they can build domain knowledge and expertise in specific areas. In this time, it has become crucial to understand domains like health, education or any other sector to be able to learn from the best practices across the world.""

Probably this is where lateral entry could work. But even as efforts are being made, why is there such widespread disillusionment within the service?

Sharma cites two reasons. ""The young bright minds join the service with the desire to change things in the country, but they soon lose the motivation, given the rigid rules and regulations which prevent them from implementing out-of-the-box ideas. At a societal level, to the common man, bureaucracy is not necessarily the IAS officer but the Block Development Officer at the grass-roots level. Here, the common citizen encounters corruption at every step of government interface to get public services delivered to him/her.""

Anil Swarup, former Coal and Education Secretary, feels that ""while there is transparency in performance appraisals, similar transparency is missing in selection of officers to senior-level posts. There is absence of communication between those that are responsible for selection/empanelment and those that are not considered for selection. A sincere conversation with those that are left will enable them to improve and will not lead to demoralisation.""

As former IAS officer Vivek Rae, who was also a member of the Seventh Pay Commission, says, there is need for a more rigorous system to recognise and reward merit and punish weak performance, both at the Central and State level. Automatic career progression to higher pay scales, especially through non-functional upgradation, has to stop.

And there is mixed signalling everywhere. As an in-service officer says, ""When we meet the Prime Minister for meetings he calls, we all feel motivated and convinced...but..."".

It's time the government stopped this mixed messaging and put some trust and faith in the civil servants of the country."

The UK's future skills-based immigration system, tabled in the House of Commons by UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid, removes any cap on highly-skilled migrants from anywhere in the world and improves the post-study work offering for international students.

The proposals, set to be phased in from December 2021 after the proposed transition period for Britain's exit from the European Union (EU), claim to level the country's immigration playing field with the end of free movement for people from within the 28-member economic bloc.

""As we leave the European Union, free movement will end...This will be a system where it is workers' skills that matter, not which country they come from,"" British Prime Minister Theresa May said in her foreword to the strategy.

""We are taking a skills-based approach to ensure we can attract the brightest and best migrants to the UK,"" added Javid, who made a reference to his own Pakistani origins as the ""son of immigrant parents"".

Under the new proposals, an annual cap of 20,700 on the number of skilled work visas issued will be removed, likely to benefit doctors and IT professionals from India, among others. There will also be a new 12-month visa route for workers at any skill level for a temporary period to allow businesses to hire the staff they need on a time-bound basis.

""People arriving on this route will not be able to bring family members with them, won't accrue rights to settle in the UK and will have a 12-month cooling off period once their visa expires,"" the UK Home Office said.

The onerous requirement for labour market tests by employers wanting to sponsor an overseas skilled worker are also to be done away with.

The plans were broadly welcomed by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), which said the White Paper recognises the value offered by skilled workers from countries like India.

""Indian Industry has long called for a fair, transparent and skills-based immigration system, and today's proposals go some way to achieving these goals,"" said Jim Bligh, of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Chair of CII's UK India Business Forum.

""Tackling the UK's skills gaps, particularly in digital and technology, must remain a key focus for government and it is welcome that this paper recognises the value that skilled workers from overseas can bring to helping improve the UK's skills base,"" he said.

Under changes proposed to attract international students to the UK, the government said it would ""improve the current offer"" to those who have completed a degree who want to stay on in the UK to work after they have completed their studies by offering six months' post-study leave to all Master's students and Bachelor's students studying at an institution with degree-awarding powers. This is aimed at giving them more time to find permanent skilled work and to work temporarily during that period.

""We will also allow for students studying at Bachelor's level or above to be able to apply to switch into the skilled workers route up to three months before the end of their course in the UK, and from outside of the UK for two years after their graduation,"" the White Paper notes.

Universities UK International, the representative group for the country's higher education institutions which has been campaigning for a better post-study offer, said the proposals recognise the important contributions made by international students to the UK.

""Allowing graduates to stay on for longer to find work in the UK sends the message that international students are welcome here, and we value the skills they bring. These changes will have a real, positive impact on the students who come here to study and their opportunities after graduating,"" said Vivienne Stern, Director of Universities UK International.

However, the group added that it will continue to campaign for a longer two-year post-study work visa.

As part of some of the more contentious aspects of the new immigration White Paper, the government will hold a consultation on a minimum salary requirement of 30,000 pounds for skilled migrants seeking five-year visas and low-skilled workers may be able to apply for short-term visas of up to a year.

The document forms the basis for the Immigration and Social Security Coordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill, to be published on Thursday, which ends free movement for EU nationals and creates the legal framework for a future UK borders and immigration system after Brexit. It also creates parity in the way migrants can access the country's benefits system, which will apply equally to both EU and non-EU nationals.

The new system will be implemented in a phased approach from 2021, following an extensive 12-month programme of engagement with businesses, stakeholders and the public, the Home Office said.

While it does not make a specific reference to the ruling Conservative Party's manifesto pledge to bring immigration down to the tens of thousands annually, the government stressed that the target remains in place."

He said the panel will examine the possibility of operating a health insurance scheme in the state directly through a third-party administrator (TPA) by dispensing with the insurer and intermediary, determining the contours of such a scheme and the selection procedure.

The committee, as per the order, has to submit its report by the end of December, the spokesman said.

The panel is being set up two months after Malik had ordered foreclosure of the contract with Reliance General Insurance for implementing the group mediclaim health insurance for the state employees and had asked the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) to probe the matter.

The government in September 20 this year had rolled out a group mediclaim health insurance policy for its employees, pensioners and accredited journalists of the state and had a tie-up with Reliance General Insurance for the policy, which was made mandatory for the employees and pensioners.

But on October 25, the governor had cancelled the tie-up with Reliance General Insurance for providing the group medi-claim health insurance policy to employees as there was ""some bungling"" in it.

Two days later on October 27, Malik approved foreclosure of the contract with Reliance General Insurance Company (RGIC) and referred the matter to the newly-established Anti-Corruption Bureau for examining the entire process to see whether it was conducted in a transparent and fair manner.

The workshop, which was part of a Continuing Medical Education (CME) on 'Transfusion Medicines: Updates for Clinicians' arranged by the operating faculties at the AMS, received a good response from students, observers and practitioners from the medical field.

The prime motive of the workshop was to spread awareness among the medical practitioners about the much controversial process of blood transfusion. The key speakers for the workshop included stalwarts in the field of transfusion medicine like Dr RN Makroo, Dr Aseem Tiwari and Dr Rajesh Sawant. The speakers individually focused on various factors related to blood transfusion and gave a precise insight to the audience.

Dr Sawant spoke about basic knowledge and mandatory know-abouts of the blood transfusion process which included transfusion consent from patients, proper labelling of blood bags, technical aspects of the process, visual assessment of blood and blood warming process. He also talked about the importance of five 'rights of transfusion'- right patient, right product, right amount, right rate and right time.

Dr Aseem Tiwari, while talking about 'Transfusion Reactions', elaborated the reasons and types of various reactions that are caused during and after the process of transfusion, as well as the management of possible allergies caused. He focused on the fact that clerical errors during blood transfusion are more likely to occur than technical errors; and so, being very attentive and cautious during the process should be a top priority. Talking on a popular myth about relative blood, he said, ""It is believed that relative blood transfusion is OK, but we should avoid transfusing blood to the patient that is taken from his close relatives. The body gets confused in cases of relative blood transfusion and may create more problems for the patient.""

Dr Makroo started his session with a basic question -- Why should we donate blood? Proceeding further with his topic- blood donation -- he talked about the need, types and advantages of blood donation, who can or cannot donate blood as well as facts and myths related to it. He told the audience that blood donation replaces the old blood with fresher and healthier blood and so, everyone should donate it at least once in 4 months. ""I have donated my blood 151 times till date and I will continue to do so to stay fit and young even at the age of 65,"" he said.

The workshop was preceded by a daylong programme including seminars and panel discussions related to transfusion medicines by several renowned doctors like AMS president Dr Warbhe, Dr Rajadhyaksha, Dr Rahate, Dr Lavange, Dr Ganju and Dr Deshmukh. The event ended with a vote of thanks from AMS secretary Dr Ambade. The Maharashtra Medical Council accredited had granted two credit points for this enclave."

resources.

She said she has always been a learner and been interested in the teaching profession.

Bedi recalled the reforms she effected in Tihar jail in Delhi and improved the standard of literacy of prisoners. ""It all depends on how strong your will is and how

Addressing media persons here today, the Union Minister for Tribal Affairs Shri Jual Oram said that consequent upon Budget announcement for 2018-19, Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, in its meeting held on 17th December, 2018, has decided that by the year 2022, every block with more than 50% ST population and at least 20,000 tribal persons, will have an Eklavya Model Residential School. Eklavya schools will be on par with Navodaya Vidyalayas and will have special facilities for preserving local art and culture besides providing training in sports and skill development. Across the country, as per census 2011 figures, there are 564 sub-districts i.e. blocks/taluka/tehsil having more than 50% ST population and at least 20,000 tribal persons. Out of these sub-districts, at present 102 sub-districts have EMRSs.

He informed the media persons that it is proposed to establish new EMRSs in the remaining 462 sub-districts by the year 2022 as per the phasing plan as given below:

The Minister said that the proposed scale up of the initiative through enhanced recurring and non-recurring cost is a path breaking initiative. This will immensely help in reducing gaps in literacy between ST population vis-à-vis overall population. The focus is on academic excellence through this upscaled initiative and will lead to holistic development of tribal children.

Ministry of Tribal Affairs (M/oTA) was set up in 1999, with the objective of providing more focused approach on the integrated socio-economic development of the Scheduled Tribes (STs), the most underprivileged of the Indian Society, in a coordinated and planned manner. M/oTA is the nodal Ministry for overall policy, planning and coordination of programmes for development of STs. One of the important educational intervention by Ministry of Tribal Affairs is establishing Eklavya Model Residential Schools with the objective of enhancing access to quality education and to maximize retention of ST students within various stages of school education and promoting higher learning among them. EMRS is an excellent approach for imparting quality education to ST children. Apart from school building including hostels and staff quarters, provision for a playground, students' computer lab, teacher resource room etc. are also included in the EMRSs. A total of 284 EMRSs have been sanctioned as on date, out of which 219 have been reported functional, with about 65,231 students enrolled therein. The existing non-recurring cost is Rs.12.00 Crores (16.00 Crores for North East, hilly, deserts and islands). The recurring cost is Rs.61500/- from 2018-19.

The important features of the decision are:-

1. Setting up of Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRSs) in 462 blocks having more than 50% ST population with minimum 20,000 ST population by the year 2022 including 12 Eklavya Model Day Boarding School (EMDBS). It may be also being mentioned that EMDBS will be established wherever density of ST population is higher in identified Sub-Districts/Blocks (90% or more). This will be a boost for providing additional scope for ST Students seeking to avail school education without residential facility.

2. Financial provisions for 145 EMRSs and 5 EMDBSs during 2018-19 and 2019-20.

3. Setting up of an Autonomous Society under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs similar to Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti to run the EMRSs. (The Society to function through an Executive Committee (EC) under the Chairmanship of Secretary, Tribal Affairs. The EC shall be responsible for the management of all affairs including allocation of funds for setting up and functioning of EMRSs. The composition of the Steering Committee will be decided with the approval of the Minister, Tribal Affairs.

4. Enhancing the construction cost of EMRS (with 480 students capacity) to Rs. 20.00 Crore.

5. Cost of construction of EMRSs for North East, hilly areas, difficult areas and areas affected by Left Wing Extremism at 20% more than the normal cost.

6. Enhancing the recurring cost from the existing Rs. 61,500/- to Rs. 1,09,000/- per student per year from 2019-20 and recurring cost for EMDBS to Rs. 85,000/- per student per year from 2019-20.

7. Upgradation of already sanctioned EMRSs on need basis with unit cost subject to a maximum of Rs. 5 crores per school.

8. Setting up Centre of Excellence for sports at select locations with all related infrastructure (buildings, equipment's etc.). This Centre of Excellence will have specialized state-of-the-art facilities for two identified sports (including one group sport and one individual sport) which will be common for a State.

9. Enhancing the grants for maintenance, which are admissible every five years, from Rs 10 lakhs to Rs.20 Lakhs.

10. Utilization of up to 10% seats by non-ST students. Priority shall be given to children of EMRSs staff, children who have lost their parents to Left wing extremism and insurgencies, children of widows etc.

11. Reservation of 20% seats under sports quota for deserving ST students who have excelled in the field of sports.

12. Rolling out the proposed scheme with a financial cost of Rs. 2238.47 Crores during 2018-19 and 2019-20."

It is bordered by Benin to the west, Niger to the north, Cameroon to the east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south.

Imports: Machinery; chemicals; transport equipment; manufactured goods; food and live animals

There are five primary forms of companies commonly used by foreign investors:

The minimum number of shareholders for a private company limited by shares is two, while the maximum number of shareholders is 50. In order for a foreign entity to trade in Nigeria it is mandatory that such entity incorporate a company. This is done at the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) situated in the country's capital Nairobi, and is evidenced by a CAC certificate upon the completion of the process. Unlimited liability companies are formed for certain professions which are not permitted to have limited liability.

The following steps need to be taken in order to incorporate a company:

The approximate timeframe will depend on the type of business being set up. A private or public company limited by shares typically takes between 2 to 3 weeks to set up.

Annual general meetings (AGM) are required in Nigeria. AGM's must be held within nine months of the financial year end and not more than 15 months after the previous meeting.

The minimum share capital to incorporate a private limited liability company is approximately USD 55. However, where foreigners will hold shares in the company, there is a minimum investment requirement of approximately USD 55 000 in order for the company to be eligible to apply for a business permit and expatriate quota approval.

The minimum number of directors for any company is 2. Directors can be appointed by the shareholders at incorporation; or by other directors to fill a casual vacancy subject to the ratification of the appointment by the shareholders at the AGM. The appointment of the directors can be done in three to five days.

A Nigerian resident must be appointed as the secretary of the company and all companies. Qualified Nigerian auditors are also required.

Foreigners are allowed to wholly own companies, however certain legislation stipulates mandatory indigenous participation in certain sectors, such as oil and gas and inland water trading. Companies with foreign shareholders are required to apply for a business permit from the Citizenship and Business Department of the Ministry of Interior to enable such company to carry on business in Nigeria.

A branch can be established. A representative office is not authorised to carry on business activities. The process is the same as for trading entities and takes between 2 to 3 weeks to register.

Nigeria currently has no national competition law or policy in place. However, in certain instances specific sector or industry legislation makes provision for competition related aspects.

Further to the paragraph above, competition law is not regulated in Nigeria and there are, accordingly, no specific merger controls in place.

Competition is not regulated in Nigeria and restrictive practices are therefore not regulated.

Owing to the lack of competition regulation in Nigeria, there are no abuse-of-dominance provisions to contend with.

As Nigeria has no competition legislation and/or policy in place, there are no specific sanctions with regard to competition law.

There are various piecemeal legislative provisions in Nigeria which have both a direct and indirect impact on consumer protection. In addition to such legislative provisions there is also the Consumer Protection Council Act, 1992 (CPCA) which is specifically aimed at the enforcement of consumer rights by providing consumers with the appropriate avenues to seek redress.

Some of the key provisions of the CPCA are as follows:

In 2010, the Cyber Security and Information Protection Agency Bill was tabled in Parliament. In terms of which a cyber-security and information protection agency will be established, which will be charged with protecting computer systems and networks, and liaise with the relevant law enforcement agency for the enforcement of cybercrimes laws and related matters. However, to date, no substantial progress has been made in this regard.

However, for the time being, data protection is regulated by the general provisions relating to the protection of privacy as set out in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as well as other relevant legislative provisions. In this respect the following principles apply:

Nigeria is a federation of 36 states, each with its own House of Assembly and laws. The highest court is the Supreme Court of Nigeria which sits above the Court of Appeal; both of these courts have federal jurisdiction. The Federal High Courts and the High Courts of States have concurrent jurisdiction, and the Sharia Court of Appeals and Customary Court of Appeals hear appeals from the lowest courts which are known as Customary, Area and Sharia Courts. The Magistrate's and District Courts hear smaller matters.

It is no longer an inflexible or rigid rule that a plaintiff resident abroad should provide security for costs. Courts must rather exercise discretion with regard to all the circumstances of the case.

The Judge has the discretion to make any order as to costs that he deems fit. In principle, the successful party is entitled to be indemnified for legitimate expenses which he has necessarily incurred by the institution of proceedings, either wholly or partially.

There is a single professional roll for all legal professionals that include both barristers and solicitors.

The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1990 provides authority for the conduct of arbitrations and is modelled closely upon the UNCITRAL model law and its rules. The Constitution empowers the Chief Judge of each state to make practice directives for the incorporation of ADR into the civil procedure, which has resulted in certain states emphasizing ADR in the pre-trial stages. The Nigerian branch of the London based Chartered Institute of Arbitrators, the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators Nigeria, and the Lagos Regional Centre for International Commercial Arbitration have all handled high profile arbitrations, while the Lagos Chamber Arbitration Centre (LAC), the Society of Construction Industry Arbitrators (SCIArb), the Maritime Arbitrators of Nigeria, and the Negotiation and Conflict Management Group (NCMG) all also handle arbitrations. Nigeria is a party to the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards.

A contract of employment must be given within 3 months of commencement.

There are certain exchange control regulations in Nigeria. A foreign investor may invest in any enterprise or securities with foreign currency or capital imported into Nigeria through an authorised dealer (a licensed bank).

An investor will be issued with a Certificate of Capital Importation (CCI) by the authorised dealer through which the capital is imported into Nigeria.

The CCI typically entitles the foreign investor to open a foreign currency domiciliary account with any authorised dealer for investment purposes, open a special non-resident Nigerian Dollar (Naira) account to which could be credited all receipts from the capital inflows, proceeds from sale of securities, dividends and interests.

Furthermore, to invest in securities in Nigeria out of the balances in the Naira account and repatriate the capital, capital gains, dividends and income received by way of interests through authorised dealers which are subject to deductions of taxes.

Resident companies are taxed on their worldwide income. Non-resident companies are taxed on profits derived from Nigeria, to the extent that profits are not attributable to operations outside of Nigeria.

Income tax, capital gains tax, tertiary education tax, petroleum profits tax and dividends tax are payable.

Both resident and non-resident companies are taxed at 30% except for petroleum profits tax, which for resident petroleum companies is at a rate of 85%.

CGT is at a rate of 10% on resident and non-resident companies and individuals. Dividends are taxed at 10%. Interest and rent are taxed at 10% on both resident and non-resident companies and individuals.

Royalties are taxed at 10% on royalties earned by resident companies and 5% on royalties earned by resident individuals and non-resident individuals and companies. There is a tax of 10% on consultancy fees and management fees.

Directors are taxed at 10% on director's fees earned by resident individuals.

Nigeria has entered into double taxation agreements with the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Pakistan, Canada, Romania, Netherlands, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Philippines, Japan, China, South Africa and Italy (shipping and air transportation only)."

It is particularly outrageous to utilize a commission tasked with addressing gun violence in schools as a tool to undermine protections for students of color -- and HRC will continue to fight alongside civil rights and education advocates to stop this administration's harmful agenda and protect the civil rights of all students.""

Schools are prohibited from discriminating against students based on race, color, national origin, sex, religion or disability. Despite these laws, discrimination is rampant in the administration of school discipline. Data collected by the Department of Education clearly shows that black students are suspended and expelled three times more often than white students, and students with disabilities are twice as likely to be suspended or expelled as students without disabilities.

In 2014, the Obama Administration's Department of Education issued guidance reminding schools that they must administer discipline policies in a non-discriminatory manner, and it provided resources to help schools ensure they are providing an equal opportunity for all students.

In March, HRC, along with other leading national LGBTQ organizations, sent a letter to DeVos urging her to keep the 2014 guidance in place.

LGBTQ students also face disproportionate levels of unfairly harsh school discipline practices. According to a study from GLSEN, two thirds of LGBTQ students have experienced some form of discipline, compared to less than half of non-LGBTQ students. Students with multiple marginalized identities, including LGBTQ students of color and LGBTQ students with disabilities, are particularly at risk for being subject to exclusionary school discipline. An HRC survey of more than 12,000 LGBTQ youth found that Black and African American, Native American and Alaska Native, and multiracial respondents reported being expelled from school at more than twice the rate of white respondents. Black and African American respondents also reported receiving out-of-school suspensions at three times the rate of white respondents.

Although the guidance rescinded today does not explicitly talk about LGBTQ students, they are disproportionately impacted by these policies. The consequences of exclusionary school discipline can be devastating to young people, especially those who may already face marginalization in school, their communities and even at home. Students experiencing exclusionary school discipline lose critical instruction time and are often pushed out of school, which can lead to involvement with the juvenile justice system or homelessness.

The 'entrepreneurship curriculum' will train the secondary and senior secondary students, from Class 9 to 12 before they start college. Explaining the rationale behind this curriculum at the first convocation of Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday said, ""We need to instill confidence among our children in school right from the beginning of secondary education that after completing their education, they should aspire to be job givers and not job seekers"".

The curriculum will be based on a four-fold framework -- inspire through stories and case studies of entrepreneurial journeys, educate through self-designed micro research, involve through local community, and facilitate by supporting in developing ideas into projects.

Sisodia said, ""Barring few exceptions, once the child completes elementary schooling and joins the secondary class, his entire orientation, which is largely shaped by the teachers and parents, is to secure good marks in exams, get admission in a good college and get a job with decent pay package after completing education. This is considered a trajectory of success and anyone who either secures less marks or fails to join college or fails to secure a job is deemed as unsuccessful.""

""If our schools and colleges continue to churn out batches of students who are going to join the queue with the mindset of job seekers we will soon be left with very small number of job givers,"" he added. The minister has directed the education secretary to set up a high powered working group having senior faculties from SCERT/DIET, principals and individuals having domain expertise."

Prime News, International, (Washington), December 19:-A safety panel set up by US President Donald Trump in the wake of numerous school shootings recommended on Tuesday that schools consider arming staff, using veterans as guards and reversing Obama-era guidelines.

The Federal Commission on School Safety panel, led by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, was set up after the February massacre in Parkland, Florida, when a former student shot dead 17 people, sparking mass gun control protests.

The commission rejected calls to increase the minimum age required for gun purchases, arguing in its 180-page report that most school shooters obtain their weapons from family members or friends.

Instead, it suggested arming staff -- even teachers in some circumstances -- ""for the sake of effectively and immediately responding to violence."" School districts where police responses could be slower, such as rural districts, may benefit in particular, the commission said.

It also recommended education authorities hiring military veterans and former police officers who ""can also serve as highly effective educators."" The report pushes for a review of disciplinary guidelines introduced in 2014 under former president Barack Obama, which suggested alternatives to suspension and expulsion to tackle discrimination against black and Latino students.

The commission's report said the measure has had ""a strong negative impact on school discipline and safety."" The American Civil Liberties Union condemned that proposition.

""The Trump administration is exploiting tragedies to justify rolling back school children's civil rights protections, despite the lack of any evidence linking school discipline reform to school shootings,"" it said in a statement.

Democratic Representative Nancy Pelosi, who will be US House speaker when her party take over the chamber in January, criticized the report saying Trump and DeVos ""have reached a new low."" ""Their 'report' on school safety puts special interests and the NRA ahead of protecting America's school children. Students & parents have had #Enough,"" Pelosi wrote on Twitter.

She drew a backlash from Ryan Petty, a gun enthusiast and school safety advocate whose 14 year old daughter was killed in the Parkland massacre.

""Hi @NancyPelosi, it's easy to be a critic. Harder to create. Would you sit down with Parkland families to discuss the report?,"" Petty wrote on Twitter.

""We worked hard to ensure this report addresses top school safety priorities. It's painful for us when you dismiss it without basis in fact,"" he added."

She died of cardiac arrest at the age of 66 in February.

She was honoured with the 2018 United Nations Human Rights Prize, an award given every five years since 1968.

Jahangir's daughter Munizae Jahangir received the award on her behalf from President of the UN General Assembly Mara Fernanda Espinosa at a special ceremony here Tuesday.

Among others who won the award include girls' education rights activist Rebeca Gyumi of Tanzania, Brazil's first indigenous woman lawyer Joenia Batista de Carvalho and Front Line Defenders from Ireland, working to protect human rights defenders at risk.

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that the work of the honourees and that of other human rights defenders around the world is essential for the collective efforts to sustain peace and ensure inclusive sustainable development and respect for human rights for all.

""Often their work is dangerous. We regularly hear of abuses against human rights defenders murder, disappearances, torture, arbitrary imprisonment and other attempts to silence them.

""Yet, these courageous individuals and groups remain committed to shining a light on the dark corners of the globe, wherever human rights violations occur,"" he said in his remarks to the General Assembly's United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights award ceremony.

The event commemorated the 70th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, marked annually on December 10.

Guterres said human rights defenders give voice to the voiceless and shield the powerless against injustice.

""They stand for all rights economic, civil, political, social and cultural. They support the rule of law or work peacefully to change laws so women and girls, indigenous communities, minorities and other marginalised groups may exercise their rights,"" he said.

Guterres said they they work to empower people through education, and help to protect other human rights defenders from harassment, intimidation or arrest.

As part of the UN's activities in observance of Human Rights Day, which coincided with the Declaration's anniversary, the champions in the field from across the world, convened at the General Assembly Hall to be recognised for their outstanding contributions.

Every five years, the United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights is awarded to organisations and individuals which embody excellent activism in defending human rights.

The four winners join a notable group who have been recognised since the Prize was established by the General Assembly in 1966, including prominent figures such as Eleanor Roosevelt, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, Jimmy Carter, Malala Yusafzai and this year's Nobel Peace Prize winners, Denis Mukwege and Nadia Murad, as well as organisations such as the Amnesty International and the International Committee of the Red Cross.

Marking the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Espinosa said it was one of the most important contributions that the world body has made to mankind, reflecting the collective aspirations of an international order founded on human dignity and with a view to making the world a better place.

UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said upholding all people's human rights is the only possible path to peace."

(HT File)

After introducing ""happiness classes"" for children in its schools, the Delhi government is going to have ""entrepreneurship curriculum"" from the next academic session.

The idea behind the curriculum, which will be taught to students from classes 9 to 12, is to encourage students to become ""job givers"" and not ""job seekers"".

Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia announced this during the first convocation of the Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women on Tuesday.

""After at least 15 years of formal education, if a large number of youth is not confident of creating something innovative that can give them gainful returns and add value to the economy, then as a society, we are failing to nurture their potential. So, we need to instil confidence among our children right from the beginning of secondary education so that after completing their education, they aspire to become job givers and not job seekers,"" he said.

Sisodia asked the secretary (higher education) to set up high level committee comprising senior faculty members from the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT), District Institute for Education and Training (DIET), school principals and experts. ""The SCERT will organise a conference in January and will invite organisations and individuals to present their ideas for the drawing up the entrepreneurship curriculum. Based on the inputs, the curriculum shall be rolled out from April 2019,"" he said.

This is Delhi government's first initiative to introduce ""skill based"" curriculum in schools. The curriculum will be based on a fourfold framework - inspire, educate, involve and facilitate. ""Through this curriculum, the effort would be to raise the aspirations of children and build a mindset for problem solving and decision making. Emphasis would be on personality development, communication and planning,"" the education minister said

""This trajectory is obsolete in today's day and age when new ideas and technologies are driving our way of life. If our schools and colleges continue to churn out batches of students who are going to join the queue of job seekers, we will soon be left with a small number of job givers.

Earlier this year, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government had introduced a ""happiness curriculum"" for students from nursery to Class 8. It comprises exercises such as storytelling, meditation and question-and-answer sessions."

As per the inquiry, the school head, education department officials and the doctors who examined the girl did not report the matter to the police. Copies of the letters are with TOI.

In November, TOI had reported that the commission has refrained itself from recommending action against the persons in question for delay in reporting the case as suggested in the Juvenile Justice Act and had left it to the concerned authorities to decide the punishment. Notably, this is the first time that the child rights commission has shown leniency in a serious case and not recommended FIR against every person from doctors to school heads and education department officials who did not report the matter to the police as per the Act suggests.

As per the information, this was done because the school authorities were found to be unaware about the law that applied in such a case.

In 2015, CCPCR had acted the other way and recommended FIR against the school management of a private Chandigarh school for delaying to report the molestation case of a pre-primary student. The conductor of the school bus had molested a kindergarten student in the bus. Recently, the Punjab and Haryana high court had directed a lower court to proceed against a the school principal who had failed to act even after knowing about the molestation.

The JJ Act states under Section 19 (1) that any person who has the apprehension that an offence is likely to be committed or has the knowledge that an offence has been committed, should bring the incident to the notice of the special juvenile police unit or the local police. The failure to report such an offence is punishable with imprisonment or fine or both.

Failing to report the commission of an offence under Section 19 (1) or failing to record such offence under section 19 (2) is punishable under Section 21

(2) which states that any person, being in-charge of any company or an institution (by whatever name called) who fails to report the commission of an offence in respect of a subordinate under his control, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year and with fine.

CCPCR chairperson Harjinder Kaur could not be reached for comment."

The Federal Commission on School Safety panel, led by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, was set up after the February massacre in Parkland, Florida, when a former student shot dead 17 people, sparking mass gun control protests.

The commission rejected calls to increase the minimum age required for gun purchases, arguing in its 180-page report that most school shooters obtain their weapons from family members or friends.

Instead, it suggested arming staff -- even teachers in some circumstances -- ""for the sake of effectively and immediately responding to violence."" School districts where police responses could be slower, such as rural districts, may benefit in particular, the commission said.

It also recommended education authorities hiring military veterans and former police officers who ""can also serve as highly effective educators."" The report pushes for a review of disciplinary guidelines introduced in 2014 under former president Barack Obama, which suggested alternatives to suspension and expulsion to tackle discrimination against black and Latino students.

The commission's report said the measure has had ""a strong negative impact on school discipline and safety."" The American Civil Liberties Union condemned that proposition.

""The Trump administration is exploiting tragedies to justify rolling back school children's civil rights protections, despite the lack of any evidence linking school discipline reform to school shootings,"" it said in a statement.

Democratic Representative Nancy Pelosi, who will be US House speaker when her party take over the chamber in January, criticized the report saying Trump and DeVos ""have reached a new low."" ""Their 'report' on school safety puts special interests and the NRA ahead of protecting America's school children. Students & parents have had #Enough,"" Pelosi wrote on Twitter.

""We worked hard to ensure this report addresses top school safety priorities. It's painful for us when you dismiss it without basis in fact,"" he added.

Over 219,000 US students have been involved in a school shooting since the April 1999 Columbine High School massacre, according to figures collated by the Washington Post.

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that the work of the honourees and that of other human rights defenders around the world is essential for the collective efforts to sustain peace and ensure inclusive sustainable development and respect for human rights for all. ""Often their work is dangerous. We regularly hear of abuses against human rights defenders -- murder, disappearances, torture, arbitrary imprisonment and other attempts to silence them. ""Yet, these courageous individuals and groups remain committed to shining a light on the dark corners of the globe, wherever human rights violations occur,"" he said in his remarks to the General Assembly's United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights award ceremony.

The event commemorated the 70th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, marked annually on December 10. Guterres said human rights defenders give voice to the voiceless and shield the powerless against injustice. ""They stand for all rights -- economic, civil, political, social and cultural. They support the rule of law or work peacefully to change laws so women and girls, indigenous communities, minorities and other marginalised groups may exercise their rights,"" he said. Guterres said they they work to empower people through education, and help to protect other human rights defenders from harassment, intimidation or arrest.

As part of the UN's activities in observance of Human Rights Day, which coincided with the Declaration's anniversary, the champions in the field from across the world, convened at the General Assembly Hall to be recognised for their outstanding contributions. Every five years, the United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights is awarded to organisations and individuals which embody excellent activism in defending human rights.

The four winners join a notable group who have been recognised since the Prize was established by the General Assembly in 1966, including prominent figures such as Eleanor Roosevelt, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, Jimmy Carter, Malala Yusafzai and this year's Nobel Peace Prize winners, Denis Mukwege and Nadia Murad, as well as organisations such as the Amnesty International and the International Committee of the Red Cross.

Marking the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Espinosa said it was one of the most important contributions that the world body has made to mankind, reflecting the collective aspirations of an international order founded on human dignity and with a view to making the world a better place. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said upholding all people's human rights is the only possible path to peace."

A safety panel set up by US President Donald Trump in the wake of numerous school shootings recommended Wednesday that schools consider arming staff, using veterans as guards and reversing Obama-era guidelines.

The Federal Commission on School Safety panel, led by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, was set up after the February massacre in Parkland, Florida, when a former student shot dead 17 people, sparking mass gun control protests.

The commission rejected calls to increase the minimum age required for gun purchases, arguing in its 180-page report that most school shooters obtain their weapons from family members or friends.

Instead it suggested arming staff -- even teachers in some circumstances -- ""for the sake of effectively and immediately responding to violence."" School districts where police responses could be slower, such as rural districts, may benefit in particular, the commission said.

It also recommended education authorities hiring military veterans and former police officers who ""can also serve as highly effective educators."" The report pushes for a review of disciplinary guidelines introduced in 2014 under former president Barack Obama, which suggested alternatives to suspension and explusion to tackle discrimination against black and Latino students.

The commission's report said the measure has had ""a strong negative impact on school discipline and safety."" The American Civil Liberties Union condemned that proposition.

""The Trump administration is exploiting tragedies to justify rolling back school children's civil rights protections, despite the lack of any evidence linking school discipline reform to school shootings,"" it said in a statement."

Soon after assuming office, Nath had signed the farm loan waiver file, fulfilling the grand old party's pre-poll promise. Now, with his announcement of offering investment benefits to those who offer 70 per cent jobs to locals, the veteran politician has his eyes set on wooing the youth.

The new chief minister's move, however, has not gone down well with the opposition parties, with the BJP and the JD(U) accusing him of fuelling 'divisive' politics. BJP general secretary Kailash Vijaywargiya accused Nath of pitting one region against another. Taking a dig at the chief minister, Vijaywargiya raised his ""outsider"" background and asked if his statement should be implemented in politics too.

JD(U) leader from Bihar Neeraj Kumar said people from the state claimed jobs on the basis of their talent and skills. He also asked Congress chief Rahul Gandhi and RJD's Tejashwi Yadav to clarify their stand on the statement.

The criticism notwithstanding, Nath has also announced establishment of four garment parks in the state and promised to boost support jobs. In its manifesto, the party had announced a slew of measures to the youth, including Rs 4,000 unemployment allowance per month.

In the 973-point Vachan Patra, Congress had promised several sops to the youth, including closure of Vyapam (MP Professional Examination Board), which was embroiled in admission and recruitment anomalies. Besides, for employment generation, the party had promised to offer Rs 10,000 per month or 25 per cent salary (whichever is less) to youth working with investment ventures up to Rs 50 crore till five years. The party had also announced establishment of a Youths' Commission.

""The announcement of 70 per cent jobs to local youth is a significant step in accordance with pre-poll commitments,"" head of Berozgar Sena Akshay Hunka told News18. ""The chief minister also ordered a probe as we met him over anomalies in Group 4 Assistant Grade 3 exam conducted by Vyapam in the month of July,"" he added.

As on December 31 last year, there were 23.90 lakh jobless youth listed with employment offices in MP but Hunka claimed that the number was around one crore. According to Berozgar Sena (BS), unemployment has gone up by 53 per cent in the last two years and suicides due to unemployment have surged 20 times between 2005 and 2015.

As against 57 lakh registrations at employment offices, barely 1 per cent have received jobs so far in the last 10 years and the 60,000 vacancies as advertised by the state government appeared only during the election year, according to BS estimates and the organisation deems that MP leads in terms of suicides related to joblessness.

BJP too had wooed the youth in its manifesto through free scooters to meritorious girls, Global Skill Parks, jobs in IT sector, free education to poor students till PhD, entrepreneurship and skill development and Karigar Universities among others.

The Samanya Pichhda Alpsankhyak Kalyan Samaj (SAPAKS) that entered into politics against quota issue also rode on the youth plank, promising free job applications, filling up of all the vacant posts in state government, establishment of student and youths' commission and others."

This year, researchers at Ohio State University tried to measure the impact that fake news had on the 2016 election. They based their analysis on a postelection survey in which they'd asked voters 281 questions, three of which were intended to determine their exposure to online disinformation.

Respondents were asked to rate the accuracy of statements claiming that Hillary Clinton was suffering from a serious illness, that she'd approved weapons sales to the Islamic State as secretary of state, and that Donald Trump had been endorsed by Pope Francis. ""Belief in these fake news stories is very strongly linked to defection from the Democratic ticket by 2012 Obama voters,"" wrote the researchers, Richard Gunther, Paul A. Beck and Erik C. Nisbet. Even after controlling for variables like ideology, education, party identification and dislike of Clinton, they found that believing a fake news story made people who voted for President Barack Obama in 2012 significantly less likely to vote for Clinton in 2016.

The study's authors don't claim a clear causal link between propaganda and voting; it's possible that people who rejected Clinton were more open to misinformation about her. It's hard to believe, however, that at least some of them weren't affected by a social media ecosystem saturated with deliberate lies.

Still, many people on both the left and the right have been skeptical of the notion that Russia's industrial-scale trolling campaign made a significant difference in Trump's election. In February, the special counsel Robert Mueller indicted 13 Russians connected to the Internet Research Agency, a Russian trolling operation based in St. Petersburg. Shortly afterward, National Review's Rich Lowry scoffed that the ""Russian contribution on social media was piddling and often laughable.""

That month, Adrian Chen, who reported on the Internet Research Agency for The New York Times Magazine, appeared to minimize its political impact in an interview on MSNBC. He called it ""essentially a social media marketing campaign with 90 people, a few million dollars behind it, run by people who have a bare grasp of the English language and not a full understanding of who they're targeting.""

At a conference in Germany in July, I met Denis Korotkov, a brave Russian journalist who has reported extensively on Yevgeny Prigozhin, the oligarch behind the troll factory, who was included in Mueller's February indictments. Speaking through an interpreter, he expressed incredulity at the idea that the misinformation being spread from St. Petersburg could have changed the direction of American history.

But it looks increasingly as though it did. On Monday, the Senate Intelligence Committee released two reports it commissioned about the nature and scale of Russia's social media disinformation campaign. One was produced by New Knowledge, a Texas cybersecurity company, along with researchers at Columbia University and Canfield Research; the other was written by researchers at Oxford University's Computational Propaganda Project along with Graphika, a company that analyzes social media. They were based on (incomplete) data turned over to Congress by several major social media platforms, and they suggest the campaign was more extensive and sophisticated than has been previously understood.

Russian propaganda, one of the reports found, had about 187 million engagements on Instagram, reaching at least 20 million users, and 76.5 million engagements on Facebook, reaching 126 million people. Approximately 1.4 million people, the report said, engaged with tweets associated with the Internet Research Agency. ""The organic Facebook posts reveal a nuanced and deep knowledge of American culture, media and influencers in each community the I.R.A. targeted,"" it said.

There is no way to quantify exactly what this barrage of disinformation and manipulation did to American politics. But it should be obvious that what happens online influences our perceptions of, and behavior in, the offline world. People have committed horrific acts of violence based on Facebook propaganda. The Islamic State has used Twitter to recruit alienated Westerners.

Looking at Israel's airstrikes on Gaza in 2012, Thomas Zeitzoff, an associate professor at American University, found that they'd significantly slow when there was a sharp uptick of online support for Hamas, an indication that the Israeli Defense Forces were monitoring their reputation on social media. So-called influencer marketing wouldn't be a billion-dollar industry if corporations didn't think social media shapes behavior.

In October 2016, Libby Chamberlain founded an invitation-only Facebook group called Pantsuit Nation as a safe space for supporters of Hillary Clinton. The fact that people felt like a such a space was necessary is testament to how intimidated a great many Clinton supporters were by the vicious climate online. ""As much as possible,"" Chamberlain told The Washington Post, her group ""removes the risk that they're going to be attacked for their views.""

Some of these attacks came from real people, but not all. In their book ""LikeWar: The Weaponization of Social Media"" -- which is where I learned about Zeitzoff's study -- P.W. Singer and Emerson T. Brooking described how, in the run-up to the election, ""anti-Clinton botnets actively sought out and 'colonized' pro-Clinton hashtags, flooding them with virulent political attacks."" These attacks helped make fervent Clinton supporters reluctant to go public online. That, in turn, created a widespread impression that Clinton lacked enthusiastic grass-roots support, which is belied by the fact that Pantsuit Nation quickly swelled to millions of members.

In an election decided by a rounding error -- fewer than 80,000 voters spread over three states -- Russian trolling easily could have made the difference. It's mortifying and preposterous that fake news ruined America. That doesn't mean it isn't true."

""People from states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh come here and local people don't get jobs. I have signed the file for this.""

Congress President Rahul Gandhi, who is a Lok Sabha MP from Uttar Pradesh, said on Tuesday he will discuss the matter with Nath. The party's state unit, however, defended Nath's comments saying that the chief minister was talking about providing employment to people in Madhya Pradesh and had stressed that the Bihar government should focus on it too, PTI reported.

Meanwhile, BJP's Purvnachal Morcha workers staged a protest outside Nath's Tughlaq Road house in New Delhi and defaced his nameplate, PTI reported. The BJP workers staged a protest and demanded an apology from Nath. ""The Constitution allows people of the country to go and settle in any part of the country and take up any livelihood means of their choice,"" said Delhi BJP's Poorvanchal Morcha President Manish Singh.

The Rashtriya Janata Dal, an ally of the Congress in Bihar, also described Nath's comments as avoidable. Bhai Virendra, Rashtriya Janata Dal MLA and spokesperson, said every citizen of the country is free to live and work anywhere.

Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the chief minister is not aware of existing rules that prioritise employment for the local people. ""What he is talking about is already in place... by making such a claim, he is misleading people,"" Tomar said, according to PTI.

BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya claimed Nath himself was an ""outsider"" and should not make such divisive statements. ""Kamal Nath was born in Kanpur. He received his education in [West] Bengal. His business is spread across the country. He is now chief minister of Madhya Pradesh,"" Vijayvargiya said. ""Such a statement does not behove him.""

Bihar BJP president Nityanand Rai demanded an apology from the Congress for the comments. ""It should apologise to the people of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, though this may be expecting too much from a party which is yet to express regret over the role of its Gujarat MLA Alpesh Thakore in attacks on Biharis in the western state,"" Rai said.

The Aam Aadmi Party accused the Madhya Pradesh chief minister of creating animosity against the people of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, PTI reported. ""The Congress and the BJP are two sides of the same coin when it comes to their attitude towards settlers from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in other states,"" said the party's spokesperson Dilip Pandey.

When the Indian startup ecosystem - then mostly limited to Bengaluru and Delhi-NCR - was witnessing a funding frenzy in 2015, Hyderabad was still recovering from the turmoil in the wake of Telangana's birth. Known for its IT legacy, over the years, macro-economic factors had hampered growth and 2015 was almost the year for a fresh start.

Three years on, the city has acquired a serious reputation as a growing startup hub. It's not just about the funding that Hyderabad-based startups have raised. The number of entrepreneurs choosing to start up in the city is growing, as are the number of partnerships among startups, academic institutions, corporates, and the government.

One strong indicator of growth is funding raised. According to YourStory Research, Indian startups raised $8.3 billion in funding in 2015. Startups from Hyderabad raised $43 million that year - just 0.52 percent of the total. Cut to 2018: Indian startups have raised $11.23 billion so far. Of this, Hyderabad-based startups accounted for $400.95 million - that's 3.5 percent of the total.

The sheer number of startups too shows strong growth. In 2015, the Nizam's city was home to around 1,500 startups. Today, that number has grown to 4,000, according to the Telangana State Innovation Cell (TSIC).

""Hyderabad has always had a strong entrepreneurial DNA. The IT legacy is testament to that. But in these three years, there has been growing awareness and push towards new-age technology startups. Each year, at the Centre of Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CIE), the kind of startups that come in are different. The entrepreneurs are maturing and growing,"" says Ramesh Loganathan, a professor at IIIT and a mentor and guide at CIE.

There is also a growing number of students looking to start up, he adds. According to the CIE, there are 18 student-driven startups at IIIT today, up from just eight in 2015. In all, CIE is currently incubating 78 startups versus 54 in 2015.

The push to increase startup activity in the city comes from government quarters as well - while different states have announced startup-friendly policies, for Telangana, the idea was more of a 'need to have' than 'nice to have'.

Jayesh Ranjan, IT Secretary, Telangana Government, says,

""Being one of the youngest and newest states in the country, our first agenda was to build an ecosystem of technology and innovation. Post bifurcation, Hyderabad needed to catch up, and that needed to be done fast. We felt the quickest way to do that was by encouraging startups. So, we began with a basic framework and policy, and ensured it was translated on ground.""

The state government's policy framework focused on physical infrastructure and programme management capabilities, which facilitated the setting up of T-Hub in a public-private-partnership involving active participation from three academic institutes - IIIT-H, Indian School of Business (ISB), and NALSAR.

In the first phase, 2016 saw T-Hub become operational. It is spread over 70,000 sq ft and currently houses over 200 startups. The policy document by the government states that in the second phase, the facility will be spread over 3 lakh sq ft and will house over 3,000 startups.

T-Hub offers a co-working space that gives startups a chance to forge partnerships with companies, investors, and mentors, among others. Gayam Motors, a electric vehicle (EV) startup, which was incubated out of CIE and T-Hub, was selected to be a part of the Summit Mercedes-Benz EQ Global Fellowship.

""One-third of Telangana is government land so it can be easily given to set up labs and central government institutes. What we need to push is an output and get in a stronger density of companies,"" says Phanindra Sama, Chief Innovation Officer, TSIC and Co-founder of redBus.

The CIE is now planning to set up an accelerator that will focus on health/medical technology startups.

""We realised there were growing number of healthtech and healthcare startups in the city. These needed special attention and focus; hence, we thought of developing an accelerator inside CIE itself. Many startups in the space could be a part of the incubator,"" says Ramesh.

In October this year, the government also announced the first phase of T-Works to focus on manufacturing and product startups. Sujai Karampuri, CEO, T-Works, says, ""The idea has been to create a platform and a framework where converting an idea into a product becomes easy for hobbyists, engineers, makers, engineers, entrepreneurs, etc.""

T-Works wants to lower the barriers-to-entry for prototypes and create an environment where failure to develop a product is not frowned upon.

Sujai says that as a nation we have embraced software-related solutions and businesses, but, the ""same is not the case when it comes to developing a product in the domain of mechanical, electromechanical and electronics"".

IT Secretary Ranjan says that with the legacy of IT and corporate tie-ups, stronger collaborations would be the way forward. ""There are currently 40 incubators in the city, but they need to collaborate to grow faster. Collaboration always helps and makes the city grow faster.

The five must-haves for a startup are idea, implementation, market, a team, and funds. To create a sustainable funding model for startups in the city, the government also set up the T-Fund last year. With an initial corpus of Rs 100 crore, it invited startups to apply so that it can fund them. The T-Fund is also planning to start a Rs 600-crore seed fund that will take contributions from private investors.

Government efforts are clearly in place, but what of the private sector and its faith in the Hyderabad startup ecosystem?

In 2018, in all, 32 startups raised $400.95 million. In 2015, this number was $43 million across 33 deals. The mix across stages also was healthy, with 2018 seeing 15 pre-Series A deals, two PE rounds, four Series A rounds, and one each in Series B, C and E. This is a big change from 2017, when no Hyderabad-based companies raised Series B, C, D or E rounds. And in 2015, while there were 22 Pre-series A rounds, there were few others in the growth stage.

Former cricketer Sachin Tendulkar's interest in startups by investing in city-based USPL and Smartron gave the city a big boost. Investors agree.

""Startups in Hyderabad are as good as startups in Bengaluru, Delhi, or Mumbai. We don't invest in startups on the basis of the city or the region they are based out of,"" says Vaibhav Agarwal, Partner, LightSpeed Ventures.

While there is increased interest in the ecosystem, there are few funds or investors with offices in Hyderabad. The one that stands out is Endiya Partners. The Hyderabad-based early-stage venture capital firm was started by Sateesh Andra, Dr Ramesh Byrapaneni, and Abhishek Srivastava. The two-year-old fund has approximately Rs 200 crore to invest, and focuses on SaaS, security, mobility, semiconductors, fintech, digital healthcare, and medical devices.

Of the eight companies in Endiya Partners' portfolio, two - Ekincare and Darwinbox - are based out of Hyderabad.

""We believe Hyderabad has a strong base of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship. There is a strong product and growth focus in startups here. Also, when it comes to investments, we are sure we will soon add more Hyderabad startups to our portfolio,"" says Sateesh.

A seed investor based in the city says, ""The founders are getting a little more mature, and the startups here are understanding the focus on product.""

What would put Hyderabad on the startup map in a bigger way, say mentors and founders, is having a big startup from the city. Anu Acharya, Founder of Mapmygenome, says startups from the city are more driven towards enterprise tech, software, and healthcare. The last is, in fact, one of the top sectors garnering investment. This year, healthcare has accounted for $130 million of the total funding raised by Hyderabad-based startups.

Also, ThinCI, which is registered in the US, but runs its operations from the city, raised Series C of $65 million this year, reinforcing its image as a favourite for SaaS startups.

""I am guessing this (focus on healthcare and SaaS) is driven more by the legacy of healthcare and IT in the city,"" says Rohit Chennammeni, Co-founder, Darwinbox, an HR-tech startup.

Endiya's Ramesh Byrapaneni, a cardiologist-turned-investor, says that while the existing healthcare ecosystem has enabled the growth and development of several healthtech startups, a complete ecosystem would help.

""We already have large pharmaceutical companies and hospital chains here. What is needed is an ecosystem of interaction. Currently, I feel many startups lack an understanding of ground realities. If they begin working with the hospital chains and pharma companies, they can build solutions for real-world problems. I see that happening now,"" he says.

Healthtech startups based in Hyderabad include StanPlus, Nephroplus, Call Health and Ekincare.

Mahesh Lingareddy, Chairman of consumer tech firm Smartron, says, ""When we talk of startups, there has been a push or focus towards B2C or more consumer internet companies. Now, we believe there is a need for real product innovation. Hence, I founded Smartron out of Hyderabad. When I came back (from the US), I knew I wanted to do something more than IT services, which was strong in Hyderabad. I wanted to put product innovation from India on the world map.""

To this, Sujai adds that over the last 10 years, Indians have been slowly gravitating towards building businesses around hardware, both mechanical and electronics. ""We have companies that make wearables, electric bikes, IoT gadgets, and medical devices right here in Hyderabad. With Industrial Revolution 4.0, creating products has become democratised. Indian startups are bound to take advantage of this trend and T-Works will become a great enabler,"" he says.

""There is a redBus mafia, a Flipkart mafia, a FreeCharge mafia - we need something like that here,"" says Phanindra. ""Each of the larger companies should give birth to 30 more companies; that will create a vibrant ecosystem. We need one big ingredient - a strong mix of a mentorship network of people who have built large companies and old traditional businesses. At TSIC, we are working to bring in that round of collaboration,"" he adds.

While ThinCI might have created waves for Hyderabad, it is still missing a big name like Flipkart or Paytm.

Ramesh says the number of applications from students to be a part of CIE has gone up as against those from people with experience. ""There is an increased number of students willing to experiment and try out. Three years back, we had to build more awareness and tell students that they could look at entrepreneurship as an option. Today, students themselves approach us. However, there can still be more number of students coming in,"" he adds.

Over the last three years, Hyderabad has been going all guns blazing - from policies and infrastructure, to funding, mentorship and even education. What remains to be seen is how it succeeds and how the Hyderabad startup ecosystem evolves in the days to come."

The fate of 70 mentally challenged students studying at the centre, some of whom are also physically disabled, hinges on how the Dr Zakir Hussain Memorial Welfare Society is able to make ends meet.

These students, aged between four and 18 years, belong to economically disadvantaged families whose meagre incomes come from pulling rickshaws, selling vegetables and fruits or working as domestic help.

The Dr Zakir Hussain Memorial Welfare Society has been managing its Child Guidance Centre (CGC) with the help of financial grants it receives under the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment's Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Rehabilitation Scheme. The crisis for the specialised school began when the ministry issued guidelines that from April 1, 2018, the salaries of the staff were to be increased two and a half times or more. This resulted in the annual expenditure on salaries going up from Rs 5.5 lakh to Rs 14 lakh.

""The yearly government funding on which CGC runs is retrospective, that is, the society has to meet all the expenses, including staff salaries, before it actually receives the grant from the social justice ministry,"" explained Baran Farooqi, general secretary of the society. ""This meant that when the ministry hiked the salaries of teachers employed on contract for the project, the society was forced to arrange almost double the amount it used to till 2017-18 in order to meet the incremental expenses.""

Perhaps even the additional finances could have been somehow managed. But discouragingly, the ministry has affected the working of the school by being erratic in the disbursal of grants. In fact CGC is still awaiting the second instalment of grants for 2015-16.

What also irks Farooqi is the whimsical manner in which the grants are disbursed. ""Reimbursements are either denied to us on arbitrary grounds or only a fraction of the stipulated amount is released,"" he pointed out. As an example, Farooqi reiterated the failure of the ministry to release the second instalment of grants for 2015-16.

The families of the students studying in CGC do not have the means to send them to any other school. Besides, here they can also get the specialised training required by their mentally challenged ward, such as IQ assessment, counselling, psychological assessment, physiotherapy and reading, writing and speech therapies. These and other measures could mean a world of difference in the way the children receive their education.

The society is more than 40 years old and runs several social service programmes other than this school. Jamia does assist it with space and other necessary infrastructural necessities, but CGC has to manage funds on its own."

Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav hit out at newly appointed Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath's remark that migrants from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar were taking away jobs of local people in MP.

Soon after taking the oath of office on Monday, Nath told newspersons in Bhopal that his government will give incentives to industries that offered 70% of their jobs to those from his state. He added that people from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh got employment in Madhya Pradesh at the cost of the native population.

In a tweet, Yogi Adityanath said the Congress's statement was unfortunate and showcased ""the Congress's divisive and regressive politics. Rahul Gandhi should apologise to the nation.""

Adityanath did not take Kamal Nath's name and mentioned Congress instead in the tweet.

Yogi had campaigned extensively in Madhya Pradesh for BJP.

Reacting to Kamal Nath's statement, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said, ""Before this similar voices from governments in Maharashtra and Delhi had come up. People from other states were coerced to leave those states. This is wrong.""

Criticising Nath, Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar said he appeared to be unaware of existing rules that prioritise jobs for the native population.

""He has also been a Union minister. He should be aware of these rules. What he is talking about is already in place... by making such a claim, he is misleading people,"" the BJP leader and Lok Sabha MP from Madhya Pradesh told reporters.

BJP general secretary Kailash Vijaywargiya agreed with his colleague and accused Nath of promoting ""divisive"" politics and pitting one region against another.

Taking a dig at the chief minister, Vijaywargiya raised his ""outsider"" background and asked if the statement he has made should be implemented in politics too.

""Kamal Nath was born in Kanpur. He received his education in (West) Bengal. His business is spread across the country. He is now chief minister of Madhya Pradesh. Such a statement does not behove him,"" the BJP leader, who is also from Madhya Pradesh, said.

Meanwhile, Congress legislature party leader, Ajay Kumar 'Lalu' said: ""His (Kamal Nath's statement has been misinterpreted"".

At the same time, Akhilesh welcomed the Kamal Nath government's announcement on farm loan waiver. ""They have announced loan waiver up to Rs 2 lakh but whenever Samajwadi Party will get the chance our government will give absolute farm loan waiver,"" he said.

Akhilesh Yadav had campaigned in MP for SP candidates and has also extended the support of his lone party MLA to the Congress in government formation."

Speaking as the chief guest, St Edmund's College principal, Sylvanus Lamare said, ""This day should be taken seriously and not merely for cleaning localities, there should be a state function not only in the state library but in every district of the state. Hope he gets a proper place that is befitting to his name, befitting to his writings and contribution. The Garo community should also know about the works of Soso Tham.""

Lamare said the writings of Tham should live on among us and termed him as a poet without boundaries and pointed to Ki Sngi barim U Hynniewtrep (the olden days of the seven huts) the works of which contain a lot of ideas of the Khasi society and their way of life.

At the programme, he recited verses from some of Tham's poems to highlight the relevance of his poems in people's lives and the present times which include a poem on the effect of climate change on agriculture.

""We live in an age of technology and information and an age of excessive information and Soso Tham rightly said about this,"" Lamare said.

As a line of inspiration he referred to Tham's stanza - Sa shisien pat kin win ki khlaw, sa shisien pat kin khih ki maw (Once more the forests will sound/Once more the rocks will move).

At the programme, there was prize distribution for painting, drawing and quiz competition conducted under the theme, Ki Saw Aiom (The four seasons). The drama on the same theme was also enacted.

Dedicate one chapter to prominent people: KSU

Meanwhile, the Khasi Students' Union (KSU) general secretary, Donald Thabah urged the education department to dedicate one chapter to prominent people from the indigenous community.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday after paying tribute to the Khasi bard, he said the government has given less attention to prominent people of the community. ""There should be one chapter dedicated to freedom fighters and other prominent people of the state,"" he said.

According to him, Khasi literature is very rich judging from the scholarly articles, journals, poetry and others and the Khasi subject was recognized by Kolkata University from 1902 and currently the language is used till Masters and PhD level.

""It is rich but it is not able to make its way to the Eighth schedule of the Indian Schedule and to make it here, there has to be a strong political will from the state government,"" Thabah said.

He said Tham can be regarded as a pioneer to mould and shape the Khasi literature and also a man with a vision.

Thabah maintained there is no grand tribute made to Tham even after 78 years of his death and declaring state holiday is not enough.

""There has to be activities, literary activities or any festival relating to Soso Tham, Kiang Nangbah, Tirot Sing, for children and young people to know,"" he added.

Meanwhile, Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama, Cherrapunjee (Sohra) gave a befitting tribute to renowned poet of Khasi Hills U Soso Tham at Iewthymmai ground, Sohra. 1100 children from 40 schools of the Ramakrishna Mission Asharma Sohra remembered him by performing Calisthenics, Thematic Martial Arts, Yoga for children and Khasi traditional dance styles."

A safety panel set up by US President Donald Trump in the wake of numerous school shootings recommended Tuesday that schools consider arming staff, using veterans as guards and reversing Obama-era guidelines.

The Federal Commission on School Safety panel, led by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, was set up after the February massacre in Parkland, Florida, when a former student shot dead 17 people, sparking mass gun control protests.

The commission rejected calls to increase the minimum age required for gun purchases, arguing in its 180-page report that most school shooters obtain their weapons from family members or friends.

Instead it suggested arming staff -- even teachers in some circumstances -- ""for the sake of effectively and immediately responding to violence.""

School districts where police responses could be slower, such as rural districts, may benefit in particular, the commission said.

It also recommended education authorities hiring military veterans and former police officers who ""can also serve as highly effective educators.""

The report pushes for a review of disciplinary guidelines introduced in 2014 under former president Barack Obama, which suggested alternatives to suspension and explusion to tackle discrimination against black and Latino students.

The commission's report said the measure has had ""a strong negative impact on school discipline and safety.""

The American Civil Liberties Union condemned that proposition.

""The Trump administration is exploiting tragedies to justify rolling back school children's civil rights protections, despite the lack of any evidence linking school discipline reform to school shootings,"" it said in a statement.

Over 219,000 US students have been involved in a school shooting since the April 1999 Columbine High School massacre, according to figures collated by the Washington Post.

Shocked by the incident, the school sent out a flurry of notices to parents warning of strict action if students below the age of 13 (Class VI onwards) are found having their own social media accounts. The notice includes an advisory on how to monitor social media activities of students.

A senior cyber crime officer probing the case said police have sought legal help to understand whether using an open device without the explicit consent of its minor owner can be construed legally as hacking and secondly if it's a cognizable offence if some of the accused are under-age.

However, this is not the first incident where students have used social media to make fun of teachers or post rude comments full of slangs. In fact, as TOI found out, it is quite common among students of city schools to create online communities and pages to disparage teachers and, in some cases, they have openly named their schools.

In a similar incident at another top boys' school, a group of students hacked into a social media account of a student to post offensive comments on certain issues and teachers forcing the school to call in the cyber crimes cops, who identified the culprits.

Schools begin to track students' cyber footprints

The school stopped short of expelling the boys but dealt with them severely. Now the school has set up a secret group of tech-savvy teachers who keep an eye on students' cyber activities.

Rude online activities are not restricted to boys alone. ""We had a girl mentioning an intimate incident involving the school on Facebook. She posted rude comments without mentioning the name of the school, but it was clear which school. We called the parents and took her to task. We are keeping strict vigil,"" said the principal of a leading central Kolkata girls' school.

Concerned by the rise in such online behaviour, city schools are taking steps to keep an eye on their students' cyber footprints.

""We have a vigilance group that is keeping an eye on the social media activity of senior boys. We are holding regular parent-teachers meetings to get the former oriented about the kind of trouble their wards might get into,"" said T H Ireland, principal, St James' School.

Agrees Aruna Gomes, principal of Loreto House. ""We keep ourselves pre-warned and our value education classes are full of advisories,"" she said.

Teachers feel it all starts with the idea of having fun but soon gets out of control. ""Accepting this, we are trying to tell our boys that such negative activity is not fun but a crime. Criticising teachers is an ageold thing but taking it to the level of social publishing is something one never dreamt of. We are organising workshops where we are getting cyber experts to talk to boys,"" said said Mukta Nain, principal, Birla High School for Boys.

Shane Calvert, secretary, La Martiniere schools, advised students to make judicious use of social media.

""Stop, think and connect is what I am asking students to do. They should stop to think every time they get the urge to play pranks on social media. Judicious use of the internet can take them places whereas irresponsible use can bring a lot of harm,"" he said."

Addressing students at the first convocation of Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women, Mr. Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio, said: ""There is an emphasis on studying hard to get a good job but we need to recognise and celebrate those students who have given up job offers to start their own enterprises that will offer salary packages to employees.""

Mr. Sisodia said that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government is introducing an entrepreneurship curriculum for students between class 9-12 in all Delhi government schools. The curriculum will teach students skills on how to be job creators.

""We need to instil confidence in our children, right from the beginning of secondary education, that after completing their education, they should aspire to be job givers and not job seekers,"" said Mr. Sisodia.

If after 15 years of formal education, the youth are not confident of creating something innovative, which can give them gainful return and add value to the economy, then as a society we are failing to nurture their full potential, said Mr. Sisodia.

While the Opposition BJP in MP has accused Mr Nath of promoting regionalism for electoral gains, allies in the Mahagathbandhan in Bihar have demanded a clarification from the Congress on the issue.

Soon after assuming office on Monday, Mr Nath had said, ""Many industries have come up in MP, in which people from other states such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have been given employment, depriving youth of MP from getting jobs. Only industries which absorb 70 per cent of their manpower from MP will be eligible for the incentives proposed for them by the state government"".

He, however, clarified that he was not against migrants getting jobs in the state.

The Congress had, in its election manifesto, promised to provide incentive of salary grants for five years to industries which generate employment in the state.

A day after RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav attended Mr Nath's oath ceremony in Bhopal, the party's spokesman criticised the chief minister's statement. RJD spokesperson in Patna, Bhai Virendra, said, ""People are free to live and work anywhere in the country. Political leaders should avoid such kind of statements"".

Mr Yadav and former Bihar chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi had previously criticised the BJP for targeting migrants from North India in Gujarat and Maharashtra.

BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijavargiya accused Mr Nath of promoting regionalism for electoral gains by speaking against migrants from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.

""Mr Nath was born in Uttar Pradesh, had education in West Bengal and became chief minister of Madhya Pradesh. Should we call him a migrant?"" he wondered aloud and advised the chief minister not to vitiate the peaceful atmosphere of the state.

Congress spokesman in Bhopal, however, defended Mr Nath saying that as chief minister he was justified in working for the interest of unemployed youth of the state.

The Patna unit of the Congress also defended Mr Nath, saying that the statement was given in a different context.

""The Madhya Pradesh chief minister never said anything against migrants from Bihar and UP. He was talking about providing employment to youth of his own state. The situation which has been created in states like Gujarat and Maharashtra is not going to happen in any of the states where Congress Party is in power,"" senior Congress leader Prem Chand Mishra told this newspaper."

(loan waiver) figure can go up'","The Indian Express",FALSE,"Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel speaks on the modalities of the loan waiver he signed on his first day in office, Naxalism, and what the Congress intends to do to overturn a 10-1 deficit in the state in the Lok Sabha elections.

A day after being sworn in as Chhattisgarh Chief Minister, Bhupesh Baghel speaks to Dipankar Ghose on the modalities of the loan waiver he signed on his first day in office, Naxalism, and what the Congress intends to do to overturn a 10-1 deficit in the state in the Lok Sabha elections. Excerpts:

Your first decision was to waive farm loans from cooperative and rural banks. What about loans taken from other commercial banks?

The cooperative banks and rural banks, those who had taken agricultural short-term loans -- we have waived these in a straightforward manner. We will have to study loans taken from commercial banks. Many farmers will have taken crop loans. There will be other loans as well, although those too are linked to agriculture. We will have to study those, and it will take a little time. I have told the chief secretary to get information on this from all districts and banks. Right now, we have waived loans worth Rs 6,100 crore. That figure can go up.

Have you thought of a ceiling for this waiver, especially in commercial banks where the loans can be large?

Advertising

In cooperative banks, we have not divided it into any category. Because there is a limit on the loan per acre that a person can get. But in commercial banks, the limits are very high for loans. Right now, there is no information... Only after we get that information, can we take any decision.

A farmer doesn't always take loans from a bank. He may take a loan from a local moneylender, and get caught in a debt trap.

The way forward is that loans have been waived right now. Those who take loans privately, there is very little paper work. On that subject, we had made no declarations. Farmers who have taken loans from banks, it was that loan waiver which had been talked about. Those who get trapped by moneylenders, I think that we need to make farmers prosperous and stable. We have a motto: Chhattisgarh ke chaar chinhaari: narwa, gurwa, gharwa, baari, yeh bachaana hai (We need to protect Chhattisgarh's four identities: rivulets, livestock, manure and farming). This is not just a slogan. In this is the economic and social structure of Chhattisgarh, its life... We have to work towards this and we will do it. If we do this, Chhattisgarh's economy will be sound, people will get work, and farmers will become prosperous.

There was a perception that the Congress leadership in the state wasn't completely united. How do you plan to take everyone along?

We have been working together for a long time. I worked as PCC chief for five years and there were no problems anywhere. Yes, perhaps a little bit in ticket distribution... There is push and pull there, but the elections are over now. There are no disagreements. Now we have to run the government... We will run the government with collective leadership.

Naxalism is a problem in the state. You have said you want to speak for people caught in the conflict.

The Naxal issue is not just a law and order problem... It is a social, political and economic problem as well. The rights people should have got have been snatched away from them. That is why they entered (Naxalism) and why it spread. We have to make the people right-rich. We have to talk to them. Those who are affected live in the jungles, whether they are Adivasis or non-Adivasis. They are the victims. What do they think? Nobody talks about that. We talk about Maoists, we talk to police forces. But nobody asks about the real victim. Not the government, political parties or journalists. We have to reach them, ask them what they think, and what are the solutions. They will give the best solution. Then, we can hold a dialogue with whosoever required, and solve the problem.

You said media is the fourth pillar of democracy. Both journalists and human rights activists have alleged discrimination in the state, fake cases etc. Will you talk to activists as well?

In the subjects that they talk about, what are the points they are raising, what is the truth, understand them, solve the problem... It is not as if they are our enemies. They are not opponents. They want betterment of people. We also want betterment of people. So what is the problem in talking to them? It is not necessary, and not possible, to agree on each subject. But if their motive is to help people, my motive is also to help people, then where is the problem?

You have said you will stop ""outsourcing of jobs"".

Where there are big posts and high qualifications, we need those kind of people as well. Those who can run the administration. But there are education workers, patwaris, nurses. We have our youth for these. What is the need to outsource these? It is their right and they should get it. If there is any need to amend the law for this, then we will do it.

How do you see the transition from Opposition leader to Chief Minister?

The fire in you at that time was because you were fighting for the rights of people. It was used to strengthen the organisation of the Congress. Through that fight for the people, whether women, farmers, youth, Adivasis, labourers, that fire was in that direction. Now this fire is towards development. The issues that we were fighting for, those solutions we now have to implement. Gear change ho gaya (The gear has changed).

The Lok Sabha elections will be held in a few months. The Congress holds one of 11 seats from the state.

The first thing that we promised to the biggest section of people, that is farmers, is loan waiver. When we say farmers, they are Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, OBCs and upper class as well. There is no section in Chhattisgarh where there is no farmer. The promise we made to them, we fulfilled yesterday itself. Today, I have signed the order. We have gained the people's faith. Because it (2019) is a national election, there will be national issues as well. So Narendra Modi will have to talk about Rafale and what he has done for five years.

The BJP is raising the Ram Mandir issue.

Chhattisgarh has rejected it. BJP members themselves reduced the stature of Narendra Modi. Earlier, there used to a huge place for him in their posters, that has now become smaller. Here, there was Raman Singh... Yogi Adityanath roamed around a great deal. Not just in Chhattisgarh but in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. He too was rejected. After that, they have no issues. Jab jab chunaav aata hai, unhe Ram ki yaad aati hai. Ram ke naam pe sarkaar bana lete hai, Ram ki mandir nahi bana paate (They remember Ram during poll time. They make a government in the name of Ram, but are not able to make Ram Mandir).

The state has seen conflict because of mining, with tribal land being taken away, laws not being followed.

Advertising

Laws have been created for all of this. Everybody is needed for the development of the nation. You have to save the environment and run mines as well. If someone's land is taken, there is the Land Acquisition Act. But those laws are not followed. If you give appropriate compensation, then why will there be protests. Apply the rehabilitation policy... If we rehabilitate them properly, there will be no protest."

One of the loudest cries often heard in the political gatherings across the country is that youth should play more prominent role in the politics. But the fact is that despite the entry of young energetic leader like Jamyang Tsering Namgyal (JTN) in the politics, people find it hard to accept a person like him from humble background on the highest post of decision making. The similar case in consideration/deliberation here is the present Chief Executive Councilor (CEC), LAHDC Leh.

Ever since the death of Dr. Sonam Dawa Lonpo, the former CEC, political stage of Leh have been marked by high drama. This high drama has something exciting in store for all of us who are concerned with the changing political landscape of Ladakh.

After the untimely demise of Dr. Sonam Dawa, Jamyang Tsering Namgyal has emerged as one of the prospective CEC candidate but he then decided not to pursue the same and chose to support veteran leader Dorjay Motup for the post instead. Subsequently Dorjay Motup was unanimously elected as the CEC, Leh. Another turn in the event took place with the resignation of Dorjay Motup from CEC post, citing health grounds.Again debate on the prospective candidate for the post was started. Point of discussion among the general public was, who can fill the vacuum created by the resignation of Dorjay Motup? Finally in a move that surprised many, the 33-year-old councilor from Martho, JTN was unanimously elected as new CEC. Though circumstances leading to elevation of the young leader to this highest post in the Council began with the demise of Late Dr. Sonam Dawa, credit goes to the young leader himself as he was quick to capitalize on this.

The youngest ever CEC for Ladakh region, JTN followed the footstep of his mentor Sh. Thupstan Chhewang, the former MP Ladakh. But a doubtful turn took place in the political drama as latter resigned just after former's taking oath as the new CEC, Leh. MP Ladakh resigned alleging the Centre for failing to deliver on the electoral promise made during the 2014 general election. Now the question arises, why he suddenly chose to resign as MP Leh that too just after the young leader taking oath as the CEC, Leh. Was it too difficult for him to accept a leader as the new CEC Leh that he chose to resign as MP Ladakh?

Within this high political drama, we have to understand that the larger debate is on aristocrats v/s democrats. The real implementation of democracy requires egalitarianism, openness and an inclusive social mindset. Democracy without these traits becomes an aristocracy where specific privileged class emerges as system runner and commoners become only fuel to run such system.

What makes young leader's elevation to the CEC post interesting is the fact that unlike other leaders of Ladakh he is coming from a humble family and does not boast of any hereditary title like LONPO. But it is unfortunate that the post of CEC has never been undermined so much as it does these days. There has been a joke doing the round in social media, which says it is easier to be CEC than to be the Principal of Lamdon School. This is a serious issue and shouldn't be brushed aside as mere joke. Deep down it raises questions like- who is suitable for the post of CEC? Why do people find JTN unsuitable for the CEC? Is it merely because he is coming from a humble family background? Is it because JTN does not belong to a Lonpo family unlike our revered former MP Ladakh? Because the argument of education qualification for the same does not hold well ground as he is more qualified than the present Prime Minister of India.

If a youth leader from a humble background has claimed the seat of CEC he is neither being opportunist nor endangering the future of BJP in Leh as many have blamed him. Rather he is reassuring thousands of poor people, who are not born with silver spoon, that if they work hard and do not bury their aspirations they can also claim the highest seat of power. His success as the CEC Leh would promote the feeling that anyone can participate as top decision maker in the democratic setup and that family background does not matter. From working for student welfare as student leader at Jammu, to the corridors of power first at Delhi then in Ladakh, he has travelled a long way to reach the coveted post of the CEC, LAHDC, Leh.

The second eldest son of the family, JTN, a graduate from M.A.M College Jammu, had entry into politics as a BJP party worker in Jammu in 2012. Within few years, he has been assigned with the duty of managing election campaign for Thupstan Chhewang, who was running for MP seat from Ladakh on a BJP ticket. He was also the main speaker during the election. It was a time when BJP party in Ladakh was almost non-existent and there were slim chances for him to secure victory. But thanks to the hard work of JTN who toured every nook and corner of Ladakh campaigning for Thupstan Chhewang that the latter won MP seat from Ladakh by smallest margin of 30 votes. This victory took him to the streets of parliament, where he has worked as the Private Secretary to MP Ladakh for 3 years. Things however took a turn for good when he decided to contest LAHDC, Leh election and resigned from the PA to MP. He was given party ticket to contest the election of LAHDC Leh from Martselang constituency and he won by a record margin of 825 votes.His nearest rival in the election then was Tsering Angdus, who was running for third term in the office and was one of the most influential persons in Leh.Even at that time many were discrediting him and were saying that BJP is going to lose this seat but he proved them wrong and marked the politics of Ladakh by registering the record victory in the said election. It was also under his presidency that for the first time a BJP councilor from Lungnak, Zanskar, also made entry into the LAHDC, Kargil.

Hailing from the Martho village in Leh district, he is coming from a family of Aam Admi unlike most of other leaders in Leh who were born with silver spoon. His father served as carpenter in Military Engineering Service and his mother is a housewife. Unlike him most of other leaders in the Ladakh region have an aristocratic background, means they had their ancestors in the royal court who were either serving as Lonpo or were enjoying royal patronage. This gave them unparalleled advantage over others in getting elected to various posts. These democratic aristocrats are distinguished from the traditional aristocrats in one key respect that is their dependence on electoral politics for the endorsement of privilege. Rise of a young leader to the highest post of decision making breaks many stereotypes, foremost among them is the belief that to be successful in the politics you have to be either from an aristocratic family or a rich family. More than breaking long held stereotype, young leader offers a renewed sense of vitality and excitement to Ladakh region, which is facing regional discrimination from Kashmiri centric politician. At the same time the emergence of youthful figures in positions of power gives hope to youth of Ladakh who might have seen politics as no-go zone. Besides dealing with strong opposition leaders, the youngest CEC Leh also faces high expectations of the public.

It still remains to be seen how far the policies of the young leader actually represent a departure from the past. We might reasonably be skeptical about the capacity of one so young, rising against the overwhelming tide of barriers; and it is not enough for the young leader to believe him but society must also believe in him.

Despite his young age, JTN already has significant political experience and we can't discredit his capability of lobbying for the divisional status for Ladakh in the power corridors of Jammu.

He has also been able to prove his leadership qualities by seccefully assuming the mantle leadership for the slogan of ' 'Free Ladakh from Kashmir' and has already been able to lead this fight better than any other CEC from Ladakh in past.

Within a one month in the office he has already started his campaign of freeing Ladakh from Kashmir and the biggest strides towards securing this vision is his demand for divisional status for Ladakh. And it is to youngest CEC's credit that Governor is already contemplating on granting Divisional status for Ladakh.

JTN becoming youngest CECis a landmark political development of 2018, but only the time can tell about his durability as it too early to write off him and his political career.

Despite all these, the attempt to break the old glass ceiling for the entry into the political class, which until now, was forbidden for a poor, is a perfect beginning of an egalitarian democratic space for all.

JTN's rise and this Generational shift in the political class is nevertheless a tale well begun.

A day after Kamal Nath took over as Madhya Pradesh chief minister, the police informed the state government on Tuesday that the Centre's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) has seized 11 hard disks related to the e-tendering scam.

Alongside, a probe was ordered by the state government into allegations of irregularities in the conduct of a clerks' recruitment examination by the Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board, called Vyapam, and a CBI court in Indore convicted an accused in the 2009 Vyapam scam in medical admissions.

V Madhukumar, director of the economic offences wing (EOW), confirmed that a CERT team had seized hard disks from the Madhya Pradesh State Electronic Development Corporation (MPSEDC) in the Rs 3,000 crore scam, which the Congress had made an issue in the recently concluded assembly elections.

The EOW had asked the CERT to assist it with investigations as the state agency did not have the technical expertise to decode the data on the hard disk.

The scam relates to the alleged hacking of the e-procurement portal hosted by the MPSEDC to see e-tenders before bids are opened and to lower the bids to favour certain companies. At present, the EOW is investigating nine e-tenders of three departments, all of which have been cancelled.

Those familiar with the investigation said the CERT visited the MPSEDC office in the first week of this month and scanned records over three days. ""We have informed the state government about the latest development today [Tuesday],"" a senior government official, who was not willing to be named, said.

The CERT is expected to sift through the data on the hard disks to find out the specific computer, its IP address and the time/place when the changes in tenders were made and submit a report within a month. Once the report is handed in, the EOW, which has been investigating the case over the last six months, will register an FIR, officials familiar with the matter said.

The e-tendering scam was an election issue for the Congress and the then leader of the Opposition, Ajay Singh, had claimed it was bigger than the Vyapam scam. The Congress had dema- nded that all the e-tenders floated by MPSEDC since its inception in 2013 should be examined.

An inquiry was ordered into an alleged 'toppers' scam in a clerks' recruitment exam conducted by Vyapam where six candidates who had been under-performing in every other test suddenly emerged as toppers.

Principal secretary, technical education, Ashok Varnawal, will inquire into the allegations. The order came after a group of candidates, along with Congress MLA Kunal Chaudhary, met Nath.

Akshay Hunka, convener of the Berozgar Sena, an organisation of unemployed youth, claimed the scam took place in the Group 4 (assistant grade III) recruitment exam conducted to fill 2,700 clerical posts in different departments. The exam was conducted in July and the results were announced on December 12.

""The six candidates who were unable to score even 50 per cent in two other recruitment exams suddenly scored 95 per cent and became toppers. Such improvement might be possible in one case, but six cases raise suspicion,"" Hunka said.

A CBI special court in Indore sentenced a Vyapam accused to five years' rigorous imprisonment on Tuesday. According to CBI advocate Ranjan Sharma, a resident of Morena, Manoj Jatav cleared the Pre-Medical Test, 2009, with the help of impersonators."

He also described Kashmere Gate as an ""incubation centre"" for universities, saying it is a coincidence that several varsities, which were based in the area, are now moving to bigger campuses.

""We had launched the 'happiness curriculum' in government schools. Now we will launch the entrepreneurship curriculum from the next session onwards for secondary and senior secondary students.

""We need to instill confidence among our children in school right from the beginning of secondary education that after completing their education, they should aspire to be job givers and not job seekers,"" Sisodia said.

He explained that after at least 15 years of formal education, if a large number of the youth are not confident of creating something new, which can give them gainful return and add value to the economy, then as a society ""we are failing to nurture their full potential"".

Sisodia said, barring a few exceptions, once a child completes elementary schooling and joins the secondary classes, his entire orientation, which is largely shaped by the teachers and parents, is to secure good marks in exams, get admission in a good college and get a job with decent pay package.

This is considered a trajectory of success and anyone who either secures less marks or fails to join college or fails to secure a job is deemed as unsuccessful, he said.

""This trajectory is obsolete in today's day and age when new ideas and technologies are driving our way of life. If our schools and colleges continue to churn out batches of students who are going to join the queue with the mindset of job seekers we will soon be left with very small number of job givers,"" Sisodia said.

He said the entrepreneurship curriculum will be for students of classes 9 to 12 with the vision that every child should have the confidence of being creator rather than just being a consumer.

""The curriculum shall be based on a four-fold framework-- inspire through stories and case studies of entrepreneurial journeys, educate through self designed micro research, involve through local community and facilitate by supporting in developing ideas into projects,"" said Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio.

To take this idea forward, he has directed the secretary education to set up a high-powered working group having senior faculties from SCERT/DIET, school principals and individuals having domain expertise as members.

""SCERT Delhi will organise a conference in January where it will invite organisations and individuals to present their ideas for the design of the entrepreneurship curriculum as per the framework of the government to a working group.

""Based on the inputs received, the pilot curriculum shall be rolled out from April 2019 onwards,"" Sisodia said.

He said they will try and ensure they take it to private schools as well.

In the convocation, as many as 1,161 students, comprising 504 undergraduates, 656 post graduates and one doctorate, were awarded degrees.

Thirty-eight chancellor gold medal, vice-chancellor gold medal and exemplary performance silver plaque were given to students across the years at the event.

Baijal congratulated the students and also suggested that entrepreneurs should be supported by the government when they start out.

'Metro man' E Sreedharan was the chief guest at the event. He said the future of the country lies in the hands of engineers and technocrats and not politicians.

Annoyed by the statement, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said, ""This is wrong. Often you get to hear the same from Maharashtra. Why have North Indians come here? Why have they taken up jobs here? Similar statements can be heard from Delhi & now from MP as well. What if the North Indians decide who'll form government at the Centre?""

It is important to note that SP, along with BSP, had supported Congress in forming the government in Madhya Pradesh after the Grand Old Party stood two short of simple majority in the assembly elections. Congress won 114 seats in the 230-seat assembly, with BJP close behind with 109 seats.

Criticising Nath, Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar said he appeared to be unaware of existing rules that prioritise jobs for the native population.

""He has also been a Union minister. He should be aware of these rules. What he is talking about is already in place... by making such a claim, he is misleading people,"" the BJP leader and Lok Sabha MP from Madhya Pradesh told reporters.

With the help of latest mobile technology, these excited children were trained to study their textbooks, helping them overcome their physical challenge in a way they did not think was possible before this. Each of them got a phone which had preloaded accessible textbooks, and they were taught to study these textbooks using latest mobile applications.

This innovation in CSR was made possible in one of its kind initiatives by mjunction services limited, India's largest B2B e-commerce company, in collaboration with the Chhattisgarh government. mjunction first procured the smartphones and then uploaded all Chhattisgarh government school textbooks for the intended age group into these smartphones. The third and last phase happened recently in Raipur when these 50 students were not only given these smartphones but also trained extensively on how to study their textbooks from these phones.

The programme gains greater importance in view of the limited availability of textbooks in Braille, where students had to share the books.

The reactions from the excited students were spontaneous and heartfelt, and sometimes exceeded expectations from the programme. Dinu Patel of class 8, said, ""What I could read on Braille in three days, I can now do in one day. I can also carry my books anywhere I go now as they are all on my mobile phone.""

Aarzoo Banu of class 9 said, ""My hands used to ache earlier while taking down class notes on Braille. Now with the recording facility on the phone, I can record my class notes and listen to them later with the 'talk back' facility.""

Yadeshwar Kumar Sahoo of class 9 said, ""This is especially useful when English spellings get complicated and it becomes difficult on Braille. I want to thank everyone associated with this as it really makes life easy for me.""

The students were handed certificates and felicitated at the end of the training programme at an event attended by top mjunction officials associated with the programme, Mr Gaurav Dwivedi, Secretary of School Education, Chhattisgarh Government and Mr Vinit Nandanwar, IAS, Mission Director, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. Dr Homiyar Mobedji, Disability Expert, Program Management Benetech India, conducted the training process.

Welcoming the initiative, Mr Vinaya Varma, CEO of mjunction said, ""We are glad to collaborate with the Chhattisgarh government on this. This programme is a part of mjunction's social responsibility activities, and will be run as a pilot project. In the next phase, this will be extended to more students of Chhattisgarh government schools.""

Mr Dwivedi said, ""I am happy to partner with mjunction on this. The children were extremely enthusiastic about using new devices and trying new technology solutions to overcome their disability."" Mr Nandanwar said, ""The initiative was a success and I hope to work with mjunction once again in the near future for the benefit of an even greater number of students.""

Mr Nandanwar said ""The initiative of mjunction and Sarva Sikhsha team was really fruitful and we hope to work together in future and benefit more students.""

mjunction has been working in the field of digital literacy for the underprivileged for the last 11 years and has taken the pledge of 'Transforming 30K' lives in the next two years. With this project, it forays into the field of providing education via mobile literacy, and is just the beginning of more such initiatives which will touch lives positively, Mr Varma added."

Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath's remark that people of the state were losing jobs to migrants from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar has created an uproar, with many politicians slamming the Congress veteran for the ""divisive"" statement.

Akhilesh Yadav, whose Samajwadi Party has lent support to the Congress in Madhya Pradesh, lashed out at Nath, who himself belongs to UP, saying that North Indians might decide which party would form the government at the Centre.

After assuming office in Madhya Pradesh on Monday, Nath had said workers from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh coming to the state for jobs had cut down employment opportunities for local youths, adding that his government would provide incentives to only those industries that give 70 per cent of their jobs to natives of the state.

Annoyed by the statement, Yadav said, ""This is wrong. Often you get to hear the same from Maharashtra. Why have North Indians come here? Why have they taken up jobs here? Similar statements can be heard from Delhi & now from MP as well. What if the North Indians decide who'll form government at the Centre?""

It is pertinent to mention here that SP, along with BSP, had supported Congress in forming the government in Madhya Pradesh after the Grand Old Party stood two short of simple majority in the assembly elections. Congress won 114 seats in the 230-seat assembly, with BJP close behind with 109 seats.

Earlier in the day, BJP leaders too slammed the CM and termed his comment ""divisive"". Criticising Nath, Union Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said he appeared to be unaware of existing rules that prioritise jobs for the native population.

""He has also been a Union minister. He should be aware of these rules. What he is talking about is already in place... by making such a claim, he is misleading people,"" the BJP leader and Lok Sabha MP from Madhya Pradesh said.

BJP General Secretary Kailash Vijaywargiya reiterated the statement given by his colleague and accused Nath of promoting ""divisive"" politics and pitting one region against another. Vijaywargiya raised Nath's ""outsider"" background and asked if his statement should be implemented in politics too.

""Kamal Nath was born in Kanpur. He received his education in (West) Bengal. His business is spread across the country. He is now chief minister of Madhya Pradesh. Such a statement does not behove him,"" the BJP leader, who is also from Madhya Pradesh, said.

BJP leader Giriraj Singh and former Union minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy, an MP from Bihar, also condemned Nath's statement and said people from UP and Bihar had been contributing significantly in the development of Madhya Pradesh with their hard work."

Mr. Nath's statement also met with disapproval from the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), an ally of the Congress in Bihar, which said such remarks should be avoided. However, Bihar Congress working president Kaukab Qadri said Mr. Nath was not spreading hatred against migrants was on giving incentives to employment-generating industries in the state he will be governing.

Tripura government has imposed a set of restrictions on the creation of new government jobs and advised abolition of vacant posts, in case new posts are created.

A memorandum issued by the Finance Department on Monday stated that Tripura already has the highest level of government employment in the country, in proportion to its population.

Tripura has roughly 200,000 government employees, including 60,000 pensioners. The estimated population of the state is 4,000,000.

""The need for this provision arises due to the fact that salaries and wages constitute the largest item of expenditure and it is absolutely necessary to exercise financial prudence and discipline while committing expenditure under these heads.

""Hence, whenever a department submits a proposal for post creation, it should be accompanied by a proposal for surrender/abolition of posts with equivalent financial implications, the memorandum signed by Chief Secretary L K Gupta, who also holds the Finance portfolio, said.

Restrictions were imposed on filling up of vacant posts saying all government departments must ensure that no process of filling up vacant posts is initiated without prior concurrence of the Finance Department and violation of the newly laid out plans would invite disciplinary action against concerned officers, it said.

""Some departments have a wrong notion that the Finance Department has unlimited funds for salaries and wages and that it is their entitlement to fill up all the vacant posts and create new ones. This is not the case,"" the memo said.

The Department of School Education has violated these instructions and was asked to explain their action.

Earlier this year, the department announced recruitment in over 14,000 teaching positions to fill up vacancies, that were to be created by the retirement of 10,323 school teachers, who were terminated by the Supreme Court in 2017.

As per the new rules, the Finance Department would monitor expenditure on salary and wages by each department on a monthly basis and impose cuts from non-salary budget for departments which exceed their approved funds.

The Congress on Monday gave notices of breach of privilege in both Houses of Parliament, demanding an explanation from the Centre on why it provided the Supreme Court ""wrong"" information on the Rafale deal. Likewise, three members of the ruling party -- Anurag Thakur, Nishikant Dubey and Sanjay Jaiswal -- in the Lok Sabha too moved a notice of breach of privilege against the Congress president, alleging that he spoke ""falsehood"" and ""misled the House"" over the fighter aircraft deal in his speech during a debate in July.

The Lok Sabha was adjourned thrice since it met in the morning, before being adjourned for the day, as the treasury and the opposition benches sparred over the Rafale jet deal issue with both sides raising slogans against each other.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said it was unfortunate that the Opposition members were not allowing the Lok Sabha to function. The BJP workers and leaders also held protests in several parts of the country against the Congress party over the Rafale issue.

Parliament set for a stormy session on sixth straight day

Despite the first five days being a near washout, the commotion over Rafale row is unlikely to die down on the sixth day of Winter Session as Opposition and the government continue to spar over the issue outside Parliament. Reports say that Congress party is planning to hold 50 pressers in the coming days, while BJP ministers and leaders fanned out across the country Monday to allege Congress of spreading ""falsehood"" with an ""amazing audacity"" over the Rafale issue.

On Monday, the opposition party gave privilege notices against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government -- only to be countered with a notice against Rahul Gandhi by the ruling party MPs.

Parliament LIVE updates: Speaking outside the Parliament after the Lok Sabha was adjourned for the day, Congress chief Rahul Gandhi took on the Narendra Modi government, saying the prime minister sat on farmers' loans for four years and didn't waive a single rupee. He asserted that this was injustice for the farmers. The Congress president highlighted that the party had already waived the loans of farmers in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, two of the three states where the Congress came to power after the Assembly elections. Rahul demanded an answer from Modi on why he had not waived farmers' loans yet, when he could work for the benefit of big corporates.

The Lok Sabha session had resumed at noon amid shots of ""chowkidaar chor hai'. The ruckus continued even as Speaker Sumitra Mahajan tried to get the session underway. Mahajan appealed to MPs to allow the session to proceed, saying Parliament was a place for discussion. As her appeals fell on deaf ears, she adjourned the Lok Sabha for the day.

""The government is ready to discuss anything you want, but this is not the way. It is not giving a good message. We have to face the public. I'm requesting you again and again. Whatever discussions you want will be done as per the rules,"" she said. ""People abroad also ask what is happening in India?... We must show some responsibility. I'll request the government myself to hold a discussion. We must maintain a standard in Parliament.""

Earlier, the House was adjourned within minutes of convening amid slogans of ""Rahul Gandhi maafi mango"" and ""Rahul Gandhi chor hai"" shouted by BJP members. Congress MPs also countered with shouts of ""Modi sarkar chor hai"", when Speaker Sumitra Mahajan adjourned the House till 12 pm. Rajya Sabha was also adjourned till 2 pm amid ruckus over the Rafale deal.

BJP MPs Sanjay Jaiswal, Anurag Thakur and Nishikant Dubey have moved a privilege motion in the Lok Sabha against Congress president Rahul Gandhi on the Rafale controversy, seeking action against Rahul over his speech during the debate on the no-confidence motion against the Narendra Modi government in Parliament's Monsoon Session. Congress MP KC Venugopal, too, has moved a privilege motion against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, alleging that the government submitted misrepresented facts on the Rafale deal to the Supreme Court.

Meanwhile, the All India Trinamool Congress party has given a notice under Rule 267 in Rajya Sabha to take up discussion on the rising unemployment and lack of job opportunities, another thorny issue that the Opposition parties use to corner the government.

The Rafale row was expected to rock Parliament on the sixth straight day of the Winter Session even as the first week was a wash out over the controversy. The Congress party will move an Adjournment Motion for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) investigation into the deal.

Moreover, Left parties will seek a reply from the government on the questions raised against the Supreme Court verdict on the Rafale deal last Friday. The Congress and BJP, meanwhile, are locked in a battle of privilege motions, with the Congress giving a notice against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and the BJP responding with its own notice against Rahul Gandhi.

Monday, too, saw a stormy session in Parliament as the Lower House was adjourned for three times over Opposition protests relating to the Rafale issue. The Congress on Monday gave notices of breach of privilege in both Houses of Parliament, demanding an explanation from the Centre on why it provided the Supreme Court ""wrong"" information on the Rafale deal. Likewise, three members of the ruling party -- Anurag Thakur, Nishikant Dubey and Sanjay Jaiswal -- in the Lok Sabha too moved a notice of breach of privilege against the Congress president, alleging that he spoke ""falsehood"" and ""misled the House"" over the fighter aircraft deal in his speech during a debate in July.

The Lok Sabha was adjourned thrice since it met in the morning, before being adjourned for the day, as the treasury and the opposition benches sparred over the Rafale jet deal issue with both sides raising slogans against each other.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said it was unfortunate that the Opposition members were not allowing the Lok Sabha to function. The BJP workers and leaders also held protests in several parts of the country against the Congress party over the Rafale issue.

Other businesses listed for the day include a discussion on the increased frequency of natural calamities in coastal India and the Centre's preparedness in dealing with it. P Venugopal will raise a discussion on the natural calamities in various parts of the country, particularly in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Odisha, with special reference to cyclones Gaja, Titli, etc.

In legislative business, Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan is set to move the Consumer Protection Bill, 2018, in Lok Sabha to establish authorities for timely and effective administration and settlement of consumers' disputes. Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad is likely to move for passage The New Delhi International Arbitration Centre Bill, 2018.

Parliament set for a stormy session on sixth straight day

Despite the first five days being a near washout, the commotion over Rafale row is unlikely to die down on the sixth day of Winter Session as Opposition and the government continue to spar over the issue outside Parliament. Reports say that Congress party is planning to hold 50 pressers in the coming days, while BJP ministers and leaders fanned out across the country Monday to allege Congress of spreading ""falsehood"" with an ""amazing audacity"" over the Rafale issue.

On Monday, the opposition party gave privilege notices against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government -- only to be countered with a notice against Rahul Gandhi by the ruling party MPs.

Parliament LIVE updates: The Lok Sabha session resumed at noon amid shots of ""chowkidaar chor hai'. The ruckus continued even as Speaker Sumitra Mahajan tried to get the session underway. Earlier, the House was adjourned within minutes of convening amid slogans of ""Rahul Gandhi maafi mango"" and ""Rahul Gandhi chor hai"" shouted by BJP members. Congress MPs also countered with shouts of ""Modi sarkar chor hai"", when Speaker Sumitra Mahajan adjourned the House till 12 pm. Rajya Sabha was also adjourned till 2 pm amid ruckus over the Rafale deal.

BJP MPs Sanjay Jaiswal, Anurag Thakur and Nishikant Dubey have moved a privilege motion in the Lok Sabha against Congress president Rahul Gandhi on the Rafale controversy, seeking action against Rahul over his speech during the debate on the no-confidence motion against the Narendra Modi government in Parliament's Monsoon Session. Congress MP KC Venugopal, too, has moved a privilege motion against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, alleging that the government submitted misrepresented facts on the Rafale deal to the Supreme Court.

Meanwhile, the All India Trinamool Congress party has given a notice under Rule 267 in Rajya Sabha to take up discussion on the rising unemployment and lack of job opportunities, another thorny issue that the Opposition parties use to corner the government.

The Rafale row was expected to rock Parliament on the sixth straight day of the Winter Session even as the first week was a wash out over the controversy. The Congress party will move an Adjournment Motion for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) investigation into the deal.

Moreover, Left parties will seek a reply from the government on the questions raised against the Supreme Court verdict on the Rafale deal last Friday. The Congress and BJP, meanwhile, are locked in a battle of privilege motions, with the Congress giving a notice against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and the BJP responding with its own notice against Rahul Gandhi.

Monday, too, saw a stormy session in Parliament as the Lower House was adjourned for three times over Opposition protests relating to the Rafale issue. The Congress on Monday gave notices of breach of privilege in both Houses of Parliament, demanding an explanation from the Centre on why it provided the Supreme Court ""wrong"" information on the Rafale deal. Likewise, three members of the ruling party -- Anurag Thakur, Nishikant Dubey and Sanjay Jaiswal -- in the Lok Sabha too moved a notice of breach of privilege against the Congress president, alleging that he spoke ""falsehood"" and ""misled the House"" over the fighter aircraft deal in his speech during a debate in July.

The Lok Sabha was adjourned thrice since it met in the morning, before being adjourned for the day, as the treasury and the opposition benches sparred over the Rafale jet deal issue with both sides raising slogans against each other.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said it was unfortunate that the Opposition members were not allowing the Lok Sabha to function. The BJP workers and leaders also held protests in several parts of the country against the Congress party over the Rafale issue.

Other businesses listed for the day include a discussion on the increased frequency of natural calamities in coastal India and the Centre's preparedness in dealing with it. P Venugopal will raise a discussion on the natural calamities in various parts of the country, particularly in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Odisha, with special reference to cyclones Gaja, Titli, etc.

In legislative business, Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan is set to move the Consumer Protection Bill, 2018, in Lok Sabha to establish authorities for timely and effective administration and settlement of consumers' disputes. Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad is likely to move for passage The New Delhi International Arbitration Centre Bill, 2018.

Parliament LIVE updates: BJP MPs Sanjay Jaiswal, Anurag Thakur and Nishikant Dubey have moved a privilege motion in the Lok Sabha against Congress president Rahul Gandhi on the Rafale controversy, seeking action against Rahul over his speech during the debate on the no-confidence motion against the Narendra Modi government in Parliament's Monsoon Session. Congress MP KC Venugopal, too, has moved a privilege motion against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, alleging that the government submitted misrepresented facts on the Rafale deal to the Supreme Court.

Meanwhile, the All India Trinamool Congress party has given a notice under Rule 267 in Rajya Sabha to take up discussion on the rising unemployment and lack of job opportunities, another thorny issue that the Opposition parties use to corner the government.

The Rafale row was expected to rock Parliament on the sixth straight day of the Winter Session even as the first week was a wash out over the controversy. The Congress party will move an Adjournment Motion for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) investigation into the deal.

Moreover, Left parties will seek a reply from the government on the questions raised against the Supreme Court verdict on the Rafale deal last Friday. The Congress and BJP, meanwhile, are locked in a battle of privilege motions, with the Congress giving a notice against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and the BJP responding with its own notice against Rahul Gandhi.

Monday, too, saw a stormy session in Parliament as the Lower House was adjourned for three times over Opposition protests relating to the Rafale issue. The Congress on Monday gave notices of breach of privilege in both Houses of Parliament, demanding an explanation from the Centre on why it provided the Supreme Court ""wrong"" information on the Rafale deal. Likewise, three members of the ruling party -- Anurag Thakur, Nishikant Dubey and Sanjay Jaiswal -- in the Lok Sabha too moved a notice of breach of privilege against the Congress president, alleging that he spoke ""falsehood"" and ""misled the House"" over the fighter aircraft deal in his speech during a debate in July.

The Lok Sabha was adjourned thrice since it met in the morning, before being adjourned for the day, as the treasury and the opposition benches sparred over the Rafale jet deal issue with both sides raising slogans against each other.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said it was unfortunate that the Opposition members were not allowing the Lok Sabha to function. The BJP workers and leaders also held protests in several parts of the country against the Congress party over the Rafale issue.

Other businesses listed for the day include a discussion on the increased frequency of natural calamities in coastal India and the Centre's preparedness in dealing with it. P Venugopal will raise a discussion on the natural calamities in various parts of the country, particularly in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Odisha, with special reference to cyclones Gaja, Titli, etc.

In legislative business, Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan is set to move the Consumer Protection Bill, 2018, in Lok Sabha to establish authorities for timely and effective administration and settlement of consumers' disputes. Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad is likely to move for passage The New Delhi International Arbitration Centre Bill, 2018. Suresh Prabhu will introduce The National Institute of Design (Amendment) Bill, 2018 to amend the National Institute of Design Act, 2014.

""According to a study by ICRIER (a research firm), USD 100 billion investment will have seven-fold multiplier effect on GDP. There is a need of a national mission to make this happen. We are going to launch broadband readiness index for states which will be vital for investments.""Aruna Sundararajan, Telecom Secretary

She said the Ministry of Electronics and IT have also shown interest in states readiness index and want to expand it further.

The telecom ministry will hold first workshop on implementation of the National Digital Communications Policy (NDCP) which envisages USD 100 billion investment in telecom sector by 2022, broadband connectivity at 50 megabit per second speed to every citizen, telecom connectivity at every corner of India and creating 40 lakh jobs.

""This is first preparatory national workshop on implementation of NDCP in which 25 states have confirmed to participate. Here we will launch National Broadband Mission to achieve objective of broadband for all.""

Industry leaders and associations will discuss at the NDCP workshop issues they are facing in states especially in rolling out telecom infrastructure which in turn impact investments.

""We want to ensure that 5G is not limited to urban areas. It should reach rural areas. For this, we have to work with states to ensure that there is 100 percent penetration of optical fibre cables. Without massive OFC penetration, 5G services will not expand. States have to provide smooth right of way permissions,"" Sundararajan said.

5G networks are said to provide broadband speed of upto 1 Gbps. Theoretically, a high definition 2-hour video can be downloaded in 5 seconds at this speed.

The telecom secretary said there is a need to increase mobile tower base by three times and OFC rollout by four-folds to achieve 'broadband for all' target under the National Broadband Mission.

""We have to roll out wifi services in rural and urban areas. To deliver benefit of NDCP to people and create jobs, states have to come forward. We will do comparative evaluation of all states and highlight best policies for other states to adopt it.""

The telecom ministry has floated tender to roll out 10 lakh wifi hotspot across all 2.5 lakh village panchayats.

At present, 1.21 lakh panchayats are ready with broadband services infrastructure. The DoT has awarded task to roll out wifi services in 62,0000 panchayats to Telecommunications Consultants India Limited (TCIL) and is working with ITI for setting up wifi hotpsots in other panchayats.

""Broadband services have been started in all panchayats covered under Phase 1. Now we are looking at utilisation of broadband where states need to come forward and identify institutions like school, police stations etc that are to be connected with wifi.""

She said states have to ensure that there is enough electronic equipment available at their institutions to start using BharatNet broadband network for various services like tele-medicine, E-health, E-education etc.

""DoT is working to create state-of-the-art telecom infrastructure in next four years and we want states to draw a road map to start using it. At the workshop, we will work on yearly targets that states need to achieve.""

She said the telecom ministry will discuss with states usage of broadband for development at aspirational districts, enhancing connectivity in Naxal-affected areas, north eastern states and islands.

Acting against certain government and aided polytechnic colleges for ""not following norms"", the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has directed them to slash their student intake by 25-50 per cent. Some of these institutions have also been put in the 'no admission' category.

While the Technical Education Directorate could not confirm the exact number of seats reduced by the AICTE, an approximate figure would be 8,000 seats out of total 36,000 polytechnic seats in 141 government and 19 aided polytechnics for 2019-20.

The AICTE's orders state that certain polytechnics did not follow the rules on issues like deficiency of teachers, unavailability of proper laboratories and libraries, display boards and insufficient administrative area.

State Technical Education Director R C Rajput said they have challenged the AICTE decision as it will affect the aspirants, adding that they will also be discussing the issue at their December 26 meeting, and take remedial steps.

""The AICTE has reduced the number of seats keeping in mind some deficiencies in polytechnic institutions. We have appealed against it...,"" he added.

He further said, ""We all know we are not able to fulfill AICTE norms. There is a severe problem of staff unavailability...AICTE is unable to employ the students so this is a chance for them to increase the employment percentage. With number of students reduced, there will be an increase in the employment percentage. But they should understand that UP has a huge population and not everyone is going to get a government job. If students get technical education, at least they will gain confidence to start something on their own.""

Technical Education secretary Bhuvnesh Kumar said there are several issues regarding appointment of teachers. ""The recruitment process is done through the UP Public Service Commission. There was an agitation by teachers in the past that their appointment should be done as per AICTE norms. The government accepted this demand. But the service rules were the old ones. Now the service rules have to be amended according to AICTE norms. That process takes roughly 6-8 months. Service rules have been re-drafted and will now be examined by the personnel department. It will later go to the finance department and then Cabinet. The amendment will be final only after it is approved by the Cabinet,"" he added."

Owners of plots in various sectors of Gurugram have been asking for this for more than a year now.

On Monday, members of All Haryana Residents Welfare Association met HSVP chief Chandrashekhar Khare and demanded the constitution of the committee for recalculation of enhancement charges. HSVP officials later confirmed that according to notification, the committee would hold discussions with the resident welfare associations (RWAs), allottees and petitioners at the zonal level under the chairmanship of the zonal administrator befor recalculating the enhancement charges.

The committee will include the estate officer and the district town planner of the urban estate concerned as well as the land acquisition officer of the zone concerned. According to the notification, the committee will draft fresh proposals and send it to the headquarters for approval. Apart from this, a copy will also be sent to a chartered accountant (CA) for auditing. Once approved, the revised enhancement charges will be conveyed to the plot owners so that they can make payments accordingly.

The government has directed the immediate recalculation of enchantment charges and so the process would be started at the earliest, said Tejinder Singh, the secretary of the association. On December 14, the chief minister had made the announcement in this regard, which came as a relief for All Haryana Sector Enhancement Sangharsh Samiti, an association of people who have been allotted HSVP plots and flats. The members of the samiti had been asked to pay more for their real-estate properties after compensation to be paid to those whose land was acquired for housing pro'jects had been increased.

Samiti president Kapil Vats said the move would help cut down the enhancement amount by 60-65%, thus bringing huge relief for plot owners. Due to heavy enhancement charges, residents of more than 46 sectors and their families are being affected, according to Vats. ""We are middle-class and working families and have a lot of liabilities including home, education and business loans. The heavy enhancement charges, along with 15% interest, would prove disastrous for all residents of all sectors,"" he added.

On November 1, the state government had launched a rebate scheme for settling of enhancement dues. However, the rebate was lesser as compared to the rebate offered in the scheme of May 2018. At that time, the state government had offered a rebate of 40% and HSVP had collected Rs 850 crore against total dues of Rs 1,400 crore."

The move comes a day after the sixth anniversary of the 'Nirbhaya' gang rape case.

The lieutenant governor issued a number of directions as he chaired a meeting of the 'Task Force on Women Safety'.

""The LG directed Social Welfare department to make arrangements for auditing all the children homes as well as shelter homes run by third party under their jurisdiction to ensure safety and security of the inmates to avoid any untoward incidents,"" the LG's office said in the statement.

Trai has made a preliminary set of recommendations for 5G, which is under examination of the ministry, she said. But since the ecosystem is not ready, it (spectrum auction) will be only after July-August next year. ""The minister has given a timeline of 2020 for 5G rollout and it (5G rollout) will start at that time. But it doesn't mean the whole country will have 5G at one go,"" she said on the sidelines of a seminar on national digital communications policy (NDCP) vision of the telecom department. Sundararajan said 5G technology field trials have begun.

The task force referred by the secretary is the 5G steering committee, chaired by Stanford University's professor emeritus AJ Paulraj. The panel has made several recommendations to drive 5G adoptions in areas like spectrum policy, regulatory policy, standards and education to DoT.

Earlier, the telecom regulatory authority of India (Trai) had recommended auction of 8,644 MHz at an estimated base price of Rs 4.9 trillion, which included radio waves for 5G services.

The telecom ministry's panel on 5G has said 6,000 Mhz spectrum can be made available without delay for the next generation mobile service. Vodafone Idea, a key telecom player, said on Sunday that it has urged DoT to delay auction to as the 5G ecosystem is not ready and 4G optimisation will happen by then.

The July-August timeline is significant for telcos preparedness for the auction in view of the huge debt that the industry is reeling under. They blame it on pressure on their revenue and profitability due to heightened competition in the sector.

In August, Trai recommended auction of airwaves across seven 4G bands, besides 5G spectrum. The regulator slashed the base price of premium 700 MHz band by 43 per cent to Rs 6,568 crore a unit and also set Rs 492 crore per unit as the minimum rate for 5G.

Sundararajan also asked states to ensure full utilisation of the BharatNet infrastructure. ""But for few, most states have not been able to use them (the BharatNet Infra), so we are now bringing private players and some PSUs for WiFi services. After WiFi, utilisation will be ensured,"" she said.

The ministry will also sign MoUs with states to use the BharatNet connectivity and connect various development institutions. ""We are asking states if they want dark fibre, they can take it from BharatNet Infrastructure and market it. We will go for revenue-sharing with states to incentivise them. This idea is to create not just a supply push but also a demand pull for this infrastructure to raise its (BharatNet) utilization,"" she said.

The secretary asked states to rationalise levies for rights-of-way permission to telcos for laying fibres and setting up towers. ""If you levy 40-50 times the charges, how will the infrastructure be built,"" the secretary asked.

""We are preparing the country for 5G through aggressive fiberisation. To meet the need for large number of towers, as envisaged under the 5G roadmap, then we have to bring states on boards as the power to grant rights of ways for setting up towers are with states,"" she said. Sundararajan also said the government planned to raise optic fibre cable spread from 1.8 million km to 5.5 million km by 2022. On WiFi, she said, ""Our effort is to do as much as possible by March 2019 and Wi-Fi should be available in six months,"" Sundararajan said. She was responding to questions on BharatNet deadline, which is around the corner.

The event, also attended by states, was part of the government push to speed up BharatNet programme expansion that aims to connect 250,000 gram panchayats. It also aims to achieve $100 billion of investment, create 4 million jobs and with $120 billion of additional revenue contribute $670 billion to GDP, she said. The Centre also aims to soon launch national broadband mission with association with states.

In a bid to evolve a plan of action on preventing child marriages in Tamil Nadu, the Indian Council for Child Welfare, in collaboration with UNICEF Chennai and the Department of Social Welfare, has come out with an evidence-based report identifying the determinants of the age-old practice in the State.

A study has shown that nearly 75 % of 1,156 child marriages, which were stopped by the government in 2017, were arranged by parents. In the arranged marriages, 52 % of the parents had not asked the consent of the child. A total of 1,636 child marriages had been stopped, of which data from 1,156 marriages had been analysed.

""Any plan of action that we take towards preventing child marriages should be based on data we have available, which is why we sought to look at the determinants. There is a whole range of emotional factors involved as well and a comprehensive plan of action needs to take everything into consideration,"" explained Girija Kumarababu, honorary general secretary, ICCW-TN.

The determinants for arranged child marriages indicated that nearly 33 % of the cases, the marriage was fixed owing to economic problems of the child's family. This was followed by reasons such as the girl child would have a love affair, safety issues and sickness of family members.

V. Amudhavalli, Commissioner, Social Welfare department, pointed out that the factors tend to vary across districts in the State. ""At the same time, wherever the government mechanisms such as ChildLine have been effectively publicised, more number of cases get reported in those districts. We need all the stakeholders, including the department as well as NGOs, to come together and work towards its prevention,"" she said.

While nearly 46 % of the child marriages were found to have been stopped after engagement, 29 % on the day of the marriage.

Several cases reported in Tamil Nadu, especially through calls on the ChildLine 1098, were by friends of the girl who was about to get married.

While delayed reporting is a major challenge, the report indicated that field workers did not have vehicles to travel far and often faced threats from village leaders or other people.

""Education plays an important part in addressing the gaps and since there are schools in remote areas, all the children should be sensitised about 1098 and reporting any cases that they hear of. There is also a need for guidelines about what to do if the actual ceremony has been completed and our focus should be child-centric,"" said Andal Damodaran, President of ICCW-TN."

The demand has come in the wake of an ongoing enquiry against a Professor of MKU based on the complaint by a research scholar working under him.

Citing University Grants Commission (Prevention, prohibition, and redressal of sexual harassment of women employees and students in higher education institutions) Regulations of 2015, the organisations pointed out that the ICC must include three democratically elected student representatives.

""However, all the three student representatives in the committee now are nominated by the administration,"" said S.K. Ponnuthai, State secretary, AlDWA.

Similarly, the organisations said that the three student representatives must respectively be from undergraduate, postgraduate and research programmes. ""Since MKU does not offer undergraduate courses on its campus, postgraduate students and research scholars can be included. But all the three are research scholars,"" she added.

The organisations have also demanded the suspension of K. Karnamaharajan, Professor and Head of Centre for Film and Electronic Media Studies in MKU, who is facing the harassment charges.

The research scholar had accused him of emotionally abusing her and demanding her do everything he suggested, including sexual favours, if she wanted to obtain her Ph. D degree.

""There appears to be prima facie evidence in her complaint. To ensure a fair enquiry, the Professor must be kept under suspension till the enquiry is over,"" she said.

Mr. Karnamaharajan, however, denied the allegations by stating that he had only questioned the scholar on her absenteeism and insincerity.

Meanwhile, Madurai Kamaraj University Superior and Inferior Welfare Association, an association of senior and junior level non-teaching staff belonging to oppressed communities, issued a statement in support of the Professor.

Terming the allegations as baseless, the association accused the scholar of levelling false allegations since the Professor sought an explanation from her for regularly being absent and manipulating attendance records.

""Some vested interests in the university that are targeting Mr. Karnamaharajan for the past few years are behind the complaint since he is a first generation graduate from a Scheduled Caste community, who secured his appointment in MKU in open competition,"" M. Parthasarathi, secretary, said."

This visit was very crucial for us since the award of the commission can have a bearing on the finances of the new state. Mr CS Rao, former finance secretary, Government of India, was appointed as advisor in the finance department exclusively to deal with the Finance Commission. He had a long experience in the finance department and is well respected. In fact some of the members of the Finance Commission like Ms. Sushma Nath worked with him when he was the finance secretary at the Centre. The fact that the chairman of the 14th Finance Commission, Dr Y Venugopal Reddy, was from Andhra Pradesh made things easier since he had first-hand knowledge of the division of the state and its problems. Tirupati was indicated as the place to meet the Finance Commission by the Chief Minister and accordingly arrangements were made. We made a forceful presentation for giving us a fair dispensation by the Finance Commission and they were also very reasonable and considerate. When the final award came, Andhra Pradesh was the only state other than the North-eastern states to get revenue deficit grants for all the five years of the 14th Finance Commission's award. They gave an award for Rs 21,113 crores as revenue deficit grants for the five-year period.

We as officers were very happy that we could successfully get a good deal for Andhra Pradesh from the Finance Commission. But the Chief Minister was not happy. He held a series of meetings and telephone conferences on this issue with officers, MPs and started crying, stating that nothing had come for the capital and what has been given is only a pittance. In one meeting Mr CS Rao, who by then lost his patience had to remind the Chief Minister that the Finance Commission goes by its terms of reference, and the issues Sri Naidu was raising do not come within the terms of reference of the commission. He said the award was generous with reference to the state of Andhra Pradesh.

The matter did not end there. In the legislative Assembly, the Revenue Minister started making a personal attack against Dr Y Venugopal Reddy. Mr CS Rao rang me up and said that Dr Venugopal Reddy was pained by these comments and requested me to bring it to the notice of the Chief Minister. Accordingly I informed the CM that Dr Venugopal Reddy was feeling bad that he should be targeted when he did his best for the state. The Chief Minister told me to convey to Dr Reddy that he holds him in high regard and he would be talking to him personally. The same was conveyed to Mr CS Rao with a request to convey it to Dr Venugopal Reddy as it was he who rang me up and informed about this. Subsequently when I enquired with Sri CS Rao whether there was any such call from the CM to Dr Venugopal Reddy, he checked with him and told me there was no such call. In our use and throw policy both Dr Venugopal Reddy and Sri CS Rao had no relevance once the 14th Finance Commission gave its award. Sri CS Rao also left the post after some time as there was no work for him before completing his tenure.

The award of the 14th Finance Commission takes care of AP's revenue deficit from 2015 to 2020. That still left the revenue deficit gap for the 10-month period from June 2014 to March 2015. The statement of the Prime Minister on the floor of Parliament covered this issue. He said the resource gap that may arise in the successor state of Andhra Pradesh in the very first year especially during the period between the appointed day and the award of finance commission would be compensated in the Union budget for 2014-15. Even before the division of the state, the Governor made a calculation of what could be this deficit and sent his report to the Union government indicating Rs 16,000 crores as the possible revenue deficit. Contrary to the assessment made by the Governor, the revenues were very buoyant and expenditure under control, and by December 2014 we knew the deficit will not cross Rs 3,000 to 4,000 crores. By January the Chief Minister started concentrating on this and was particular that higher revenue deficit be built up. He was very confident that with his political connections he would be able to get any amount from the Union government. I am sure his expectations were based on his experience when he was earlier part of NDA-1 when he used to have his way through. So, a huge expenditure was incurred in the last few months of the financial year to build up a higher revenue deficit. Certain industrial incentives which were not being sanctioned for years together were discovered and released, and industrialists who never expected it were too happy to oblige. Expenditure on the electoral promises like loan waiver, and higher amounts for pensions were all booked under this account. Accordingly a revenue deficit of Rs 16,078 crores was incurred for the year 2014-15 and the same was certified by the CAG. Stating that these are CAG-certified figures, the state government made a plea to the Centre to reimburse Rs 16,078 crores. The central Government took the view that like the 14th Finance commission they would only fill the normal revenue gap which is the result of the division of the state, but not amounts incurred on fulfilling electoral promises made by the new government. Their argument was that if they sanction the expenditure incurred on the electoral promises they will get similar demands from other states as well. The state government's argument that the figures were certified by the CAG did not cut any ice with the Union government as they clearly said only eligible portion out of the amount certified by the CAG would be reimbursed and accordingly the deficit was determined as Rs 4,117 crores. I felt the argument of Government of India was very valid. However the state government kept on repeatedly raising this issue with no success. The Centre was willing to consider 2015-16 revenue deficit grant, as sanctioned by the 14th Finance Commission which was coming to about Rs 6,609 crore and were willing to give that amount proportionately for the 10 month period for which the state government was not agreeable. Finally the central government has gone on record through an affidavit before Supreme Court in a case filed by an individual stating that the amount that is due on this account is only Rs 4,117 crores which is the normal deficit incurred by the state government. Right from the beginning, the state government's stand on this issue was not correct and by stretching it too far they lost the possibility of getting more by making a reference to the 14th Finance commission revenue deficit grant for 2015-16.

Section 93 of the act enjoins on the Central government to take all necessary measures as enumerated in the 13th Schedule for the progress and sustainable development of the Successor State within a period of 10 years from the appointed day. Accordingly a set of institutions are listed out in the 13th schedule. They are broadly divided into two categories: educational and infrastructure. While with reference to the institutions listed under the education category, it is specifically mentioned in the act that they ""shall be"" established, no such firm commitment is mentioned in the infrastructure category excepting with reference to one or two organisations. The mandate was only to examine the feasibility of setting up such industries and organisations.

Our first focus was on establishment of the education institutions with reference to which there was a firm commitment in the act. We were keen they should start functioning from 2015-16 academic year. We had a series of meetings with the Secretary, Higher Education, Government of India who was reluctant to start them until the total infrastructure was ready and wanted us to wait for three to four years before the infrastructure actually materialises. We were able to put enormous pressure on GOI politically to ensure that they start operating from 2015-16. Wherever the government was able to allot the land and make temporary buildings available for locating the institutions they started functioning from 2015 and others got delayed where we were not able to provide land immediately or there was a dispute about the location of the institution. One such institution that got delayed was NIT which finally got located at Tadepalligudem. The Endowments Minister wanted it to be located at TP Gudem while another lobby close to the power centre wanted it to be located at Eluru. Finally the minister prevailed. So also was the problem with Petroleum University since the state government was not able to decide whether to locate it in East Godavari or in Vizag. Most of the institutions started functioning from temporary accommodation in a record time before my retirement. Two institutions to establish which legislation was required, got delayed. It is a sad commentary on the manner in which the state government can behave when now they accuse the Central government of running these institutions in temporary accommodation when the fact is that we put pressure on them and got those institutions functioning when they were reluctant to start them until full infrastructure is available.

Regarding the infrastructure projects mentioned in the 13th Schedule, activity started in terms of examining the feasibility. The focus immediately was on Vizag - Chennai industrial corridor and Metro Rail for Vijayawada and Vizag. Regarding Vizag - Chennai industrial corridor, since funding was coming from Asian Development Bank, we had a series of meetings with them and the nodes were finalised. Since I dealt with Hyderabad Metro earlier as finance secretary and was associated with Sri Sridharan of Delhi Metro at that time, I revived my contact with him and brought him to meet the Chief Minister. By the time I retired, Vijayawada Metro project was progressing well and in fact preparations for land acquisition were being done. Subsequently both metros seem to have been stuck at some stage. Regarding the other infrastructure projects, feasibility studies were going on by the time I retired.

The ""special category status"" was on the agenda immediately after I took over as the Chief Secretary. I made a visit to Delhi and sought an appointment with Mr Subrahmanyam in the PMO who is from Jharkhand cadre but belongs to Andhra Pradesh. Presently he is the chief secretary of Jammu and Kashmir. When the issue of special category status was discussed, his immediate reaction was it is next to impossible and something which needs to be decided at a level much higher than that of officers. He said that this decision needs to be taken in the National Development Council where all Chief Ministers would be present and there is likely to be strong opposition from the other Chief Ministers. He suggested that it should be taken up at political level. I came back and informed the same to the Chief Minister and left it at that. The special package proposal was not initiated when I was in service.

While RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday completed a three-day series of organizational meetings away from media glare here, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is planning to address at least three public meetings in the state in December and January. BJP president Amit Shah is scheduled to address a two-day tribal convention here on February 2 and 3. Successive visits to the state by top saffron party functionaries ensures that the party and its leaders remain on people's minds, feel political analysts.

Sources said Bhagwat had meetings with RSS functionaries at various levels, apart from BJP general secretary (organization) Manas Mohanty and Union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan. The meetings are being seen as a necessary measure to better BJP-RSS coordination in the state ahead of the coming polls.

On December 24, Modi will address a public meeting at the foothills of the historic Barunei Hills, the site of the 1817 Paika rebellion -- an armed uprising of peasants against the British, at Khurda. He will inaugurate the IIT Bhubaneswar campus and lay the foundation of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research's (IISER) Berhampur campus. Dharmendra on Sunday tweeted, ""The Central Govt. is celebrating bicentenary of historic Paika Rebellion. Modi ji will release the commemorative coin, stamp & inaugurate the Chair at Utkal University in memory of the rebellion.""

BJP sources said the PM will also address a public meeting in Mayurbhanj district in the first week of January and another in Sambalpur in the last week of the month. Union tribal affairs minister Jual Oram said Shah will address a two-day convention of the BJP Scheduled Tribe Morcha in the city, where issues of tribals in the country will the key focus. ""Being held in Odisha, the event will highlight how the Naveen government has been indifferent to the plights of tribals,"" Oram said.

The BJD and the Congress said no plan will work for the BJP in Odisha. ""The people of Odisha have always rejected the BJP-RSS ideology. Moreover, the BJP government at the Centre has miserably failed to keep any of the promises it had made ahead of 2014 elections. In such a situation, I don't see any future for the BJP here,"" said leader of opposition Narasingha Mishra.

BJD spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member Pratap Keshari Deb said the BJP is talking big. ""Jual should explain what he has done for the tribals in his four and half years as tribal affairs minister. People can't be fooled,"" he said."

The prime minister is due to present her deal to parliament in January after postponing a planned vote on the agreement last week in order to avoid a landslide House of Commons defeat.With opposition to the deal refusing to budge, May's senior ministers are now calling on her to hand control of the process to Parliament.

""We can't have continued uncertainty and I think Parliament should be invited to say what it would agree with,"" the Business Secretary Greg Clark told the Today Programme on Monday, adding that ""every MP needs to regard themselves as responsible participants.""

This was backed by the International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, who told the Andrew Marr show on Sunday that he ""wouldn't have a huge problem with Parliament as a whole having a say on what the options were.""

The Education Secretary Damian Hinds agreed, telling BBC 5 Live on Sunday that ""there is a value in, sort of, flushing out, what these various different options are.""

Ministers would like May to hold a series of non-binding votes indicating whether MPs would support a change of course to either a Norway-style soft-Brexit in which the UK remained inside the single market, or a harder exit with the possibility of signing a trade deal with the EU in the future, which Brexiteers call a ""managed no-deal.""

The prime minister has reportedly so far resisted calls for her to hand over the process to MPs, insisting that she can secure sufficient concessions from the EU to allow her deal to pass through parliament.The push for May to hand over control of the Brexit process comes as

Her chief of staff Gavin Barwell and her effective deputy David Lidington have reportedly been laying the groundwork for a new vote if May's deal fails in the Commons.

The prime minister will today say that holding a second referendum would do ""irreparable damage"" to British politics.

""Let us not break faith with the British people by trying to stage another referendum,"" she will tell the Commons.

""Another vote which would do irreparable damage to the integrity our politics, because it would say to millions who trusted in democracy, that our democracy does not deliver.

""Another vote which would likely leave us no further forward than the last. And another vote which would further divide our country at the very moment we should be working to unite it.""

The People's Vote campaign for another referendum believes the fact that May feels the need to dedicate a House of Commons speech to the subject of another public vote is a sign of the campaign gaining momentum.

""We live rent-free inside Theresa May's head these days,"" one campaigner told Business Insider on Monday, while a senior figure in campaign said: ""It raises the issue and allows wavering Labour MPs to come out for it under the cover that the prime minister hates it.""Another said: ""It shows exactly how far we have come that she's giving a big statement in the House of Commons after an EU summit and it's all about us. It means we get coverage when we don't do anything.""

The prime minister will update MPs after her failed attempt last week to seek further concessions from EU leaders.

May was humiliated by senior EU leaders in Brussels after her demands for new legally binding assurances on the so-called Brexit backstop were rebuffed.

The prime minister had sought extra reassurances that the backstop - which is designed to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit - was unlikely to be used and would be time-limited.

However, rather than firming up the political declaration that accompanies the Withdrawal Agreement, as she had hoped, the EU actually removed significant assurances that it already contained.

But others choose to fight. Bengal Oncology Foundation's (BOF) annual meet's theme on Sunday featured around this aspect. Substantiating the organization's belief were hundreds of cancer survivors participating in the meet.

Addressing the participants, BOF secretary Dr Gautam Mukhopadhyay said, ""Cancer treatment involves a huge cost if diagnosed late and it affects the outcome. This is why we stress on prevention and early detection. If detected early, treatment is cost-effective, with better outcome.""

The director of medical education, Pradip Mitra, said the state government has been working on improving healthcare services, including that of cancer care. ""Five linear accelerator machines have been acquired by the government that will render high-end cancer care to patients at government hospitals. However, installing these machines are taking time as these are state-of-the-art equipment that cannot be installed overnight,"" Mitra, who is also an onco-pathologist, said. He also spoke on the high cost of cancer treatment and the need for insurance policies subsidized by the government.

""The number of cancer patients will keep rising for several factors, including increased life expectancy. Therefore, awareness from school level is important. But recently, I came across a well-known school where teenaged girls were being screened for breast cancer. This kind of hyper-activism is uncalled for,"" said Subir Ganguly, vice-president, BOF.

The organization has been working on cancer awareness not only in the city, but also in the districts and rural areas. Last Durga Puja, BOF tied up with Puja organizers in Baghajatin that had cancer as its theme and conducted awareness campaigns. BOF's team of about 1,000 survivors regularly engages in awareness camps and motivates patients battling cancer."

Hundreds of the company's consultants frolicked in the desert, riding camels over sand dunes and mingling in tents linked by red carpets. Meetings took place in a cavernous banquet hall that resembled a sultan's ornate court, with a sign overhead to capture the mood.

""I can't keep calm, I work at McKinsey & Company,"" it said.

Especially remarkable was the location: Kashgar, the ancient Silk Road city in China's far west that is experiencing a major humanitarian crisis.

About four miles from where the McKinsey consultants discussed their work, which includes advising some of China's most important state-owned companies, a sprawling internment camp had sprung up to hold thousands of ethnic Uighurs -- part of a vast archipelago of indoctrination camps where the Chinese government has locked up as many as one million people.

One week before the McKinsey event, a United Nations committee had denounced the mass detentions and urged China to stop.

But the political backdrop did not appear to bother the McKinsey consultants, who posted pictures on Instagram chronicling their Disney-like adventures. In fact, McKinsey's involvement with the Chinese government goes much deeper than its odd choice to showcase its presence in the country.

For a quarter-century, the company has joined many American corporations in helping stoke China's transition from an economic laggard to the world's second-largest economy. But as China's growth presents a muscular challenge to American dominance, Washington has become increasingly critical of some of Beijing's signature policies, including the ones McKinsey has helped advance.

One of McKinsey's state-owned clients has even helped build China's artificial islands in the South China Sea, a major point of military tension with the United States.

It turns out that McKinsey's role in China is just one example of its extensive -- and sometimes contentious -- work around the world, according to an investigation by The New York Times that included interviews with 40 current and former McKinsey employees, as well as dozens of their clients.

At a time when democracies and their basic values are increasingly under attack, the iconic American company has helped raise the stature of authoritarian and corrupt governments across the globe, sometimes in ways that counter American interests.

Its clients have included Saudi Arabia's absolute monarchy, Turkey under the autocratic leadership of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and corruption-plagued governments in countries like South Africa.

In Ukraine, McKinsey and Paul Manafort -- President Trump's campaign chairman, later convicted of financial fraud -- were paid by the same oligarch to help burnish the image of a disgraced presidential candidate, Viktor F. Yanukovych, recasting him as a reformer.

Once in office, Mr. Yanukovych rebuffed the West, sided with Russia and fled the country, accused of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars. The events set off years of chaos in Ukraine and an international standoff with the Kremlin.

Inside Russia itself, McKinsey has worked with Kremlin-linked companies that have been placed under sanctions by Western governments -- companies that the firm helped build up over the years and, in some cases, continues to advise.

It has consulted in many sectors of the Russian economy, including mining, manufacturing, oil and gas, banking, transportation and agriculture. A McKinsey official sat on the Russian government's energy board. Former McKinsey consultants have gone to work in the Russian companies they once advised.

In August, VEB Bank -- which is wholly owned by the Russian state, intertwined with Russian intelligence and under United States sanctions -- hired McKinsey to develop its business strategy.

There is no indication that McKinsey has violated American sanctions, which prohibit only certain transactions with targeted companies and individuals. But the larger question is whether the company, in pursuing legitimate business opportunities abroad, is helping to shore up President Vladimir V. Putin's autocratic leadership.

Other consulting companies serve similar clients, but none have the stature to confer credibility quite like McKinsey, a confidant for 92 years to many of the world's most admired companies.

In China, it has advised at least 22 of the 100 biggest state-owned companies -- the ones carrying out some of the government's most strategic and divisive initiatives, according to a review of Chinese-language material by The Times.

While it is not unusual for American corporations to work with China's state-owned companies, McKinsey's role has sometimes put it in the middle of deeply troubled deals. In Malaysia, the company laid out the case for one of Asia's most corrupt leaders to pursue billions of dollars from China at a time when he was suspected of funneling vast sums of public money into his own pocket, drawing tens of thousands into the streets to protest against him.

McKinsey defends its work around the world, saying that it will not accept jobs at odds with the company's values. It also gives the same reason that other companies cite for working in corrupt or authoritarian nations -- that change is best achieved from the inside.

""Since 1926, McKinsey has sought to make a positive difference to the businesses and communities in which our people live and work,"" the company said in a statement.

""Tens of thousands of jobs have been created, lives improved and education provided thanks to the work we have done with our clients,"" it added.

""Like many other major corporations including our competitors, we seek to navigate a changing geopolitical environment,"" the company said, ""but we do not support or engage in political activities.""

Still, some analysts, veteran diplomats and experts on global governance see McKinsey's role in a different light.

While the United States pulls back from international cooperation and adopts a more nationalist stance, major companies like McKinsey are pursuing business in countries with little regard for human rights -- sometimes advancing, rather than curbing, the contentious tactics of America's biggest rivals.

""It is more likely they enable these regimes and likely become complicit,"" said David J. Kramer, a former assistant secretary of state. ""They don't want to alienate regimes, or they would lose business.""

Oligarchs and Autocrats

His bona fides included two criminal convictions and a rigged election that, many assumed, had finally doomed his presidential ambitions.

So it was a bit surprising when McKinsey helped polish the battered image of Mr. Yanukovych and pitch him as something else: a forward-thinking leader with an economic vision of a better future for all Ukrainians.

McKinsey's role in resurrecting Mr. Yanukovych's political career has been lost in the clamor surrounding the conviction of Mr. Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, for secretly taking millions of dollars to help the Ukranian leader win the presidency in 2010.

But McKinsey was financed by the same oligarch who backed Mr. Manafort, and it wrote an economic plan that Mr. Yanukovych wielded to disarm his critics -- before discarding much of it after becoming president.

On his 100th day in office, in a Soviet-era palace adorned with Cossack art, Mr. Yanukovych stiffly briefed the nation, laying out his economic plan. After sipping Cognac and Scotch, legislators and guests packed the hall, where the cameras conspicuously stopped on a man with a bright blue suit and a résumé that touched the lives of virtually everyone in Ukraine.

His name: Rinat Akhmetov, the country's richest oligarch. As much as anyone, he was the reason for the gathering, and he had reason to feel good.

He had rescued Mr. Yanukovych through a strategy that included hiring two very different consulting groups: Mr. Manafort, whose Russian-linked team had worked for dictators with little regard for human rights, and McKinsey, the purveyor of best practices for the world's most important corporations.

That these two disparate groups found common ground is a testament to Mr. Akhmetov's vast business empire and political skill. But for McKinsey, it underscored the risk of consulting in an unstable part of the world, where the company might be perceived as enabling autocratic or corrupt governments.

Mr. Manafort's job was twofold: to soften Mr. Yanukovych's reputation and strengthen his Russian-leaning Party of Regions, facilitating his rise to the presidency. McKinsey provided something different -- an economic plan that Mr. Yanukovych could use to portray himself as a market-based reformer, tilting to the West.

To ensure that the message got through, Mr. Yanukovych and Mr. Akhmetov pointedly mentioned McKinsey in talks with American officials, according to diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks. Mr. Akhmetov assured the Americans that his candidate was ""a strong McKinsey supporter,"" while Mr. Yanukovych emphasized that he had instructed his aides ""to work directly with McKinsey experts.""

Diplomats remained wary. A respected Ukrainian journalist warned American officials that Mr. Yanukovych might ""sing a song one moment and knife someone the next.""

There were also questions about Mr. Akhmetov, who had long been suspected of links to organized crime, which he denied. One diplomat called his Party of Regions a haven for ""mobsters and oligarchs,"" noting that it might be trying to shed that image.

Mr. Akhmetov's financial ties to Mr. Manafort and McKinsey went beyond politics. He hired both to advise parts of his corporate empire, which included steel, mining, energy, finance, telecommunications, real estate, media, transportation, agriculture and soccer. He also hired former McKinsey consultants to help run his businesses, placing them in senior positions.

Mr. Akhmetov paid Mr. Manafort by wire transfers funneled through a Cypriot shell company, court records show. Other Party of Regions operatives paid Mr. Manafort through shell companies, eventually resulting in his conviction in the United States for failing to declare the money on his tax returns.

McKinsey, by contrast, was paid through a Ukrainian foundation financed by Mr. Akhmetov and run by a former McKinsey consultant now living in Moscow. Set up to promote economic reform, the foundation also sought to publicize McKinsey -- and by extension, Mr. Yanukovych.

To reach its prime audience in the United States, the foundation held two forums on the Ukrainian economy -- one at the Four Seasons Hotel in New York and the other in Washington. On the whole, McKinsey's work was well received.

But the promise of a better future didn't last long.

Within a few years, Ukraine careened toward economic collapse while Mr. Yanukovych looted the nation, living in a palatial residence surrounded by a private zoo, a golf course, a garage filled with classic cars and a private restaurant in the form of a pirate ship.

If that were not enough, he was also quietly building an enormous seaside retreat, complete with 40-foot ceilings and an indoor swimming pool, that eclipsed his presidential residence.

The capital soon turned against him. Mr. Yanukovych had long promised to tie Ukraine to the West by signing sweeping political and trade agreements with the European Union. Then he abruptly reneged, siding with Russia instead.

Protesters flooded the streets for months, chanting pro-Europe slogans. Mr. Yanukovych's government responded with a heavy hand, culminating in what the European Parliament's envoy called a ""Ukrainian Tiananmen,"" referring to China's deadly crackdown on demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. More than 80 protesters were killed before Mr. Yanukovych fled the country in 2014.

The chaos didn't end there. Outraged, Mr. Putin pushed into Ukraine, annexed Crimea and stirred up a war that has claimed more than 10,000 lives. The West responded by kicking Russia out of the Group of 8 industrialized democracies and imposing sanctions. The standoff between Mr. Putin and the West had begun.

McKinsey defended its role in Mr. Yanukovych's rise by saying that the foundation was serious about promoting economic development in Ukraine and featured prominent Westerners on its board. The foundation quietly folded -- without achieving its goals -- just before Mr. Yanukovych fled to Russia. Neither Mr. Akhmetov nor McKinsey would say how much money McKinsey earned.

""When we concluded that the government was not following through on its stated reform agenda, we ended our work,"" McKinsey said in a statement.

Mr. Akhmetov, who publicly broke with Mr. Yanukovych during the protests, declined to speak to The Times. Inside his gold and chrome headquarters, a spokesman said the foundation had been unsuccessful because politicians lacked the will ""to embrace the reform agenda.""

But critics like Anders Aslund, a Swedish-born economist who advised the Russian government in the 1990s and later the government of Ukraine, lamented how Mr. Yanokovych's image had been sold in Western capitals. It was clear, he said, that Mr. Yanokovych ""was about power and robbery.""

McKinsey's role in Ukraine did not end with Mr. Yanukovych's downfall. ""We build leaders who can deliver lasting, meaningful impact for Ukraine's major companies, its economy and society,"" the company wrote on its website

McKinsey quickly became a favorite of Mr. Yanukovych's successor, Petro O. Poroshenko, an oligarch known as ""the chocolate king"" for his confectionary business.

In a speech last November, Mr. Poroshenko praised McKinsey for its 15 years of work in Ukraine. His daughter-in-law also worked for the company during most of his presidency.

Meanwhile, McKinsey has continued to consult for Mr. Akhmetov, sharing the top floor of a Kiev office building with an Akhmetov company. Another Akhmetov company sits a floor below. In fact, Mr. Akhmetov owns the entire building, which includes a business in the lobby fit for an oligarch: an Aston Martin-Rolls Royce dealership.

Building China's Dream

Deep in the Malaysian jungle, a sprawling construction site sits abandoned, the relentless monsoon rain taking its toll on the rusting fields of steel girders.

It is supposed to be a railway -- part of China's signature Belt and Road Initiative, a $1 trillion global undertaking financed by big Chinese loans, and usually built by Chinese companies.

Chief among them is the China Communications Construction Company, a state-owned behemoth whose initials are stenciled in black on the cement plant at the abandoned site.

China Communications, which was barred for eight years from doing business on some World Bank projects because of a corruption scandal, played a leading role in building artificial islands in the South China Sea that have raised tensions with the United States.

The company's subsidiary also built a new port for Sri Lanka. But the debt turned out to be such a burden that the Sri Lankan government had to give up the port and hand it over for 99 years -- to China.

Sri Lanka's fate was so alarming that Malaysia's new prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, worried that the same thing might happen to him. So he suspended the railway project in July.

""That is not good for us,"" Mr. Mahathir said in September. ""Malaysian workers have no jobs that they can do. All the work is hired from China. You can see how one-sided it is.""

But for McKinsey, it was anything but one-sided. The company represented both parties involved in the deal.

In 2015, as China Communications was building the artificial islands and still under World Bank sanctions, McKinsey signed it on as a client, advising it on strategy.

Months later, McKinsey won another contract: this one with the Malaysian government, to review the feasibility of the rail line.

In a confidential PowerPoint report, McKinsey told Malaysian officials that the rail line could increase economic growth in parts of the country by as much as 1.5 percent. It was a figure that the prime minister at the time, Najib Razak, who now has been charged with corruption, liked to cite.

In bullet points, McKinsey also said the project would help improve ties with China -- ""build the nation-to-nation relationship"" -- because of its importance in China's Belt and Road Initiative.

And McKinsey endorsed the idea of heavy borrowing from China, referring to it as a ""game changer"" elsewhere in the region.

It isn't hard to see where McKinsey's enthusiasm for the Belt and Road Initiative came from: The firm had promoted the Chinese policy at the highest levels of the company.

Dominic Barton, McKinsey's managing partner at the time, made Belt and Road the theme of a keynote address in Beijing in 2015, recounting the Silk Road trade from the second century B.C. onward.

McKinsey's in-house research group, the McKinsey Global Institute, sprang into action, producing reports -- widely cited in the Chinese state news media -- extolling the benefits of the Belt and Road Initiative.

Mr. Barton -- who has served on the advisory board of China Development Bank, one of the two biggest Chinese lenders to the Belt and Road Initiative -- also batted down concerns in a 2015 interview with Chinese state media that the undertaking might be used as a tool to expand China's global influence.

""The world is waiting for the 'One Belt, One Road' grand blueprint to move from dream to reality,"" Mr. Barton and his colleagues wrote in a report published on the company's Chinese website in May 2015, expressing McKinsey's enthusiasm to work on it.

The feeling was mutual. Nine of the top 20 Belt-and-Road contractors are or have been McKinsey clients, according to research by The Times and figures from RWR Advisory Group, which tracks such projects.

In 2016, McKinsey's client, China Communications, won the $13 billion contract to build the Malaysian railroad. McKinsey justified the project at a time when Mr. Najib was widely accused of corruption, buffeted by street protests over the disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars from a state investment fund, and badly in need of cash from an outside lender like China.

The scandal over the deal has enveloped both of McKinsey's clients. Mr. Mahatir told local reporters that China Communications, which won a no-bid contract for the railroad, may have deliberately overstated the costs in order to help Mr. Najib and his allies shovel extra money into the investment fund to replenish the missing amounts.

Tony Pua, a Malaysian lawmaker and an aide to the finance minister, said the deal was brokered by a hard-partying Malaysian businessman named Jho Low, who is accused of siphoning off hundreds of millions of dollars from the fund and is now believed to be in China, avoiding a Malaysian arrest warrant.

McKinsey says it has no knowledge of any collusion between China and Mr. Najib. It said that of course it would discuss China's sweeping Belt and Road plans but rejected the notion that, by representing both sides involved in the project, the company had a conflict of interest in any way. By the time China Communications won the bid, its work for Malaysia had already finished, the firm said.

""Our firm's rigorous internal policies and procedures"" ensure that ""we bring an independent perspective"" to help each client ""pursue its own strategic goals,"" McKinsey said.

But the political backdrop -- a government facing crippling corruption accusations and the prospect that Mr. Najib might turn to China for funds to cover his tracks -- should have been obvious to McKinsey at the time, argued Bridget Welsh, a professor at John Cabot University in Rome who focuses on Malaysian politics.

""They were choosing to engage with actors that were deeply tainted,"" Ms. Welsh said of McKinsey.

A Special Relationship

It was not the first time McKinsey had been drawn into questionable arrangements through its work in China.

The company opened its first office there in 1995, using consultants from the United States and Britain. By the end the decade, McKinsey was on hand to help as Beijing began pushing its moribund state-owned companies to adopt Western-style management, a McKinsey specialty.

The firm landed some big clients. Its star pupil was Ping An, an insurance company set up as part of a state-owned shipping company. Beginning in 1997, McKinsey began a two-decade relationship with the company as it rose from a footnote to one of the world's biggest insurers.

McKinsey's success soon reached into the pinnacle of Chinese politics, dragging it -- unwittingly and unknowingly, the company contends -- into a potential conflict of interest in the most glaring example of official enrichment in the history of the People's Republic of China.

Always in search of top talent, McKinsey brought on a 27-year-old named Liu Chunhang as a full-time associate in 2002. He had just graduated near the top of his class at Harvard Business School, according to school records, and stayed at McKinsey for less than a year. But in that time, his in-laws took steps that would turn them into billionaires.

Mr. Liu was the son-in-law of Wen Jiabao, the country's vice premier in charge of finance. Several months later, Mr. Wen became China's premier, putting him in charge of running the government.

At the time, McKinsey's client, Ping An, was preparing for an initial public offering in Hong Kong. The Wen family and its business associates became secret shareholders of Ping An, having acquired their stakes at low cost in late 2002. And as premier, Mr. Wen presided over China's cabinet, which oversaw the insurance industry and signed off on big I.P.O.s.

According to McKinsey, Mr. Liu left the company in July 2003. It's not clear whether he played any role in his extended family's business activities. But when Ping An went public the next year, the Wen family amassed a staggering fortune, largely in company stock. By 2007, the family was worth at least $2.7 billion.

Mr. Liu, who is now a senior official at China's banking regulator, said through a spokesman that he ""never worked on any projects for the firm's Chinese clients,"" and that it would be ""misleading"" to connect him with McKinsey's work for Ping An.

McKinsey said that Mr. Liu had been hired because he was qualified, not because of his family connections.

""Any suggestion that Mr. Liu was hired or employed for improper purpose is false and extremely misleading,"" the company said.

Today, China's best and brightest clamor to work at McKinsey. Partners in the firm have sat in on Communist Party meetings at companies. More than 90 percent of the company's 350 consultants in China are of Chinese descent, according to its website.

And the importance of China to McKinsey over all is evident: The firm's last two managing partners, Mr. Barton and Kevin Sneader, were promoted from the region. Mr. Sneader now runs the entire company from Hong Kong.

McKinsey's name has become so prestigious in the country that a Chinese copycat sprang up, adopting the company's Chinese name.

The copycat firm -- Chengdu McKinsey Management Consulting Company -- even won a contract to advise Sichuan Province on its economic planning. Its ruse was so successful that the China Economic Weekly, a magazine under the Communist Party's mouthpiece People's Daily, wrote a cover article about the spreading influence of the real McKinsey, likening it to an octopus, and marveling at the success of the fake one.

McKinsey said it had not worked on the economic planning in Sichuan Province.

The company, however, has not shied away from contentious programs like ""Smart Cities,"" worrying scholars and human rights advocates who say the approach will strengthen China's surveillance state.

The idea of smart cities is to make them more manageable by collecting data from sources like cameras. In an authoritarian state like China, that raises broad concerns.

""Police patrols cannot be everywhere, for instance, but predictive analytics can deploy them in the right place at the right time,"" McKinsey wrote in a report in June.

""It is about political control,"" said Samantha Hoffman, a fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.

McKinsey is now working with Ping An to put smart cities into practice in the Chinese city of Nanning to monitor financial fraud.

The company has also championed -- even parroted, critics say -- the Chinese government's ""Made in China 2025"" initiative to become a global leader in sensitive fields like artificial intelligence and aerospace, a policy rattling European and American leaders who fear the plans will undermine their economies and set the stage for Chinese dominance.

In October, Vice President Mike Pence warned that ""through the 'Made in China 2025' plan, the Communist Party has set its sights on controlling 90 percent of the world's most advanced industries.""

McKinsey has produced at least 10 reports in Chinese focusing on ""Made in China 2025."" But earlier this year, China's government ordered the news media to stop writing about it, given the intense criticism from the United States and Europe. McKinsey's reports also stopped mentioning the policy.

""They sometimes seem to be almost like an arm of the People's Daily,"" George Magnus, a former chief economist at UBS, said of McKinsey. ""Obviously they do it in a slightly more subtle way -- sometimes not so subtle.""

Clients Under Sanctions

When Senate investigators wanted to know why Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law, met with the head of a Russian bank under sanctions shortly after the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Kushner explained that, as far as he had been told, the bank chief had ""a direct line to the Russian president.""

It is easy to see how. The bank -- Vnesheconombank, or VEB -- is owned by the Russian government and overseen directly by Mr. Putin's inner circle. The bank's former chief -- the one Mr. Kushner met -- graduated from the training school of the F.S.B., the successor agency of the K.G.B. The bank has also come under scrutiny in Congress and by the special counsel investigating possible collusion in the 2016 election.

And the bank is a McKinsey client.

In August, VEB hired the consulting firm to develop its business strategy -- one of several companies that are under sanctions and that McKinsey advises.

Sberbank -- a state-controlled bank that is on the sanctions list and that sponsored Mr. Trump's Miss Universe contest in Moscow in 2013 -- is also a McKinsey client. In 2016, it agreed to pay the firm up to $5.2 million for advice on restructuring.

Yet another state-owned bank under sanctions, VTB, agreed to pay McKinsey about $4.4 million in 2017 to develop information technology.

McKinsey's work in Russia is extensive. Its Moscow office, the largest of the Western consulting firms working there, has handled about 2,000 projects, working with market leaders in oil, gas, banking and retail, as well as the mining of diamonds, gold and coal. One of its senior partners is the son of the Nobel Prize-winning novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.

McKinsey is so valued in Russia that even as Mr. Putin and Western nations clashed over Ukraine, a partner in the firm served on a Russian energy commission until 2015, along with several business executives who were either the target of individual sanctions or had ties to companies under sanction.

McKinsey clients help expand Russia's reach abroad. One of them -- PhosAgro, a fertilizer giant with ties to the Kremlin -- is pushing hard for new regulations that would give it greater control over Europe's food supply. The European Union already had concerns about Russian influence over its natural gas supply, much of which came from Gazprom, another Russian company under sanctions that McKinsey has advised on strategy and pricing.

McKinsey says it takes jobs in Russia -- or anywhere in the world -- only when it believes it can make a positive contribution. McKinsey also says its consulting is not political in nature, but focused on helping people lead better lives.

The firm has plenty of accomplishments to point to. In Russia alone, it upgraded Aeroflot, the national airline, improved traffic flow in Moscow and improved worker safety.

And McKinsey is far from the only American company working in legal ways with companies under sanctions. Some American officials have long argued that getting involved in the Russian economy not only benefits the American companies working there, but can also help foster better business practices and a greater appreciation for democratic principles overseas.

Others see little evidence of that. Robert G. Berschinski, a State Department official in the Obama administration, said business leaders and policymakers often believed that actively engaging with authoritarian governments would lead to economic reform, which in turn would drive political reform.

""But what is becoming increasingly clear, in Russia, China and Saudi Arabia -- in all three of those instances -- that belief has not proven to be true,"" he said.

China is a prime example, argued Mr. Kramer, the former assistant secretary of state. He said the country had lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, yet companies that do business there ""have nothing to point to"" showing that Chinese people have been granted more civil or political rights.

In some cases, McKinsey's work may have made things worse.

The firm produced a report tracking how some of Saudi Arabia's most important policies were viewed by the public, singling out three individuals who drove often negative conversations on Twitter.

One was later arrested, according to a human rights group. Another said that Saudi government officials had imprisoned two of his brothers and hacked his cellphone. The third -- an anonymous account -- was shut down.

McKinsey said it was ""horrified by the possibility, however remote,"" that the report could have been misused. But the kingdom is a such a vital client for the firm -- the source of nearly 600 projects from 2011 to 2016 alone -- that McKinsey chose to participate in a major Saudi investment conference in October even after the killing and dismemberment of a Washington Post columnist by Saudi agents.

""The world is divided into people who are for beheadings and against beheadings,"" said Anand Giridharadas, a former McKinsey consultant and former Times writer. He added that the firm and other companies were lending ""their reputation and credibility to a regime that deserves none of that.""

For 19 months, Calvert W. Jones, a University of Maryland professor, crisscrossed the Gulf monarchies in the Middle East as part of her research evaluating the work of management consultants in what she calls ""the black box of authoritarian governance.""

""Even if democracy itself remains a distant hope, so the thinking goes, experts might improve the daily lives of citizens in fundamental ways,"" Ms. Jones wrote.

Her conclusions are not likely to make it into recruiting videos for consulting companies seeking idealistic college graduates.

""In the beginning, the best of them want to help, want to do real research, provide data and expert opinions,"" she said. But after initially speaking their minds, she said, they gradually stop.

""They engage in the art of not speaking truth to power,"" she said. ""They self-censor, exaggerate successes and downplay their own misgivings due to the incentive structures they face.""

Outside experts might even reduce, rather than encourage, domestic reform, Ms. Jones said, partly because consultants are often unwilling to level with the ruling elite. The issue is becoming increasingly relevant, she said, as ""the number of experts circulating around the world continues to grow.""

The expansion is clear enough in the lobby of the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh on a weekday morning. There, a former Western diplomat quipped, you can watch the consultants departing for their jobs ""like bats leaving a cave."""

The original Act had stated that not less than 34 per cent of the total number of offices in Gram Panchayats would be reserved for Backward Classes. However, total reservations, after accounting for reservations provided to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, which are constitutional in nature, would have exceeded 50 per cent.

This would have been against the Supreme Court's directions of not allowing total reservations to go beyond the halfway mark. Currently, as per the Census of 2011, STs get 6 per cent, SCs get 16 per cent. With the Ordinance, the total reservations for Backward Classes, which include Muslims under the BC (E) category, will now be 28 per cent, instead of 34 per cent as planned by the government earlier.

The State currently has 1,308 Panchayats in Scheduled Areas which are completely reserved for Sheduled Castes. Also, as many as 1,326 Panchayats are reserved for, and populated entirely, by Scheduled Tribes.

In the remaining 10,117 Panchayats in the State, according to the Panchayat Raj (Amendment) Ordinance-2018, the total reservation provided to any community cannot exceed 50 per cent.

'Different purposes'

Way back in May 2010, Chief Justice of India KG Balakrishnan in the 'K Krishna Murthy & Ors vs Union of India' case, ruled that reservations in local governments were different from those in employment and education. He had said that policies evolved in relation to Article 15(4) and 16(4) could be readily applied in the context of local self government. The upper ceiling of 50 per cent vertical reservations in favour of SC/ST/OBCs should not be breached in this context,the SC order said.

Turning his attention to the villages, Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Sunday said the villages are key to development of the State and the country.

After a review meeting at Pragathi Bhavan on various aspects of Panchayat Raj and electoral promises made in the recent Assembly elections, the Chief Minister said the country and the State would be developed only if the villages are developed. So, one should concentrate on the development of villages, he added. During the meeting, Rao also instructed the officials concerned to appoint village secretaries to all gram panchayats.

Revealing the plans to give villages a facelift by effectively implementing new Panchayat Raj Act, Rao said that immediately after the Village Panchayat Raj elections, the initiatives aimed at developing the villages, their greenery and sanitation as well as environmental cleanliness must be stepped up.

9,355 new secretaries

The chief minister also said that in a first of its kind recruitment process aimed at having one village secretary for each of the 12,751 gram panchayats in the State, after creation of new zonal system, the government took up recruitment of 9,355 village secretaries. With the recruitment process has already been completed, the Chief Minister has signed the concerned file, instructing the District Collectors to issue appointment orders to the newly recruited village secretaries. The chief minister said that now every village would have village level officers who would be made responsible for the development of the village, its greenery and sanitation programmes.

The government will be conducting an awareness conclave for these 12,751 village secretaries -- both present and newly-recruited, MPDOs, EOPRDs, DPOs and DLPOs at LB Stadium in Hyderabad. The chief minister will deliver the inaugural address at the conclave which is scheduled to start at 2.00 p.m.

Aasara implementation

The Chief Minister also announced during the review meeting that as per the electoral promises every old age person on completion of 57 years would be provided with old pension under the Aasara scheme. Rao instructed Chief Secretary SK Joshi to draft modalities pertaining to the matter and decide on the process of identifying persons eligible for the pension.

Rao said that once the details of beneficiaries are worked out and the number is decided, the adequate provision would be made in 2019-20 budget and pension should be given with effect from April 1, 2019.

Sarees distribution

Chandrasekhar Rao also instructed the officers concerned to make arrangements for the distribution of Bathukamma sarees from December 19.

Recalling that though the sarees were kept ready for distribution ahead of the Bathukamma festival it had to deferred in view of the complaint made by the Congress party to the ECI before the elections, he instructed the officials to distribute Bathukamma sarees along with the distribution of clothes on the occasion of Christmas.

The CM also announced the decision to have MLA's distribute the cheques of Kalyana Laxmi and Shadi Mubarak as was done before the election model code of conduct came into force ahead of elections.

When the poll code was in force, the district Collectors distributed the cheques to the eligible candidates.

New district and mandals

The CM instructed revenue principal secretary Rajeshwar Tiwari to commence the process of formation of two new districts -- Mulugu and Narayanpet. Rao also instructed the revenue secretary to initiate the process of formation of new revenue division of Korutla as well as six new mandals. The new mandals to be formed are Ghattuppal Mandal in Nalgonda, Mallampally in Bhupalapally, Chanduru and Mosra in Bhanswada, Inugurthy in Mahbubabad and Narayanraopet in Siddipet."

""According to a study by ICRIER (a research firm), USD 100 billion investment will have a seven-fold multiplier effect on GDP. There is a need of a national mission to make this happen. We are going to launch broadband readiness index for states which will be vital for investments,"" Telecom Secretary Aruna Sundararajan told PTI. She said the Ministry of Electronics and IT has also shown interest in states readiness index and want to expand it further.

The telecom ministry will hold the first workshop on the implementation of the National Digital Communications Policy (NDCP) which envisages USD 100 billion investment in telecom sector by 2022, broadband connectivity at 50 Mbps speed to every citizen, telecom connectivity at every corner of India and creating 40 lakh jobs.

""This is the first preparatory national workshop on the implementation of NDCP in which 25 states have confirmed to participate. Here we will launch National Broadband Mission to achieve the objective of broadband for all,"" Sundararajan said.

Industry leaders and associations will discuss at the NDCP workshop issues they are facing in states especially in rolling out telecom infrastructure which in turn impact investments. ""We want to ensure that 5G is not limited to urban areas. It should reach rural areas. For this, we have to work with states to ensure that there is 100% penetration of optical fibre cables. Without massive OFC penetration, 5G services will not expand. States have to provide a smooth right of way permissions,"" Sundararajan said.

5G networks are said to provide the broadband speed of 1 Gbps. Theoretically, a high definition 2-hour video can be downloaded in 5 seconds at this speed. The telecom secretary said there is a need to increase mobile tower base by three times and OFC rollout by four-folds to achieve 'broadband for all' target under the National Broadband Mission.

""We have to roll out Wi-Fi services in rural and urban areas. To deliver the benefit of NDCP to people and create jobs, states have to come forward. We will do a comparative evaluation of all states and highlight best policies for other states to adopt it,"" Sundararajan said.

The telecom ministry has floated tender to roll out 10 lakh Wi-Fi hotspots across all 2.5 lakh village panchayats. At present, 1.21 lakh panchayats are ready with broadband services infrastructure. The DoT has awarded task to roll out Wi-Fi services in 62,0000 panchayats to Telecommunications Consultants India Limited (TCIL) and is working with ITI for setting up Wi-Fi hotspots in other panchayats.

""Broadband services have been started in all panchayats covered under Phase 1. Now we are looking at utilisation of broadband where states need to come forward and identify institutions like school, police stations etc that are to be connected with Wi-Fi,"" Sundararajan said.

She said states have to ensure that there is enough electronic equipment available at their institutions to start using the BharatNet broadband network for various services like telemedicine, e-health, e-education etc.

""DoT is working to create state-of-the-art telecom infrastructure in the next four years and we want states to draw a roadmap to start using it.

Is the case of two 'meticulously selected' IPS officers to head the CBI a reflection of a deeper malaise that has afflicted the civil service? Is it just the tip of the iceberg? Is there something wrong with the process of selection? Despite a much-touted 360-degree assessment, why are so many senior officers being shifted so often? There are many more such questions that beg answers.

Why was Rupak Dutta, an IPS officer with impeccable credentials and with a long tenure in the CBI, shifted and attached to the home ministry? Why wasn't he considered for the post of director? Why were Alok Verma and Rakesh Asthana brought to the CBI when they had no experience of working in the organisation? Were competence and integrity not the criteria to select officers on these critical and sensitive posts? Were they not assessed through a '360-degree' evaluation?

As many as 17 ministries/departments have each had four-five secretaries or more during the past four years. Not all these postings were necessitated on account of superannuation. The social sector has suffered the most. The rural development ministry has had five secretaries, same as the case with crucial ministries/departments like health and school education. How can these sectors develop with such frequent changes at the top?

Also read: Modi govt is very 'unstable' for top IAS secretaries, transfers them too often and abruptly

Secretaries are supposed to be selected after due diligence (read 360-degree). If that was the case, then why were two home secretaries - L.C. Goyal and Anil Goswami shifted even before they could complete their tenure of two years? Some other changes were equally baffling. Vrinda Sarup, rated as one of the finest IAS officers and with a very high experience in the school education sector, was shifted out suddenly. J.S. Deepak, then secretary, telecom, was attached to the ministry of commerce in an overnight order while he was representing the country at an international conference in Barcelona. Anuj Bishnoi who was ultimately considered fit for Central Administrative Tribunal, was shifted three times during his tenure as secretary. Why was C.K. Mishra shifted out of the ministry of health and family welfare? And if he wasn't good enough, how did he end up getting the ministry of environment and forest?

A large number of public sector undertakings (PSUs) have been left headless and without directors for months together, adversely impacting the performance of these entities. Coal India Limited is one such example where the absence of a CMD has created havoc. The coal sector was going through a serious crisis on account of coal shortages till 2014. The infamous coal scam was an outcome of this shortage. However, this was turned around on account of the outstanding contribution of Sutirtha Bhattacharya who headed the company for three years. Coal production saw an unprecedented jump in the years 2014-15 and 2015-16 primarily on account of his efforts. The incremental growth of 32 million tonnes was more than the cumulative growth during the previous four years. However, on completion of his tenure, Coal India Limited was left with an officiating chairman for more than a year. The consequences are there for everyone to see. There is yet again an acute shortage of coal in the country. The situation is gradually improving because there is a full-time CMD now. This is true of a number of public sector undertakings.

Every time one interacted with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, one could not but be impressed with his sincerity of purpose and clarity of thought. The intent was always there and this reflected in his thought, expression and action. There were indeed some brilliant initiatives and decisions. The setting up of secretaries' groups, getting trainee IAS officers for a three-month stint in Delhi, posting of some senior level officers well ahead of the retirement of the previous incumbent, amendment to Section 13(1)(d)(ii) of the Prevention of Corruption Act were indeed praiseworthy and reflected the positive intent of the Prime Minister in the context of human resource management. But then, where did it all go wrong? Why and how did human resource management get messed up? Who is advising the Prime Minister in taking these crucial decisions that are repeatedly going wrong?

Also read: Hiring non-IAS officers as joint secretaries may be too radical a step for India

The answer perhaps lies in the humongous task of managing India's army of civil servants. With almost everything getting concentrated in the hands of a few civil servants, the task has become too big to handle. This has also led to enormous delays in decisions related to postings resulting in vacancies for long durations. There is indeed something amiss. Can some of the work be delegated to different levels? Will it help? Can competence and integrity, and not allegiance, become the criteria for selection? These are, as they say, million dollar questions that beckon answers. Only those that matter can perhaps answer them. However, before they are answered, someone will have to muster the courage to ask these questions.

The State will have two more new districts -- Mulug and Narayanpet -- taking the total to 33 along with several other lower-level administrative units such as revenue divisions and mandals, as promised by Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao during the recent elections to the Assembly.

Directions to the effect were given by the Chief Minister to Special Chief Secretary (Revenue) Rajeshwar Tiwari at a review meeting held here on Sunday. The Chief Minister told the official to initiate the process for carving out the two new districts in tune with his electoral promise. Apart from the two new districts, Korutla will be made a new revenue division and Narayanraopet in Siddipet, Gattuppal in Nalgonda, Mallampally in Bhupalapally, Chanduru and Mosra in Kamareddy and Inugurthy in Mahabubabad districts will be made new mandals. Further, Gundala mandal in Jangoan district will be merged into Yadadri-Bhuvangiri district.

""The DDA committed to the Delhi high court to give 4,000 sq metre of land to the Directorate of Education for constructing a school. However, the size of the school has now been reduced to 1,600 sq metre, along with the number of classes that would be taught,"" Sisodia said. ""The decision was taken on the direction of the Lieutenant Governor in a meeting held by Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash a month after the high court order, without taking the Delhi government in confidence,"" he claimed.

Sisodia was referring to the Qaumi Senior Secondary School operating inside an Eidgah at Quresh Nagar in central Delhi, with around 800 students at present. The Central Board of Secondary Examination-affiliated school was then shifted to a DDA Colony, but it neither got land, nor a building. Four-decades later, the school runs classes out of an Eidgah in two shifts due to a space constraint, with primary classes held in the morning while the rest are held in the evening.

Thirteen 'classrooms', with tin, shed roofs and makeshift walls are built in an L-shape at the corner of the Eidgah's premises. A ceiling fan, a blackboard on a stand and rusted iron benches comprise each 'classroom'. School principal Mohabbat Ali was hopeful that a plot will be allotted in the next three months after completion of all formalities of the court order.

However, this year, students will have to appear for that aptitude test on their smartphones. The move has not gone down well with the school teachers and principals. According to teachers, not all students have smartphones. The matter has worried authorities enough for the city's school principals' association to approach the Board.

The aptitute test will begin on December 18. The education department has come up with a mobile application not only for students to write the test, but also for teachers to assess their performance.

According to the teachers, results of students will have to be fed to the app from personal mobile phones. They have claimed that every teacher does not have a smartphone.

A principal of a school in the western suburbs said, ""On one hand it is a big challenge to keep children off mobile phones and on the other hand such activities only make the challenge harder to tackle. Secondly, most parents do not own smartphones. One issue will lead to another.""

Another principal and secretary from the city's principals' association said, ""Not all students have smartphones. We are wondering how the aptitude test for SSC students can be conducted on phones. Until last year, the aptitude test was conducted on computers. The board should have kept both the options open -- of phones and computers. Teachers are being trained for the assessment part. Not all teachers have smartphones or internet facility. The organisation has decided to approach board officials over this issue."""

The Centre is planning to launch broadband services readiness index of states based on parameters like infrastructure, approval processes and utilisation of high speed Internet.

""According to a study by ICRIER (a research firm), $100 billion investment will have seven-fold multiplier effect on Gross Domestic Product (GDP). There is a need of a national mission to make this happen. We are going to launch broadband readiness index for states which will be vital for investments,"" Telecom Secretary Aruna Sundararajan said.

She said that the Ministry of Electronics and IT has also shown interest in states readiness index and want to expand it further.

The telecom ministry will hold first workshop on implementation of the National Digital Communications Policy (NDCP) which envisages USD 100 billion investment in telecom sector by 2022, broadband connectivity at 50 megabit per second speed to every citizen, telecom connectivity at every corner of India and creating 40 lakh jobs.

""This is first preparatory national workshop on implementation of NDCP in which 25 states have confirmed to participate. Here we will launch National Broadband Mission to achieve objective of broadband for all,"" Sundararajan said.

Industry leaders and associations will discuss at the NDCP workshop issues they are facing in states especially in rolling out telecom infrastructure which in turn impact investments.

""We want to ensure that 5G is not limited to urban areas. It should reach rural areas. For this, we have to work with states to ensure that there is 100 per cent penetration of optical fibre cables. Without massive OFC penetration, 5G services will not expand. States have to provide smooth right of way permissions,"" Sundararajan said.

5G networks are said to provide broadband speed of 1 Gbps. Theoretically, a high definition 2-hour video can be downloaded in 5 seconds at this speed.

The telecom secretary said there is a need to increase mobile tower base by three times and OFC rollout by four-folds to achieve 'broadband for all' target under the National Broadband Mission.

""We have to roll out wifi services in rural and urban areas. To deliver benefit of NDCP to people and create jobs, states have to come forward. We will do comparative evaluation of all states and highlight best policies for other states to adopt it,"" Sundararajan said.

The telecom ministry has floated tender to roll out 10 lakh wifi hotspot across all 2.5 lakh village panchayats.

At present, 1.21 lakh panchayats are ready with broadband services infrastructure. The DoT has awarded task to roll out wifi services in 62,0000 panchayats to Telecommunications Consultants India Limited (TCIL) and is working with ITI for setting up wifi hotpsots in other panchayats.

""Broadband services have been started in all panchayats covered under Phase 1. Now we are looking at utilisation of broadband where states need to come forward and identify institutions like school, police stations etc that are to be connected with wifi,"" Sundararajan said.

She said states have to ensure that there is enough electronic equipment available at their institutions to start using BharatNet broadband network for various services like tele-medicine, e-health, e-education etc.

""DoT is working to create state-of-the-art telecom infrastructure in next four years and we want states to draw a road map to start using it. At the workshop, we will work on yearly targets that states need to achieve,"" Sundararajan said.

She said the telecom ministry will discuss with states usage of broadband for development at aspirational districts, enhancing connectivity in Naxal-affected areas, north eastern states and islands."

Though more than 100 sabhas are vying with each other to dish out a delectable fare for their rasikas with music, dance and drama, there are still murmurs that talented youngsters are not given a level playing field. We scan the Margazhi scene to understand what plagues the system, why the number of young rasikas is not increasing and more... While many sabhas prefer established and celebrity artistes, there are a few organisations that are trying their best to nurture youngsters. Deepu Mon of Giri Fine Arts says, ""We have been organising concerts and giving opportunities for youngsters for the past several years. It all started off in our showroom almost a decade ago and later, we took it to the temples. This year onwards, we have decided to conduct it as a 45-day festival in Mylapore, and 200 artistes will be performing at the fest."" Stating that their focus has been to promote uncelebrated professional youngsters, Deepu says that during the last several years, they were able to promote several budding artistes, including NRIs, through their programmes.

When talking about young talents, Mudhra's contribution cannot be ignored, say young artistes. Bhaskar, its secretary, says, ""With changing times, it's not easy to identify and promote real talent. In addition to the role of an organiser, we have a year-long programme to spot talent. With multiple auditions and strict merit-based scores, we ensure the best talents get opportunities to perform."" The selected artistes are given a chance to perform with established and veteran artistes, be as instrumentalists or singers. Bhaskar says that it gives them confidence and helps them learn from the veterans during a performance.

However, Lalitha Subramanian, an art critic, says that all is not well with the current system that's in place. She says, ""Music and dance flourished around temples. But with the advent of sabhas, except for Navarathri, no music concerts happen in temples. Due to this, a majority of ordinary people are deprived of an opportunity to listen to such concerts.""

Mentioning that it's the 'elite audience' who are making it to the concerts of celebrity musicians, she says, ""The tickets for such programmes are sold out months before the event, and the cost and availability of tickets make it a difficult proposition for the students to attend such concerts. Since the entire front rows and good seats are occupied by the patrons and elite, even if youngsters manage to attend concerts, they don't get to enjoy or understand the nuances from proximity. We can't blame them if they lose interest and stop attending these concerts under such circumstances.""

A cultural organiser, on condition of anonymity, says that money plays a major role in getting a performance slot these days. ""Everyone talks about lack of sponsorship, but most of the sabhas have big corporate names sponsoring them. Then, why should the organisers resort to taking money for giving opportunity?"" he asks. Another aspect he points out is that while the daytime slots, till 4.30pm, were set apart for youngsters earlier, the scenario has changed in the last couple of years. ""There is heavy competition for day slots and dancers have occupied most of them,"" he adds. Citing that it becomes monetarily viable for a troupe to buy slots and present group performances, it's not the case with musicians. ""A slot is now being sold for as high as '20,000. Considering the cost of hiring accompanists, a musician has to keep aside at least '1.5 lakh for a single performance,"" he adds, ""If not money, an artiste should be in a position to get the sabha a sponsor for the programme. This is true even for established artistes.""

However, sabha administrators rue that even if they allot slots to youngsters, there is no audience for such concerts. Saashwathi Prabhu, CEO of Sri Krishna Gana Sabha Trust, says, ""We want to encourage youngsters to come and enjoy the performances. Admission to our programmes, including those that happen in the main slots, is free for artistes and students. Students have to just show their school or college identity card and they will be allowed inside."" However, A Prabhu, secretary of the sabha, says that he is appalled to see that there is no growth in the number of youngsters attending the concerts. ""This is a worrying fact. Even after giving slots for youngsters at Kamakoti Hall and making all the performances there free, the number of young audiences attending these concerts is not increasing,"" he adds.

Lalitha says that today's students are torn between their regular studies and coaching classes. Also, there are several other forms of entertainment. Unless we invest time and effort to inculcate in them a taste for music, the young generation will never be interested in classical music, she says. She suggests, ""Instead of focusing on sabhas, musicians should reach out to students in schools and colleges and prepare them to enjoy classical music.""

Musician Anil Srinivasan, who has been propagating education through music, concurs, ""We have been doing exactly the same. We started our initiative Rhapsody Music Education in 2013. We have been associated with private, government and corporation schools and have been working with more than 2.5 lakhs students."" He says that they focus not only on Carnatic music, but all genres -- music for children. He says that they have been measuring the results in a data-driven way and the results have been very encouraging. ""I can see the transformation in students. It's like growing up with music; it's a part of the curriculum. Several hundreds of students are now interested to take up music as a profession and several youngsters are able to understand the nuances of becoming an artiste as well as a rasika,"" he adds. Highlighting that the present and future of music lies in collaboration, he says that he recently put up a performance in a city school with 220 students.

Ramanathan Iyer, founder of ARTery, says that they started Voice of Tomorrow in 2012 and the first concert series was held in Kalakshetra. ""We make sure that we put the effort to identify promising talents and offer them reputed venues,"" he says. Adding that the youngsters are carefully chosen, he says that sabhas and organisers have a responsibility towards youngsters. ""At present, most sabhas are outsourcing their talent selection. While having an artiste on the selection panel is welcome, outsourcing the artistes through them will pave the way for favouritism. They, for sure, would be having their own agendas, and in that way, the chances are very high that the real talents get sidelined,"" he points out. Stressing on the role sabhas and organisers should play, he says, ""They should go, listen to youngsters' kutcheris, and scout for talent from among promising disciples of artistes. There's no shortcut to it.""

Comparing the concerts of upcoming artistes to league matches in cricket, he says, ""League matches don't have much audience, but it's from those matches that talents are spotted and trained. Similarly, we should encourage youngsters and it's every sabha or organiser's responsibility."" Adding that sabhas should utilise the money they make from celebrity performances for promoting upcoming artistes, he says, ""It has become easy for talented youngsters to make a mark. Social media and online video streaming sites help them showcase their talent to a wide audience. The only flip side is that youngsters should not get carried away by the instant adulation they receive, and instead, work hard to increase their longevity to sustain in the scene."""
