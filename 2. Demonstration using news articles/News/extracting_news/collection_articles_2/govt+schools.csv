(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). With effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions.

The Samagra Shiksha scheme focuses on improvement of quality of education by providing support for different interventions like; in-service training of teachers and schools heads, conduct of achievement surveys at National and State level, provision of textbooks as per Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, ICT and digital initiatives, vocational education, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment has been increased and from this year provisions for library grants and grants for sports and physical education have also been introduced.

The Government has also launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities.

e PATHSHALA: a single point repository of e ­resources containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-­print materials.

The Central Government, supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme namely 'Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat' (PBBB) in foundational years of schooling.

(iii) MHRD, has launched a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform popularly known as SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) on 9 July, 2017. The portal is offering various online courses for school education and higher education. NCERT has been developing course modules for Massive Open and Online Course (MOOCs) for school education system in 12 subject areas (Accountancy, business studies, biology, chemistry, economic, history, geography, mathematics, physics, political science, psychology and sociology) for classes IX-XII. Twelve (12) courses and twenty one (21) courses have been completed in the first cycle and second cycle (completed on 30 Nov. 2018) on SWAYAM platform (https://swayam.gov.in/) respectively. Nearly 22,000 students and 30,000 students were registered in the first cycle and second cycle respectively.

(iv) CIET-NCERT has been assigned the task of developing e-resources for Master of Education (M.Ed.) course jointly with Allahabad University. One course (Educational Administration, Management and Leadership in School Education) has been completed first cycle on SWAYAM platform in which 2115 were enrolled. The second cycle of this course is offered from 2 July 2018.

Besides, an online course on action research for teachers is conducted in regular intervals in the MOODLE platform (http://ictcurriculum.gov.in/ ). Post Graduate Diploma in Guidance and Counselling for in-service teachers is also offered through the same course portal. Several other online courses are developed for inservice teachers professional development and delivered through the portal https://itpd.ncert.org.in/.

(v) A programme for utilization of satellite communication technologies for transmission of educational e-contents through 32 National Channels i.e. SWAYAM PRABHA DTH-TV has been launched. CIET-NCERT is the national coordinator for one DTH TV channel i.e., Kishore Manch (#31) and has started feeding a 24x7 educational TV channel w.e.f. 09 July, 2018. Everyday four hour fresh slot is telecast and repeated six times in 24 hours to provide learning opportunities for the stake holders, as per their convenience. Besides, NIOS is running 5 channels for teachers, for Secondary and Sr. Secondary levels and for sign language.

(vi) MHRD has launched Diksha Portal for providing digital platform to teachers giving them an opportunity to learn and train themselves and connect with teacher community. The portal envisages to help teachers boost their teaching skills and create their own separate profile with their skills and knowledge, and help in improving quality of education with use of latest technologies in education sector.

Chronicle Reporter, Bhopal, In spite of many schemes including 'School Chalen Hum', running in the state, the number of children in government schools is declining year after year. This has been revealed in the report submitted by the school education department in the last assembly session.

In the last three years six lakh children have left the government schools. Chhindwara district tops in the number of dropouts, whereas Satna and Rewa are second and Shivpuri is in third place.

Children enrolled in government schools through school education department are counted through mid-day meal and free textbook distribution. The number of children in the year 2015-16 is 76,23,522, which fell to only 70,20,008 in the year 2017-18.

All the schemes are aimed at luring the children to the government school. Funds of crores are given under 'School Chale Hum' campaign by the Central Government. The entire budget is also being spent every year, but still the number of children is falling in schools.

Either this budget is being spent on paper, or the schemes are not proving to be effective in attracting children. In order to increase enrollment of children in government schools, the government is running schemes like free textbooks, uniforms and bicycles distribution. In this every year bill of crores rupees is wasted."

Narsipur taluk are preparing for the English fest tomorrow

Suneetha and her classmates at Government Higher Primary School at Madrahalli in T. Narsipur taluk of Mysuru district have been reciting English rhymes in the last fortnight as the day to present their newly acquired English talent is fast approaching.

The school in the tiny village has around 101 students and each one has to speak English with their teachers, friends, and students throughout the day on January 1, 2019. While some are memorising simple rhymes, others are practising dance to Shakira's popular number 'Waka waka' (This Time For Africa).

This is a part of the 'English Empowerment Programme Fest' (EEPF) designed to improve knowledge of English among the students of government schools, said S. Mamatha, Deputy Director of Public Instruction, Mysuru district.

On New Year's day, the fest will be conducted in each of the 339 schools in the taluk, entirely in English -- from the prayer and dance, and action songs to the vote of thanks.

The EEPF is an ambitious project of the Education Department and it is being implemented on a pilot basis in all government schools in T. Narsipur taluk.

There are 26,000 students in the 339 government schools in the taluk. ""They are mainly from rural areas and they need a boost to improve their English. Hence, the department has selected T. Narsipur for the EEPF,"" Ms. Mamatha told The Hindu.

S. Swamy, Block Education Officer, said, ""We have already trained the teachers and cluster officer, and conducted meetings with the various teachers' associations. The motive behind the EEPF is to build confidence among the students to communicate in English.""

Though there is no official communication, the programme is being seen as a precursor to the State government's plan to introduce English medium in 1,000 government primary schools across the State.

The Education Department is thinking of extending the 'T. Narsipur model' across the State by training teachers through the Department of State Educational Research and Training (DSERT) and the District Institutes of Education and Training (DIET), another senior officer said."

This apart, the petitioner also wanted the court to set up a district level committee of officials known for their integrity and commitment to cause of student welfare to inspect all government and government-aided schools to ensure adequate toilet facilities are provided along with sanitary workers.

According to the petitioner, his wife Parvathi was working as a science teacher in the school for the past 10 years on consolidated pay. But after the incident came to light and the petitioner sent representations to various authorities seeking action against the management, his wife was terminated without any reason, he said. It was purely to take revenge against him, the petitioner submitted. The management claimed it was the petitioner's wife who made the children clean toilets and that was why she was sacked.

The petitioner further submitted that undeterred by the action of the management he continued to petition the collector to take appropriate action against the correspondent and ensure toilets were cleaning only by sanitary workers.

The act of the school management not only amounted to abuse of children against the Constitution it also meant forced manual scavenging as they were compelled to clean the toilets without any safety gadgets, the petitioner submitted.

It was in 2010 that Delhi's Shri Ram School Maths and Computer Science teacher Sujata Sahu first went on a trip to Ladakh. It was a solo trek, and on the third day, she began to face extreme difficulty breathing and walking. The low oxygen in the altitudes as high as 16,100 feet had given her Pulmonary Edema.

She needed to rest, and with the help of two passing trekkers, she decided to spend the night at a remote village --

""A village which has no road access, is reachable only after a day's walk, and one which boasted of just one home with three occupants. I had neither medicines, nor the ability to call my family, nor access to medical care,"" says 50-year-old Sahu, a resident of Gurugram.

In was in these conditions that she saw two tiny schools which totally changed her life.

The first primary school -- Sku-Kaya -- had five students and two teachers. It had two rooms which were being rebuilt. While one teacher had stayed in the village, the other had gone to Leh to get uniforms and mid-day meal supplies for the school.

The second school had eight children and three teachers. It was two of them who had stopped to help Sahu when she was feeling sick. They had been walking back to Leh for textbooks and uniforms

The children were being taught from English books, which was very alien to them as they had no electricity or TV or telephone connectivity and thus, had no idea what the outside world was like. Having never set foot out of their villages, the exposure level of these children was very low.

.In Ladakh, even the summer months were bitingly cold but that didn't stop the kids from coming to school to learn. ""One of the children even brought his little brother along, who was barely two years old and the love and care with which all the children and the teacher took care of the child was a lesson for me,"" says Sahu.

What really hit her on that fateful Ladakh trip was the sheer drive of the Ladakhi people there to keep growing and improving their circumstances.

""Their determination to come to school and learn, the eagerness of the teacher to learn something new to teach his students, and the aspiration of the parents to educate their children was my inspiration to drop everything and help these amazing people,"" says Sahu.

From a regular school teacher to Ladakh's 'Iron Lady'

""My experience with the schools in Ladakh gave me a path to follow, one that I knew I could contribute to,"" says Sujata Sahu, who had spent 12 years in the corporate world before starting to work with children.

But she had been working at the Shri Ram School for just two years at the time, and leaving this job was the hardest decision she had to make in her life.

""I was planning to take on a seemingly herculean task, in possibly one of the toughest terrains of the world. I had no idea about where I would get the funds from and was also not very clear on how much of an impact I alone could make,"" she says.

Moreover, no one had done something like this before her in Ladakh. But thankfully, she found with herself two strong founding partners -- her husband, Sandeep Sahu, who had been trekking in the region for almost 35 years, and Dawa Jora, a Ladakhi businessman, all of whom had the strong conviction that something like this was really needed for the region.

In 2011, unable to find other NGOs to partner with, the three founders went on a three-day trek to one of the most isolated villages in Lingshed (in Ladakh), carrying 1500 kg of education material on 25 horses, and crossing three mountains at extreme temperatures as low as minus 15 degrees.

The treacherous and steep pass they crossed at an altitude of almost 17000 ft inspired the name of the '17000 ft foundation'.

As she started off on her mission to provide Ladakh schools with the right resources to further the education of their students, she realised this wouldn't be very easy.

""One of our biggest challenges was convincing corporates that even remote areas with extremely scattered and small populations needed support,"" says Sahu.

For the first two years, the foundation worked only with the founders' own funds and kind contributions of friends and family members.

""Though no non-profit organisations were willing to take on Ladakh as a region, we were given support in the form of knowledge, pedagogy and even a large donation of books for our first 100 libraries,"" she says.

Sujata Sahu's undying passion to help the people of Ladakh earned her the nickname of the 'Iron Lady'.

How Ladakh poses a unique set of education problems

India is a geographical anomaly as it has every type of topographical setup, each of which comes with its own challenges. This makes it extremely difficult for the government to cater to every type of problem that can arise in this vast country owing to accessibility issues, extreme weather conditions etc.

Ladakh has almost a 1000 schools across Leh and Kargil, spread across 60,000 sq km of harsh mountains. Catering to a school going population of under 40,000 children, the average school strength of these schools is barely 25 students across the two districts, explains Sahu.

Teachers themselves come from remote villages and have to travel long distances for training, school supplies and even basic administrative functions, leading to long absences and shortage of staff, she adds.

Also, ""While teachers are given basic residential training during winters as well as in-service training, most of the trainings are not contextualized for the uniqueness of the Ladakhi education system,"" she says.

The extreme weather also adds to the problems with schools being shut for severe winters for three months in a year when the roads become inaccessible due to thick snow and temperatures as low as minus 35-40 degrees.

""Incredibly, despite the remoteness of the region, every little hamlet which has even 10 school going children has a tiny government school with teachers in attendance, thanks to the local administration. A little wonder then, that 89% of the schools in Ladakh are govt schools with the private schools present in just a handful of the larger villages,"" she says.

""What is commendable is that all these 900 plus schools are functional and have qualified teachers in attendance. What is even more remarkable is that every child in every village goes to school, managing to at least complete middle school,"" Sahu adds

However, it is only the larger villages which have middle schools and after passing class 5, children have to walk around two hours to get to school to continue their education. Public transport isn't available in such terrain and the army provides army vans for commuting.

.Despite the presence of these govt schools, the community here wants a better life and quality education for their children so they can get better jobs. This aspiration makes them send their very young children, often as young as three years old, to be enrolled in private schools, often extremely far away from their homes.

""Cut off from their villages and parents for months in a year, these children grow up in dormitories, hostels or with other families. Lacking the care and guidance they need in their growing up years, this leads to large-scale dropouts and a population of youth who are unable to go back to their villages,"" Sahu explains.

17000 ft works in these remote villages by improving existing govt schools so that parents would have faith in them and stop sending their children away so far that it disconnects them from their roots.

How voluntourism is helping 17000 ft foundation grow

Sujata Sahu started her non-profit organisation with just the founders and a few volunteers who were given the task to survey the entire length and breadth of Ladakh.

The team mapped around 600 schools after a seven-month-long study. Some of these schools had been bomb shelters during the Kargil war and the buildings had to be shifted multiple times.

The success of the volunteer programmes helped the foundation grow and each of these schools has been geo-mapped for travellers to find.

""We, very early on, piloted our volunteering programmes to involve outsiders in the work of our organization and to also understand if people could be encouraged to donate to such a cause. The enthusiasm and support shown by complete strangers told us that we were on the right track,"" says Sahu.

""Our volunteers, who are our brand ambassadors, then carried the story of our work into their workplaces and CSR then became our main source of funding. Voluntourism, as it is called today, still forms a good 25% of our annual budget and helps us maintain our backend costs,"" she adds.

Why playgrounds are so important in Ladakh schools

Though the govt schools all over Ladakh have proper buildings, they lack the proper facilities that make a school a happy, joyous and welcoming place for children. And in a remote location with rugged ground, a playground comes as a blessing.

""In these remote villages, where nothing is available, there are absolutely no options for children to play with. Though these schools have well-qualified teachers and very low pupil-teacher-ratio, parents often judge the performance of a school based just on the facilities they provide,"" says Sahu.

Thus, parents see the existence of a playground in govt schools as a very good incentive to not send away their kids to far-off private schools.

""Today, 17000 ft foundation has setup playgrounds in 140 schools with colourful swings, slides, see saws etc. many of which the team had to carry over horseback for days to reach our remotest schools,"" she says.

Solving the problem of no native language storybooks in Ladakh

A big aspect of Ladakh education that surprised Sujata Sahu was how the kids learned in English medium schools even though they have no exposure to the foreign language. Their native language was Bhoti.

""To add to this burden, children also have to study their local language as well an additional Hindi/Urdu from grade 1,"" says Sahu.

To enable the children to read better and get comfortable with the number of languages they have to deal with, 17000 ft set up libraries in 230 schools with simple and easy to read story books in English, Hindi and Urdu.

""However, sadly, there are absolutely no story books in Bhoti for children to read. Sensing this gap, we undertook a mission to translate storybooks from English to Bhoti.""

""In 2015, we launched our first phase where we translated 21 titles and published 21,000 storybooks for distribution into 300 schools,"" says Sahu.

This year again, the organisation not only translated another 20 titles, but also added illustrations and changed narratives to make them more relatable to the children of Ladakh.

What has 17000 ft foundation achieved so far?

In the span of just six years, Sujata Sahu's organisation has accomplished much.

""Today, 17000 ft works with 250 govt schools across Leh and Kargil and we are already seeing a reverse trend of children coming back from private schools back to the govt schools in their villages,"" says Sahu.

The organisation has set up libraries in 230 schools, playgrounds in 140 schools, and trained over 1500 teachers in various methodologies with a team which is in Ladakh every winter for training teachers.

17000 ft foundation has conducted multiple community workshops in 125 villages with over 10,000 villagers contributing to our workshops and programmes in the schools.

Recently, the organisation electrified and digitized 120 schools in Leh and Kargil, providing solar electricity and tablets with customized digital learning content, a TV, and a server to provide offline data syncing.

The DigiLab project is the non-profit's most ambitious programme bringing offline hybrid digital learning solutions to the remote villages.

The well-furnished digital labs supported by workshops from the team throughout the year can help the students learn independently with guidance from their teachers.

How crowfunding is helping 17000 ft foundation

Crowdfunding is increasingly coming up as a very important resource collection measure.

""17000 ft has been involved with ImpactGuru.com in multiple projects, the latest being the funding of a Playground for a very remote school in Kargil. We had also fundraised for our Bhoti Book Translation project through ImpactGuru.com and managed to raise more than we needed,"" says Sahu.

Fundraising platforms are great for helping nonprofits fund small projects that have tangible goals and timelines. It is an excellent way to help get the word out to potential supporters and garner more support for the non-profit, says the Iron Lady of Ladakh.

Future of 17000 ft foundation

Before 17000 ft was established, there was little or no attention on the remote schools of Ladakh, and today with all our work and efforts and the participation of the local communities, govt schools are looking and performing better and we are seeing a reverse trend of children coming back to their villages and govt schools.

""When we started, one of our biggest challenges was encouraging donors, volunteers, foundations and even corporates to focus on remote regions of Ladakh. Today, however, we are confident that our model is working and we can get the support we need,"" beams Sahu.

Sujata Sahu now wants to take this model to other remote and mountainous regions, like Arunachal Pradesh, or the remote areas of Himachal.

""We feel that we are closer now to our vision of a better life and education for all children, regardless of geography or terrain,"" she says.

These days, Sagar Singh frets about the academic future of his daughter who studies at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Delhi's Cantonment area.

""There are hardly any teachers there. She often tells me that kids sit clueless as teachers are forced to teach subjects they themselves don't understand well. I wonder if she will remain underprepared for challenges ahead in life, he said.

Singh sums up the crisis in Delhi government schools which have only 35,034 regular teachers against a sanctioned strength of 64,096. A shortage of 29,062 regular hands (45.34 per cent) has left the teachers exhausted and students vulnerable. A total of 15,04,627 students are enrolled in 1,024 schools run by the AAP government.

There are 22,016 guest teachers that take the existing number to 57,050 but they work on daily-wage contracts that must be renewed every year. Even if guest teachers are factored in, Delhi government schools are short of 7,046 (10.99 per cent) teaching hands.

Saroj Sharma, a primary teacher at a Greater Kailash school said, On several occasions, I have had to teach higher-secondary class subjects. We are overworked and stressed. We are filling in for many others. School heads are aware of the crisis, but nothing has been done.

Neeru Loriya, a teacher coordinator at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in RK Puram Sector 4, also said that several subjects are not being taught properly. Barkha Kumari, a Class VI student at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Rohini said, My Class has 50 students. We need more teachers to ensure we're taught well. It's not that the government isn't working at all. After the Aam Aadmi Party came to power in Delhi in 2014, the government has built 48 schools.

But where are the teachers? We have sent several reminders to the government. Nothing has happened, said a teacher at a Pusa Road school. Most regular posts are filled through promotions. But they have not happened since 2013, he said.

Sanjay Goel, head of the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) told Mail Today, We're aware of the problem. Each year, guest teachers are being enrolled to minimise the shortage. Avdhesh Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, also said, There is a problem. But the government is hiring guest teachers to tackle it.

But facts tell a different tale. In July, the Delhi government had announced that schools would get 9,000 guest teachers by mid-August. It did not happen. Hiring guest teachers is anyway no solution to this huge crisis, said Ajay Veer Singh, general secretary of the last Government School Teachers' Association (GSTA) elected in 2014. GSTA elections have not taken place since 2014.

So its demands have not been heard effectively, its office-bearers claim. We have asked for elections. But education department officials have not paid any heed. The future of government school teachers is dark, said Singh. GSTA has a three-year term.

He also described Kashmere Gate as an ""incubation centre"" for universities, saying it is a coincidence that several varsities, which were based in the area, are now moving to bigger campuses.

""We had launched the 'happiness curriculum' in government schools. Now we will launch the entrepreneurship curriculum from the next session onwards for secondary and senior secondary students.

""We need to instill confidence among our children in school right from the beginning of secondary education that after completing their education, they should aspire to be job givers and not job seekers,"" Sisodia said.

He explained that after at least 15 years of formal education, if a large number of the youth are not confident of creating something new, which can give them gainful return and add value to the economy, then as a society ""we are failing to nurture their full potential"".

Sisodia said, barring a few exceptions, once a child completes elementary schooling and joins the secondary classes, his entire orientation, which is largely shaped by the teachers and parents, is to secure good marks in exams, get admission in a good college and get a job with decent pay package.

This is considered a trajectory of success and anyone who either secures less marks or fails to join college or fails to secure a job is deemed as unsuccessful, he said.

""This trajectory is obsolete in today's day and age when new ideas and technologies are driving our way of life.

While the teachers welcome the innovation wholeheartedly as it does magic in schools, experts opine that video lessons could be used only in addition to classroom learning.

Initially, the department had embedded QR code in the textbooks for classes I, VI, IX and XI - syllabus was revamped in this academic year - and each lesson had at least three QR codes which upon scanning would take you to video lessons of that lesson, explained an official from the department who is involved in the process.

The department also has a YouTube channel with 1.18 lakh subscribers and is planning to launch a 24-hour free satellite education channel, said the official.

""The basic idea is to evoke interest among the students and to make them attend classes regularly. Also, concepts which are considered as difficult by the students, were made into videos to unwrap its complexity,"" the official added.

The video lessons in turn has done magic in the schools as most of the students who were difficult to find in classrooms, were not just found on regular basis, but also noticed paying keen attention to the lessons, said a government schoolteacher on condition of anonymity.

A teacher, who teachers Mathematics, said most of the problems which, in general, students would struggle to understand were solved, within matter of time as the videos explain it with pictorial representations and sound effects.

""Teaching the students to pronounce difficult words has become a fun task now for both students and teachers. But, the only issue that we face is that videos were created only for a few concepts and not for entire lessons,"" T Arulanantham of Tamil Nadu high and higher secondary teachers' association said.

With videos, students can listen to it numerous times until they clearly understand it, while a teacher would not be able to spare much time to explain same doubts during the class hours as they would have to move on to next chapter, he added.

""The video lessons would definitely be useful in understanding difficult concepts, but it should not replace the textbooks completely.

The model school initiative at GLPS Ravindranagar has been supported by Shyamala Prabhu and Kavita Shastry from the Institute of Indian Interior Designers and organisations such as Let's Endorse, Smile Charitable Trust, and The Aravani Art Project.

In a special interaction with Deccan Chronicle, Yaduveer said that infrastructural development of government schools was essential to help students benefit better from the system. Excerpts:

Experts point out offering better opportunities for students in government schools as well keeping the system of public education alive. How can this be done?

Going forward from initiatives like the School and Student Transformation model put forth by TAPF, encouraging children to grow up in a sustainable environment and ensuring they get access to experiential learning platforms is important. A transformation towards getting better in all ways - in terms of education, infrastructure and advanced learning prospects is essential for government schools to be more appealing to students and parents.

Do you believe beginning English medium classes or schools in the public education sector would improve government school enrolments and thereby quality of education offered as well?

Merely changing the medium to English would not improve the system at a larger scale. Even though learning English would help students get recognised as a global citizen, one cannot neglect the local language and culture and hence learning in Kannada is equally important. Knowledge in more languages right from the formative years is always good as it helps better brain development. However, a system to offer both Kannada and English mediums and either of them as a second language should be in place. The final call should be left open to each student/parent catering to their individual needs.

That will be a matter of practicality and we'll take a call depending on what is right for him at that point of time. He's just one year old now. I've seen several government schools that are very good and way better than their private counterparts with an enabled and progressive outlook. Good things take time and hopefully with such initiatives, government schools will retain its past glory. To be very honest, we haven't given this much thought as to how we should have already."

The biggest challenge was to make education interesting for them.

He started using his mobile phone and tablet to teach students rhymes and realised that their interest levels increased sharply. Seeing Ravi's performance, a local MLA supported him with cash prize of Rs 1 lakh which he used to buy a projector and speakers etc.

Seeing its performance, the state government rewarded the school with a cash prize of ₹ 1.2 lakh in 2015-16. ""I used the money to buy audio video gadgets and transformed the school into a smart class. I started using the audio-visual mode of communication to teach other subjects as well. The attendance began improving. Now there are 325 students in the school. Today, the students don't want to miss any class,"" he said.

This is not the lone example.

Alpa Nigam, headmaster of a school in Gorakhpur, said when she joined in 2010, very few students were enrolled and most of them ran away after lunch time. To catch their interest, Alpa too started using a mobile phone and speakers.

Impressed with her dedication, Rotary Club and other well-wishers donated a projector, which is being used to screen educational movies for students. Now the school has three laptops and learning is fun here.

Sushil Singh, principal of primary school Gulriha in Harak block of Barabanki district said, ""We had received ₹1.2 lakh from the state government as part of an excellence award. We used the prize money to buy a projector, speakers and an inverter and started smart classes. The results have been encouraging. We hope other schools will follow our model instead of waiting for government assistance.""

The number of government schools in Uttar Pradesh running smart classes had been slowly but steadily growing, said a basic education department official. He said this was largely due to efforts of individual teachers who were seeking help from good Samaritans or opting for crowd funding to arrange the money needed to digitize the teaching process.

At a time when the state government is still to make any budgetary provision for running smart classes in schools, these teachers are doing their best to equip their institutions with the latest technologies and compete with private institutions mushrooming in small districts.

Now the basic education department is preparing a database of all such schools.

""The findings, so far, have come as a surprise. Nearly 1,200 schools (out of the total 1.54 lakh in the state) are running smart classes,"" said director, basic education, Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh. He said it was equally surprising that the state capital was yet to catch up with other districts in this respect.

He said that most of these institutions were concentrated in far off districts like Gorakhpur or smaller ones such as Hardoi and Sitapur.

""Gorakhpur has the maximum number (124) of smart class schools. Hardoi is a close second with 122 schools, and Sitapur is next with 120. Some of the other districts with such schools are Azamgarh (33), Mau (28), Muzaffarnagar (20), Bulandshahr (18), Lalitpur (17), Kaushambhi (15) and Jaunpur (10),"" he said.

Singh said that by integrating technology with education, these schools had transformed the teaching-learning process, making it far more interesting.

""It has helped a lot in increasing student retention. For instance, now a science teacher doesn't just talk about blood circulation but actually shows the students how blood is circulated in the body via arteries and veins,"" he said.

The official said that soon these teachers would be invited to the state capital where they would interact with other government school teachers, inspiring them to generate resources to make their respective schools more appealing for students.

""Some of the teachers who have done good work will also be felicitated,"" Singh said."

Also, the education department is planning to extend the Government Model Primary School (GMPS) in Sector 49 to middle level (till class VIII). This was stated by the officials from the education department in its preliminary plan as final decision will be taken only after conducting a proper survey of these schools and the nearby schools after the re-transfer process is done.

The eight primary schools being re-transferred are- GPS -12, GPS - Bapudham Colony, GPS- Buterla, GPS- Mauli Complex, GPS- Railway Colony, GPS- Manimajra - I, GPS- Manimajra - II, and GMPS - 49 (the newest among all schools).

""There are the schools which do not have good infrastructure and have less number of students, so we will be adjusting students in nearby schools. Also, the schools which are large in spaces will be further upgraded,"" said an official from the UT education department requesting anonymity.

The shifting, as per teachers may prove to be an unsuccessful task as the schools, especially in Mauli complex, railway colony and Manimajra are already overcrowded.

The schools that will get prior attention from the education department include Government Primary School in Maulijagran, Government Primary School in railway colony and Manimajra-II as these are running in worst conditions of all. GPS in Mauli and railway colony are not even having their own buildings and are being run in rented buildings.

In a reality check, the TOI had reported how these three schools had poor infrastructure as they are so small that they cannot even afford to have furniture in classrooms and accommodate students.

The department is also planning to close Government Primary School in Buterla, Sector 41 due to low enrollment of students. ""The building can be put to some other good use. There is no point in running a separate school for a few students,"" the official added.

The school has 130 students at present studying in nursery class and classes I-V.

These schools further lack basic facilities like playgrounds and teachers have to be on toes to ensure students don't get injured as few swings that lie in the corner of small yards. Thus, making it unsafe for students. In some schools situated in Mauli complex and railway colony, they utilize the adjoining neighbourhood park as they don't have their own playgrounds. This, however, raises security concerns for children, as the park is also used by people and vendors.

GMPS will further be upgraded to middle level. Moreover, the school's building needs attention too. The other seven government primary schools have been running under the MC Chandigarh since 2010."

The computer professionals said they joined the schools in June 2018, but were paid a month's salary only in November this year, a day before Diwali. The assistants claim their complaints to CM, deputy CM (who also holds the charge of the education department) and public grievance cell have failed to provide them a relief.

The assistants said they were hired by Intelligent Communication Systems India Limited (ICSIL) and sent to Delhi government's DoE, which, in turn, deployed them in various government schools.

""When we did not get our salary for three months, the company that hired us told us to contact the DoE. When we talked to the education department officials, they said paying salaries was the responsibility of the company that outsourced the manpower. We have only been shuttling between the two offices,"" said an IT Assistant, requesting anonymity.

The job responsibility of the assistants include managing the attendance of students and teachers, monitoring the e-mails, orders and circulars coming from the DoE and sharing them with the head of the school.

The education department had initially hired 1,068 IT Assistants and later advertised for another 670 more computer professionals for schools that have more than 1,200 students and thus have more work load. While the 1,068 IT Assistants, hired for two years, have been getting their salaries regularly, the 670 have not been paid.

""Despite being working hard all these months, sometimes on Sundays and holidays as well, our salaries have not been released.

Chatting about the upcoming examination and reciting multiplication tables, they are getting ready for another day at the Government Senior Secondary School here.

From the outside, there's nothing extraordinary about the scene but as you enter, a pleasant surprise awaits.

Neatly furnished classrooms, a library and lab form part of an encouraging attempt to give these children quality education infrastructure, all thanks to an experiment by Brahm Prakash Shastri, a former principal of the school.

By bypassing administrative procedures and seeking help directly from NGOs, and tapping various corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, Shastri's endeavours have ended up benefiting teachers as well as some 20 government schools in the district. And it's the power of community, he believes, which has helped turn his simple idea into gold, in the space of four years.

As a rule, to channel CSR funds, corporates and NGOs must approach the education department but this is a process that can, and often does, take a long time. ""And all the donations don't necessarily reach us,"" admits Shastri, who eventually sought the assistance of the big companies, with due approval from the education department. Now, the govt school in Basai has an impressive science and computer lab, an RO water purifier for clean drinking water, refurbished toilets, a diesel genset and split air-conditioners, besides well-furnished classes and staff rooms. Behind all this is teamwork.

Villagers, for example, have contributed by whitewashing the walls. ""Several local NGOs approached us for basic things, like installing RO and donating books. We then asked the companies to invest directly and they have helped (with) the entrance, walking tracks and boundary walls,"" Shastri adds.

According to a notification under Section 135 of The Companies Act 2013, it is compulsory for companies with a net worth of Rs 500 crore or more, turnover of Rs 1,000 crore or more, or net profit of Rs 5 crore or more, in any given financial year, to spend two percent of their net profit on CSR programmes.

And following the successful Basai model, government schools in Carterpuri, Jacobpura, Tikri, Shakurpur, Bhondsi and Tikli (and one in Sarsa, Bhiwani), have undergone renovation. The Tikri school, TOI found, is getting a new washroom for boys, girls and handicapped children (courtesy a North American real estate firm). Tulsiram, the principal here, happily acknowledges the transformation. ""Our school was initially in a very bad condition - there was no sewer connection and the boundary wall was in a dilapidated state,"" he recalls, sitting in his office-cum-staff room. ""We are not aware of the expenditure, but this CSR activity has brought a positive change in the school.""

Indeed, in two years, CSR funds have ensured that the Tikri govt school is not lacking when it comes to the bare essentials, among them a water tank, utensils for midday meals, a level playground and washrooms.

Dinesh Shastri, the district education officer, has visited 20 such schools across the state and claims that facilities are on a par with those in private schools. ""The drop-out rate has come down heavily too,"" he says.

However, for all the progress in infrastructure development, there are still more than 30,000 vacancies for teachers in the state. The data report card of the District Information System for Education (U-DISE) corroborates this fact, pointing out the acute shortage of teachers and principals in Haryana.

Still, with over 540 government schools in the district, there is no dearth of corporate majors who are prepared to come forward and do their bit towards make the learning ecosystem more welcoming and fun for children."

Meanwhile with the government announcing winter vacations, students of these government schools were in a dilemma as they have not received their textbooks yet from the school authorities.

The annual examinations in government primary and middle schools culminated last month but the promoted students have not been provided with various textbooks by School Education Department (SED).

The teachers in various government-run-schools said that there is a non-availability of mathematics, history and geography books for the 9th standard and mathematics, Science in 10th standard also.

The teachers also said that the students from 5th to 8th standard are also without mathematics, history and civics textbooks.

Official sources in SED said that the Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education (JKBOSE) was probably supposed to order 50 lakh textbooks but this year the department ordered these books late.

""However the board have received some of the books but few books are yet to be received and the School Education Department,"" he said.

""SED has given a deadline to the JKBOSE for availing the pending books of various classes till December 05, sources said adding, ""The school authorities have been also asked to distribute the pending books on 15th of December to all respective students.""

He said that the JKBOSE was also directed to provide books and stationery to the school authorities of Ladakh district first because of the road closure issues.

Chairman, JKBOSE, Veena Pandita said, ""We have science books available but mathematics and Urdu books are pending for two classes."" ""Actually the trucks carrying the books are stuck somewhere in the highway. But in coming two days we are hopeful, we will receive these books too,"" she assured. She said that for the rest of the classes there was no shortage or non-availability of any book.

For most part of the 14 years of his life, Priyanshu Singh, a class 9 student of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Yamuna Vihar, had no clue why his female friends complain about mood swings and abdominal pain for a day or two every month. Whenever the girls declined to participate in sports activities, he would mock and even crack jokes at their expense.

But all of that changed this September.

That was when Singh understood that it happens when the girls are either going through premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or on their monthly period cycle. ""While I knew what periods are, I was unaware about the difficulties women face when they are on their natural cycle. I used to laugh at my friends when they would complain about stomachache and mood swings. Now, I understand that mood swings are because of the PMS and it's normal to have stomach pain while they are on their periods,"" he said.

The change in mindset and the awareness was only possible because the school organised a workshop on 'menstrual awareness' in collaboration with non-governmental organisation (NGO) Sachhi Saheli. ""It was overwhelming to see the students, especially boys, asking menstruation-related queries with so much confidence. At the end of the workshop, the boys distributed packets of sanitary napkins among girls without any hesitation and pledged to make the campus period-friendly,"" RP Singh, principal of the school, said.

Now, the school is planning to organise a workshop for parents as well. ""Most of these students come from families where such discussions are prohibited. We are planning to organise a workshop for parents to sensitise them and encourage them to discuss these topics with their children,"" he said.

But their school is not an exception.

As many as 30 co-educational government schools have approached the NGO this year to organise workshops in order to sensitise students about menstruation. Till July this year, the NGO was conducting these workshops only in all girls' schools. ""We wanted to impart basic education about menstruation to students studying in government schools. We had contacted the Directorate of Education (DoE) last year and briefed them about our plan. The DoE gave us permission to conduct these workshops in girls' schools running under the Delhi government and the civic bodies. But, this year we started receiving requests from co-ed schools as well. We have already covered around 10 co-ed schools in the last four months and it has turned out to be a wonderful experience,"" said Dr Surbhi Singh, a gynecologist and founder of Sachhi Saheli.

During the workshops, the students are told about the science behind menstruation and the myths surrounding it. The girls are also taught basic hygiene that should be maintained during periods. ""We do not discuss about menstruation with boys at home or school and still expect them to be sensitive and supportive. It's very important to remove stigmas and taboos attached to periods from their minds. That's why we show them sanitary napkins and explain the importance of their use. We also tell boys about the physical and mental strains girls go though during their menstrual cycle,"" Singh said.

At another co-ed school in Nanakpura, a class 10 student Sagar Malik said he gifted his mother a pack of sanitary pads after attending the workshop. ""I had come to know about the issues women face in case they use cloth instead of sanitary pads during their periods. I requested the teacher in charge at my school to give a packet for my mother because I did not know what she uses. I have never heard anything about menstruation at home. When I gave her the packet, she looked shocked. But when I told her what I had learnt at school, she looked happy and relieved. She even called me a Padman,"" the 14-year-old said.

Meanwhile, a group of boys at a government co-ed school in Vasant Kunj has pledged to educate people in their localities about ""menstrual health"". ""We have decided to go from door to door in our localities and tell people the importance of maintaining hygiene during periods to avoid infections,"" said Lalit Singh, one of the students.

Girls, too, are happy with the change.

Divya Singh, a class 9 student at a school in Janakpuri, said she used to bring a 'black polythene bag' to carry the packet of sanitary napkins the school distributes under the Centre's Kishori Shakti Yojna. The girls in her school would collect their packets from the medical room after classes got over. Under the Kishori Shakti Yojna, girl students, between the ages of 11 and 18, are distributed a sanitary napkin packet every month in government schools across the country.

However, Singh and her classmates have now asked the teacher to distribute the pack of sanitary napkins in the classrooms. ""We had never uttered the word period in the presence of our male classmates before. It was the first time when a group, having more boys than girls, was sitting and discussing the myths and taboos attached to menstruation. Things have comparatively changed. Now, we do not have to think hundred times before talking about periods in school at least like we have to do at home,"" she said.

According to a survey published in Journal of Family and Community Medicine (JFCM) in September, 40% girls remained absent from school during their menstruation for reasons such as lack of privacy at school, source of information on menstruation and anxiety about leakage, and staining of their uniform. The survey was conducted on 600 girls studying in government schools in Delhi.

Experts say it's important to impart basic knowledge about menstruation at schools. ""It's important to make both make both genders aware of the science behind menstruation. While for girls, good menstrual hygiene can help prevent any kind of pelvic inflammatory diseases and infections, such talk sessions are equally important for boys to remove all the taboos and preconceived notions about periods. They should understand that it's a part of a girls' life and absolutely normal,"" said Dr Anuradha Kapur, a senior gynecologist at Max hospital in Saket.

Sanjay Goel, director of the DoE, said the government will encourage more co-ed schools to come forward and organise such workshops."

The review of mid-term results at 1,100 government schools threw up worrying trends. In class IX, on average, 80% of the students failed; this number was slightly lower at 70% for class X. However, in classes XI and XII, the average pass percentage was 50%. In total, there were 34 schools in classes XII (science, commerce, arts and vocational stream), XI (science, commerce, arts), IX and VIII, which had zero pass percentage.

According to a circular issued by education officer of zone 10 of Northwest district, a notice has already been sent to a school where the pass percentage was below 40%. A copy of the notice is with TOI. ""The results of mid-term examination of this school is less than 40%, which is very poor and below norms.

Similar circulars have been sent to schools in other districts too. Unlike last year, when showcause notices were issued to individual subject teachers, this time, schools are being held accountable. The principal of a school in outer Delhi attributed the poor results to non-availability of teachers in certain subjects and also due to lengthy absenteeism among students. ""We will mention these reasons to DoE and have already put in a request for subject teachers,"" the principal said on condition of anonymity.

As a part of corrective measures, DoE has conducted sample re-evaluation of mid-term answerscripts where it randomly picked schools for the exercise. The re-evaluation was conducted by ""mentor teachers"" who then submitted their report to DoE.

When Shobha Suryanarayan, a volunteer with Acharyas for a Better Community (ABC), first approached Vijayanagar Lower Primary School in Whitefield, the students could barely string together a sentence in English. The school had over 50 children from classes 1 to 5, but there was only one teacher and a headmistress (HM) to teach all of them. Children in classes 1, 2 and 3 would sit together; they were taught by the HM once she finished her official work. Children in classes 4 and 5 would sit together, and were taught by the other teacher, says Shobha.

ABC, an NGO based in Bengaluru, is driven by volunteers who go to teach in government schools. They also get CSR funding to meet each school's individual requirements.

At Vijayanagar school, the teachers asked ABC to take over English classes. In last November, ABC appointed a full-time teacher in the school, whose salary is paid with CSR funds. Within just three months, there was a huge difference, says Shobha. ""The students spoke in English, and even performed a skit in English. When I first had gone in, they had no idea about sentence structure,"" she says. ABC also appointed a janitor since students themselves used to clean the school, including its toilets, up till then.

ABC is also refurbishing the school, and setting up a peer lab and library there, with CSR funds. ""We have built a dining area and washing area for the kids. The ground has been levelled and cleaned up so that children have a safe place to play. We also raised the compound wall and put up barbed fencing to prevent anti-social activities that used to be common in the school premises at night,"" says Shobha. CSR funds also cover students' breakfast, which has resulted in both higher attendance rates and better attention span among students. Overall ABC has got Rs 40 lakhs as CSR funds for Vijayanagar School.

In Pattandur Agrahara School behind ITPL, the student enrolment went up from less than 10, to 96 now. The school which was in threat of being shut down, was rebuilt by ABC. ABC's volunteers also teach in the school. The school's transformation has most benefited children from the migrant construction labourer community who live nearby. Similar was the case with Nallurhalli Government Primary School.

ABC is one among the many volunteer-driven initiatives in the city that's changing government schools, one at a time. In addition to registered trusts like ABC, there are also informal volunteering groups, like one led by Anupama Harish in Malleswaram.

The shortage of competent teachers in government schools, lack of functional infrastructure, and difficult familial circumstances are causing many students to perform poorly in schools or to drop out altogether. Many low-income families also spend a large part of their income to send their children to private schools, in hope of better education, especially in English. However, studies show that low-income private schools are hardly any better than government schools in terms of learning outcomes. It's in this scenario that volunteer interventions are strengthening the public school system in Bengaluru.

Many volunteering organisations start off without much of a plan.

Malleswaram volunteers had come together when local resident Anupama Harish proposed her idea of volunteering in the 'Malleswaram & Suttha Muttha' Facebook group. Of nearly 12,000 members in the group then, many responded. Since 2015-16, Anupama's team has been teaching Mathematics in the Malleswaram 18th Cross Boys' High School.

The group has three volunteer-teachers for Maths each in 8th, 9th and 10th standards. Each teacher picks a favourite topic in Maths to teach - algebra, geometry etc. At any time, the group has 10-15 volunteers.

The school initially asked Anupama to get the permission of the Block Education Officer (BEO). The BEO was happy to have volunteer-teachers since the school had teacher shortage, especially in Maths. Maths was also the subject in which majority of the 10th standard students had failed in the previous year, in board exams.

After discussions with the school's head teacher, the group got a timetable. From this year, they have also been teaching Social Studies here. The team has developed a structured syllabus. They also update their progress in a common document so that there is no overlap in what's taught.

Having a structured syllabus is important since volunteers may otherwise teach random topics, concurs Jayashree Narayanan, who was a teacher-volunteer with the NGO OBLF (One Billion Literates Foundation). Jayashree, by her own initiative, had approached Kaikondrahalli Government School a few years back, interested in being a volunteer-teacher. She then became part of OBLF, which signed MoUs with the schools to allow its volunteer-teachers there.

Jayashree then found interested volunteers through her personal networks. OBLF volunteers have worked with five schools in Sarjapur Road area so far, but the volunteering has been stalled for this year because of the lack of committed volunteers. Jayashree plans to resume the programme next year.

OBLF volunteers start off the academic year by assessing students on spoken and written English. ""So we know where the kids stand, and we teach them from that level. We give another assessment at the end of the year to see how far the kids have progressed,"" says Jayashree. The team gets only a one-hour slot in a day. Usually there are two volunteers teaching English in each grade - one teachers three hours and the other two hours per week, so that there is continuity. Jayashree says schools have been open to them since they come from a registered NGO, with proper permissions.

ABC had started informally in 2016, as a group of 10-15 people. They initially had difficulty getting CSR funds, but this changed with their success in Pattandur Agrahara School. In late 2017, ABC registered as a Trust since corporates would fund only formal entities. Currently the NGO is a loosely structured organisation with a CSR group, operations group, social media group etc, all driven by volunteers. The organisation has about 50 volunteers in the city, and has worked with around 20 schools so far.

ABC starts engaging with a school by holding sports or art events, or by donating school bags etc to the students. During events, the team identifies the requirements of the school by talking to teachers and students. ""When we hold an event, they understand that we are serious. We list down requirements and create a proper project for the school,"" says Vikas Chandra, co-founder of ABC.

The requirements are put up on ABC's Facebook page, where people interested in volunteering or donating respond. The NGO also approaches corporates for CSR funds to do building repairs, set up new infrastructure, appoint teachers, distribute bags to students etc. It takes a good deal of time and effort to get CSR funds approved, says Chandra.

Volunteers say that working with high school or PUC students is more difficult as they often lack basic knowledge in subjects. Brijesh of the Malleswaram group says teaching 10th standard students was an uphill task. ""They didn't even know basic maths such as addition and subtraction. But we made sure that students who would come to 10th standard from 8th and 9th standards would get the basics right,"" he says.

Working with primary school students is more fruitful than working with high school or PUC students, opine volunteers. Younger children are more receptive to learning, and can get a good foundation at the appropriate age, they say. ""We want to enter the primary school sector now. If we strengthen the basics of primary school children, teaching high school students will become easier for our own volunteers,"" says Anupama.

Many students also come from very unstable backgrounds, such as abusive/alcoholic fathers, along with socio-economic backwardness or migrant nature of parents jobs. They need to be motivated to study, say volunteers. Schools get very little amounts for annual maintenance, and hence lack essential stationery materials and staff. In some schools, toilets are locked up or students are made to clean those due to the lack of cleaning staff. ""In a class of 30-40 students, only 10-15 would really want to learn. The other children don't even want to come to school,"" says Jayashree.

Coordinating between volunteers and schools is a challenge for volunteering organisations. Volunteers come from varying backgrounds, but most are homemakers or working professionals. While homemakers are available to volunteer on weekdays, coordinating with professionals on their time slots at the school can be a challenge. Negotiating with the school to get good time slots for teaching, having the school not cancel a time slot randomly, and having committed volunteers who go to the school regularly, are all challenges. Most volunteer organisations ask its members to commit to teaching in a school for at least a year.

The volunteering system acts as a self-sustaining system, where the interested, committed volunteers stay on their own. Volunteering groups say that most volunteers who stay on are well-qualified and passionate about teaching.

However, finding committed volunteers who are fluent in both English and Kannada has been difficult in Sarjapur Road area, says Jayashree. ""Many volunteers, once they start teaching, realise that not knowing Kannada is a barrier in reaching out to primary school children, since these children are very young.""

Some volunteers at ABC circumvented this problem by taking a six-month course in Kannada to learn the basics. ""This leads to a reverse teaching process in the class. Students love that they can teach Kannada to volunteers,"" says Shobha. Sometimes, if a student in the class knows Hindi, the child will act as a translator between the Hindi-speaking volunteer and other students.

Gaining entry into a school in the first place can be difficult as well. ""We struggle with regulatory challenges - BEO permissions, HMs not wanting to cooperate etc. For teachers, it is judgement on their work when we go in. So there is a lot of resistance. Sometimes we bulldoze our way through. But sometimes we find very cooperative and committed teachers,"" says Shobha. However, once the volunteers bring about good results, schools are only too happy to have them continue, say volunteers.

While volunteers pitching in with teaching, infrastructure support and funds is impactful for that specific school, it is not an institutionalised solution, and hard to sustain in the long run. Systemic changes to the education system need more thought out interventions and reforms, which we shall explore in subsequent stories."

Town dwellers informed Rising Kashmir that barring two higher secondary schools, all government schools in Shopian town have been operating from rented building sans infrastructure since their establishment decades ago.

They added that around a dozen schools were established in the town by school education department in past eight decades but failed to construct buildings for them.

""The schools were housed in rented buildings which lack basic facilities including lavotaries, bathrooms and playgrounds,"" said a town dweller, Mohamed Amen, adding that it resulted government schools failing to attract students.

The schools which as per official records became defunct include;

Boys Middle School Shopian, Girls Primary School Hergam , Girls Primary School Shopian, Primary School Hergam, Primary School Bongam, Middle School Sheikh Mohalla Bongam, Primary School Batpora, Primary School Alyalpora and Primary SchoolKannipora.

The other schools have similar stories of being operating from a building of Handicrafts department or Panchayat house, the residents said.

The poor infrastructure has made parents in Shopian town, which couldn't afford private schooling , to send their wards to other government schools in neighboring villages like Arhama.

The residents demanded construction of a model school in Shopian town on patterns of central high school Pulwama on a patch of land lying vacant behind old bus stand.

""The space is more than sufficient for constructing a model school with all facilities for students coming economically weak sections of society,"" the residents said.

Chief Education Officer Shopian, Mohamed Sadiq said that in Shopian district around 140 schools were operating from rented buildings. ""The number came down to 10,"" he said, adding that they couldn't construct buildings for these schools because there is paucity of land in the town.

A plea has been filed in the Supreme Court alleging that the Uttar Pradesh government has failed to implement the 2015 order of the Allahabad High Court asking it to ensure that public servants, including top bureaucrats, send wards to state-run primary schools.

The appeal has challenged the Allahabad High Court's recent order refusing to initiate contempt proceedings against the state government for not complying with the earlier judgement that had directed that kids of government servants, local bodies' representatives, judicial officers, who receive perks and salary from the state exchequer, should study in schools run by the Uttar Pradesh Board.

The plea, filed by advocate Shiv Kumar Tripathi, said non-implementation of the high court's directions was affecting the interest of the children as the primary schools run by the Basic Education Board of Uttar Pradesh were the victims of ""mal-administration and rampant corruption"".

""The interest of the common man is suffering for non-implementation of the said judgment as the administration of these schools is being seriously affected and mal-administered due to lack of adequate attention being paid by the bureaucrats and political functionaries,"" the plea said.

It further said that three years have elapsed since the high court's judgement, thereby causing serious loss of funds which should have accrued for development of these schools.

The plea claimed that the state government had also failed to submit the requisite compliance report despite the lapse of three years and there was no valid reason for it.

A plea has been filed in the Supreme Court alleging that the Uttar Pradesh government has failed to implement the 2015 order of the Allahabad High Court asking it to ensure that public servants, including top bureaucrats, send wards to state-run primary schools.

The appeal has challenged the Allahabad High Court's recent order refusing to initiate contempt proceedings against the state government for not complying with the earlier judgement that had directed that kids of government servants, local bodies' representatives, judicial officers, who receive perks and salary from the state exchequer, should study in schools run by the Uttar Pradesh Board.

The plea, filed by advocate Shiv Kumar Tripathi, said non-implementation of the high court's directions was affecting the interest of the children as the primary schools run by the Basic Education Board of Uttar Pradesh were the victims of ""mal-administration and rampant corruption"".

""The interest of the common man is suffering for non-implementation of the said judgment as the administration of these schools is being seriously affected and mal-administered due to lack of adequate attention being paid by the bureaucrats and political functionaries,"" the plea said.

It further said that three years have elapsed since the high court's judgement, thereby causing serious loss of funds which should have accrued for development of these schools.

The plea claimed that the state government had also failed to submit the requisite compliance report despite the lapse of three years and there was no valid reason for it.

It also sought directions to the state government, as per the high court's orders, for making a provision of awarding punishment of depositing an amount of fees equal to what they are paying for their children's education in private schools.

The Punjab education department has directed all government schools to use powdered milk (dry milk) to prepare kheer, which is served once a week as part of the mid-day meal menu to children. The powdered milk will be supplied to schools by government-run cooperative MILKFED (which runs VERKA milk plants across the state).

As per the notification issued, schools are required to use seven grams of milk powder per child for making kheer. The milk powder will cost Rs 273 per kilogram; this amount will be paid to MILKFED from the ration amount they are granted for mid-day meals. Besides increasing the sale of milk powder, sources said, this step by the government has been taken to ensure children consume kheer prepared from ""quality-tested"" milk as earlier, schools purchased milk from local dairies and other shops which do not undergo a quality check.

Also, with adulterated milk widely being sold across Punjab, one needs to ensure children are not made to consume the same.

The order, however, clarifies that MILKFED will supply 10-kg powder milk cans to schools with 150 children or above. In other words, government schools with less than 150 children (mostly primary and in far-flung villages) will have to arrange the item on their own.

Welcoming the government's decision, Amarjit Singh, a government school teacher from Mansa said, ""Some schools are already using powder milk as it is easier to handle and store. Also, it tastes better and children prefer powdered milk in the food they consume.""

Another teacher from Ludhiana, Dharamjit Singh said, ""There is not going to much of a cost difference as a kilogram of powdered milk can be used by several students when compared to liquid milk. Also, it is easier to store powdered milk.""

Punjab State Education (elementary) Director Inderjit Singh, ""We have taken this decision as MILKFED agreed to supply powdered milk to our schools. The quality of milk had become a cause of worry as adulterated milk is openly sold in the market. The powdered milk by MILKFED passes through several checks.""

Singh added, ""The only concern might be cases of theft. Some people can try and steal to take the milk powder home. We need to look for a solution for this soon.""

It also decided to scrap Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009.

With the objective of making Kannada-medium Government School students ready to compete with those from private English-medium schools, the Education Department here has taken a significant decision to start English-medium classes in Government Schools in the State.

In a bid to provide quality education to rural students, the Government has decided to start the English medium in selected schools. It will start admission to English medium from Class 1 and 5th standard from the next academic year. The Government has already started the process of recruitment of teachers exclusively to teach English medium students besides to prepare syllabus and to conduct the exams.

One of the main reason for starting English-medium classes is that parents in even rural areas want their children to study in English-medium schools as English has largely become inevitable for better career prospects at the global level compared to regional language.

Despite having Government School in their locality, parents send their children to far off places to English schools. Starting English classes would not only help in retaining students in Government Schools, but would also encourage the parents to send their children to such schools.

The State Government has also decided to scrap the RTE and use Rs.400 crore grant of the same for the development of these English medium Government Schools. Government is reimbursing the fees to private schools for 25 percent quota admissions under the RTE Act. Moreover, the State Government is worried over student strength in State-run schools was declining as parents preferred to send their children to private schools under the RTE quota. Nearly 5000 private schools are surviving only because of the funds they are availing under RTE quota. The steep hike in expenditure reimbursement has also become headache to the Government.

The State Govt. has increased the expenditure per child from Rs.5,924 to 8,000 for pre-primary school students and from 11, 848 to 16000 for others. Besides this, the number of students admitted under the quota has been steadily increasing every year.

As many as 4.5 lakh students have been migrated to private schools from Government Schools after the implementation of admissions to private schools under RTE quota from last four years in the State. Shockingly, most of the Government Schools are facing the closure threat after introduction of RTE in the State.

Chief Minister writes to Principal Secretary Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy had already written a letter to Principal Secretary to Government Education Department (Primary and Secondary Education) Dr. Shalini Rajneesh to take all necessary steps to open English medium schools from next academic year. He also directed her to scrap RTE and stop releasing funds to private schools under RTE admissions quota. He has told to utilise RTE reimbursement funds to train the teachers of government schools and recruit teachers to English Medium."

The recruitment will happen with the help of the Teacher's Recruitment Board (TRB), he said. ""We are now inspecting the vacancies and the appointments will be made after we complete the survey,"" he said.

He also announced that special part-time teachers, who handle subjects such as physical education, drawing and music in schools, would not get full-time employment.

A resolution adopted at the district general body meeting of the Koottani held here recently said that the strength of learners was ever-increasing in the State.

However, of late the School Education Department has decided to close down about 1,500 government schools with less then 10 students on their roll, the resolution said adding that this will affect the student community to a big extent. The students of such schools will have to go to far away places for continuing their studies. The decision will affect the student community as well the teachers, the resolution added.

Another resolution said that School Education Minister K. A. Sengottaiyan held discussion with the educationists in the beginning of this year and introduced the new syllabus after a gap of 12 years. He also announced public examination for Plus One and consideration of the combined marks of Plus One and Plus Two for admission into higher courses. These decisions were welcomed by all. However, the Minister has come out with a new announcement that the marks of the Plus One public examination will not be taken for consideration for admission into higher degree courses and Plus Two marks alone will be considered. This has shocked the educationists.

Such a decision will only favour the private school managements, as they will concentrate in the Plus Two subjects in the Plus One year and also in conducting special classes for NEET. This will badly hit the government school students. The meeting urged the Minister to convene a meeting with educationists once again to discuss this issue.

Another resolution stated that late Jayalalithaa announced the abolition of the new pension scheme for the teachers and continuing with the old system. But, the present state regime did not implement the announcement of the late leader.

The humming of children can be heard as one takes the curve while driving from Cement Bridge towards Azad Gunj, Baramulla. The building on the left side of the curve is not just another school in town, but a repository of important memories. As an unrivaled landmark of old Baramulla, ""The College School"" has today become a vibrant campus of nine schools, from a 'Jabri School'.

Back in the day when Baramulla was the Gateway to Kashmir, Jabri schools were opened by Maharaja Hari Singh for imparting education to Kashmiris. However, people were reluctant to send their wards to these schools. To fulfill Maharaja's decree, administration led by Wazir-i-Wazarat -- the present-day divisional commissioner -- would literally drag children to these schools. And therefore the name, Jabri -- forced -- school was coined.

""Before 1947,"" says Khaliq Parveez, a local author and poet, ""there was a dire need of educated and skilled labour. So in order to fulfill this need, five Jabri schools were set up in Kashmir. This [Baramulla's Jabri School] was one among them.""

The College School of Baramulla.

There was a special team comprising of selected teachers and students who would work as a special task force to drag students out of their houses and bring them to school, the author says.

Over the period of time, the school witnessed the times of peace, the hours of unrest and the years of turmoil, but nothing has stopped its journey of great contribution to the society.

""This institution has a legacy of producing gems,"" says Irshada Jaan, headmistress of the school. ""It has been a kindergarten to such people who were destined to sit at the top layer of Kashmir.""

Taking out a thick and long register from her cupboard, she starts reading out the names: Abdul Rashid Bhatt, Labour Commissioner; Aijaz Ahmad Kakroo, Advisor to CM; Dr Abdul Hamid Zargar, ex-Skims Director; Mushtaq Ahmad Sheikh, Divisional Commissioner; Mir Tariq, Director School Education, and the list goes on.

The school was momentarily affected by the explosive political reaction in the old town. With time, says Muneer Ahmad, a former teacher of the school, the roll of students even came down to 58.

""Then in 2015,"" he says, ""a special team of young teachers was set up to reform this historic institution. I was also a member of that team.""

In order to improve the student footfall in the school, eight schools of nearby localities were clubbed together, including a high school, five primary schools and two middle schools. It took the roll to 108.

The team of teachers took to modern teaching techniques and personality development, with main focus on kindergartens.

""We collected funds to purchase the much required equipment and build facilities,"" Muneer says. ""These efforts bore fruit and soon school was buzzing with students again.""

The roll went on increasing and finally one day the school had to put up a notice No Vacancy to stop insisting parents to pressurize the school authorities to admit their wards there.

It's most likely the first and the only government school in the Valley where administration had to refuse admission due to the swelling roll of the students. In most of the government schools, however, the situation is just the opposite.

""The school had to introduce entrance test for the students at KG level, on the style of private schools, as the roll shot up to 300 plus,"" Muneer says.

But now, the campus housing nine institutes is struggling due to deficiency of accommodation and increasing number of students.

""We're studying in one school but we're tagged different, our mark sheets, our attendance all are separate,"" says Adnan Ali, a class X student. ""We feel overcrowded when all students are present. There, in fact, is no space left for some students even to sit in the classroom. We make shifts. When one class leaves for games, other students enter the room to attend a lecture there.""

The absence of labs and playground further disheartens students.

""I had formally written to the authorities on sanctioning of a building, conveyed it to the CEO also during his timely visits, but nothing happened,"" says Jameela Showkat, ex-headmistress of the school.

The only solution to this situation, says Abdul Ahad Wani, CEO Baramulla, is to de-club some schools from there.

The move might give a breathing space to the heritage school, but it's also feared to undo the hard work of the team of young teachers who played a yeomen's role to replace the growing hush with the increasing hum. Maybe, the authorities can do better than simply undoing what the young teachers did to make it an inspiring government school.

Annual fee hike in private schools was cited as one of the key reasons for which students turned to government schools. Jyoti Kumari, who studies in Class VI and has come from Divya Vidya Niketan School, Mohammadpur, said, ""My parents put me in a government school because in private schools, the fee is hiked every year.""

Besides, she said, government school teachers gave more attention to students. ""Teachers give us extra time and attention -- we are sometimes called to school during holidays to study -- which is not the case in private schools,"" said Kumari.

A wide range of books in the school library and bigger playgrounds were other reasons that students, who have transferred to government schools, cited as positives.

A reply to an RTI from the Public Works Department (PWD) has revealed that rainwater harvesting (RWHs) systems are yet to be installed, or begin operations, in government schools and office buildings in the capital. This despite the National Green Tribunal (NGT) pulling up the Delhi government and asking it to file a response on the installation of RWH systems in schools and colleges in January.

In January, the NGT had sought implementation of its November 2017 order, asking government and private schools, and colleges to install rainwater harvesting systems at their own cost.

The rainwater harvesting guidelines of the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) state that RWH systems are important to prevent a fall in groundwater levels and to increase availability of potable water.

With the Delhi government yet to notify the January order, the NGT had directed DJB to inspect all residential and commercial buildings on plots of 500 sq metres and above in July. The tribunal had also ordered a fine of Rs 5 lakh as environment compensation on buildings that haven't installed the systems.

(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). With effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions.

The Samagra Shiksha scheme focuses on improvement of quality of education by providing support for different interventions like; in-service training of teachers and schools heads, conduct of achievement surveys at National and State level, provision of textbooks as per Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, ICT and digital initiatives, vocational education, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment has been increased and from this year provisions for library grants and grants for sports and physical education have also been introduced.

The Government has also launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities.

e PATHSHALA: a single point repository of e ­resources containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-­print materials.

The Central Government, supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme namely 'Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat' (PBBB) in foundational years of schooling.

(iii) MHRD, has launched a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform popularly known as SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) on 9 July, 2017. The portal is offering various online courses for school education and higher education. NCERT has been developing course modules for Massive Open and Online Course (MOOCs) for school education system in 12 subject areas (Accountancy, business studies, biology, chemistry, economic, history, geography, mathematics, physics, political science, psychology and sociology) for classes IX-XII. Twelve (12) courses and twenty one (21) courses have been completed in the first cycle and second cycle (completed on 30 Nov. 2018) on SWAYAM platform (https://swayam.gov.in/) respectively. Nearly 22,000 students and 30,000 students were registered in the first cycle and second cycle respectively.

(iv) CIET-NCERT has been assigned the task of developing e-resources for Master of Education (M.Ed.) course jointly with Allahabad University. One course (Educational Administration, Management and Leadership in School Education) has been completed first cycle on SWAYAM platform in which 2115 were enrolled. The second cycle of this course is offered from 2 July 2018.

Besides, an online course on action research for teachers is conducted in regular intervals in the MOODLE platform (http://ictcurriculum.gov.in/ ). Post Graduate Diploma in Guidance and Counselling for in-service teachers is also offered through the same course portal. Several other online courses are developed for inservice teachers professional development and delivered through the portal https://itpd.ncert.org.in/.

(v) A programme for utilization of satellite communication technologies for transmission of educational e-contents through 32 National Channels i.e. SWAYAM PRABHA DTH-TV has been launched. CIET-NCERT is the national coordinator for one DTH TV channel i.e., Kishore Manch (#31) and has started feeding a 24x7 educational TV channel w.e.f. 09 July, 2018. Everyday four hour fresh slot is telecast and repeated six times in 24 hours to provide learning opportunities for the stake holders, as per their convenience. Besides, NIOS is running 5 channels for teachers, for Secondary and Sr. Secondary levels and for sign language.

(vi) MHRD has launched Diksha Portal for providing digital platform to teachers giving them an opportunity to learn and train themselves and connect with teacher community. The portal envisages to help teachers boost their teaching skills and create their own separate profile with their skills and knowledge, and help in improving quality of education with use of latest technologies in education sector.

Chronicle Reporter, Bhopal, In spite of many schemes including 'School Chalen Hum', running in the state, the number of children in government schools is declining year after year. This has been revealed in the report submitted by the school education department in the last assembly session.

In the last three years six lakh children have left the government schools. Chhindwara district tops in the number of dropouts, whereas Satna and Rewa are second and Shivpuri is in third place.

Children enrolled in government schools through school education department are counted through mid-day meal and free textbook distribution. The number of children in the year 2015-16 is 76,23,522, which fell to only 70,20,008 in the year 2017-18.

All the schemes are aimed at luring the children to the government school. Funds of crores are given under 'School Chale Hum' campaign by the Central Government. The entire budget is also being spent every year, but still the number of children is falling in schools.

Either this budget is being spent on paper, or the schemes are not proving to be effective in attracting children. In order to increase enrollment of children in government schools, the government is running schemes like free textbooks, uniforms and bicycles distribution. In this every year bill of crores rupees is wasted."

Suneetha and her classmates at Government Higher Primary School at Madrahalli in T. Narsipur taluk of Mysuru district have been reciting English rhymes in the last fortnight as the day to present their newly acquired English talent is fast approaching.

The school in the tiny village has around 101 students and each one has to speak English with their teachers, friends, and students throughout the day on January 1, 2019. While some are memorising simple rhymes, others are practising dance to Shakira's popular number 'Waka waka' (This Time For Africa).

This is a part of the 'English Empowerment Programme Fest' (EEPF) designed to improve knowledge of English among the students of government schools, said S. Mamatha, Deputy Director of Public Instruction, Mysuru district.

On New Year's day, the fest will be conducted in each of the 339 schools in the taluk, entirely in English -- from the prayer and dance, and action songs to the vote of thanks.

The EEPF is an ambitious project of the Education Department and it is being implemented on a pilot basis in all government schools in T. Narsipur taluk.

There are 26,000 students in the 339 government schools in the taluk. ""They are mainly from rural areas and they need a boost to improve their English. Hence, the department has selected T. Narsipur for the EEPF,"" Ms. Mamatha told The Hindu.

S. Swamy, Block Education Officer, said, ""We have already trained the teachers and cluster officer, and conducted meetings with the various teachers' associations. The motive behind the EEPF is to build confidence among the students to communicate in English.""

Though there is no official communication, the programme is being seen as a precursor to the State government's plan to introduce English medium in 1,000 government primary schools across the State.

The Education Department is thinking of extending the 'T. Narsipur model' across the State by training teachers through the Department of State Educational Research and Training (DSERT) and the District Institutes of Education and Training (DIET), another senior officer said."

This apart, the petitioner also wanted the court to set up a district level committee of officials known for their integrity and commitment to cause of student welfare to inspect all government and government-aided schools to ensure adequate toilet facilities are provided along with sanitary workers.

It was in 2010 that Delhi's Shri Ram School Maths and Computer Science teacher Sujata Sahu first went on a trip to Ladakh. It was a solo trek, and on the third day, she began to face extreme difficulty breathing and walking. The low oxygen in the altitudes as high as 16,100 feet had given her Pulmonary Edema.

She needed to rest, and with the help of two passing trekkers, she decided to spend the night at a remote village --

""A village which has no road access, is reachable only after a day's walk, and one which boasted of just one home with three occupants. I had neither medicines, nor the ability to call my family, nor access to medical care,"" says 50-year-old Sahu, a resident of Gurugram.

In was in these conditions that she saw two tiny schools which totally changed her life.

The first primary school -- Sku-Kaya -- had five students and two teachers. It had two rooms which were being rebuilt. While one teacher had stayed in the village, the other had gone to Leh to get uniforms and mid-day meal supplies for the school.

The second school had eight children and three teachers. It was two of them who had stopped to help Sahu when she was feeling sick. They had been walking back to Leh for textbooks and uniforms

The children were being taught from English books, which was very alien to them as they had no electricity or TV or telephone connectivity and thus, had no idea what the outside world was like. Having never set foot out of their villages, the exposure level of these children was very low.

.In Ladakh, even the summer months were bitingly cold but that didn't stop the kids from coming to school to learn. ""One of the children even brought his little brother along, who was barely two years old and the love and care with which all the children and the teacher took care of the child was a lesson for me,"" says Sahu.

What really hit her on that fateful Ladakh trip was the sheer drive of the Ladakhi people there to keep growing and improving their circumstances.

""Their determination to come to school and learn, the eagerness of the teacher to learn something new to teach his students, and the aspiration of the parents to educate their children was my inspiration to drop everything and help these amazing people,"" says Sahu.

From a regular school teacher to Ladakh's 'Iron Lady'

""My experience with the schools in Ladakh gave me a path to follow, one that I knew I could contribute to,"" says Sujata Sahu, who had spent 12 years in the corporate world before starting to work with children.

But she had been working at the Shri Ram School for just two years at the time, and leaving this job was the hardest decision she had to make in her life.

""I was planning to take on a seemingly herculean task, in possibly one of the toughest terrains of the world. I had no idea about where I would get the funds from and was also not very clear on how much of an impact I alone could make,"" she says.

Moreover, no one had done something like this before her in Ladakh. But thankfully, she found with herself two strong founding partners -- her husband, Sandeep Sahu, who had been trekking in the region for almost 35 years, and Dawa Jora, a Ladakhi businessman, all of whom had the strong conviction that something like this was really needed for the region.

In 2011, unable to find other NGOs to partner with, the three founders went on a three-day trek to one of the most isolated villages in Lingshed (in Ladakh), carrying 1500 kg of education material on 25 horses, and crossing three mountains at extreme temperatures as low as minus 15 degrees.

The treacherous and steep pass they crossed at an altitude of almost 17000 ft inspired the name of the '17000 ft foundation'.

As she started off on her mission to provide Ladakh schools with the right resources to further the education of their students, she realised this wouldn't be very easy.

""One of our biggest challenges was convincing corporates that even remote areas with extremely scattered and small populations needed support,"" says Sahu.

For the first two years, the foundation worked only with the founders' own funds and kind contributions of friends and family members.

""Though no non-profit organisations were willing to take on Ladakh as a region, we were given support in the form of knowledge, pedagogy and even a large donation of books for our first 100 libraries,"" she says.

Sujata Sahu's undying passion to help the people of Ladakh earned her the nickname of the 'Iron Lady'.

How Ladakh poses a unique set of education problems

India is a geographical anomaly as it has every type of topographical setup, each of which comes with its own challenges. This makes it extremely difficult for the government to cater to every type of problem that can arise in this vast country owing to accessibility issues, extreme weather conditions etc.

Ladakh has almost a 1000 schools across Leh and Kargil, spread across 60,000 sq km of harsh mountains. Catering to a school going population of under 40,000 children, the average school strength of these schools is barely 25 students across the two districts, explains Sahu.

Teachers themselves come from remote villages and have to travel long distances for training, school supplies and even basic administrative functions, leading to long absences and shortage of staff, she adds.

Also, ""While teachers are given basic residential training during winters as well as in-service training, most of the trainings are not contextualized for the uniqueness of the Ladakhi education system,"" she says.

The extreme weather also adds to the problems with schools being shut for severe winters for three months in a year when the roads become inaccessible due to thick snow and temperatures as low as minus 35-40 degrees.

""Incredibly, despite the remoteness of the region, every little hamlet which has even 10 school going children has a tiny government school with teachers in attendance, thanks to the local administration. A little wonder then, that 89% of the schools in Ladakh are govt schools with the private schools present in just a handful of the larger villages,"" she says.

""What is commendable is that all these 900 plus schools are functional and have qualified teachers in attendance. What is even more remarkable is that every child in every village goes to school, managing to at least complete middle school,"" Sahu adds

However, it is only the larger villages which have middle schools and after passing class 5, children have to walk around two hours to get to school to continue their education. Public transport isn't available in such terrain and the army provides army vans for commuting.

.Despite the presence of these govt schools, the community here wants a better life and quality education for their children so they can get better jobs. This aspiration makes them send their very young children, often as young as three years old, to be enrolled in private schools, often extremely far away from their homes.

""Cut off from their villages and parents for months in a year, these children grow up in dormitories, hostels or with other families. Lacking the care and guidance they need in their growing up years, this leads to large-scale dropouts and a population of youth who are unable to go back to their villages,"" Sahu explains.

17000 ft works in these remote villages by improving existing govt schools so that parents would have faith in them and stop sending their children away so far that it disconnects them from their roots.

How voluntourism is helping 17000 ft foundation grow

Sujata Sahu started her non-profit organisation with just the founders and a few volunteers who were given the task to survey the entire length and breadth of Ladakh.

The team mapped around 600 schools after a seven-month-long study. Some of these schools had been bomb shelters during the Kargil war and the buildings had to be shifted multiple times.

The success of the volunteer programmes helped the foundation grow and each of these schools has been geo-mapped for travellers to find.

""We, very early on, piloted our volunteering programmes to involve outsiders in the work of our organization and to also understand if people could be encouraged to donate to such a cause. The enthusiasm and support shown by complete strangers told us that we were on the right track,"" says Sahu.

""Our volunteers, who are our brand ambassadors, then carried the story of our work into their workplaces and CSR then became our main source of funding. Voluntourism, as it is called today, still forms a good 25% of our annual budget and helps us maintain our backend costs,"" she adds.

Why playgrounds are so important in Ladakh schools

Though the govt schools all over Ladakh have proper buildings, they lack the proper facilities that make a school a happy, joyous and welcoming place for children. And in a remote location with rugged ground, a playground comes as a blessing.

""In these remote villages, where nothing is available, there are absolutely no options for children to play with. Though these schools have well-qualified teachers and very low pupil-teacher-ratio, parents often judge the performance of a school based just on the facilities they provide,"" says Sahu.

Thus, parents see the existence of a playground in govt schools as a very good incentive to not send away their kids to far-off private schools.

""Today, 17000 ft foundation has setup playgrounds in 140 schools with colourful swings, slides, see saws etc. many of which the team had to carry over horseback for days to reach our remotest schools,"" she says.

Solving the problem of no native language storybooks in Ladakh

A big aspect of Ladakh education that surprised Sujata Sahu was how the kids learned in English medium schools even though they have no exposure to the foreign language. Their native language was Bhoti.

""To add to this burden, children also have to study their local language as well an additional Hindi/Urdu from grade 1,"" says Sahu.

To enable the children to read better and get comfortable with the number of languages they have to deal with, 17000 ft set up libraries in 230 schools with simple and easy to read story books in English, Hindi and Urdu.

""However, sadly, there are absolutely no story books in Bhoti for children to read. Sensing this gap, we undertook a mission to translate storybooks from English to Bhoti.""

""In 2015, we launched our first phase where we translated 21 titles and published 21,000 storybooks for distribution into 300 schools,"" says Sahu.

This year again, the organisation not only translated another 20 titles, but also added illustrations and changed narratives to make them more relatable to the children of Ladakh.

What has 17000 ft foundation achieved so far?

In the span of just six years, Sujata Sahu's organisation has accomplished much.

""Today, 17000 ft works with 250 govt schools across Leh and Kargil and we are already seeing a reverse trend of children coming back from private schools back to the govt schools in their villages,"" says Sahu.

The organisation has set up libraries in 230 schools, playgrounds in 140 schools, and trained over 1500 teachers in various methodologies with a team which is in Ladakh every winter for training teachers.

17000 ft foundation has conducted multiple community workshops in 125 villages with over 10,000 villagers contributing to our workshops and programmes in the schools.

Recently, the organisation electrified and digitized 120 schools in Leh and Kargil, providing solar electricity and tablets with customized digital learning content, a TV, and a server to provide offline data syncing.

The DigiLab project is the non-profit's most ambitious programme bringing offline hybrid digital learning solutions to the remote villages.

The well-furnished digital labs supported by workshops from the team throughout the year can help the students learn independently with guidance from their teachers.

How crowfunding is helping 17000 ft foundation

Crowdfunding is increasingly coming up as a very important resource collection measure.

""17000 ft has been involved with ImpactGuru.com in multiple projects, the latest being the funding of a Playground for a very remote school in Kargil. We had also fundraised for our Bhoti Book Translation project through ImpactGuru.com and managed to raise more than we needed,"" says Sahu.

Fundraising platforms are great for helping nonprofits fund small projects that have tangible goals and timelines. It is an excellent way to help get the word out to potential supporters and garner more support for the non-profit, says the Iron Lady of Ladakh.

Future of 17000 ft foundation

Before 17000 ft was established, there was little or no attention on the remote schools of Ladakh, and today with all our work and efforts and the participation of the local communities, govt schools are looking and performing better and we are seeing a reverse trend of children coming back to their villages and govt schools.

""When we started, one of our biggest challenges was encouraging donors, volunteers, foundations and even corporates to focus on remote regions of Ladakh. Today, however, we are confident that our model is working and we can get the support we need,"" beams Sahu.

Sujata Sahu now wants to take this model to other remote and mountainous regions, like Arunachal Pradesh, or the remote areas of Himachal.

""We feel that we are closer now to our vision of a better life and education for all children, regardless of geography or terrain,"" she says.

These days, Sagar Singh frets about the academic future of his daughter who studies at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Delhi's Cantonment area.

""There are hardly any teachers there. She often tells me that kids sit clueless as teachers are forced to teach subjects they themselves don't understand well. I wonder if she will remain underprepared for challenges ahead in life, he said.

Singh sums up the crisis in Delhi government schools which have only 35,034 regular teachers against a sanctioned strength of 64,096. A shortage of 29,062 regular hands (45.34 per cent) has left the teachers exhausted and students vulnerable. A total of 15,04,627 students are enrolled in 1,024 schools run by the AAP government.

There are 22,016 guest teachers that take the existing number to 57,050 but they work on daily-wage contracts that must be renewed every year. Even if guest teachers are factored in, Delhi government schools are short of 7,046 (10.99 per cent) teaching hands.

Saroj Sharma, a primary teacher at a Greater Kailash school said, On several occasions, I have had to teach higher-secondary class subjects. We are overworked and stressed. We are filling in for many others. School heads are aware of the crisis, but nothing has been done.

Neeru Loriya, a teacher coordinator at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in RK Puram Sector 4, also said that several subjects are not being taught properly. Barkha Kumari, a Class VI student at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Rohini said, My Class has 50 students. We need more teachers to ensure we're taught well. It's not that the government isn't working at all. After the Aam Aadmi Party came to power in Delhi in 2014, the government has built 48 schools.

But where are the teachers? We have sent several reminders to the government. Nothing has happened, said a teacher at a Pusa Road school. Most regular posts are filled through promotions. But they have not happened since 2013, he said.

Sanjay Goel, head of the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) told Mail Today, We're aware of the problem. Each year, guest teachers are being enrolled to minimise the shortage. Avdhesh Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, also said, There is a problem. But the government is hiring guest teachers to tackle it.

But facts tell a different tale. In July, the Delhi government had announced that schools would get 9,000 guest teachers by mid-August. It did not happen. Hiring guest teachers is anyway no solution to this huge crisis, said Ajay Veer Singh, general secretary of the last Government School Teachers' Association (GSTA) elected in 2014. GSTA elections have not taken place since 2014.

So its demands have not been heard effectively, its office-bearers claim. We have asked for elections. But education department officials have not paid any heed. The future of government school teachers is dark, said Singh. GSTA has a three-year term.

He also described Kashmere Gate as an ""incubation centre"" for universities, saying it is a coincidence that several varsities, which were based in the area, are now moving to bigger campuses.

""We had launched the 'happiness curriculum' in government schools. Now we will launch the entrepreneurship curriculum from the next session onwards for secondary and senior secondary students.

""We need to instill confidence among our children in school right from the beginning of secondary education that after completing their education, they should aspire to be job givers and not job seekers,"" Sisodia said.

He explained that after at least 15 years of formal education, if a large number of the youth are not confident of creating something new, which can give them gainful return and add value to the economy, then as a society ""we are failing to nurture their full potential"".

Sisodia said, barring a few exceptions, once a child completes elementary schooling and joins the secondary classes, his entire orientation, which is largely shaped by the teachers and parents, is to secure good marks in exams, get admission in a good college and get a job with decent pay package.

This is considered a trajectory of success and anyone who either secures less marks or fails to join college or fails to secure a job is deemed as unsuccessful, he said.

""This trajectory is obsolete in today's day and age when new ideas and technologies are driving our way of life.

While the teachers welcome the innovation wholeheartedly as it does magic in schools, experts opine that video lessons could be used only in addition to classroom learning.

Initially, the department had embedded QR code in the textbooks for classes I, VI, IX and XI - syllabus was revamped in this academic year - and each lesson had at least three QR codes which upon scanning would take you to video lessons of that lesson, explained an official from the department who is involved in the process.

The department also has a YouTube channel with 1.18 lakh subscribers and is planning to launch a 24-hour free satellite education channel, said the official.

""The basic idea is to evoke interest among the students and to make them attend classes regularly. Also, concepts which are considered as difficult by the students, were made into videos to unwrap its complexity,"" the official added.

The video lessons in turn has done magic in the schools as most of the students who were difficult to find in classrooms, were not just found on regular basis, but also noticed paying keen attention to the lessons, said a government schoolteacher on condition of anonymity.

A teacher, who teachers Mathematics, said most of the problems which, in general, students would struggle to understand were solved, within matter of time as the videos explain it with pictorial representations and sound effects.

""Teaching the students to pronounce difficult words has become a fun task now for both students and teachers. But, the only issue that we face is that videos were created only for a few concepts and not for entire lessons,"" T Arulanantham of Tamil Nadu high and higher secondary teachers' association said.

With videos, students can listen to it numerous times until they clearly understand it, while a teacher would not be able to spare much time to explain same doubts during the class hours as they would have to move on to next chapter, he added.

""The video lessons would definitely be useful in understanding difficult concepts, but it should not replace the textbooks completely.

The model school initiative at GLPS Ravindranagar has been supported by Shyamala Prabhu and Kavita Shastry from the Institute of Indian Interior Designers and organisations such as Let's Endorse, Smile Charitable Trust, and The Aravani Art Project.

In a special interaction with Deccan Chronicle, Yaduveer said that infrastructural development of government schools was essential to help students benefit better from the system. Excerpts:

Experts point out offering better opportunities for students in government schools as well keeping the system of public education alive. How can this be done?

Going forward from initiatives like the School and Student Transformation model put forth by TAPF, encouraging children to grow up in a sustainable environment and ensuring they get access to experiential learning platforms is important. A transformation towards getting better in all ways - in terms of education, infrastructure and advanced learning prospects is essential for government schools to be more appealing to students and parents.

Do you believe beginning English medium classes or schools in the public education sector would improve government school enrolments and thereby quality of education offered as well?

Merely changing the medium to English would not improve the system at a larger scale. Even though learning English would help students get recognised as a global citizen, one cannot neglect the local language and culture and hence learning in Kannada is equally important. Knowledge in more languages right from the formative years is always good as it helps better brain development. However, a system to offer both Kannada and English mediums and either of them as a second language should be in place. The final call should be left open to each student/parent catering to their individual needs.

Will you prefer sending your son to a government school for education?

That will be a matter of practicality and we'll take a call depending on what is right for him at that point of time. He's just one year old now. I've seen several government schools that are very good and way better than their private counterparts with an enabled and progressive outlook. Good things take time and hopefully with such initiatives, government schools will retain its past glory. To be very honest, we haven't given this much thought as to how we should have already."

The number of government schools in Uttar Pradesh running smart classes had been slowly but steadily growing, said a basic education department official. He said this was largely due to efforts of individual teachers who were seeking help from good Samaritans or opting for crowd funding to arrange the money needed to digitize the teaching process.

At a time when the state government is still to make any budgetary provision for running smart classes in schools, these teachers are doing their best to equip their institutions with the latest technologies and compete with private institutions mushrooming in small districts.

Now the basic education department is preparing a database of all such schools.

""The findings, so far, have come as a surprise. Nearly 1,200 schools (out of the total 1.54 lakh in the state) are running smart classes,"" said director, basic education, Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh. He said it was equally surprising that the state capital was yet to catch up with other districts in this respect.

He said that most of these institutions were concentrated in far off districts like Gorakhpur or smaller ones such as Hardoi and Sitapur.

""Gorakhpur has the maximum number (124) of smart class schools. Hardoi is a close second with 122 schools, and Sitapur is next with 120. Some of the other districts with such schools are Azamgarh (33), Mau (28), Muzaffarnagar (20), Bulandshahr (18), Lalitpur (17), Kaushambhi (15) and Jaunpur (10),"" he said.

Singh said that by integrating technology with education, these schools had transformed the teaching-learning process, making it far more interesting.

""It has helped a lot in increasing student retention. For instance, now a science teacher doesn't just talk about blood circulation but actually shows the students how blood is circulated in the body via arteries and veins,"" he said.

The official said that soon these teachers would be invited to the state capital where they would interact with other government school teachers, inspiring them to generate resources to make their respective schools more appealing for students.

""Some of the teachers who have done good work will also be felicitated,"" Singh said."

Also, the education department is planning to extend the Government Model Primary School (GMPS) in Sector 49 to middle level (till class VIII). This was stated by the officials from the education department in its preliminary plan as final decision will be taken only after conducting a proper survey of these schools and the nearby schools after the re-transfer process is done.

The eight primary schools being re-transferred are- GPS -12, GPS - Bapudham Colony, GPS- Buterla, GPS- Mauli Complex, GPS- Railway Colony, GPS- Manimajra - I, GPS- Manimajra - II, and GMPS - 49 (the newest among all schools).

""There are the schools which do not have good infrastructure and have less number of students, so we will be adjusting students in nearby schools. Also, the schools which are large in spaces will be further upgraded,"" said an official from the UT education department requesting anonymity.

The shifting, as per teachers may prove to be an unsuccessful task as the schools, especially in Mauli complex, railway colony and Manimajra are already overcrowded.

The schools that will get prior attention from the education department include Government Primary School in Maulijagran, Government Primary School in railway colony and Manimajra-II as these are running in worst conditions of all. GPS in Mauli and railway colony are not even having their own buildings and are being run in rented buildings.

In a reality check, the TOI had reported how these three schools had poor infrastructure as they are so small that they cannot even afford to have furniture in classrooms and accommodate students.

The department is also planning to close Government Primary School in Buterla, Sector 41 due to low enrollment of students. ""The building can be put to some other good use. There is no point in running a separate school for a few students,"" the official added.

The school has 130 students at present studying in nursery class and classes I-V.

These schools further lack basic facilities like playgrounds and teachers have to be on toes to ensure students don't get injured as few swings that lie in the corner of small yards. Thus, making it unsafe for students. In some schools situated in Mauli complex and railway colony, they utilize the adjoining neighbourhood park as they don't have their own playgrounds. This, however, raises security concerns for children, as the park is also used by people and vendors.

GMPS will further be upgraded to middle level. Moreover, the school's building needs attention too. The other seven government primary schools have been running under the MC Chandigarh since 2010."

The computer professionals said they joined the schools in June 2018, but were paid a month's salary only in November this year, a day before Diwali. The assistants claim their complaints to CM, deputy CM (who also holds the charge of the education department) and public grievance cell have failed to provide them a relief.

The assistants said they were hired by Intelligent Communication Systems India Limited (ICSIL) and sent to Delhi government's DoE, which, in turn, deployed them in various government schools.

""When we did not get our salary for three months, the company that hired us told us to contact the DoE. When we talked to the education department officials, they said paying salaries was the responsibility of the company that outsourced the manpower. We have only been shuttling between the two offices,"" said an IT Assistant, requesting anonymity.

The job responsibility of the assistants include managing the attendance of students and teachers, monitoring the e-mails, orders and circulars coming from the DoE and sharing them with the head of the school.

The education department had initially hired 1,068 IT Assistants and later advertised for another 670 more computer professionals for schools that have more than 1,200 students and thus have more work load. While the 1,068 IT Assistants, hired for two years, have been getting their salaries regularly, the 670 have not been paid.

""Despite being working hard all these months, sometimes on Sundays and holidays as well, our salaries have not been released. We all our working under duress and are sustaining ourselves by taking loans from friends, families and even from banks. We are under severe financial pressure,"" said another assistant.

A representative from ICSIL said the IT Assistants were first hired for three months and in June, it was decided to extend their contract for one year.

Chatting about the upcoming examination and reciting multiplication tables, they are getting ready for another day at the Government Senior Secondary School here.

From the outside, there's nothing extraordinary about the scene but as you enter, a pleasant surprise awaits.

Neatly furnished classrooms, a library and lab form part of an encouraging attempt to give these children quality education infrastructure, all thanks to an experiment by Brahm Prakash Shastri, a former principal of the school.

By bypassing administrative procedures and seeking help directly from NGOs, and tapping various corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, Shastri's endeavours have ended up benefiting teachers as well as some 20 government schools in the district. And it's the power of community, he believes, which has helped turn his simple idea into gold, in the space of four years.

As a rule, to channel CSR funds, corporates and NGOs must approach the education department but this is a process that can, and often does, take a long time. ""And all the donations don't necessarily reach us,"" admits Shastri, who eventually sought the assistance of the big companies, with due approval from the education department. Now, the govt school in Basai has an impressive science and computer lab, an RO water purifier for clean drinking water, refurbished toilets, a diesel genset and split air-conditioners, besides well-furnished classes and staff rooms. Behind all this is teamwork.

Villagers, for example, have contributed by whitewashing the walls. ""Several local NGOs approached us for basic things, like installing RO and donating books. We then asked the companies to invest directly and they have helped (with) the entrance, walking tracks and boundary walls,"" Shastri adds.

According to a notification under Section 135 of The Companies Act 2013, it is compulsory for companies with a net worth of Rs 500 crore or more, turnover of Rs 1,000 crore or more, or net profit of Rs 5 crore or more, in any given financial year, to spend two percent of their net profit on CSR programmes.

And following the successful Basai model, government schools in Carterpuri, Jacobpura, Tikri, Shakurpur, Bhondsi and Tikli (and one in Sarsa, Bhiwani), have undergone renovation. The Tikri school, TOI found, is getting a new washroom for boys, girls and handicapped children (courtesy a North American real estate firm). Tulsiram, the principal here, happily acknowledges the transformation. ""Our school was initially in a very bad condition - there was no sewer connection and the boundary wall was in a dilapidated state,"" he recalls, sitting in his office-cum-staff room. ""We are not aware of the expenditure, but this CSR activity has brought a positive change in the school.""

Indeed, in two years, CSR funds have ensured that the Tikri govt school is not lacking when it comes to the bare essentials, among them a water tank, utensils for midday meals, a level playground and washrooms.

Dinesh Shastri, the district education officer, has visited 20 such schools across the state and claims that facilities are on a par with those in private schools. ""The drop-out rate has come down heavily too,"" he says.

However, for all the progress in infrastructure development, there are still more than 30,000 vacancies for teachers in the state. The data report card of the District Information System for Education (U-DISE) corroborates this fact, pointing out the acute shortage of teachers and principals in Haryana.

Still, with over 540 government schools in the district, there is no dearth of corporate majors who are prepared to come forward and do their bit towards make the learning ecosystem more welcoming and fun for children."

Meanwhile with the government announcing winter vacations, students of these government schools were in a dilemma as they have not received their textbooks yet from the school authorities.

The annual examinations in government primary and middle schools culminated last month but the promoted students have not been provided with various textbooks by School Education Department (SED).

The teachers in various government-run-schools said that there is a non-availability of mathematics, history and geography books for the 9th standard and mathematics, Science in 10th standard also.

The teachers also said that the students from 5th to 8th standard are also without mathematics, history and civics textbooks.

Official sources in SED said that the Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education (JKBOSE) was probably supposed to order 50 lakh textbooks but this year the department ordered these books late.

""However the board have received some of the books but few books are yet to be received and the School Education Department,"" he said.

""SED has given a deadline to the JKBOSE for availing the pending books of various classes till December 05, sources said adding, ""The school authorities have been also asked to distribute the pending books on 15th of December to all respective students.""

He said that the JKBOSE was also directed to provide books and stationery to the school authorities of Ladakh district first because of the road closure issues.

Lamenting on the non-availability of various books in Srinagar district he said there is a huge non-availability of various books from Ist to 10th standard in the district.

Chairman, JKBOSE, Veena Pandita said, ""We have science books available but mathematics and Urdu books are pending for two classes."" ""Actually the trucks carrying the books are stuck somewhere in the highway. But in coming two days we are hopeful, we will receive these books too,"" she assured. She said that for the rest of the classes there was no shortage or non-availability of any book.

Pertinently, the State Government on Thursday announced winter vacations for all schools in Kashmir division and winter zones of Jammu division from December-6 to March- 03 2019 upto 8th standard and December-17 to March February 23 2019 for 9th standard onwards."

For most part of the 14 years of his life, Priyanshu Singh, a class 9 student of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Yamuna Vihar, had no clue why his female friends complain about mood swings and abdominal pain for a day or two every month. Whenever the girls declined to participate in sports activities, he would mock and even crack jokes at their expense.

But all of that changed this September.

That was when Singh understood that it happens when the girls are either going through premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or on their monthly period cycle. ""While I knew what periods are, I was unaware about the difficulties women face when they are on their natural cycle. I used to laugh at my friends when they would complain about stomachache and mood swings. Now, I understand that mood swings are because of the PMS and it's normal to have stomach pain while they are on their periods,"" he said.

The change in mindset and the awareness was only possible because the school organised a workshop on 'menstrual awareness' in collaboration with non-governmental organisation (NGO) Sachhi Saheli. ""It was overwhelming to see the students, especially boys, asking menstruation-related queries with so much confidence. At the end of the workshop, the boys distributed packets of sanitary napkins among girls without any hesitation and pledged to make the campus period-friendly,"" RP Singh, principal of the school, said.

Now, the school is planning to organise a workshop for parents as well. ""Most of these students come from families where such discussions are prohibited. We are planning to organise a workshop for parents to sensitise them and encourage them to discuss these topics with their children,"" he said.

But their school is not an exception.

As many as 30 co-educational government schools have approached the NGO this year to organise workshops in order to sensitise students about menstruation. Till July this year, the NGO was conducting these workshops only in all girls' schools. ""We wanted to impart basic education about menstruation to students studying in government schools. We had contacted the Directorate of Education (DoE) last year and briefed them about our plan. The DoE gave us permission to conduct these workshops in girls' schools running under the Delhi government and the civic bodies. But, this year we started receiving requests from co-ed schools as well. We have already covered around 10 co-ed schools in the last four months and it has turned out to be a wonderful experience,"" said Dr Surbhi Singh, a gynecologist and founder of Sachhi Saheli.

During the workshops, the students are told about the science behind menstruation and the myths surrounding it. The girls are also taught basic hygiene that should be maintained during periods. ""We do not discuss about menstruation with boys at home or school and still expect them to be sensitive and supportive. It's very important to remove stigmas and taboos attached to periods from their minds. That's why we show them sanitary napkins and explain the importance of their use. We also tell boys about the physical and mental strains girls go though during their menstrual cycle,"" Singh said.

At another co-ed school in Nanakpura, a class 10 student Sagar Malik said he gifted his mother a pack of sanitary pads after attending the workshop. ""I had come to know about the issues women face in case they use cloth instead of sanitary pads during their periods. I requested the teacher in charge at my school to give a packet for my mother because I did not know what she uses. I have never heard anything about menstruation at home. When I gave her the packet, she looked shocked. But when I told her what I had learnt at school, she looked happy and relieved. She even called me a Padman,"" the 14-year-old said.

Meanwhile, a group of boys at a government co-ed school in Vasant Kunj has pledged to educate people in their localities about ""menstrual health"". ""We have decided to go from door to door in our localities and tell people the importance of maintaining hygiene during periods to avoid infections,"" said Lalit Singh, one of the students.

Girls, too, are happy with the change.

Divya Singh, a class 9 student at a school in Janakpuri, said she used to bring a 'black polythene bag' to carry the packet of sanitary napkins the school distributes under the Centre's Kishori Shakti Yojna. The girls in her school would collect their packets from the medical room after classes got over. Under the Kishori Shakti Yojna, girl students, between the ages of 11 and 18, are distributed a sanitary napkin packet every month in government schools across the country.

However, Singh and her classmates have now asked the teacher to distribute the pack of sanitary napkins in the classrooms. ""We had never uttered the word period in the presence of our male classmates before. It was the first time when a group, having more boys than girls, was sitting and discussing the myths and taboos attached to menstruation. Things have comparatively changed. Now, we do not have to think hundred times before talking about periods in school at least like we have to do at home,"" she said.

According to a survey published in Journal of Family and Community Medicine (JFCM) in September, 40% girls remained absent from school during their menstruation for reasons such as lack of privacy at school, source of information on menstruation and anxiety about leakage, and staining of their uniform. The survey was conducted on 600 girls studying in government schools in Delhi.

Experts say it's important to impart basic knowledge about menstruation at schools. ""It's important to make both make both genders aware of the science behind menstruation. While for girls, good menstrual hygiene can help prevent any kind of pelvic inflammatory diseases and infections, such talk sessions are equally important for boys to remove all the taboos and preconceived notions about periods. They should understand that it's a part of a girls' life and absolutely normal,"" said Dr Anuradha Kapur, a senior gynecologist at Max hospital in Saket.

Sanjay Goel, director of the DoE, said the government will encourage more co-ed schools to come forward and organise such workshops."

When Shobha Suryanarayan, a volunteer with Acharyas for a Better Community (ABC), first approached Vijayanagar Lower Primary School in Whitefield, the students could barely string together a sentence in English. The school had over 50 children from classes 1 to 5, but there was only one teacher and a headmistress (HM) to teach all of them. Children in classes 1, 2 and 3 would sit together; they were taught by the HM once she finished her official work. Children in classes 4 and 5 would sit together, and were taught by the other teacher, says Shobha.

ABC, an NGO based in Bengaluru, is driven by volunteers who go to teach in government schools. They also get CSR funding to meet each school's individual requirements.

At Vijayanagar school, the teachers asked ABC to take over English classes. In last November, ABC appointed a full-time teacher in the school, whose salary is paid with CSR funds. Within just three months, there was a huge difference, says Shobha. ""The students spoke in English, and even performed a skit in English. When I first had gone in, they had no idea about sentence structure,"" she says. ABC also appointed a janitor since students themselves used to clean the school, including its toilets, up till then.

ABC is also refurbishing the school, and setting up a peer lab and library there, with CSR funds. ""We have built a dining area and washing area for the kids. The ground has been levelled and cleaned up so that children have a safe place to play. We also raised the compound wall and put up barbed fencing to prevent anti-social activities that used to be common in the school premises at night,"" says Shobha. CSR funds also cover students' breakfast, which has resulted in both higher attendance rates and better attention span among students. Overall ABC has got Rs 40 lakhs as CSR funds for Vijayanagar School.

In Pattandur Agrahara School behind ITPL, the student enrolment went up from less than 10, to 96 now. The school which was in threat of being shut down, was rebuilt by ABC. ABC's volunteers also teach in the school. The school's transformation has most benefited children from the migrant construction labourer community who live nearby. Similar was the case with Nallurhalli Government Primary School.

ABC is one among the many volunteer-driven initiatives in the city that's changing government schools, one at a time. In addition to registered trusts like ABC, there are also informal volunteering groups, like one led by Anupama Harish in Malleswaram.

The shortage of competent teachers in government schools, lack of functional infrastructure, and difficult familial circumstances are causing many students to perform poorly in schools or to drop out altogether. Many low-income families also spend a large part of their income to send their children to private schools, in hope of better education, especially in English. However, studies show that low-income private schools are hardly any better than government schools in terms of learning outcomes. It's in this scenario that volunteer interventions are strengthening the public school system in Bengaluru.

Many volunteering organisations start off without much of a plan.

Malleswaram volunteers had come together when local resident Anupama Harish proposed her idea of volunteering in the 'Malleswaram & Suttha Muttha' Facebook group. Of nearly 12,000 members in the group then, many responded. Since 2015-16, Anupama's team has been teaching Mathematics in the Malleswaram 18th Cross Boys' High School.

The group has three volunteer-teachers for Maths each in 8th, 9th and 10th standards. Each teacher picks a favourite topic in Maths to teach - algebra, geometry etc. At any time, the group has 10-15 volunteers.

The school initially asked Anupama to get the permission of the Block Education Officer (BEO). The BEO was happy to have volunteer-teachers since the school had teacher shortage, especially in Maths. Maths was also the subject in which majority of the 10th standard students had failed in the previous year, in board exams.

After discussions with the school's head teacher, the group got a timetable. From this year, they have also been teaching Social Studies here. The team has developed a structured syllabus. They also update their progress in a common document so that there is no overlap in what's taught.

Having a structured syllabus is important since volunteers may otherwise teach random topics, concurs Jayashree Narayanan, who was a teacher-volunteer with the NGO OBLF (One Billion Literates Foundation). Jayashree, by her own initiative, had approached Kaikondrahalli Government School a few years back, interested in being a volunteer-teacher. She then became part of OBLF, which signed MoUs with the schools to allow its volunteer-teachers there.

Jayashree then found interested volunteers through her personal networks. OBLF volunteers have worked with five schools in Sarjapur Road area so far, but the volunteering has been stalled for this year because of the lack of committed volunteers. Jayashree plans to resume the programme next year.

OBLF volunteers start off the academic year by assessing students on spoken and written English. ""So we know where the kids stand, and we teach them from that level. We give another assessment at the end of the year to see how far the kids have progressed,"" says Jayashree. The team gets only a one-hour slot in a day. Usually there are two volunteers teaching English in each grade - one teachers three hours and the other two hours per week, so that there is continuity. Jayashree says schools have been open to them since they come from a registered NGO, with proper permissions.

ABC had started informally in 2016, as a group of 10-15 people. They initially had difficulty getting CSR funds, but this changed with their success in Pattandur Agrahara School. In late 2017, ABC registered as a Trust since corporates would fund only formal entities. Currently the NGO is a loosely structured organisation with a CSR group, operations group, social media group etc, all driven by volunteers. The organisation has about 50 volunteers in the city, and has worked with around 20 schools so far.

ABC starts engaging with a school by holding sports or art events, or by donating school bags etc to the students. During events, the team identifies the requirements of the school by talking to teachers and students. ""When we hold an event, they understand that we are serious. We list down requirements and create a proper project for the school,"" says Vikas Chandra, co-founder of ABC.

The requirements are put up on ABC's Facebook page, where people interested in volunteering or donating respond. The NGO also approaches corporates for CSR funds to do building repairs, set up new infrastructure, appoint teachers, distribute bags to students etc. It takes a good deal of time and effort to get CSR funds approved, says Chandra.

Volunteers say that working with high school or PUC students is more difficult as they often lack basic knowledge in subjects. Brijesh of the Malleswaram group says teaching 10th standard students was an uphill task. ""They didn't even know basic maths such as addition and subtraction. But we made sure that students who would come to 10th standard from 8th and 9th standards would get the basics right,"" he says.

Working with primary school students is more fruitful than working with high school or PUC students, opine volunteers. Younger children are more receptive to learning, and can get a good foundation at the appropriate age, they say. ""We want to enter the primary school sector now. If we strengthen the basics of primary school children, teaching high school students will become easier for our own volunteers,"" says Anupama.

Many students also come from very unstable backgrounds, such as abusive/alcoholic fathers, along with socio-economic backwardness or migrant nature of parents jobs. They need to be motivated to study, say volunteers. Schools get very little amounts for annual maintenance, and hence lack essential stationery materials and staff. In some schools, toilets are locked up or students are made to clean those due to the lack of cleaning staff. ""In a class of 30-40 students, only 10-15 would really want to learn. The other children don't even want to come to school,"" says Jayashree.

Coordinating between volunteers and schools is a challenge for volunteering organisations. Volunteers come from varying backgrounds, but most are homemakers or working professionals. While homemakers are available to volunteer on weekdays, coordinating with professionals on their time slots at the school can be a challenge. Negotiating with the school to get good time slots for teaching, having the school not cancel a time slot randomly, and having committed volunteers who go to the school regularly, are all challenges. Most volunteer organisations ask its members to commit to teaching in a school for at least a year.

The volunteering system acts as a self-sustaining system, where the interested, committed volunteers stay on their own. Volunteering groups say that most volunteers who stay on are well-qualified and passionate about teaching.

However, finding committed volunteers who are fluent in both English and Kannada has been difficult in Sarjapur Road area, says Jayashree. ""Many volunteers, once they start teaching, realise that not knowing Kannada is a barrier in reaching out to primary school children, since these children are very young.""

Some volunteers at ABC circumvented this problem by taking a six-month course in Kannada to learn the basics. ""This leads to a reverse teaching process in the class. Students love that they can teach Kannada to volunteers,"" says Shobha. Sometimes, if a student in the class knows Hindi, the child will act as a translator between the Hindi-speaking volunteer and other students.

Gaining entry into a school in the first place can be difficult as well. ""We struggle with regulatory challenges - BEO permissions, HMs not wanting to cooperate etc. For teachers, it is judgement on their work when we go in. So there is a lot of resistance. Sometimes we bulldoze our way through. But sometimes we find very cooperative and committed teachers,"" says Shobha. However, once the volunteers bring about good results, schools are only too happy to have them continue, say volunteers.

While volunteers pitching in with teaching, infrastructure support and funds is impactful for that specific school, it is not an institutionalised solution, and hard to sustain in the long run. Systemic changes to the education system need more thought out interventions and reforms, which we shall explore in subsequent stories."

The Directorate of School Education Kashmir has failed to develop basic infrastructure for government schools in South Kashmir's Shopian town, which resulted in students leaving them for private schools.

Town dwellers informed Rising Kashmir that barring two higher secondary schools, all government schools in Shopian town have been operating from rented building sans infrastructure since their establishment decades ago.

They added that around a dozen schools were established in the town by school education department in past eight decades but failed to construct buildings for them.

""The schools were housed in rented buildings which lack basic facilities including lavotaries, bathrooms and playgrounds,"" said a town dweller, Mohamed Amen, adding that it resulted government schools failing to attract students.

The schools which as per official records became defunct include;

Boys Middle School Shopian, Girls Primary School Hergam , Girls Primary School Shopian, Primary School Hergam, Primary School Bongam, Middle School Sheikh Mohalla Bongam, Primary School Batpora, Primary School Alyalpora and Primary SchoolKannipora.

The residents said that Government Middle school Teng Mohalla, Primary school Malik Mohalla and Baba Mohalla, which are still functional, too operated from shabby rented buildings.

""The Teng Mohalla school ,which has around 30 odd students on enrollment, has been housed on second storey of a Shop.""

They added that the school, which was established 25 years ago, was operating from the building of telephone exchange office and then in a residential house prior to shifting to a second storey of a shop.

The other schools have similar stories of being operating from a building of Handicrafts department or Panchayat house, the residents said.

The poor infrastructure has made parents in Shopian town, which couldn't afford private schooling , to send their wards to other government schools in neighboring villages like Arhama.

The residents demanded construction of a model school in Shopian town on patterns of central high school Pulwama on a patch of land lying vacant behind old bus stand.

""The space is more than sufficient for constructing a model school with all facilities for students coming economically weak sections of society,"" the residents said.

Chief Education Officer Shopian, Mohamed Sadiq said that in Shopian district around 140 schools were operating from rented buildings. ""The number came down to 10,"" he said, adding that they couldn't construct buildings for these schools because there is paucity of land in the town.

When he was told about land available behind old bus stand he said that the said land is suitable for construction of a new school building as that will intrude into already functioning girls higher secondary school."

""Today, the number of libraries for children of government primary schools has gone up to 200. We are trying to inculcate reading habits in children, but here these small children are also managing the system themselves,"" said Sisodia.

Room to Read country director Sourav Banerjee said 56,671 books have been provided across the 100 schools, where 27,672 children are enrolled. ""We've roughly provided around 200 titles and 500 books per school. Over three years, the number of books in each library will increase to about 1,000. The final number depends on student enrolment.

In the Mandawali school, each section has a 40-minute 'library period' every week. The teacher in charge of the library pointed to the coloured stickers on each book.

It further said that three years have elapsed since the high court's judgement, thereby causing serious loss of funds which should have accrued for development of these schools.

The plea claimed that the state government had also failed to submit the requisite compliance report despite the lapse of three years and there was no valid reason for it.

It also sought directions to the state government, as per the high court's orders, for making a provision of awarding punishment of depositing an amount of fees equal to what they are paying for their children's education in private schools.

Taking note of the dismal conditions of the state-run schools, the high court had in 2015 passed a slew of directions to the state government.

The high court had also asked the chief secretary of the state to take appropriate action in the matter to ensure that government servants, semi-government servants, judicial officers send their child to primary schools run by the UP Basic Education Board.

The Punjab education department has directed all government schools to use powdered milk (dry milk) to prepare kheer, which is served once a week as part of the mid-day meal menu to children. The powdered milk will be supplied to schools by government-run cooperative MILKFED (which runs VERKA milk plants across the state).

As per the notification issued, schools are required to use seven grams of milk powder per child for making kheer. The milk powder will cost Rs 273 per kilogram; this amount will be paid to MILKFED from the ration amount they are granted for mid-day meals. Besides increasing the sale of milk powder, sources said, this step by the government has been taken to ensure children consume kheer prepared from ""quality-tested"" milk as earlier, schools purchased milk from local dairies and other shops which do not undergo a quality check.

Also, with adulterated milk widely being sold across Punjab, one needs to ensure children are not made to consume the same.

The order, however, clarifies that MILKFED will supply 10-kg powder milk cans to schools with 150 children or above. In other words, government schools with less than 150 children (mostly primary and in far-flung villages) will have to arrange the item on their own.

Welcoming the government's decision, Amarjit Singh, a government school teacher from Mansa said, ""Some schools are already using powder milk as it is easier to handle and store. Also, it tastes better and children prefer powdered milk in the food they consume.""

Another teacher from Ludhiana, Dharamjit Singh said, ""There is not going to much of a cost difference as a kilogram of powdered milk can be used by several students when compared to liquid milk. Also, it is easier to store powdered milk.""

Punjab State Education (elementary) Director Inderjit Singh, ""We have taken this decision as MILKFED agreed to supply powdered milk to our schools. The quality of milk had become a cause of worry as adulterated milk is openly sold in the market. The powdered milk by MILKFED passes through several checks.""

Singh added, ""The only concern might be cases of theft. Some people can try and steal to take the milk powder home. We need to look for a solution for this soon.""

Schools from next year - Star of Mysore","starofmysore.com",FALSE,"Mysuru: The State Government has decided to open English medium section in 1,000 Government Schools from next academic year in the State. It also decided to scrap Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009.

With the objective of making Kannada-medium Government School students ready to compete with those from private English-medium schools, the Education Department here has taken a significant decision to start English-medium classes in Government Schools in the State.

In a bid to provide quality education to rural students, the Government has decided to start the English medium in selected schools. It will start admission to English medium from Class 1 and 5th standard from the next academic year. The Government has already started the process of recruitment of teachers exclusively to teach English medium students besides to prepare syllabus and to conduct the exams.

One of the main reason for starting English-medium classes is that parents in even rural areas want their children to study in English-medium schools as English has largely become inevitable for better career prospects at the global level compared to regional language.

Despite having Government School in their locality, parents send their children to far off places to English schools. Starting English classes would not only help in retaining students in Government Schools, but would also encourage the parents to send their children to such schools.

The State Government has also decided to scrap the RTE and use Rs.400 crore grant of the same for the development of these English medium Government Schools. Government is reimbursing the fees to private schools for 25 percent quota admissions under the RTE Act. Moreover, the State Government is worried over student strength in State-run schools was declining as parents preferred to send their children to private schools under the RTE quota. Nearly 5000 private schools are surviving only because of the funds they are availing under RTE quota. The steep hike in expenditure reimbursement has also become headache to the Government.

The State Govt. has increased the expenditure per child from Rs.5,924 to 8,000 for pre-primary school students and from 11, 848 to 16000 for others. Besides this, the number of students admitted under the quota has been steadily increasing every year.

As many as 4.5 lakh students have been migrated to private schools from Government Schools after the implementation of admissions to private schools under RTE quota from last four years in the State. Shockingly, most of the Government Schools are facing the closure threat after introduction of RTE in the State.

Chief Minister writes to Principal Secretary Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy had already written a letter to Principal Secretary to Government Education Department (Primary and Secondary Education) Dr. Shalini Rajneesh to take all necessary steps to open English medium schools from next academic year. He also directed her to scrap RTE and stop releasing funds to private schools under RTE admissions quota. He has told to utilise RTE reimbursement funds to train the teachers of government schools and recruit teachers to English Medium."

He further said these teachers would be recruited through a new system that would include a system of weightage giving preference to better qualified candidates.

The recruitment will happen with the help of the Teacher's Recruitment Board (TRB), he said. ""We are now inspecting the vacancies and the appointments will be made after we complete the survey,"" he said.

He also announced that special part-time teachers, who handle subjects such as physical education, drawing and music in schools, would not get full-time employment.

A resolution adopted at the district general body meeting of the Koottani held here recently said that the strength of learners was ever-increasing in the State.

However, of late the School Education Department has decided to close down about 1,500 government schools with less then 10 students on their roll, the resolution said adding that this will affect the student community to a big extent. The students of such schools will have to go to far away places for continuing their studies. The decision will affect the student community as well the teachers, the resolution added.

Another resolution said that School Education Minister K. A. Sengottaiyan held discussion with the educationists in the beginning of this year and introduced the new syllabus after a gap of 12 years. He also announced public examination for Plus One and consideration of the combined marks of Plus One and Plus Two for admission into higher courses. These decisions were welcomed by all. However, the Minister has come out with a new announcement that the marks of the Plus One public examination will not be taken for consideration for admission into higher degree courses and Plus Two marks alone will be considered. This has shocked the educationists.

Such a decision will only favour the private school managements, as they will concentrate in the Plus Two subjects in the Plus One year and also in conducting special classes for NEET. This will badly hit the government school students. The meeting urged the Minister to convene a meeting with educationists once again to discuss this issue.

Another resolution stated that late Jayalalithaa announced the abolition of the new pension scheme for the teachers and continuing with the old system. But, the present state regime did not implement the announcement of the late leader.

The humming of children can be heard as one takes the curve while driving from Cement Bridge towards Azad Gunj, Baramulla. The building on the left side of the curve is not just another school in town, but a repository of important memories. As an unrivaled landmark of old Baramulla, ""The College School"" has today become a vibrant campus of nine schools, from a 'Jabri School'.

Back in the day when Baramulla was the Gateway to Kashmir, Jabri schools were opened by Maharaja Hari Singh for imparting education to Kashmiris. However, people were reluctant to send their wards to these schools. To fulfill Maharaja's decree, administration led by Wazir-i-Wazarat -- the present-day divisional commissioner -- would literally drag children to these schools. And therefore the name, Jabri -- forced -- school was coined.

""Before 1947,"" says Khaliq Parveez, a local author and poet, ""there was a dire need of educated and skilled labour. So in order to fulfill this need, five Jabri schools were set up in Kashmir. This [Baramulla's Jabri School] was one among them.""

The College School of Baramulla.

There was a special team comprising of selected teachers and students who would work as a special task force to drag students out of their houses and bring them to school, the author says.

Over the period of time, the school witnessed the times of peace, the hours of unrest and the years of turmoil, but nothing has stopped its journey of great contribution to the society.

""This institution has a legacy of producing gems,"" says Irshada Jaan, headmistress of the school. ""It has been a kindergarten to such people who were destined to sit at the top layer of Kashmir.""

Taking out a thick and long register from her cupboard, she starts reading out the names: Abdul Rashid Bhatt, Labour Commissioner; Aijaz Ahmad Kakroo, Advisor to CM; Dr Abdul Hamid Zargar, ex-Skims Director; Mushtaq Ahmad Sheikh, Divisional Commissioner; Mir Tariq, Director School Education, and the list goes on.

The school was momentarily affected by the explosive political reaction in the old town. With time, says Muneer Ahmad, a former teacher of the school, the roll of students even came down to 58.

""Then in 2015,"" he says, ""a special team of young teachers was set up to reform this historic institution. I was also a member of that team.""

In order to improve the student footfall in the school, eight schools of nearby localities were clubbed together, including a high school, five primary schools and two middle schools. It took the roll to 108.

The team of teachers took to modern teaching techniques and personality development, with main focus on kindergartens.

""We collected funds to purchase the much required equipment and build facilities,"" Muneer says. ""These efforts bore fruit and soon school was buzzing with students again.""

The roll went on increasing and finally one day the school had to put up a notice No Vacancy to stop insisting parents to pressurize the school authorities to admit their wards there.

It's most likely the first and the only government school in the Valley where administration had to refuse admission due to the swelling roll of the students. In most of the government schools, however, the situation is just the opposite.

""The school had to introduce entrance test for the students at KG level, on the style of private schools, as the roll shot up to 300 plus,"" Muneer says.

But now, the campus housing nine institutes is struggling due to deficiency of accommodation and increasing number of students.

""We're studying in one school but we're tagged different, our mark sheets, our attendance all are separate,"" says Adnan Ali, a class X student. ""We feel overcrowded when all students are present. There, in fact, is no space left for some students even to sit in the classroom. We make shifts. When one class leaves for games, other students enter the room to attend a lecture there.""

The absence of labs and playground further disheartens students.

""I had formally written to the authorities on sanctioning of a building, conveyed it to the CEO also during his timely visits, but nothing happened,"" says Jameela Showkat, ex-headmistress of the school.

The only solution to this situation, says Abdul Ahad Wani, CEO Baramulla, is to de-club some schools from there.

The move might give a breathing space to the heritage school, but it's also feared to undo the hard work of the team of young teachers who played a yeomen's role to replace the growing hush with the increasing hum.

This has happened on account of various reasons, including affordability. Students who have transferred claimed that government schools were providing almost all facilities available in private schools at much lower costs.

Annual fee hike in private schools was cited as one of the key reasons for which students turned to government schools. Jyoti Kumari, who studies in Class VI and has come from Divya Vidya Niketan School, Mohammadpur, said, ""My parents put me in a government school because in private schools, the fee is hiked every year.""

Besides, she said, government school teachers gave more attention to students. ""Teachers give us extra time and attention -- we are sometimes called to school during holidays to study -- which is not the case in private schools,"" said Kumari.

A wide range of books in the school library and bigger playgrounds were other reasons that students, who have transferred to government schools, cited as positives. Nitish Verma, a Class VI student who has joined Government Senior Secondary School, Jharsa, from Shiv Public Senior Secondary School, Sohna, said, ""The library here is far better -- we have all types of books.""

A reply to an RTI from the Public Works Department (PWD) has revealed that rainwater harvesting (RWHs) systems are yet to be installed, or begin operations, in government schools and office buildings in the capital. This despite the National Green Tribunal (NGT) pulling up the Delhi government and asking it to file a response on the installation of RWH systems in schools and colleges in January.

In January, the NGT had sought implementation of its November 2017 order, asking government and private schools, and colleges to install rainwater harvesting systems at their own cost.

The rainwater harvesting guidelines of the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) state that RWH systems are important to prevent a fall in groundwater levels and to increase availability of potable water.

With the Delhi government yet to notify the January order, the NGT had directed DJB to inspect all residential and commercial buildings on plots of 500 sq metres and above in July. The tribunal had also ordered a fine of Rs 5 lakh as environment compensation on buildings that haven't installed the systems.

(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE).

Chronicle Reporter, Bhopal, In spite of many schemes including 'School Chalen Hum', running in the state, the number of children in government schools is declining year after year. This has been revealed in the report submitted by the school education department in the last assembly session.

In the last three years six lakh children have left the government schools. Chhindwara district tops in the number of dropouts, whereas Satna and Rewa are second and Shivpuri is in third place.

Children enrolled in government schools through school education department are counted through mid-day meal and free textbook distribution. The number of children in the year 2015-16 is 76,23,522, which fell to only 70,20,008 in the year 2017-18.

All the schemes are aimed at luring the children to the government school. Funds of crores are given under 'School Chale Hum' campaign by the Central Government. The entire budget is also being spent every year, but still the number of children is falling in schools.

Either this budget is being spent on paper, or the schemes are not proving to be effective in attracting children. In order to increase enrollment of children in government schools, the government is running schemes like free textbooks, uniforms and bicycles distribution. In this every year bill of crores rupees is wasted."

Suneetha and her classmates at Government Higher Primary School at Madrahalli in T. Narsipur taluk of Mysuru district have been reciting English rhymes in the last fortnight as the day to present their newly acquired English talent is fast approaching.

The school in the tiny village has around 101 students and each one has to speak English with their teachers, friends, and students throughout the day on January 1, 2019. While some are memorising simple rhymes, others are practising dance to Shakira's popular number 'Waka waka' (This Time For Africa).

This is a part of the 'English Empowerment Programme Fest' (EEPF) designed to improve knowledge of English among the students of government schools, said S. Mamatha, Deputy Director of Public Instruction, Mysuru district.

On New Year's day, the fest will be conducted in each of the 339 schools in the taluk, entirely in English -- from the prayer and dance, and action songs to the vote of thanks.

The EEPF is an ambitious project of the Education Department and it is being implemented on a pilot basis in all government schools in T. Narsipur taluk.

There are 26,000 students in the 339 government schools in the taluk. ""They are mainly from rural areas and they need a boost to improve their English. Hence, the department has selected T. Narsipur for the EEPF,"" Ms. Mamatha told The Hindu.

S. Swamy, Block Education Officer, said, ""We have already trained the teachers and cluster officer, and conducted meetings with the various teachers' associations. The motive behind the EEPF is to build confidence among the students to communicate in English.""

Though there is no official communication, the programme is being seen as a precursor to the State government's plan to introduce English medium in 1,000 government primary schools across the State.

The Education Department is thinking of extending the 'T. Narsipur model' across the State by training teachers through the Department of State Educational Research and Training (DSERT) and the District Institutes of Education and Training (DIET), another senior officer said."

This apart, the petitioner also wanted the court to set up a district level committee of officials known for their integrity and commitment to cause of student welfare to inspect all government and government-aided schools to ensure adequate toilet facilities are provided along with sanitary workers.

It was in 2010 that Delhi's Shri Ram School Maths and Computer Science teacher Sujata Sahu first went on a trip to Ladakh. It was a solo trek, and on the third day, she began to face extreme difficulty breathing and walking. The low oxygen in the altitudes as high as 16,100 feet had given her Pulmonary Edema.

She needed to rest, and with the help of two passing trekkers, she decided to spend the night at a remote village --

""A village which has no road access, is reachable only after a day's walk, and one which boasted of just one home with three occupants. I had neither medicines, nor the ability to call my family, nor access to medical care,"" says 50-year-old Sahu, a resident of Gurugram.

In was in these conditions that she saw two tiny schools which totally changed her life.

The first primary school -- Sku-Kaya -- had five students and two teachers. It had two rooms which were being rebuilt. While one teacher had stayed in the village, the other had gone to Leh to get uniforms and mid-day meal supplies for the school.

The second school had eight children and three teachers. It was two of them who had stopped to help Sahu when she was feeling sick. They had been walking back to Leh for textbooks and uniforms

The children were being taught from English books, which was very alien to them as they had no electricity or TV or telephone connectivity and thus, had no idea what the outside world was like. Having never set foot out of their villages, the exposure level of these children was very low.

.In Ladakh, even the summer months were bitingly cold but that didn't stop the kids from coming to school to learn. ""One of the children even brought his little brother along, who was barely two years old and the love and care with which all the children and the teacher took care of the child was a lesson for me,"" says Sahu.

What really hit her on that fateful Ladakh trip was the sheer drive of the Ladakhi people there to keep growing and improving their circumstances.

""Their determination to come to school and learn, the eagerness of the teacher to learn something new to teach his students, and the aspiration of the parents to educate their children was my inspiration to drop everything and help these amazing people,"" says Sahu.

From a regular school teacher to Ladakh's 'Iron Lady'

""My experience with the schools in Ladakh gave me a path to follow, one that I knew I could contribute to,"" says Sujata Sahu, who had spent 12 years in the corporate world before starting to work with children.

But she had been working at the Shri Ram School for just two years at the time, and leaving this job was the hardest decision she had to make in her life.

""I was planning to take on a seemingly herculean task, in possibly one of the toughest terrains of the world. I had no idea about where I would get the funds from and was also not very clear on how much of an impact I alone could make,"" she says.

Moreover, no one had done something like this before her in Ladakh. But thankfully, she found with herself two strong founding partners -- her husband, Sandeep Sahu, who had been trekking in the region for almost 35 years, and Dawa Jora, a Ladakhi businessman, all of whom had the strong conviction that something like this was really needed for the region.

In 2011, unable to find other NGOs to partner with, the three founders went on a three-day trek to one of the most isolated villages in Lingshed (in Ladakh), carrying 1500 kg of education material on 25 horses, and crossing three mountains at extreme temperatures as low as minus 15 degrees.

The treacherous and steep pass they crossed at an altitude of almost 17000 ft inspired the name of the '17000 ft foundation'.

As she started off on her mission to provide Ladakh schools with the right resources to further the education of their students, she realised this wouldn't be very easy.

""One of our biggest challenges was convincing corporates that even remote areas with extremely scattered and small populations needed support,"" says Sahu.

For the first two years, the foundation worked only with the founders' own funds and kind contributions of friends and family members.

""Though no non-profit organisations were willing to take on Ladakh as a region, we were given support in the form of knowledge, pedagogy and even a large donation of books for our first 100 libraries,"" she says.

Sujata Sahu's undying passion to help the people of Ladakh earned her the nickname of the 'Iron Lady'.

How Ladakh poses a unique set of education problems

India is a geographical anomaly as it has every type of topographical setup, each of which comes with its own challenges. This makes it extremely difficult for the government to cater to every type of problem that can arise in this vast country owing to accessibility issues, extreme weather conditions etc.

Ladakh has almost a 1000 schools across Leh and Kargil, spread across 60,000 sq km of harsh mountains. Catering to a school going population of under 40,000 children, the average school strength of these schools is barely 25 students across the two districts, explains Sahu.

Teachers themselves come from remote villages and have to travel long distances for training, school supplies and even basic administrative functions, leading to long absences and shortage of staff, she adds.

Also, ""While teachers are given basic residential training during winters as well as in-service training, most of the trainings are not contextualized for the uniqueness of the Ladakhi education system,"" she says.

The extreme weather also adds to the problems with schools being shut for severe winters for three months in a year when the roads become inaccessible due to thick snow and temperatures as low as minus 35-40 degrees.

""Incredibly, despite the remoteness of the region, every little hamlet which has even 10 school going children has a tiny government school with teachers in attendance, thanks to the local administration. A little wonder then, that 89% of the schools in Ladakh are govt schools with the private schools present in just a handful of the larger villages,"" she says.

""What is commendable is that all these 900 plus schools are functional and have qualified teachers in attendance. What is even more remarkable is that every child in every village goes to school, managing to at least complete middle school,"" Sahu adds

However, it is only the larger villages which have middle schools and after passing class 5, children have to walk around two hours to get to school to continue their education. Public transport isn't available in such terrain and the army provides army vans for commuting.

.Despite the presence of these govt schools, the community here wants a better life and quality education for their children so they can get better jobs. This aspiration makes them send their very young children, often as young as three years old, to be enrolled in private schools, often extremely far away from their homes.

""Cut off from their villages and parents for months in a year, these children grow up in dormitories, hostels or with other families. Lacking the care and guidance they need in their growing up years, this leads to large-scale dropouts and a population of youth who are unable to go back to their villages,"" Sahu explains.

17000 ft works in these remote villages by improving existing govt schools so that parents would have faith in them and stop sending their children away so far that it disconnects them from their roots.

How voluntourism is helping 17000 ft foundation grow

Sujata Sahu started her non-profit organisation with just the founders and a few volunteers who were given the task to survey the entire length and breadth of Ladakh.

The team mapped around 600 schools after a seven-month-long study. Some of these schools had been bomb shelters during the Kargil war and the buildings had to be shifted multiple times.

The success of the volunteer programmes helped the foundation grow and each of these schools has been geo-mapped for travellers to find.

""We, very early on, piloted our volunteering programmes to involve outsiders in the work of our organization and to also understand if people could be encouraged to donate to such a cause. The enthusiasm and support shown by complete strangers told us that we were on the right track,"" says Sahu.

""Our volunteers, who are our brand ambassadors, then carried the story of our work into their workplaces and CSR then became our main source of funding. Voluntourism, as it is called today, still forms a good 25% of our annual budget and helps us maintain our backend costs,"" she adds.

Why playgrounds are so important in Ladakh schools

Though the govt schools all over Ladakh have proper buildings, they lack the proper facilities that make a school a happy, joyous and welcoming place for children. And in a remote location with rugged ground, a playground comes as a blessing.

""In these remote villages, where nothing is available, there are absolutely no options for children to play with. Though these schools have well-qualified teachers and very low pupil-teacher-ratio, parents often judge the performance of a school based just on the facilities they provide,"" says Sahu.

Thus, parents see the existence of a playground in govt schools as a very good incentive to not send away their kids to far-off private schools.

""Today, 17000 ft foundation has setup playgrounds in 140 schools with colourful swings, slides, see saws etc. many of which the team had to carry over horseback for days to reach our remotest schools,"" she says.

Solving the problem of no native language storybooks in Ladakh

A big aspect of Ladakh education that surprised Sujata Sahu was how the kids learned in English medium schools even though they have no exposure to the foreign language. Their native language was Bhoti.

""To add to this burden, children also have to study their local language as well an additional Hindi/Urdu from grade 1,"" says Sahu.

To enable the children to read better and get comfortable with the number of languages they have to deal with, 17000 ft set up libraries in 230 schools with simple and easy to read story books in English, Hindi and Urdu.

""However, sadly, there are absolutely no story books in Bhoti for children to read. Sensing this gap, we undertook a mission to translate storybooks from English to Bhoti.""

""In 2015, we launched our first phase where we translated 21 titles and published 21,000 storybooks for distribution into 300 schools,"" says Sahu.

This year again, the organisation not only translated another 20 titles, but also added illustrations and changed narratives to make them more relatable to the children of Ladakh.

What has 17000 ft foundation achieved so far?

In the span of just six years, Sujata Sahu's organisation has accomplished much.

""Today, 17000 ft works with 250 govt schools across Leh and Kargil and we are already seeing a reverse trend of children coming back from private schools back to the govt schools in their villages,"" says Sahu.

The organisation has set up libraries in 230 schools, playgrounds in 140 schools, and trained over 1500 teachers in various methodologies with a team which is in Ladakh every winter for training teachers.

17000 ft foundation has conducted multiple community workshops in 125 villages with over 10,000 villagers contributing to our workshops and programmes in the schools.

Recently, the organisation electrified and digitized 120 schools in Leh and Kargil, providing solar electricity and tablets with customized digital learning content, a TV, and a server to provide offline data syncing.

The DigiLab project is the non-profit's most ambitious programme bringing offline hybrid digital learning solutions to the remote villages.

The well-furnished digital labs supported by workshops from the team throughout the year can help the students learn independently with guidance from their teachers.

How crowfunding is helping 17000 ft foundation

Crowdfunding is increasingly coming up as a very important resource collection measure.

""17000 ft has been involved with ImpactGuru.com in multiple projects, the latest being the funding of a Playground for a very remote school in Kargil. We had also fundraised for our Bhoti Book Translation project through ImpactGuru.com and managed to raise more than we needed,"" says Sahu.

Fundraising platforms are great for helping nonprofits fund small projects that have tangible goals and timelines. It is an excellent way to help get the word out to potential supporters and garner more support for the non-profit, says the Iron Lady of Ladakh.

Future of 17000 ft foundation

Before 17000 ft was established, there was little or no attention on the remote schools of Ladakh, and today with all our work and efforts and the participation of the local communities, govt schools are looking and performing better and we are seeing a reverse trend of children coming back to their villages and govt schools.

""When we started, one of our biggest challenges was encouraging donors, volunteers, foundations and even corporates to focus on remote regions of Ladakh. Today, however, we are confident that our model is working and we can get the support we need,"" beams Sahu.

Sujata Sahu now wants to take this model to other remote and mountainous regions, like Arunachal Pradesh, or the remote areas of Himachal.

""We feel that we are closer now to our vision of a better life and education for all children, regardless of geography or terrain,"" she says.

These days, Sagar Singh frets about the academic future of his daughter who studies at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Delhi's Cantonment area.

""There are hardly any teachers there. She often tells me that kids sit clueless as teachers are forced to teach subjects they themselves don't understand well. I wonder if she will remain underprepared for challenges ahead in life, he said.

Singh sums up the crisis in Delhi government schools which have only 35,034 regular teachers against a sanctioned strength of 64,096. A shortage of 29,062 regular hands (45.34 per cent) has left the teachers exhausted and students vulnerable. A total of 15,04,627 students are enrolled in 1,024 schools run by the AAP government.

There are 22,016 guest teachers that take the existing number to 57,050 but they work on daily-wage contracts that must be renewed every year. Even if guest teachers are factored in, Delhi government schools are short of 7,046 (10.99 per cent) teaching hands.

Saroj Sharma, a primary teacher at a Greater Kailash school said, On several occasions, I have had to teach higher-secondary class subjects. We are overworked and stressed. We are filling in for many others. School heads are aware of the crisis, but nothing has been done.

Neeru Loriya, a teacher coordinator at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in RK Puram Sector 4, also said that several subjects are not being taught properly. Barkha Kumari, a Class VI student at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Rohini said, My Class has 50 students. We need more teachers to ensure we're taught well. It's not that the government isn't working at all. After the Aam Aadmi Party came to power in Delhi in 2014, the government has built 48 schools.

But where are the teachers? We have sent several reminders to the government. Nothing has happened, said a teacher at a Pusa Road school. Most regular posts are filled through promotions. But they have not happened since 2013, he said.

Sanjay Goel, head of the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) told Mail Today, We're aware of the problem. Each year, guest teachers are being enrolled to minimise the shortage. Avdhesh Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, also said, There is a problem. But the government is hiring guest teachers to tackle it.

But facts tell a different tale. In July, the Delhi government had announced that schools would get 9,000 guest teachers by mid-August. It did not happen. Hiring guest teachers is anyway no solution to this huge crisis, said Ajay Veer Singh, general secretary of the last Government School Teachers' Association (GSTA) elected in 2014. GSTA elections have not taken place since 2014.

So its demands have not been heard effectively, its office-bearers claim. We have asked for elections. But education department officials have not paid any heed. The future of government school teachers is dark, said Singh. GSTA has a three-year term.

He also described Kashmere Gate as an ""incubation centre"" for universities, saying it is a coincidence that several varsities, which were based in the area, are now moving to bigger campuses.

""We had launched the 'happiness curriculum' in government schools. Now we will launch the entrepreneurship curriculum from the next session onwards for secondary and senior secondary students.

""We need to instill confidence among our children in school right from the beginning of secondary education that after completing their education, they should aspire to be job givers and not job seekers,"" Sisodia said.

He explained that after at least 15 years of formal education, if a large number of the youth are not confident of creating something new, which can give them gainful return and add value to the economy, then as a society ""we are failing to nurture their full potential"".

Sisodia said, barring a few exceptions, once a child completes elementary schooling and joins the secondary classes, his entire orientation, which is largely shaped by the teachers and parents, is to secure good marks in exams, get admission in a good college and get a job with decent pay package.

This is considered a trajectory of success and anyone who either secures less marks or fails to join college or fails to secure a job is deemed as unsuccessful, he said.

""This trajectory is obsolete in today's day and age when new ideas and technologies are driving our way of life.

""The curriculum shall be based on a four-fold framework-- inspire through stories and case studies of entrepreneurial journeys, educate through self designed micro research, involve through local community and facilitate by supporting in developing ideas into projects,"" said Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio.

To take this idea forward, he has directed the secretary education to set up a high-powered working group having senior faculties from SCERT/DIET, school principals and individuals having domain expertise as members.

""SCERT Delhi will organise a conference in January where it will invite organisations and individuals to present their ideas for the design of the entrepreneurship curriculum as per the framework of the government to a working group.

While the teachers welcome the innovation wholeheartedly as it does magic in schools, experts opine that video lessons could be used only in addition to classroom learning.

Initially, the department had embedded QR code in the textbooks for classes I, VI, IX and XI - syllabus was revamped in this academic year - and each lesson had at least three QR codes which upon scanning would take you to video lessons of that lesson, explained an official from the department who is involved in the process.

The department also has a YouTube channel with 1.18 lakh subscribers and is planning to launch a 24-hour free satellite education channel, said the official.

""The basic idea is to evoke interest among the students and to make them attend classes regularly. Also, concepts which are considered as difficult by the students, were made into videos to unwrap its complexity,"" the official added.

The video lessons in turn has done magic in the schools as most of the students who were difficult to find in classrooms, were not just found on regular basis, but also noticed paying keen attention to the lessons, said a government schoolteacher on condition of anonymity.

A teacher, who teachers Mathematics, said most of the problems which, in general, students would struggle to understand were solved, within matter of time as the videos explain it with pictorial representations and sound effects.

""Teaching the students to pronounce difficult words has become a fun task now for both students and teachers. But, the only issue that we face is that videos were created only for a few concepts and not for entire lessons,"" T Arulanantham of Tamil Nadu high and higher secondary teachers' association said.

With videos, students can listen to it numerous times until they clearly understand it, while a teacher would not be able to spare much time to explain same doubts during the class hours as they would have to move on to next chapter, he added.

""The video lessons would definitely be useful in understanding difficult concepts, but it should not replace the textbooks completely. How will a student be able to reproduce the concepts in textual manner while giving exams, upon listening only to videos. How will they be able to learn the spelling of words without reading and writing habits,"" district president of Tamil Nadu Post Graduate Teachers Association GR Chentooran questioned.

Meanwhile, PB Prince Gajendra Babu, an educationist, said the video lessons should only be used in addition to reading and it should never be used as a tool to replace teacher as nothing would match the live interaction between teacher and students.

The model school initiative at GLPS Ravindranagar has been supported by Shyamala Prabhu and Kavita Shastry from the Institute of Indian Interior Designers and organisations such as Let's Endorse, Smile Charitable Trust, and The Aravani Art Project.

In a special interaction with Deccan Chronicle, Yaduveer said that infrastructural development of government schools was essential to help students benefit better from the system. Excerpts:

Experts point out offering better opportunities for students in government schools as well keeping the system of public education alive. How can this be done?

Going forward from initiatives like the School and Student Transformation model put forth by TAPF, encouraging children to grow up in a sustainable environment and ensuring they get access to experiential learning platforms is important. A transformation towards getting better in all ways - in terms of education, infrastructure and advanced learning prospects is essential for government schools to be more appealing to students and parents.

Do you believe beginning English medium classes or schools in the public education sector would improve government school enrolments and thereby quality of education offered as well?

Merely changing the medium to English would not improve the system at a larger scale. Even though learning English would help students get recognised as a global citizen, one cannot neglect the local language and culture and hence learning in Kannada is equally important. Knowledge in more languages right from the formative years is always good as it helps better brain development. However, a system to offer both Kannada and English mediums and either of them as a second language should be in place. The final call should be left open to each student/parent catering to their individual needs.

Will you prefer sending your son to a government school for education?

That will be a matter of practicality and we'll take a call depending on what is right for him at that point of time. He's just one year old now. I've seen several government schools that are very good and way better than their private counterparts with an enabled and progressive outlook. Good things take time and hopefully with such initiatives, government schools will retain its past glory. To be very honest, we haven't given this much thought as to how we should have already."

The biggest challenge was to make education interesting for them.

He started using his mobile phone and tablet to teach students rhymes and realised that their interest levels increased sharply. Seeing Ravi's performance, a local MLA supported him with cash prize of Rs 1 lakh which he used to buy a projector and speakers etc.

Seeing its performance, the state government rewarded the school with a cash prize of ₹ 1.2 lakh in 2015-16. ""I used the money to buy audio video gadgets and transformed the school into a smart class. I started using the audio-visual mode of communication to teach other subjects as well. The attendance began improving. Now there are 325 students in the school. Today, the students don't want to miss any class,"" he said.

This is not the lone example.

Alpa Nigam, headmaster of a school in Gorakhpur, said when she joined in 2010, very few students were enrolled and most of them ran away after lunch time. To catch their interest, Alpa too started using a mobile phone and speakers.

Impressed with her dedication, Rotary Club and other well-wishers donated a projector, which is being used to screen educational movies for students. Now the school has three laptops and learning is fun here.

Sushil Singh, principal of primary school Gulriha in Harak block of Barabanki district said, ""We had received ₹1.2 lakh from the state government as part of an excellence award. We used the prize money to buy a projector, speakers and an inverter and started smart classes. The results have been encouraging. We hope other schools will follow our model instead of waiting for government assistance.""

The number of government schools in Uttar Pradesh running smart classes had been slowly but steadily growing, said a basic education department official. He said this was largely due to efforts of individual teachers who were seeking help from good Samaritans or opting for crowd funding to arrange the money needed to digitize the teaching process.

At a time when the state government is still to make any budgetary provision for running smart classes in schools, these teachers are doing their best to equip their institutions with the latest technologies and compete with private institutions mushrooming in small districts.

Now the basic education department is preparing a database of all such schools.

""The findings, so far, have come as a surprise. Nearly 1,200 schools (out of the total 1.54 lakh in the state) are running smart classes,"" said director, basic education, Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh. He said it was equally surprising that the state capital was yet to catch up with other districts in this respect.

He said that most of these institutions were concentrated in far off districts like Gorakhpur or smaller ones such as Hardoi and Sitapur.

""Gorakhpur has the maximum number (124) of smart class schools. Hardoi is a close second with 122 schools, and Sitapur is next with 120.

Singh said that by integrating technology with education, these schools had transformed the teaching-learning process, making it far more interesting.

""It has helped a lot in increasing student retention. For instance, now a science teacher doesn't just talk about blood circulation but actually shows the students how blood is circulated in the body via arteries and veins,"" he said.

Also, the education department is planning to extend the Government Model Primary School (GMPS) in Sector 49 to middle level (till class VIII). This was stated by the officials from the education department in its preliminary plan as final decision will be taken only after conducting a proper survey of these schools and the nearby schools after the re-transfer process is done.

The eight primary schools being re-transferred are- GPS -12, GPS - Bapudham Colony, GPS- Buterla, GPS- Mauli Complex, GPS- Railway Colony, GPS- Manimajra - I, GPS- Manimajra - II, and GMPS - 49 (the newest among all schools).

""There are the schools which do not have good infrastructure and have less number of students, so we will be adjusting students in nearby schools. Also, the schools which are large in spaces will be further upgraded,"" said an official from the UT education department requesting anonymity.

The shifting, as per teachers may prove to be an unsuccessful task as the schools, especially in Mauli complex, railway colony and Manimajra are already overcrowded.

The schools that will get prior attention from the education department include Government Primary School in Maulijagran, Government Primary School in railway colony and Manimajra-II as these are running in worst conditions of all. GPS in Mauli and railway colony are not even having their own buildings and are being run in rented buildings.

In a reality check, the TOI had reported how these three schools had poor infrastructure as they are so small that they cannot even afford to have furniture in classrooms and accommodate students.

The department is also planning to close Government Primary School in Buterla, Sector 41 due to low enrollment of students. ""The building can be put to some other good use. There is no point in running a separate school for a few students,"" the official added.

The school has 130 students at present studying in nursery class and classes I-V.

These schools further lack basic facilities like playgrounds and teachers have to be on toes to ensure students don't get injured as few swings that lie in the corner of small yards. Thus, making it unsafe for students. In some schools situated in Mauli complex and railway colony, they utilize the adjoining neighbourhood park as they don't have their own playgrounds. This, however, raises security concerns for children, as the park is also used by people and vendors.

GMPS will further be upgraded to middle level. Moreover, the school's building needs attention too. The other seven government primary schools have been running under the MC Chandigarh since 2010."

The computer professionals said they joined the schools in June 2018, but were paid a month's salary only in November this year, a day before Diwali. The assistants claim their complaints to CM, deputy CM (who also holds the charge of the education department) and public grievance cell have failed to provide them a relief.

The assistants said they were hired by Intelligent Communication Systems India Limited (ICSIL) and sent to Delhi government's DoE, which, in turn, deployed them in various government schools.

""When we did not get our salary for three months, the company that hired us told us to contact the DoE. When we talked to the education department officials, they said paying salaries was the responsibility of the company that outsourced the manpower. We have only been shuttling between the two offices,"" said an IT Assistant, requesting anonymity.

The job responsibility of the assistants include managing the attendance of students and teachers, monitoring the e-mails, orders and circulars coming from the DoE and sharing them with the head of the school.

The education department had initially hired 1,068 IT Assistants and later advertised for another 670 more computer professionals for schools that have more than 1,200 students and thus have more work load. While the 1,068 IT Assistants, hired for two years, have been getting their salaries regularly, the 670 have not been paid.

""Despite being working hard all these months, sometimes on Sundays and holidays as well, our salaries have not been released. We all our working under duress and are sustaining ourselves by taking loans from friends, families and even from banks. We are under severe financial pressure,"" said another assistant.

A representative from ICSIL said the IT Assistants were first hired for three months and in June, it was decided to extend their contract for one year.

Chatting about the upcoming examination and reciting multiplication tables, they are getting ready for another day at the Government Senior Secondary School here.

From the outside, there's nothing extraordinary about the scene but as you enter, a pleasant surprise awaits.

Neatly furnished classrooms, a library and lab form part of an encouraging attempt to give these children quality education infrastructure, all thanks to an experiment by Brahm Prakash Shastri, a former principal of the school.

By bypassing administrative procedures and seeking help directly from NGOs, and tapping various corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, Shastri's endeavours have ended up benefiting teachers as well as some 20 government schools in the district. And it's the power of community, he believes, which has helped turn his simple idea into gold, in the space of four years.

As a rule, to channel CSR funds, corporates and NGOs must approach the education department but this is a process that can, and often does, take a long time. ""And all the donations don't necessarily reach us,"" admits Shastri, who eventually sought the assistance of the big companies, with due approval from the education department. Now, the govt school in Basai has an impressive science and computer lab, an RO water purifier for clean drinking water, refurbished toilets, a diesel genset and split air-conditioners, besides well-furnished classes and staff rooms. Behind all this is teamwork.

Villagers, for example, have contributed by whitewashing the walls. ""Several local NGOs approached us for basic things, like installing RO and donating books. We then asked the companies to invest directly and they have helped (with) the entrance, walking tracks and boundary walls,"" Shastri adds.

According to a notification under Section 135 of The Companies Act 2013, it is compulsory for companies with a net worth of Rs 500 crore or more, turnover of Rs 1,000 crore or more, or net profit of Rs 5 crore or more, in any given financial year, to spend two percent of their net profit on CSR programmes.

And following the successful Basai model, government schools in Carterpuri, Jacobpura, Tikri, Shakurpur, Bhondsi and Tikli (and one in Sarsa, Bhiwani), have undergone renovation. The Tikri school, TOI found, is getting a new washroom for boys, girls and handicapped children (courtesy a North American real estate firm). Tulsiram, the principal here, happily acknowledges the transformation. ""Our school was initially in a very bad condition - there was no sewer connection and the boundary wall was in a dilapidated state,"" he recalls, sitting in his office-cum-staff room. ""We are not aware of the expenditure, but this CSR activity has brought a positive change in the school.""

Indeed, in two years, CSR funds have ensured that the Tikri govt school is not lacking when it comes to the bare essentials, among them a water tank, utensils for midday meals, a level playground and washrooms.

Dinesh Shastri, the district education officer, has visited 20 such schools across the state and claims that facilities are on a par with those in private schools. ""The drop-out rate has come down heavily too,"" he says.

However, for all the progress in infrastructure development, there are still more than 30,000 vacancies for teachers in the state. The data report card of the District Information System for Education (U-DISE) corroborates this fact, pointing out the acute shortage of teachers and principals in Haryana.

Still, with over 540 government schools in the district, there is no dearth of corporate majors who are prepared to come forward and do their bit towards make the learning ecosystem more welcoming and fun for children."

Meanwhile with the government announcing winter vacations, students of these government schools were in a dilemma as they have not received their textbooks yet from the school authorities.

The annual examinations in government primary and middle schools culminated last month but the promoted students have not been provided with various textbooks by School Education Department (SED).

The teachers in various government-run-schools said that there is a non-availability of mathematics, history and geography books for the 9th standard and mathematics, Science in 10th standard also.

The teachers also said that the students from 5th to 8th standard are also without mathematics, history and civics textbooks.

Official sources in SED said that the Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education (JKBOSE) was probably supposed to order 50 lakh textbooks but this year the department ordered these books late.

""However the board have received some of the books but few books are yet to be received and the School Education Department,"" he said.

""SED has given a deadline to the JKBOSE for availing the pending books of various classes till December 05, sources said adding, ""The school authorities have been also asked to distribute the pending books on 15th of December to all respective students.""

He said that the JKBOSE was also directed to provide books and stationery to the school authorities of Ladakh district first because of the road closure issues.

Lamenting on the non-availability of various books in Srinagar district he said there is a huge non-availability of various books from Ist to 10th standard in the district.

Chairman, JKBOSE, Veena Pandita said, ""We have science books available but mathematics and Urdu books are pending for two classes."" ""Actually the trucks carrying the books are stuck somewhere in the highway. But in coming two days we are hopeful, we will receive these books too,"" she assured. She said that for the rest of the classes there was no shortage or non-availability of any book.

Pertinently, the State Government on Thursday announced winter vacations for all schools in Kashmir division and winter zones of Jammu division from December-6 to March- 03 2019 upto 8th standard and December-17 to March February 23 2019 for 9th standard onwards."

For most part of the 14 years of his life, Priyanshu Singh, a class 9 student of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Yamuna Vihar, had no clue why his female friends complain about mood swings and abdominal pain for a day or two every month. Whenever the girls declined to participate in sports activities, he would mock and even crack jokes at their expense.

But all of that changed this September.

That was when Singh understood that it happens when the girls are either going through premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or on their monthly period cycle. ""While I knew what periods are, I was unaware about the difficulties women face when they are on their natural cycle. I used to laugh at my friends when they would complain about stomachache and mood swings. Now, I understand that mood swings are because of the PMS and it's normal to have stomach pain while they are on their periods,"" he said.

The change in mindset and the awareness was only possible because the school organised a workshop on 'menstrual awareness' in collaboration with non-governmental organisation (NGO) Sachhi Saheli. ""It was overwhelming to see the students, especially boys, asking menstruation-related queries with so much confidence. At the end of the workshop, the boys distributed packets of sanitary napkins among girls without any hesitation and pledged to make the campus period-friendly,"" RP Singh, principal of the school, said.

Now, the school is planning to organise a workshop for parents as well. ""Most of these students come from families where such discussions are prohibited. We are planning to organise a workshop for parents to sensitise them and encourage them to discuss these topics with their children,"" he said.

But their school is not an exception.

As many as 30 co-educational government schools have approached the NGO this year to organise workshops in order to sensitise students about menstruation. Till July this year, the NGO was conducting these workshops only in all girls' schools. ""We wanted to impart basic education about menstruation to students studying in government schools. We had contacted the Directorate of Education (DoE) last year and briefed them about our plan. The DoE gave us permission to conduct these workshops in girls' schools running under the Delhi government and the civic bodies. But, this year we started receiving requests from co-ed schools as well. We have already covered around 10 co-ed schools in the last four months and it has turned out to be a wonderful experience,"" said Dr Surbhi Singh, a gynecologist and founder of Sachhi Saheli.

During the workshops, the students are told about the science behind menstruation and the myths surrounding it. The girls are also taught basic hygiene that should be maintained during periods. ""We do not discuss about menstruation with boys at home or school and still expect them to be sensitive and supportive. It's very important to remove stigmas and taboos attached to periods from their minds. That's why we show them sanitary napkins and explain the importance of their use. We also tell boys about the physical and mental strains girls go though during their menstrual cycle,"" Singh said.

At another co-ed school in Nanakpura, a class 10 student Sagar Malik said he gifted his mother a pack of sanitary pads after attending the workshop. ""I had come to know about the issues women face in case they use cloth instead of sanitary pads during their periods. I requested the teacher in charge at my school to give a packet for my mother because I did not know what she uses. I have never heard anything about menstruation at home. When I gave her the packet, she looked shocked. But when I told her what I had learnt at school, she looked happy and relieved. She even called me a Padman,"" the 14-year-old said.

Meanwhile, a group of boys at a government co-ed school in Vasant Kunj has pledged to educate people in their localities about ""menstrual health"". ""We have decided to go from door to door in our localities and tell people the importance of maintaining hygiene during periods to avoid infections,"" said Lalit Singh, one of the students.

Girls, too, are happy with the change.

Divya Singh, a class 9 student at a school in Janakpuri, said she used to bring a 'black polythene bag' to carry the packet of sanitary napkins the school distributes under the Centre's Kishori Shakti Yojna. The girls in her school would collect their packets from the medical room after classes got over. Under the Kishori Shakti Yojna, girl students, between the ages of 11 and 18, are distributed a sanitary napkin packet every month in government schools across the country.

However, Singh and her classmates have now asked the teacher to distribute the pack of sanitary napkins in the classrooms. ""We had never uttered the word period in the presence of our male classmates before. It was the first time when a group, having more boys than girls, was sitting and discussing the myths and taboos attached to menstruation. Things have comparatively changed. Now, we do not have to think hundred times before talking about periods in school at least like we have to do at home,"" she said.

According to a survey published in Journal of Family and Community Medicine (JFCM) in September, 40% girls remained absent from school during their menstruation for reasons such as lack of privacy at school, source of information on menstruation and anxiety about leakage, and staining of their uniform. The survey was conducted on 600 girls studying in government schools in Delhi.

Experts say it's important to impart basic knowledge about menstruation at schools. ""It's important to make both make both genders aware of the science behind menstruation. While for girls, good menstrual hygiene can help prevent any kind of pelvic inflammatory diseases and infections, such talk sessions are equally important for boys to remove all the taboos and preconceived notions about periods. They should understand that it's a part of a girls' life and absolutely normal,"" said Dr Anuradha Kapur, a senior gynecologist at Max hospital in Saket.

Sanjay Goel, director of the DoE, said the government will encourage more co-ed schools to come forward and organise such workshops."

When Shobha Suryanarayan, a volunteer with Acharyas for a Better Community (ABC), first approached Vijayanagar Lower Primary School in Whitefield, the students could barely string together a sentence in English. The school had over 50 children from classes 1 to 5, but there was only one teacher and a headmistress (HM) to teach all of them. Children in classes 1, 2 and 3 would sit together; they were taught by the HM once she finished her official work. Children in classes 4 and 5 would sit together, and were taught by the other teacher, says Shobha.

ABC, an NGO based in Bengaluru, is driven by volunteers who go to teach in government schools. They also get CSR funding to meet each school's individual requirements.

At Vijayanagar school, the teachers asked ABC to take over English classes. In last November, ABC appointed a full-time teacher in the school, whose salary is paid with CSR funds. Within just three months, there was a huge difference, says Shobha. ""The students spoke in English, and even performed a skit in English. When I first had gone in, they had no idea about sentence structure,"" she says. ABC also appointed a janitor since students themselves used to clean the school, including its toilets, up till then.

ABC is also refurbishing the school, and setting up a peer lab and library there, with CSR funds. ""We have built a dining area and washing area for the kids. The ground has been levelled and cleaned up so that children have a safe place to play. We also raised the compound wall and put up barbed fencing to prevent anti-social activities that used to be common in the school premises at night,"" says Shobha. CSR funds also cover students' breakfast, which has resulted in both higher attendance rates and better attention span among students. Overall ABC has got Rs 40 lakhs as CSR funds for Vijayanagar School.

In Pattandur Agrahara School behind ITPL, the student enrolment went up from less than 10, to 96 now. The school which was in threat of being shut down, was rebuilt by ABC. ABC's volunteers also teach in the school. The school's transformation has most benefited children from the migrant construction labourer community who live nearby. Similar was the case with Nallurhalli Government Primary School.

ABC is one among the many volunteer-driven initiatives in the city that's changing government schools, one at a time. In addition to registered trusts like ABC, there are also informal volunteering groups, like one led by Anupama Harish in Malleswaram.

The shortage of competent teachers in government schools, lack of functional infrastructure, and difficult familial circumstances are causing many students to perform poorly in schools or to drop out altogether. Many low-income families also spend a large part of their income to send their children to private schools, in hope of better education, especially in English. However, studies show that low-income private schools are hardly any better than government schools in terms of learning outcomes. It's in this scenario that volunteer interventions are strengthening the public school system in Bengaluru.

Many volunteering organisations start off without much of a plan.

Malleswaram volunteers had come together when local resident Anupama Harish proposed her idea of volunteering in the 'Malleswaram & Suttha Muttha' Facebook group. Of nearly 12,000 members in the group then, many responded. Since 2015-16, Anupama's team has been teaching Mathematics in the Malleswaram 18th Cross Boys' High School.

The group has three volunteer-teachers for Maths each in 8th, 9th and 10th standards. Each teacher picks a favourite topic in Maths to teach - algebra, geometry etc. At any time, the group has 10-15 volunteers.

The school initially asked Anupama to get the permission of the Block Education Officer (BEO). The BEO was happy to have volunteer-teachers since the school had teacher shortage, especially in Maths. Maths was also the subject in which majority of the 10th standard students had failed in the previous year, in board exams.

After discussions with the school's head teacher, the group got a timetable. From this year, they have also been teaching Social Studies here. The team has developed a structured syllabus. They also update their progress in a common document so that there is no overlap in what's taught.

Having a structured syllabus is important since volunteers may otherwise teach random topics, concurs Jayashree Narayanan, who was a teacher-volunteer with the NGO OBLF (One Billion Literates Foundation). Jayashree, by her own initiative, had approached Kaikondrahalli Government School a few years back, interested in being a volunteer-teacher. She then became part of OBLF, which signed MoUs with the schools to allow its volunteer-teachers there.

Jayashree then found interested volunteers through her personal networks. OBLF volunteers have worked with five schools in Sarjapur Road area so far, but the volunteering has been stalled for this year because of the lack of committed volunteers. Jayashree plans to resume the programme next year.

OBLF volunteers start off the academic year by assessing students on spoken and written English. ""So we know where the kids stand, and we teach them from that level. We give another assessment at the end of the year to see how far the kids have progressed,"" says Jayashree. The team gets only a one-hour slot in a day. Usually there are two volunteers teaching English in each grade - one teachers three hours and the other two hours per week, so that there is continuity. Jayashree says schools have been open to them since they come from a registered NGO, with proper permissions.

ABC had started informally in 2016, as a group of 10-15 people. They initially had difficulty getting CSR funds, but this changed with their success in Pattandur Agrahara School. In late 2017, ABC registered as a Trust since corporates would fund only formal entities. Currently the NGO is a loosely structured organisation with a CSR group, operations group, social media group etc, all driven by volunteers. The organisation has about 50 volunteers in the city, and has worked with around 20 schools so far.

ABC starts engaging with a school by holding sports or art events, or by donating school bags etc to the students. During events, the team identifies the requirements of the school by talking to teachers and students. ""When we hold an event, they understand that we are serious. We list down requirements and create a proper project for the school,"" says Vikas Chandra, co-founder of ABC.

The requirements are put up on ABC's Facebook page, where people interested in volunteering or donating respond. The NGO also approaches corporates for CSR funds to do building repairs, set up new infrastructure, appoint teachers, distribute bags to students etc. It takes a good deal of time and effort to get CSR funds approved, says Chandra.

Volunteers say that working with high school or PUC students is more difficult as they often lack basic knowledge in subjects. Brijesh of the Malleswaram group says teaching 10th standard students was an uphill task. ""They didn't even know basic maths such as addition and subtraction. But we made sure that students who would come to 10th standard from 8th and 9th standards would get the basics right,"" he says.

Working with primary school students is more fruitful than working with high school or PUC students, opine volunteers. Younger children are more receptive to learning, and can get a good foundation at the appropriate age, they say. ""We want to enter the primary school sector now. If we strengthen the basics of primary school children, teaching high school students will become easier for our own volunteers,"" says Anupama.

Many students also come from very unstable backgrounds, such as abusive/alcoholic fathers, along with socio-economic backwardness or migrant nature of parents jobs. They need to be motivated to study, say volunteers. Schools get very little amounts for annual maintenance, and hence lack essential stationery materials and staff. In some schools, toilets are locked up or students are made to clean those due to the lack of cleaning staff. ""In a class of 30-40 students, only 10-15 would really want to learn. The other children don't even want to come to school,"" says Jayashree.

Coordinating between volunteers and schools is a challenge for volunteering organisations. Volunteers come from varying backgrounds, but most are homemakers or working professionals. While homemakers are available to volunteer on weekdays, coordinating with professionals on their time slots at the school can be a challenge. Negotiating with the school to get good time slots for teaching, having the school not cancel a time slot randomly, and having committed volunteers who go to the school regularly, are all challenges. Most volunteer organisations ask its members to commit to teaching in a school for at least a year.

The volunteering system acts as a self-sustaining system, where the interested, committed volunteers stay on their own. Volunteering groups say that most volunteers who stay on are well-qualified and passionate about teaching.

However, finding committed volunteers who are fluent in both English and Kannada has been difficult in Sarjapur Road area, says Jayashree. ""Many volunteers, once they start teaching, realise that not knowing Kannada is a barrier in reaching out to primary school children, since these children are very young.""

Some volunteers at ABC circumvented this problem by taking a six-month course in Kannada to learn the basics. ""This leads to a reverse teaching process in the class. Students love that they can teach Kannada to volunteers,"" says Shobha. Sometimes, if a student in the class knows Hindi, the child will act as a translator between the Hindi-speaking volunteer and other students.

Gaining entry into a school in the first place can be difficult as well. ""We struggle with regulatory challenges - BEO permissions, HMs not wanting to cooperate etc. For teachers, it is judgement on their work when we go in. So there is a lot of resistance. Sometimes we bulldoze our way through. But sometimes we find very cooperative and committed teachers,"" says Shobha. However, once the volunteers bring about good results, schools are only too happy to have them continue, say volunteers.

While volunteers pitching in with teaching, infrastructure support and funds is impactful for that specific school, it is not an institutionalised solution, and hard to sustain in the long run. Systemic changes to the education system need more thought out interventions and reforms, which we shall explore in subsequent stories."

The other schools have similar stories of being operating from a building of Handicrafts department or Panchayat house, the residents said.

The residents demanded construction of a model school in Shopian town on patterns of central high school Pulwama on a patch of land lying vacant behind old bus stand.

""The space is more than sufficient for constructing a model school with all facilities for students coming economically weak sections of society,"" the residents said.

Chief Education Officer Shopian, Mohamed Sadiq said that in Shopian district around 140 schools were operating from rented buildings. ""The number came down to 10,"" he said, adding that they couldn't construct buildings for these schools because there is paucity of land in the town.

When he was told about land available behind old bus stand he said that the said land is suitable for construction of a new school building as that will intrude into already functioning girls higher secondary school."

""Today, the number of libraries for children of government primary schools has gone up to 200. We are trying to inculcate reading habits in children, but here these small children are also managing the system themselves,"" said Sisodia.

Room to Read country director Sourav Banerjee said 56,671 books have been provided across the 100 schools, where 27,672 children are enrolled. ""We've roughly provided around 200 titles and 500 books per school. Over three years, the number of books in each library will increase to about 1,000. The final number depends on student enrolment.

In the Mandawali school, each section has a 40-minute 'library period' every week. The teacher in charge of the library pointed to the coloured stickers on each book.

The Punjab education department has directed all government schools to use powdered milk (dry milk) to prepare kheer, which is served once a week as part of the mid-day meal menu to children. The powdered milk will be supplied to schools by government-run cooperative MILKFED (which runs VERKA milk plants across the state).

As per the notification issued, schools are required to use seven grams of milk powder per child for making kheer. The milk powder will cost Rs 273 per kilogram; this amount will be paid to MILKFED from the ration amount they are granted for mid-day meals. Besides increasing the sale of milk powder, sources said, this step by the government has been taken to ensure children consume kheer prepared from ""quality-tested"" milk as earlier, schools purchased milk from local dairies and other shops which do not undergo a quality check.

Also, with adulterated milk widely being sold across Punjab, one needs to ensure children are not made to consume the same.

The order, however, clarifies that MILKFED will supply 10-kg powder milk cans to schools with 150 children or above. In other words, government schools with less than 150 children (mostly primary and in far-flung villages) will have to arrange the item on their own.

Welcoming the government's decision, Amarjit Singh, a government school teacher from Mansa said, ""Some schools are already using powder milk as it is easier to handle and store. Also, it tastes better and children prefer powdered milk in the food they consume.""

Another teacher from Ludhiana, Dharamjit Singh said, ""There is not going to much of a cost difference as a kilogram of powdered milk can be used by several students when compared to liquid milk. Also, it is easier to store powdered milk.""

Punjab State Education (elementary) Director Inderjit Singh, ""We have taken this decision as MILKFED agreed to supply powdered milk to our schools. The quality of milk had become a cause of worry as adulterated milk is openly sold in the market. The powdered milk by MILKFED passes through several checks.""

Singh added, ""The only concern might be cases of theft. Some people can try and steal to take the milk powder home. We need to look for a solution for this soon.""

Schools from next year - Star of Mysore","starofmysore.com",FALSE,"Mysuru: The State Government has decided to open English medium section in 1,000 Government Schools from next academic year in the State. It also decided to scrap Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009.

With the objective of making Kannada-medium Government School students ready to compete with those from private English-medium schools, the Education Department here has taken a significant decision to start English-medium classes in Government Schools in the State.

In a bid to provide quality education to rural students, the Government has decided to start the English medium in selected schools. It will start admission to English medium from Class 1 and 5th standard from the next academic year. The Government has already started the process of recruitment of teachers exclusively to teach English medium students besides to prepare syllabus and to conduct the exams.

One of the main reason for starting English-medium classes is that parents in even rural areas want their children to study in English-medium schools as English has largely become inevitable for better career prospects at the global level compared to regional language.

Despite having Government School in their locality, parents send their children to far off places to English schools. Starting English classes would not only help in retaining students in Government Schools, but would also encourage the parents to send their children to such schools.

The State Government has also decided to scrap the RTE and use Rs.400 crore grant of the same for the development of these English medium Government Schools. Government is reimbursing the fees to private schools for 25 percent quota admissions under the RTE Act. Moreover, the State Government is worried over student strength in State-run schools was declining as parents preferred to send their children to private schools under the RTE quota. Nearly 5000 private schools are surviving only because of the funds they are availing under RTE quota. The steep hike in expenditure reimbursement has also become headache to the Government.

The State Govt. has increased the expenditure per child from Rs.5,924 to 8,000 for pre-primary school students and from 11, 848 to 16000 for others. Besides this, the number of students admitted under the quota has been steadily increasing every year.

As many as 4.5 lakh students have been migrated to private schools from Government Schools after the implementation of admissions to private schools under RTE quota from last four years in the State. Shockingly, most of the Government Schools are facing the closure threat after introduction of RTE in the State.

Chief Minister writes to Principal Secretary Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy had already written a letter to Principal Secretary to Government Education Department (Primary and Secondary Education) Dr. Shalini Rajneesh to take all necessary steps to open English medium schools from next academic year. He also directed her to scrap RTE and stop releasing funds to private schools under RTE admissions quota. He has told to utilise RTE reimbursement funds to train the teachers of government schools and recruit teachers to English Medium."

He further said these teachers would be recruited through a new system that would include a system of weightage giving preference to better qualified candidates.

The recruitment will happen with the help of the Teacher's Recruitment Board (TRB), he said. ""We are now inspecting the vacancies and the appointments will be made after we complete the survey,"" he said.

He also announced that special part-time teachers, who handle subjects such as physical education, drawing and music in schools, would not get full-time employment.

A resolution adopted at the district general body meeting of the Koottani held here recently said that the strength of learners was ever-increasing in the State.

However, of late the School Education Department has decided to close down about 1,500 government schools with less then 10 students on their roll, the resolution said adding that this will affect the student community to a big extent. The students of such schools will have to go to far away places for continuing their studies. The decision will affect the student community as well the teachers, the resolution added.

Another resolution said that School Education Minister K. A. Sengottaiyan held discussion with the educationists in the beginning of this year and introduced the new syllabus after a gap of 12 years. He also announced public examination for Plus One and consideration of the combined marks of Plus One and Plus Two for admission into higher courses. These decisions were welcomed by all. However, the Minister has come out with a new announcement that the marks of the Plus One public examination will not be taken for consideration for admission into higher degree courses and Plus Two marks alone will be considered. This has shocked the educationists.

Such a decision will only favour the private school managements, as they will concentrate in the Plus Two subjects in the Plus One year and also in conducting special classes for NEET. This will badly hit the government school students. The meeting urged the Minister to convene a meeting with educationists once again to discuss this issue.

Another resolution stated that late Jayalalithaa announced the abolition of the new pension scheme for the teachers and continuing with the old system. But, the present state regime did not implement the announcement of the late leader.

The humming of children can be heard as one takes the curve while driving from Cement Bridge towards Azad Gunj, Baramulla. The building on the left side of the curve is not just another school in town, but a repository of important memories. As an unrivaled landmark of old Baramulla, ""The College School"" has today become a vibrant campus of nine schools, from a 'Jabri School'.

Back in the day when Baramulla was the Gateway to Kashmir, Jabri schools were opened by Maharaja Hari Singh for imparting education to Kashmiris. However, people were reluctant to send their wards to these schools. To fulfill Maharaja's decree, administration led by Wazir-i-Wazarat -- the present-day divisional commissioner -- would literally drag children to these schools. And therefore the name, Jabri -- forced -- school was coined.

""Before 1947,"" says Khaliq Parveez, a local author and poet, ""there was a dire need of educated and skilled labour. So in order to fulfill this need, five Jabri schools were set up in Kashmir. This [Baramulla's Jabri School] was one among them.""

The College School of Baramulla.

There was a special team comprising of selected teachers and students who would work as a special task force to drag students out of their houses and bring them to school, the author says.

Over the period of time, the school witnessed the times of peace, the hours of unrest and the years of turmoil, but nothing has stopped its journey of great contribution to the society.

""This institution has a legacy of producing gems,"" says Irshada Jaan, headmistress of the school. ""It has been a kindergarten to such people who were destined to sit at the top layer of Kashmir.""

Taking out a thick and long register from her cupboard, she starts reading out the names: Abdul Rashid Bhatt, Labour Commissioner; Aijaz Ahmad Kakroo, Advisor to CM; Dr Abdul Hamid Zargar, ex-Skims Director; Mushtaq Ahmad Sheikh, Divisional Commissioner; Mir Tariq, Director School Education, and the list goes on.

The school was momentarily affected by the explosive political reaction in the old town. With time, says Muneer Ahmad, a former teacher of the school, the roll of students even came down to 58.

""Then in 2015,"" he says, ""a special team of young teachers was set up to reform this historic institution. I was also a member of that team.""

In order to improve the student footfall in the school, eight schools of nearby localities were clubbed together, including a high school, five primary schools and two middle schools. It took the roll to 108.

The team of teachers took to modern teaching techniques and personality development, with main focus on kindergartens.

""We collected funds to purchase the much required equipment and build facilities,"" Muneer says. ""These efforts bore fruit and soon school was buzzing with students again.""

The roll went on increasing and finally one day the school had to put up a notice No Vacancy to stop insisting parents to pressurize the school authorities to admit their wards there.

It's most likely the first and the only government school in the Valley where administration had to refuse admission due to the swelling roll of the students. In most of the government schools, however, the situation is just the opposite.

""The school had to introduce entrance test for the students at KG level, on the style of private schools, as the roll shot up to 300 plus,"" Muneer says.

But now, the campus housing nine institutes is struggling due to deficiency of accommodation and increasing number of students.

""We're studying in one school but we're tagged different, our mark sheets, our attendance all are separate,"" says Adnan Ali, a class X student. ""We feel overcrowded when all students are present. There, in fact, is no space left for some students even to sit in the classroom. We make shifts. When one class leaves for games, other students enter the room to attend a lecture there.""

The absence of labs and playground further disheartens students.

""I had formally written to the authorities on sanctioning of a building, conveyed it to the CEO also during his timely visits, but nothing happened,"" says Jameela Showkat, ex-headmistress of the school.

The only solution to this situation, says Abdul Ahad Wani, CEO Baramulla, is to de-club some schools from there.

The move might give a breathing space to the heritage school, but it's also feared to undo the hard work of the team of young teachers who played a yeomen's role to replace the growing hush with the increasing hum. Maybe, the authorities can do better than simply undoing what the young teachers did to make it an inspiring government school.

Students who have transferred claimed that government schools were providing almost all facilities available in private schools at much lower costs.

Annual fee hike in private schools was cited as one of the key reasons for which students turned to government schools. Jyoti Kumari, who studies in Class VI and has come from Divya Vidya Niketan School, Mohammadpur, said, ""My parents put me in a government school because in private schools, the fee is hiked every year.""

Besides, she said, government school teachers gave more attention to students. ""Teachers give us extra time and attention -- we are sometimes called to school during holidays to study -- which is not the case in private schools,"" said Kumari.

A wide range of books in the school library and bigger playgrounds were other reasons that students, who have transferred to government schools, cited as positives. Nitish Verma, a Class VI student who has joined Government Senior Secondary School, Jharsa, from Shiv Public Senior Secondary School, Sohna, said, ""The library here is far better -- we have all types of books.""

Sachin Khatana, a Class X student of Government Senior Secondary School, Abheypur, said, ""I had been studying in New Shaheed Smarak Public School, Abheypur, since kindergarten. The school didn't have facilities such as a proper playground or co-circular activities for students. Last year, when I visited my friend in this school, I saw students playing on two big playgrounds.""

Sushma Dalal, teacher of the Abheypur government school, said, ""As many as 40 students who were studying in private schools have come to our school, this year. One of the reasons is teachers are regular and take pains to ensure every child learns the lesson.""

Premlata Yadav, district elementary education officer, said, ""Students of government schools are now getting good results and people realise that the quality of education has improved."""

A reply to an RTI from the Public Works Department (PWD) has revealed that rainwater harvesting (RWHs) systems are yet to be installed, or begin operations, in government schools and office buildings in the capital. This despite the National Green Tribunal (NGT) pulling up the Delhi government and asking it to file a response on the installation of RWH systems in schools and colleges in January.

In January, the NGT had sought implementation of its November 2017 order, asking government and private schools, and colleges to install rainwater harvesting systems at their own cost.

The rainwater harvesting guidelines of the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) state that RWH systems are important to prevent a fall in groundwater levels and to increase availability of potable water.

With the Delhi government yet to notify the January order, the NGT had directed DJB to inspect all residential and commercial buildings on plots of 500 sq metres and above in July. The tribunal had also ordered a fine of Rs 5 lakh as environment compensation on buildings that haven't installed the systems.

(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). With effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions.

Chronicle Reporter, Bhopal, In spite of many schemes including 'School Chalen Hum', running in the state, the number of children in government schools is declining year after year. This has been revealed in the report submitted by the school education department in the last assembly session.

In the last three years six lakh children have left the government schools. Chhindwara district tops in the number of dropouts, whereas Satna and Rewa are second and Shivpuri is in third place.

Children enrolled in government schools through school education department are counted through mid-day meal and free textbook distribution. The number of children in the year 2015-16 is 76,23,522, which fell to only 70,20,008 in the year 2017-18.

All the schemes are aimed at luring the children to the government school. Funds of crores are given under 'School Chale Hum' campaign by the Central Government. The entire budget is also being spent every year, but still the number of children is falling in schools.

Either this budget is being spent on paper, or the schemes are not proving to be effective in attracting children. In order to increase enrollment of children in government schools, the government is running schemes like free textbooks, uniforms and bicycles distribution. In this every year bill of crores rupees is wasted."

Suneetha and her classmates at Government Higher Primary School at Madrahalli in T. Narsipur taluk of Mysuru district have been reciting English rhymes in the last fortnight as the day to present their newly acquired English talent is fast approaching.

The school in the tiny village has around 101 students and each one has to speak English with their teachers, friends, and students throughout the day on January 1, 2019. While some are memorising simple rhymes, others are practising dance to Shakira's popular number 'Waka waka' (This Time For Africa).

This is a part of the 'English Empowerment Programme Fest' (EEPF) designed to improve knowledge of English among the students of government schools, said S. Mamatha, Deputy Director of Public Instruction, Mysuru district.

On New Year's day, the fest will be conducted in each of the 339 schools in the taluk, entirely in English -- from the prayer and dance, and action songs to the vote of thanks.

The EEPF is an ambitious project of the Education Department and it is being implemented on a pilot basis in all government schools in T. Narsipur taluk.

There are 26,000 students in the 339 government schools in the taluk. ""They are mainly from rural areas and they need a boost to improve their English. Hence, the department has selected T. Narsipur for the EEPF,"" Ms. Mamatha told The Hindu.

S. Swamy, Block Education Officer, said, ""We have already trained the teachers and cluster officer, and conducted meetings with the various teachers' associations. The motive behind the EEPF is to build confidence among the students to communicate in English.""

Though there is no official communication, the programme is being seen as a precursor to the State government's plan to introduce English medium in 1,000 government primary schools across the State.

The Education Department is thinking of extending the 'T. Narsipur model' across the State by training teachers through the Department of State Educational Research and Training (DSERT) and the District Institutes of Education and Training (DIET), another senior officer said."

This apart, the petitioner also wanted the court to set up a district level committee of officials known for their integrity and commitment to cause of student welfare to inspect all government and government-aided schools to ensure adequate toilet facilities are provided along with sanitary workers.

It was in 2010 that Delhi's Shri Ram School Maths and Computer Science teacher Sujata Sahu first went on a trip to Ladakh. It was a solo trek, and on the third day, she began to face extreme difficulty breathing and walking. The low oxygen in the altitudes as high as 16,100 feet had given her Pulmonary Edema.

She needed to rest, and with the help of two passing trekkers, she decided to spend the night at a remote village --

""A village which has no road access, is reachable only after a day's walk, and one which boasted of just one home with three occupants. I had neither medicines, nor the ability to call my family, nor access to medical care,"" says 50-year-old Sahu, a resident of Gurugram.

In was in these conditions that she saw two tiny schools which totally changed her life.

The first primary school -- Sku-Kaya -- had five students and two teachers. It had two rooms which were being rebuilt. While one teacher had stayed in the village, the other had gone to Leh to get uniforms and mid-day meal supplies for the school.

The second school had eight children and three teachers. It was two of them who had stopped to help Sahu when she was feeling sick. They had been walking back to Leh for textbooks and uniforms

The children were being taught from English books, which was very alien to them as they had no electricity or TV or telephone connectivity and thus, had no idea what the outside world was like. Having never set foot out of their villages, the exposure level of these children was very low.

.In Ladakh, even the summer months were bitingly cold but that didn't stop the kids from coming to school to learn. ""One of the children even brought his little brother along, who was barely two years old and the love and care with which all the children and the teacher took care of the child was a lesson for me,"" says Sahu.

What really hit her on that fateful Ladakh trip was the sheer drive of the Ladakhi people there to keep growing and improving their circumstances.

""Their determination to come to school and learn, the eagerness of the teacher to learn something new to teach his students, and the aspiration of the parents to educate their children was my inspiration to drop everything and help these amazing people,"" says Sahu.

From a regular school teacher to Ladakh's 'Iron Lady'

""My experience with the schools in Ladakh gave me a path to follow, one that I knew I could contribute to,"" says Sujata Sahu, who had spent 12 years in the corporate world before starting to work with children.

But she had been working at the Shri Ram School for just two years at the time, and leaving this job was the hardest decision she had to make in her life.

""I was planning to take on a seemingly herculean task, in possibly one of the toughest terrains of the world. I had no idea about where I would get the funds from and was also not very clear on how much of an impact I alone could make,"" she says.

Moreover, no one had done something like this before her in Ladakh. But thankfully, she found with herself two strong founding partners -- her husband, Sandeep Sahu, who had been trekking in the region for almost 35 years, and Dawa Jora, a Ladakhi businessman, all of whom had the strong conviction that something like this was really needed for the region.

In 2011, unable to find other NGOs to partner with, the three founders went on a three-day trek to one of the most isolated villages in Lingshed (in Ladakh), carrying 1500 kg of education material on 25 horses, and crossing three mountains at extreme temperatures as low as minus 15 degrees.

The treacherous and steep pass they crossed at an altitude of almost 17000 ft inspired the name of the '17000 ft foundation'.

As she started off on her mission to provide Ladakh schools with the right resources to further the education of their students, she realised this wouldn't be very easy.

""One of our biggest challenges was convincing corporates that even remote areas with extremely scattered and small populations needed support,"" says Sahu.

For the first two years, the foundation worked only with the founders' own funds and kind contributions of friends and family members.

""Though no non-profit organisations were willing to take on Ladakh as a region, we were given support in the form of knowledge, pedagogy and even a large donation of books for our first 100 libraries,"" she says.

Sujata Sahu's undying passion to help the people of Ladakh earned her the nickname of the 'Iron Lady'.

How Ladakh poses a unique set of education problems

India is a geographical anomaly as it has every type of topographical setup, each of which comes with its own challenges. This makes it extremely difficult for the government to cater to every type of problem that can arise in this vast country owing to accessibility issues, extreme weather conditions etc.

Ladakh has almost a 1000 schools across Leh and Kargil, spread across 60,000 sq km of harsh mountains. Catering to a school going population of under 40,000 children, the average school strength of these schools is barely 25 students across the two districts, explains Sahu.

Teachers themselves come from remote villages and have to travel long distances for training, school supplies and even basic administrative functions, leading to long absences and shortage of staff, she adds.

Also, ""While teachers are given basic residential training during winters as well as in-service training, most of the trainings are not contextualized for the uniqueness of the Ladakhi education system,"" she says.

The extreme weather also adds to the problems with schools being shut for severe winters for three months in a year when the roads become inaccessible due to thick snow and temperatures as low as minus 35-40 degrees.

""Incredibly, despite the remoteness of the region, every little hamlet which has even 10 school going children has a tiny government school with teachers in attendance, thanks to the local administration. A little wonder then, that 89% of the schools in Ladakh are govt schools with the private schools present in just a handful of the larger villages,"" she says.

""What is commendable is that all these 900 plus schools are functional and have qualified teachers in attendance. What is even more remarkable is that every child in every village goes to school, managing to at least complete middle school,"" Sahu adds

However, it is only the larger villages which have middle schools and after passing class 5, children have to walk around two hours to get to school to continue their education. Public transport isn't available in such terrain and the army provides army vans for commuting.

.Despite the presence of these govt schools, the community here wants a better life and quality education for their children so they can get better jobs. This aspiration makes them send their very young children, often as young as three years old, to be enrolled in private schools, often extremely far away from their homes.

""Cut off from their villages and parents for months in a year, these children grow up in dormitories, hostels or with other families. Lacking the care and guidance they need in their growing up years, this leads to large-scale dropouts and a population of youth who are unable to go back to their villages,"" Sahu explains.

17000 ft works in these remote villages by improving existing govt schools so that parents would have faith in them and stop sending their children away so far that it disconnects them from their roots.

How voluntourism is helping 17000 ft foundation grow

Sujata Sahu started her non-profit organisation with just the founders and a few volunteers who were given the task to survey the entire length and breadth of Ladakh.

The team mapped around 600 schools after a seven-month-long study. Some of these schools had been bomb shelters during the Kargil war and the buildings had to be shifted multiple times.

The success of the volunteer programmes helped the foundation grow and each of these schools has been geo-mapped for travellers to find.

""We, very early on, piloted our volunteering programmes to involve outsiders in the work of our organization and to also understand if people could be encouraged to donate to such a cause. The enthusiasm and support shown by complete strangers told us that we were on the right track,"" says Sahu.

""Our volunteers, who are our brand ambassadors, then carried the story of our work into their workplaces and CSR then became our main source of funding. Voluntourism, as it is called today, still forms a good 25% of our annual budget and helps us maintain our backend costs,"" she adds.

Why playgrounds are so important in Ladakh schools

Though the govt schools all over Ladakh have proper buildings, they lack the proper facilities that make a school a happy, joyous and welcoming place for children. And in a remote location with rugged ground, a playground comes as a blessing.

""In these remote villages, where nothing is available, there are absolutely no options for children to play with. Though these schools have well-qualified teachers and very low pupil-teacher-ratio, parents often judge the performance of a school based just on the facilities they provide,"" says Sahu.

Thus, parents see the existence of a playground in govt schools as a very good incentive to not send away their kids to far-off private schools.

""Today, 17000 ft foundation has setup playgrounds in 140 schools with colourful swings, slides, see saws etc. many of which the team had to carry over horseback for days to reach our remotest schools,"" she says.

A big aspect of Ladakh education that surprised Sujata Sahu was how the kids learned in English medium schools even though they have no exposure to the foreign language. Their native language was Bhoti.

""To add to this burden, children also have to study their local language as well an additional Hindi/Urdu from grade 1,"" says Sahu.

To enable the children to read better and get comfortable with the number of languages they have to deal with, 17000 ft set up libraries in 230 schools with simple and easy to read story books in English, Hindi and Urdu.

""However, sadly, there are absolutely no story books in Bhoti for children to read. Sensing this gap, we undertook a mission to translate storybooks from English to Bhoti.""

""In 2015, we launched our first phase where we translated 21 titles and published 21,000 storybooks for distribution into 300 schools,"" says Sahu.

This year again, the organisation not only translated another 20 titles, but also added illustrations and changed narratives to make them more relatable to the children of Ladakh.

What has 17000 ft foundation achieved so far?

In the span of just six years, Sujata Sahu's organisation has accomplished much.

""Today, 17000 ft works with 250 govt schools across Leh and Kargil and we are already seeing a reverse trend of children coming back from private schools back to the govt schools in their villages,"" says Sahu.

The organisation has set up libraries in 230 schools, playgrounds in 140 schools, and trained over 1500 teachers in various methodologies with a team which is in Ladakh every winter for training teachers.

17000 ft foundation has conducted multiple community workshops in 125 villages with over 10,000 villagers contributing to our workshops and programmes in the schools.

Recently, the organisation electrified and digitized 120 schools in Leh and Kargil, providing solar electricity and tablets with customized digital learning content, a TV, and a server to provide offline data syncing.

The DigiLab project is the non-profit's most ambitious programme bringing offline hybrid digital learning solutions to the remote villages.

The well-furnished digital labs supported by workshops from the team throughout the year can help the students learn independently with guidance from their teachers.

How crowfunding is helping 17000 ft foundation

Crowdfunding is increasingly coming up as a very important resource collection measure.

""17000 ft has been involved with ImpactGuru.com in multiple projects, the latest being the funding of a Playground for a very remote school in Kargil. We had also fundraised for our Bhoti Book Translation project through ImpactGuru.com and managed to raise more than we needed,"" says Sahu.

Fundraising platforms are great for helping nonprofits fund small projects that have tangible goals and timelines. It is an excellent way to help get the word out to potential supporters and garner more support for the non-profit, says the Iron Lady of Ladakh.

Future of 17000 ft foundation

Before 17000 ft was established, there was little or no attention on the remote schools of Ladakh, and today with all our work and efforts and the participation of the local communities, govt schools are looking and performing better and we are seeing a reverse trend of children coming back to their villages and govt schools.

""When we started, one of our biggest challenges was encouraging donors, volunteers, foundations and even corporates to focus on remote regions of Ladakh. Today, however, we are confident that our model is working and we can get the support we need,"" beams Sahu.

Sujata Sahu now wants to take this model to other remote and mountainous regions, like Arunachal Pradesh, or the remote areas of Himachal.

""We feel that we are closer now to our vision of a better life and education for all children, regardless of geography or terrain,"" she says.

These days, Sagar Singh frets about the academic future of his daughter who studies at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Delhi's Cantonment area.

""There are hardly any teachers there. She often tells me that kids sit clueless as teachers are forced to teach subjects they themselves don't understand well. I wonder if she will remain underprepared for challenges ahead in life, he said.

Singh sums up the crisis in Delhi government schools which have only 35,034 regular teachers against a sanctioned strength of 64,096. A shortage of 29,062 regular hands (45.34 per cent) has left the teachers exhausted and students vulnerable. A total of 15,04,627 students are enrolled in 1,024 schools run by the AAP government.

There are 22,016 guest teachers that take the existing number to 57,050 but they work on daily-wage contracts that must be renewed every year. Even if guest teachers are factored in, Delhi government schools are short of 7,046 (10.99 per cent) teaching hands.

Saroj Sharma, a primary teacher at a Greater Kailash school said, On several occasions, I have had to teach higher-secondary class subjects. We are overworked and stressed. We are filling in for many others. School heads are aware of the crisis, but nothing has been done.

Neeru Loriya, a teacher coordinator at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in RK Puram Sector 4, also said that several subjects are not being taught properly. Barkha Kumari, a Class VI student at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Rohini said, My Class has 50 students. We need more teachers to ensure we're taught well. It's not that the government isn't working at all. After the Aam Aadmi Party came to power in Delhi in 2014, the government has built 48 schools.

But where are the teachers? We have sent several reminders to the government. Nothing has happened, said a teacher at a Pusa Road school. Most regular posts are filled through promotions. But they have not happened since 2013, he said.

Sanjay Goel, head of the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) told Mail Today, We're aware of the problem. Each year, guest teachers are being enrolled to minimise the shortage. Avdhesh Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, also said, There is a problem. But the government is hiring guest teachers to tackle it.

But facts tell a different tale. In July, the Delhi government had announced that schools would get 9,000 guest teachers by mid-August. It did not happen. Hiring guest teachers is anyway no solution to this huge crisis, said Ajay Veer Singh, general secretary of the last Government School Teachers' Association (GSTA) elected in 2014. GSTA elections have not taken place since 2014.

So its demands have not been heard effectively, its office-bearers claim. We have asked for elections. But education department officials have not paid any heed. The future of government school teachers is dark, said Singh. GSTA has a three-year term.

He also described Kashmere Gate as an ""incubation centre"" for universities, saying it is a coincidence that several varsities, which were based in the area, are now moving to bigger campuses.

""We had launched the 'happiness curriculum' in government schools. Now we will launch the entrepreneurship curriculum from the next session onwards for secondary and senior secondary students.

""We need to instill confidence among our children in school right from the beginning of secondary education that after completing their education, they should aspire to be job givers and not job seekers,"" Sisodia said.

He explained that after at least 15 years of formal education, if a large number of the youth are not confident of creating something new, which can give them gainful return and add value to the economy, then as a society ""we are failing to nurture their full potential"".

Sisodia said, barring a few exceptions, once a child completes elementary schooling and joins the secondary classes, his entire orientation, which is largely shaped by the teachers and parents, is to secure good marks in exams, get admission in a good college and get a job with decent pay package.

This is considered a trajectory of success and anyone who either secures less marks or fails to join college or fails to secure a job is deemed as unsuccessful, he said.

""This trajectory is obsolete in today's day and age when new ideas and technologies are driving our way of life.

""The curriculum shall be based on a four-fold framework-- inspire through stories and case studies of entrepreneurial journeys, educate through self designed micro research, involve through local community and facilitate by supporting in developing ideas into projects,"" said Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio.

To take this idea forward, he has directed the secretary education to set up a high-powered working group having senior faculties from SCERT/DIET, school principals and individuals having domain expertise as members.

""SCERT Delhi will organise a conference in January where it will invite organisations and individuals to present their ideas for the design of the entrepreneurship curriculum as per the framework of the government to a working group.

While the teachers welcome the innovation wholeheartedly as it does magic in schools, experts opine that video lessons could be used only in addition to classroom learning.

Initially, the department had embedded QR code in the textbooks for classes I, VI, IX and XI - syllabus was revamped in this academic year - and each lesson had at least three QR codes which upon scanning would take you to video lessons of that lesson, explained an official from the department who is involved in the process.

The department also has a YouTube channel with 1.18 lakh subscribers and is planning to launch a 24-hour free satellite education channel, said the official.

""The basic idea is to evoke interest among the students and to make them attend classes regularly. Also, concepts which are considered as difficult by the students, were made into videos to unwrap its complexity,"" the official added.

The video lessons in turn has done magic in the schools as most of the students who were difficult to find in classrooms, were not just found on regular basis, but also noticed paying keen attention to the lessons, said a government schoolteacher on condition of anonymity.

A teacher, who teachers Mathematics, said most of the problems which, in general, students would struggle to understand were solved, within matter of time as the videos explain it with pictorial representations and sound effects.

""Teaching the students to pronounce difficult words has become a fun task now for both students and teachers. But, the only issue that we face is that videos were created only for a few concepts and not for entire lessons,"" T Arulanantham of Tamil Nadu high and higher secondary teachers' association said.

With videos, students can listen to it numerous times until they clearly understand it, while a teacher would not be able to spare much time to explain same doubts during the class hours as they would have to move on to next chapter, he added.

""The video lessons would definitely be useful in understanding difficult concepts, but it should not replace the textbooks completely.

How will they be able to learn the spelling of words without reading and writing habits,"" district president of Tamil Nadu Post Graduate Teachers Association GR Chentooran questioned.

Meanwhile, PB Prince Gajendra Babu, an educationist, said the video lessons should only be used in addition to reading and it should never be used as a tool to replace teacher as nothing would match the live interaction between teacher and students.

Elaborating on the project, TAPF CEO Shridhar Venkat said like GLPS Ravindranagar other schools will also be equipped with colouful and innovative compound walls, safe food storage facility, hand wash stations, zero maintenance bio-toilets and play area.

The model school initiative at GLPS Ravindranagar has been supported by Shyamala Prabhu and Kavita Shastry from the Institute of Indian Interior Designers and organisations such as Let's Endorse, Smile Charitable Trust, and The Aravani Art Project.

In a special interaction with Deccan Chronicle, Yaduveer said that infrastructural development of government schools was essential to help students benefit better from the system. Excerpts:

Experts point out offering better opportunities for students in government schools as well keeping the system of public education alive. How can this be done?

Going forward from initiatives like the School and Student Transformation model put forth by TAPF, encouraging children to grow up in a sustainable environment and ensuring they get access to experiential learning platforms is important. A transformation towards getting better in all ways - in terms of education, infrastructure and advanced learning prospects is essential for government schools to be more appealing to students and parents.

Do you believe beginning English medium classes or schools in the public education sector would improve government school enrolments and thereby quality of education offered as well?

Merely changing the medium to English would not improve the system at a larger scale. Even though learning English would help students get recognised as a global citizen, one cannot neglect the local language and culture and hence learning in Kannada is equally important. Knowledge in more languages right from the formative years is always good as it helps better brain development. However, a system to offer both Kannada and English mediums and either of them as a second language should be in place. The final call should be left open to each student/parent catering to their individual needs.

Will you prefer sending your son to a government school for education?

That will be a matter of practicality and we'll take a call depending on what is right for him at that point of time. He's just one year old now. I've seen several government schools that are very good and way better than their private counterparts with an enabled and progressive outlook. Good things take time and hopefully with such initiatives, government schools will retain its past glory. To be very honest, we haven't given this much thought as to how we should have already."

The biggest challenge was to make education interesting for them.

He started using his mobile phone and tablet to teach students rhymes and realised that their interest levels increased sharply. Seeing Ravi's performance, a local MLA supported him with cash prize of Rs 1 lakh which he used to buy a projector and speakers etc.

Seeing its performance, the state government rewarded the school with a cash prize of ₹ 1.2 lakh in 2015-16. ""I used the money to buy audio video gadgets and transformed the school into a smart class. I started using the audio-visual mode of communication to teach other subjects as well.

This is not the lone example.

Alpa Nigam, headmaster of a school in Gorakhpur, said when she joined in 2010, very few students were enrolled and most of them ran away after lunch time. To catch their interest, Alpa too started using a mobile phone and speakers.

Impressed with her dedication, Rotary Club and other well-wishers donated a projector, which is being used to screen educational movies for students. Now the school has three laptops and learning is fun here.

We used the prize money to buy a projector, speakers and an inverter and started smart classes. The results have been encouraging. We hope other schools will follow our model instead of waiting for government assistance.""

The number of government schools in Uttar Pradesh running smart classes had been slowly but steadily growing, said a basic education department official. He said this was largely due to efforts of individual teachers who were seeking help from good Samaritans or opting for crowd funding to arrange the money needed to digitize the teaching process.

At a time when the state government is still to make any budgetary provision for running smart classes in schools, these teachers are doing their best to equip their institutions with the latest technologies and compete with private institutions mushrooming in small districts.

Now the basic education department is preparing a database of all such schools.

""The findings, so far, have come as a surprise. Nearly 1,200 schools (out of the total 1.54 lakh in the state) are running smart classes,"" said director, basic education, Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh. He said it was equally surprising that the state capital was yet to catch up with other districts in this respect.

He said that most of these institutions were concentrated in far off districts like Gorakhpur or smaller ones such as Hardoi and Sitapur.

""Gorakhpur has the maximum number (124) of smart class schools. Hardoi is a close second with 122 schools, and Sitapur is next with 120. Some of the other districts with such schools are Azamgarh (33), Mau (28), Muzaffarnagar (20), Bulandshahr (18), Lalitpur (17), Kaushambhi (15) and Jaunpur (10),"" he said.

Singh said that by integrating technology with education, these schools had transformed the teaching-learning process, making it far more interesting.

""It has helped a lot in increasing student retention. For instance, now a science teacher doesn't just talk about blood circulation but actually shows the students how blood is circulated in the body via arteries and veins,"" he said.

After introducing the 'Happiness Curriculum', the Delhi government is all set to introduce a 'Cleanliness Curriculum' for government school students. Deputy Chief Minister and Education Minister Manish Sisodia announced the initiative on Wednesday.

""We will develop a curriculum to inculcate habits of cleanliness and hygiene among students,"" said Sisodia, adding: ""The cleanliness curriculum will be activity-based.

Also, the education department is planning to extend the Government Model Primary School (GMPS) in Sector 49 to middle level (till class VIII). This was stated by the officials from the education department in its preliminary plan as final decision will be taken only after conducting a proper survey of these schools and the nearby schools after the re-transfer process is done.

The eight primary schools being re-transferred are- GPS -12, GPS - Bapudham Colony, GPS- Buterla, GPS- Mauli Complex, GPS- Railway Colony, GPS- Manimajra - I, GPS- Manimajra - II, and GMPS - 49 (the newest among all schools).

""There are the schools which do not have good infrastructure and have less number of students, so we will be adjusting students in nearby schools. Also, the schools which are large in spaces will be further upgraded,"" said an official from the UT education department requesting anonymity.

The shifting, as per teachers may prove to be an unsuccessful task as the schools, especially in Mauli complex, railway colony and Manimajra are already overcrowded.

The schools that will get prior attention from the education department include Government Primary School in Maulijagran, Government Primary School in railway colony and Manimajra-II as these are running in worst conditions of all. GPS in Mauli and railway colony are not even having their own buildings and are being run in rented buildings.

In a reality check, the TOI had reported how these three schools had poor infrastructure as they are so small that they cannot even afford to have furniture in classrooms and accommodate students.

The department is also planning to close Government Primary School in Buterla, Sector 41 due to low enrollment of students. ""The building can be put to some other good use. There is no point in running a separate school for a few students,"" the official added.

The school has 130 students at present studying in nursery class and classes I-V.

These schools further lack basic facilities like playgrounds and teachers have to be on toes to ensure students don't get injured as few swings that lie in the corner of small yards. Thus, making it unsafe for students. In some schools situated in Mauli complex and railway colony, they utilize the adjoining neighbourhood park as they don't have their own playgrounds. This, however, raises security concerns for children, as the park is also used by people and vendors.

GMPS will further be upgraded to middle level. Moreover, the school's building needs attention too. The other seven government primary schools have been running under the MC Chandigarh since 2010."

The computer professionals said they joined the schools in June 2018, but were paid a month's salary only in November this year, a day before Diwali. The assistants claim their complaints to CM, deputy CM (who also holds the charge of the education department) and public grievance cell have failed to provide them a relief.

The assistants said they were hired by Intelligent Communication Systems India Limited (ICSIL) and sent to Delhi government's DoE, which, in turn, deployed them in various government schools.

""When we did not get our salary for three months, the company that hired us told us to contact the DoE. When we talked to the education department officials, they said paying salaries was the responsibility of the company that outsourced the manpower. We have only been shuttling between the two offices,"" said an IT Assistant, requesting anonymity.

The job responsibility of the assistants include managing the attendance of students and teachers, monitoring the e-mails, orders and circulars coming from the DoE and sharing them with the head of the school.

The education department had initially hired 1,068 IT Assistants and later advertised for another 670 more computer professionals for schools that have more than 1,200 students and thus have more work load. While the 1,068 IT Assistants, hired for two years, have been getting their salaries regularly, the 670 have not been paid.

""Despite being working hard all these months, sometimes on Sundays and holidays as well, our salaries have not been released. We all our working under duress and are sustaining ourselves by taking loans from friends, families and even from banks. We are under severe financial pressure,"" said another assistant.

Sanjay Goel, director of DoE, told TOI: ""The contract of the 670 IT assistants was for six months. Till June their salary has been paid. For the extension given from July, the salary has been processed and will be given to them soon.""

A representative from ICSIL said the IT Assistants were first hired for three months and in June, it was decided to extend their contract for one year. ""However, the file to extend their contract was not approved by the government, and that's why the salaries were not paid.

Chatting about the upcoming examination and reciting multiplication tables, they are getting ready for another day at the Government Senior Secondary School here.

From the outside, there's nothing extraordinary about the scene but as you enter, a pleasant surprise awaits.

Neatly furnished classrooms, a library and lab form part of an encouraging attempt to give these children quality education infrastructure, all thanks to an experiment by Brahm Prakash Shastri, a former principal of the school.

By bypassing administrative procedures and seeking help directly from NGOs, and tapping various corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, Shastri's endeavours have ended up benefiting teachers as well as some 20 government schools in the district. And it's the power of community, he believes, which has helped turn his simple idea into gold, in the space of four years.

As a rule, to channel CSR funds, corporates and NGOs must approach the education department but this is a process that can, and often does, take a long time. ""And all the donations don't necessarily reach us,"" admits Shastri, who eventually sought the assistance of the big companies, with due approval from the education department. Now, the govt school in Basai has an impressive science and computer lab, an RO water purifier for clean drinking water, refurbished toilets, a diesel genset and split air-conditioners, besides well-furnished classes and staff rooms. Behind all this is teamwork.

Villagers, for example, have contributed by whitewashing the walls. ""Several local NGOs approached us for basic things, like installing RO and donating books. We then asked the companies to invest directly and they have helped (with) the entrance, walking tracks and boundary walls,"" Shastri adds.

According to a notification under Section 135 of The Companies Act 2013, it is compulsory for companies with a net worth of Rs 500 crore or more, turnover of Rs 1,000 crore or more, or net profit of Rs 5 crore or more, in any given financial year, to spend two percent of their net profit on CSR programmes.

And following the successful Basai model, government schools in Carterpuri, Jacobpura, Tikri, Shakurpur, Bhondsi and Tikli (and one in Sarsa, Bhiwani), have undergone renovation. The Tikri school, TOI found, is getting a new washroom for boys, girls and handicapped children (courtesy a North American real estate firm). Tulsiram, the principal here, happily acknowledges the transformation. ""Our school was initially in a very bad condition - there was no sewer connection and the boundary wall was in a dilapidated state,"" he recalls, sitting in his office-cum-staff room. ""We are not aware of the expenditure, but this CSR activity has brought a positive change in the school.""

Indeed, in two years, CSR funds have ensured that the Tikri govt school is not lacking when it comes to the bare essentials, among them a water tank, utensils for midday meals, a level playground and washrooms.

Dinesh Shastri, the district education officer, has visited 20 such schools across the state and claims that facilities are on a par with those in private schools. ""The drop-out rate has come down heavily too,"" he says.

However, for all the progress in infrastructure development, there are still more than 30,000 vacancies for teachers in the state. The data report card of the District Information System for Education (U-DISE) corroborates this fact, pointing out the acute shortage of teachers and principals in Haryana.

Still, with over 540 government schools in the district, there is no dearth of corporate majors who are prepared to come forward and do their bit towards make the learning ecosystem more welcoming and fun for children."

Meanwhile with the government announcing winter vacations, students of these government schools were in a dilemma as they have not received their textbooks yet from the school authorities.

The annual examinations in government primary and middle schools culminated last month but the promoted students have not been provided with various textbooks by School Education Department (SED).

The teachers in various government-run-schools said that there is a non-availability of mathematics, history and geography books for the 9th standard and mathematics, Science in 10th standard also.

The teachers also said that the students from 5th to 8th standard are also without mathematics, history and civics textbooks.

Official sources in SED said that the Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education (JKBOSE) was probably supposed to order 50 lakh textbooks but this year the department ordered these books late.

""However the board have received some of the books but few books are yet to be received and the School Education Department,"" he said.

""SED has given a deadline to the JKBOSE for availing the pending books of various classes till December 05, sources said adding, ""The school authorities have been also asked to distribute the pending books on 15th of December to all respective students.""

He said that the JKBOSE was also directed to provide books and stationery to the school authorities of Ladakh district first because of the road closure issues.

Lamenting on the non-availability of various books in Srinagar district he said there is a huge non-availability of various books from Ist to 10th standard in the district.

Chairman, JKBOSE, Veena Pandita said, ""We have science books available but mathematics and Urdu books are pending for two classes."" ""Actually the trucks carrying the books are stuck somewhere in the highway. But in coming two days we are hopeful, we will receive these books too,"" she assured. She said that for the rest of the classes there was no shortage or non-availability of any book.

Pertinently, the State Government on Thursday announced winter vacations for all schools in Kashmir division and winter zones of Jammu division from December-6 to March- 03 2019 upto 8th standard and December-17 to March February 23 2019 for 9th standard onwards."

For most part of the 14 years of his life, Priyanshu Singh, a class 9 student of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Yamuna Vihar, had no clue why his female friends complain about mood swings and abdominal pain for a day or two every month. Whenever the girls declined to participate in sports activities, he would mock and even crack jokes at their expense.

But all of that changed this September.

That was when Singh understood that it happens when the girls are either going through premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or on their monthly period cycle. ""While I knew what periods are, I was unaware about the difficulties women face when they are on their natural cycle. I used to laugh at my friends when they would complain about stomachache and mood swings. Now, I understand that mood swings are because of the PMS and it's normal to have stomach pain while they are on their periods,"" he said.

The change in mindset and the awareness was only possible because the school organised a workshop on 'menstrual awareness' in collaboration with non-governmental organisation (NGO) Sachhi Saheli. ""It was overwhelming to see the students, especially boys, asking menstruation-related queries with so much confidence. At the end of the workshop, the boys distributed packets of sanitary napkins among girls without any hesitation and pledged to make the campus period-friendly,"" RP Singh, principal of the school, said.

Now, the school is planning to organise a workshop for parents as well. ""Most of these students come from families where such discussions are prohibited. We are planning to organise a workshop for parents to sensitise them and encourage them to discuss these topics with their children,"" he said.

But their school is not an exception.

As many as 30 co-educational government schools have approached the NGO this year to organise workshops in order to sensitise students about menstruation. Till July this year, the NGO was conducting these workshops only in all girls' schools. ""We wanted to impart basic education about menstruation to students studying in government schools. We had contacted the Directorate of Education (DoE) last year and briefed them about our plan. The DoE gave us permission to conduct these workshops in girls' schools running under the Delhi government and the civic bodies. But, this year we started receiving requests from co-ed schools as well. We have already covered around 10 co-ed schools in the last four months and it has turned out to be a wonderful experience,"" said Dr Surbhi Singh, a gynecologist and founder of Sachhi Saheli.

During the workshops, the students are told about the science behind menstruation and the myths surrounding it. The girls are also taught basic hygiene that should be maintained during periods. ""We do not discuss about menstruation with boys at home or school and still expect them to be sensitive and supportive. It's very important to remove stigmas and taboos attached to periods from their minds. That's why we show them sanitary napkins and explain the importance of their use. We also tell boys about the physical and mental strains girls go though during their menstrual cycle,"" Singh said.

At another co-ed school in Nanakpura, a class 10 student Sagar Malik said he gifted his mother a pack of sanitary pads after attending the workshop. ""I had come to know about the issues women face in case they use cloth instead of sanitary pads during their periods. I requested the teacher in charge at my school to give a packet for my mother because I did not know what she uses. I have never heard anything about menstruation at home. When I gave her the packet, she looked shocked. But when I told her what I had learnt at school, she looked happy and relieved. She even called me a Padman,"" the 14-year-old said.

Meanwhile, a group of boys at a government co-ed school in Vasant Kunj has pledged to educate people in their localities about ""menstrual health"". ""We have decided to go from door to door in our localities and tell people the importance of maintaining hygiene during periods to avoid infections,"" said Lalit Singh, one of the students.

Girls, too, are happy with the change.

Divya Singh, a class 9 student at a school in Janakpuri, said she used to bring a 'black polythene bag' to carry the packet of sanitary napkins the school distributes under the Centre's Kishori Shakti Yojna. The girls in her school would collect their packets from the medical room after classes got over. Under the Kishori Shakti Yojna, girl students, between the ages of 11 and 18, are distributed a sanitary napkin packet every month in government schools across the country.

However, Singh and her classmates have now asked the teacher to distribute the pack of sanitary napkins in the classrooms. ""We had never uttered the word period in the presence of our male classmates before. It was the first time when a group, having more boys than girls, was sitting and discussing the myths and taboos attached to menstruation. Things have comparatively changed. Now, we do not have to think hundred times before talking about periods in school at least like we have to do at home,"" she said.

According to a survey published in Journal of Family and Community Medicine (JFCM) in September, 40% girls remained absent from school during their menstruation for reasons such as lack of privacy at school, source of information on menstruation and anxiety about leakage, and staining of their uniform. The survey was conducted on 600 girls studying in government schools in Delhi.

Experts say it's important to impart basic knowledge about menstruation at schools. ""It's important to make both make both genders aware of the science behind menstruation. While for girls, good menstrual hygiene can help prevent any kind of pelvic inflammatory diseases and infections, such talk sessions are equally important for boys to remove all the taboos and preconceived notions about periods. They should understand that it's a part of a girls' life and absolutely normal,"" said Dr Anuradha Kapur, a senior gynecologist at Max hospital in Saket.

Sanjay Goel, director of the DoE, said the government will encourage more co-ed schools to come forward and organise such workshops."

When Shobha Suryanarayan, a volunteer with Acharyas for a Better Community (ABC), first approached Vijayanagar Lower Primary School in Whitefield, the students could barely string together a sentence in English. The school had over 50 children from classes 1 to 5, but there was only one teacher and a headmistress (HM) to teach all of them. Children in classes 1, 2 and 3 would sit together; they were taught by the HM once she finished her official work. Children in classes 4 and 5 would sit together, and were taught by the other teacher, says Shobha.

ABC, an NGO based in Bengaluru, is driven by volunteers who go to teach in government schools. They also get CSR funding to meet each school's individual requirements.

At Vijayanagar school, the teachers asked ABC to take over English classes. In last November, ABC appointed a full-time teacher in the school, whose salary is paid with CSR funds. Within just three months, there was a huge difference, says Shobha. ""The students spoke in English, and even performed a skit in English. When I first had gone in, they had no idea about sentence structure,"" she says. ABC also appointed a janitor since students themselves used to clean the school, including its toilets, up till then.

ABC is also refurbishing the school, and setting up a peer lab and library there, with CSR funds. ""We have built a dining area and washing area for the kids. The ground has been levelled and cleaned up so that children have a safe place to play. We also raised the compound wall and put up barbed fencing to prevent anti-social activities that used to be common in the school premises at night,"" says Shobha. CSR funds also cover students' breakfast, which has resulted in both higher attendance rates and better attention span among students. Overall ABC has got Rs 40 lakhs as CSR funds for Vijayanagar School.

In Pattandur Agrahara School behind ITPL, the student enrolment went up from less than 10, to 96 now. The school which was in threat of being shut down, was rebuilt by ABC. ABC's volunteers also teach in the school. The school's transformation has most benefited children from the migrant construction labourer community who live nearby. Similar was the case with Nallurhalli Government Primary School.

ABC is one among the many volunteer-driven initiatives in the city that's changing government schools, one at a time. In addition to registered trusts like ABC, there are also informal volunteering groups, like one led by Anupama Harish in Malleswaram.

The shortage of competent teachers in government schools, lack of functional infrastructure, and difficult familial circumstances are causing many students to perform poorly in schools or to drop out altogether. Many low-income families also spend a large part of their income to send their children to private schools, in hope of better education, especially in English. However, studies show that low-income private schools are hardly any better than government schools in terms of learning outcomes. It's in this scenario that volunteer interventions are strengthening the public school system in Bengaluru.

Many volunteering organisations start off without much of a plan.

Malleswaram volunteers had come together when local resident Anupama Harish proposed her idea of volunteering in the 'Malleswaram & Suttha Muttha' Facebook group. Of nearly 12,000 members in the group then, many responded. Since 2015-16, Anupama's team has been teaching Mathematics in the Malleswaram 18th Cross Boys' High School.

The group has three volunteer-teachers for Maths each in 8th, 9th and 10th standards. Each teacher picks a favourite topic in Maths to teach - algebra, geometry etc. At any time, the group has 10-15 volunteers.

The school initially asked Anupama to get the permission of the Block Education Officer (BEO). The BEO was happy to have volunteer-teachers since the school had teacher shortage, especially in Maths. Maths was also the subject in which majority of the 10th standard students had failed in the previous year, in board exams.

After discussions with the school's head teacher, the group got a timetable. From this year, they have also been teaching Social Studies here. The team has developed a structured syllabus. They also update their progress in a common document so that there is no overlap in what's taught.

Having a structured syllabus is important since volunteers may otherwise teach random topics, concurs Jayashree Narayanan, who was a teacher-volunteer with the NGO OBLF (One Billion Literates Foundation). Jayashree, by her own initiative, had approached Kaikondrahalli Government School a few years back, interested in being a volunteer-teacher. She then became part of OBLF, which signed MoUs with the schools to allow its volunteer-teachers there.

Jayashree then found interested volunteers through her personal networks. OBLF volunteers have worked with five schools in Sarjapur Road area so far, but the volunteering has been stalled for this year because of the lack of committed volunteers. Jayashree plans to resume the programme next year.

OBLF volunteers start off the academic year by assessing students on spoken and written English. ""So we know where the kids stand, and we teach them from that level. We give another assessment at the end of the year to see how far the kids have progressed,"" says Jayashree. The team gets only a one-hour slot in a day. Usually there are two volunteers teaching English in each grade - one teachers three hours and the other two hours per week, so that there is continuity. Jayashree says schools have been open to them since they come from a registered NGO, with proper permissions.

ABC had started informally in 2016, as a group of 10-15 people. They initially had difficulty getting CSR funds, but this changed with their success in Pattandur Agrahara School. In late 2017, ABC registered as a Trust since corporates would fund only formal entities. Currently the NGO is a loosely structured organisation with a CSR group, operations group, social media group etc, all driven by volunteers. The organisation has about 50 volunteers in the city, and has worked with around 20 schools so far.

ABC starts engaging with a school by holding sports or art events, or by donating school bags etc to the students. During events, the team identifies the requirements of the school by talking to teachers and students. ""When we hold an event, they understand that we are serious. We list down requirements and create a proper project for the school,"" says Vikas Chandra, co-founder of ABC.

The requirements are put up on ABC's Facebook page, where people interested in volunteering or donating respond. The NGO also approaches corporates for CSR funds to do building repairs, set up new infrastructure, appoint teachers, distribute bags to students etc. It takes a good deal of time and effort to get CSR funds approved, says Chandra.

Volunteers say that working with high school or PUC students is more difficult as they often lack basic knowledge in subjects. Brijesh of the Malleswaram group says teaching 10th standard students was an uphill task. ""They didn't even know basic maths such as addition and subtraction. But we made sure that students who would come to 10th standard from 8th and 9th standards would get the basics right,"" he says.

Working with primary school students is more fruitful than working with high school or PUC students, opine volunteers. Younger children are more receptive to learning, and can get a good foundation at the appropriate age, they say. ""We want to enter the primary school sector now. If we strengthen the basics of primary school children, teaching high school students will become easier for our own volunteers,"" says Anupama.

Many students also come from very unstable backgrounds, such as abusive/alcoholic fathers, along with socio-economic backwardness or migrant nature of parents jobs. They need to be motivated to study, say volunteers. Schools get very little amounts for annual maintenance, and hence lack essential stationery materials and staff. In some schools, toilets are locked up or students are made to clean those due to the lack of cleaning staff. ""In a class of 30-40 students, only 10-15 would really want to learn. The other children don't even want to come to school,"" says Jayashree.

Coordinating between volunteers and schools is a challenge for volunteering organisations. Volunteers come from varying backgrounds, but most are homemakers or working professionals. While homemakers are available to volunteer on weekdays, coordinating with professionals on their time slots at the school can be a challenge. Negotiating with the school to get good time slots for teaching, having the school not cancel a time slot randomly, and having committed volunteers who go to the school regularly, are all challenges. Most volunteer organisations ask its members to commit to teaching in a school for at least a year.

The volunteering system acts as a self-sustaining system, where the interested, committed volunteers stay on their own. Volunteering groups say that most volunteers who stay on are well-qualified and passionate about teaching.

However, finding committed volunteers who are fluent in both English and Kannada has been difficult in Sarjapur Road area, says Jayashree. ""Many volunteers, once they start teaching, realise that not knowing Kannada is a barrier in reaching out to primary school children, since these children are very young.""

Some volunteers at ABC circumvented this problem by taking a six-month course in Kannada to learn the basics. ""This leads to a reverse teaching process in the class. Students love that they can teach Kannada to volunteers,"" says Shobha. Sometimes, if a student in the class knows Hindi, the child will act as a translator between the Hindi-speaking volunteer and other students.

Gaining entry into a school in the first place can be difficult as well. ""We struggle with regulatory challenges - BEO permissions, HMs not wanting to cooperate etc. For teachers, it is judgement on their work when we go in. So there is a lot of resistance. Sometimes we bulldoze our way through. But sometimes we find very cooperative and committed teachers,"" says Shobha. However, once the volunteers bring about good results, schools are only too happy to have them continue, say volunteers.

While volunteers pitching in with teaching, infrastructure support and funds is impactful for that specific school, it is not an institutionalised solution, and hard to sustain in the long run. Systemic changes to the education system need more thought out interventions and reforms, which we shall explore in subsequent stories."

Town dwellers informed Rising Kashmir that barring two higher secondary schools, all government schools in Shopian town have been operating from rented building sans infrastructure since their establishment decades ago.

They added that around a dozen schools were established in the town by school education department in past eight decades but failed to construct buildings for them.

""The schools were housed in rented buildings which lack basic facilities including lavotaries, bathrooms and playgrounds,"" said a town dweller, Mohamed Amen, adding that it resulted government schools failing to attract students.

The residents demanded construction of a model school in Shopian town on patterns of central high school Pulwama on a patch of land lying vacant behind old bus stand.

Chief Education Officer Shopian, Mohamed Sadiq said that in Shopian district around 140 schools were operating from rented buildings. ""The number came down to 10,"" he said, adding that they couldn't construct buildings for these schools because there is paucity of land in the town.

When he was told about land available behind old bus stand he said that the said land is suitable for construction of a new school building as that will intrude into already functioning girls higher secondary school."

""Today, the number of libraries for children of government primary schools has gone up to 200. We are trying to inculcate reading habits in children, but here these small children are also managing the system themselves,"" said Sisodia.

Room to Read country director Sourav Banerjee said 56,671 books have been provided across the 100 schools, where 27,672 children are enrolled. ""We've roughly provided around 200 titles and 500 books per school. Over three years, the number of books in each library will increase to about 1,000. The final number depends on student enrolment.

In the Mandawali school, each section has a 40-minute 'library period' every week. The teacher in charge of the library pointed to the coloured stickers on each book.

The Punjab education department has directed all government schools to use powdered milk (dry milk) to prepare kheer, which is served once a week as part of the mid-day meal menu to children. The powdered milk will be supplied to schools by government-run cooperative MILKFED (which runs VERKA milk plants across the state).

As per the notification issued, schools are required to use seven grams of milk powder per child for making kheer. The milk powder will cost Rs 273 per kilogram; this amount will be paid to MILKFED from the ration amount they are granted for mid-day meals. Besides increasing the sale of milk powder, sources said, this step by the government has been taken to ensure children consume kheer prepared from ""quality-tested"" milk as earlier, schools purchased milk from local dairies and other shops which do not undergo a quality check.

Also, with adulterated milk widely being sold across Punjab, one needs to ensure children are not made to consume the same.

The order, however, clarifies that MILKFED will supply 10-kg powder milk cans to schools with 150 children or above. In other words, government schools with less than 150 children (mostly primary and in far-flung villages) will have to arrange the item on their own.

Welcoming the government's decision, Amarjit Singh, a government school teacher from Mansa said, ""Some schools are already using powder milk as it is easier to handle and store. Also, it tastes better and children prefer powdered milk in the food they consume.""

Another teacher from Ludhiana, Dharamjit Singh said, ""There is not going to much of a cost difference as a kilogram of powdered milk can be used by several students when compared to liquid milk. Also, it is easier to store powdered milk.""

Punjab State Education (elementary) Director Inderjit Singh, ""We have taken this decision as MILKFED agreed to supply powdered milk to our schools. The quality of milk had become a cause of worry as adulterated milk is openly sold in the market. The powdered milk by MILKFED passes through several checks.""

Singh added, ""The only concern might be cases of theft. Some people can try and steal to take the milk powder home. We need to look for a solution for this soon.""

It also decided to scrap Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009.

With the objective of making Kannada-medium Government School students ready to compete with those from private English-medium schools, the Education Department here has taken a significant decision to start English-medium classes in Government Schools in the State.

In a bid to provide quality education to rural students, the Government has decided to start the English medium in selected schools. It will start admission to English medium from Class 1 and 5th standard from the next academic year. The Government has already started the process of recruitment of teachers exclusively to teach English medium students besides to prepare syllabus and to conduct the exams.

One of the main reason for starting English-medium classes is that parents in even rural areas want their children to study in English-medium schools as English has largely become inevitable for better career prospects at the global level compared to regional language.

Despite having Government School in their locality, parents send their children to far off places to English schools. Starting English classes would not only help in retaining students in Government Schools, but would also encourage the parents to send their children to such schools.

The State Government has also decided to scrap the RTE and use Rs.400 crore grant of the same for the development of these English medium Government Schools. Government is reimbursing the fees to private schools for 25 percent quota admissions under the RTE Act. Moreover, the State Government is worried over student strength in State-run schools was declining as parents preferred to send their children to private schools under the RTE quota. Nearly 5000 private schools are surviving only because of the funds they are availing under RTE quota. The steep hike in expenditure reimbursement has also become headache to the Government.

The State Govt. has increased the expenditure per child from Rs.5,924 to 8,000 for pre-primary school students and from 11, 848 to 16000 for others. Besides this, the number of students admitted under the quota has been steadily increasing every year.

As many as 4.5 lakh students have been migrated to private schools from Government Schools after the implementation of admissions to private schools under RTE quota from last four years in the State. Shockingly, most of the Government Schools are facing the closure threat after introduction of RTE in the State.

Chief Minister writes to Principal Secretary Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy had already written a letter to Principal Secretary to Government Education Department (Primary and Secondary Education) Dr. Shalini Rajneesh to take all necessary steps to open English medium schools from next academic year. He also directed her to scrap RTE and stop releasing funds to private schools under RTE admissions quota. He has told to utilise RTE reimbursement funds to train the teachers of government schools and recruit teachers to English Medium."

He further said these teachers would be recruited through a new system that would include a system of weightage giving preference to better qualified candidates.

The recruitment will happen with the help of the Teacher's Recruitment Board (TRB), he said. ""We are now inspecting the vacancies and the appointments will be made after we complete the survey,"" he said.

He also announced that special part-time teachers, who handle subjects such as physical education, drawing and music in schools, would not get full-time employment.

A resolution adopted at the district general body meeting of the Koottani held here recently said that the strength of learners was ever-increasing in the State.

However, of late the School Education Department has decided to close down about 1,500 government schools with less then 10 students on their roll, the resolution said adding that this will affect the student community to a big extent. The students of such schools will have to go to far away places for continuing their studies. The decision will affect the student community as well the teachers, the resolution added.

Another resolution said that School Education Minister K. A. Sengottaiyan held discussion with the educationists in the beginning of this year and introduced the new syllabus after a gap of 12 years. He also announced public examination for Plus One and consideration of the combined marks of Plus One and Plus Two for admission into higher courses. These decisions were welcomed by all. However, the Minister has come out with a new announcement that the marks of the Plus One public examination will not be taken for consideration for admission into higher degree courses and Plus Two marks alone will be considered. This has shocked the educationists.

Such a decision will only favour the private school managements, as they will concentrate in the Plus Two subjects in the Plus One year and also in conducting special classes for NEET. This will badly hit the government school students. The meeting urged the Minister to convene a meeting with educationists once again to discuss this issue.

Another resolution stated that late Jayalalithaa announced the abolition of the new pension scheme for the teachers and continuing with the old system. But, the present state regime did not implement the announcement of the late leader.

The humming of children can be heard as one takes the curve while driving from Cement Bridge towards Azad Gunj, Baramulla. The building on the left side of the curve is not just another school in town, but a repository of important memories. As an unrivaled landmark of old Baramulla, ""The College School"" has today become a vibrant campus of nine schools, from a 'Jabri School'.

Back in the day when Baramulla was the Gateway to Kashmir, Jabri schools were opened by Maharaja Hari Singh for imparting education to Kashmiris. However, people were reluctant to send their wards to these schools. To fulfill Maharaja's decree, administration led by Wazir-i-Wazarat -- the present-day divisional commissioner -- would literally drag children to these schools. And therefore the name, Jabri -- forced -- school was coined.

""Before 1947,"" says Khaliq Parveez, a local author and poet, ""there was a dire need of educated and skilled labour. So in order to fulfill this need, five Jabri schools were set up in Kashmir. This [Baramulla's Jabri School] was one among them.""

The College School of Baramulla.

There was a special team comprising of selected teachers and students who would work as a special task force to drag students out of their houses and bring them to school, the author says.

Over the period of time, the school witnessed the times of peace, the hours of unrest and the years of turmoil, but nothing has stopped its journey of great contribution to the society.

""This institution has a legacy of producing gems,"" says Irshada Jaan, headmistress of the school. ""It has been a kindergarten to such people who were destined to sit at the top layer of Kashmir.""

Taking out a thick and long register from her cupboard, she starts reading out the names: Abdul Rashid Bhatt, Labour Commissioner; Aijaz Ahmad Kakroo, Advisor to CM; Dr Abdul Hamid Zargar, ex-Skims Director; Mushtaq Ahmad Sheikh, Divisional Commissioner; Mir Tariq, Director School Education, and the list goes on.

The school was momentarily affected by the explosive political reaction in the old town. With time, says Muneer Ahmad, a former teacher of the school, the roll of students even came down to 58.

""Then in 2015,"" he says, ""a special team of young teachers was set up to reform this historic institution. I was also a member of that team.""

In order to improve the student footfall in the school, eight schools of nearby localities were clubbed together, including a high school, five primary schools and two middle schools. It took the roll to 108.

The team of teachers took to modern teaching techniques and personality development, with main focus on kindergartens.

""We collected funds to purchase the much required equipment and build facilities,"" Muneer says. ""These efforts bore fruit and soon school was buzzing with students again.""

The roll went on increasing and finally one day the school had to put up a notice No Vacancy to stop insisting parents to pressurize the school authorities to admit their wards there.

It's most likely the first and the only government school in the Valley where administration had to refuse admission due to the swelling roll of the students. In most of the government schools, however, the situation is just the opposite.

""The school had to introduce entrance test for the students at KG level, on the style of private schools, as the roll shot up to 300 plus,"" Muneer says.

But now, the campus housing nine institutes is struggling due to deficiency of accommodation and increasing number of students.

""We're studying in one school but we're tagged different, our mark sheets, our attendance all are separate,"" says Adnan Ali, a class X student. ""We feel overcrowded when all students are present. There, in fact, is no space left for some students even to sit in the classroom. We make shifts. When one class leaves for games, other students enter the room to attend a lecture there.""

The absence of labs and playground further disheartens students.

""I had formally written to the authorities on sanctioning of a building, conveyed it to the CEO also during his timely visits, but nothing happened,"" says Jameela Showkat, ex-headmistress of the school.

The only solution to this situation, says Abdul Ahad Wani, CEO Baramulla, is to de-club some schools from there.

The move might give a breathing space to the heritage school, but it's also feared to undo the hard work of the team of young teachers who played a yeomen's role to replace the growing hush with the increasing hum. Maybe, the authorities can do better than simply undoing what the young teachers did to make it an inspiring government school.

Nitish Verma, a Class VI student who has joined Government Senior Secondary School, Jharsa, from Shiv Public Senior Secondary School, Sohna, said, ""The library here is far better -- we have all types of books.""

Sachin Khatana, a Class X student of Government Senior Secondary School, Abheypur, said, ""I had been studying in New Shaheed Smarak Public School, Abheypur, since kindergarten. The school didn't have facilities such as a proper playground or co-circular activities for students. Last year, when I visited my friend in this school, I saw students playing on two big playgrounds.""

Sushma Dalal, teacher of the Abheypur government school, said, ""As many as 40 students who were studying in private schools have come to our school, this year. One of the reasons is teachers are regular and take pains to ensure every child learns the lesson.""

Premlata Yadav, district elementary education officer, said, ""Students of government schools are now getting good results and people realise that the quality of education has improved."""

If the packets were damaged or the content inside was spoilt, it was returned to the KMF. The school headmasters were responsible for checking the packets, he said.

Intervening, Shivanand Kapashi, CEO of Zilla Panchayat, directed Mr. Seshasayana to inform the headmasters not to get or store additional milk power packets. He also directed him to submit a report on this issue to him.

Ms. Jyoti also said that some schools were not sending the winners of zonal level Pratibha Karanji competitions to the cluster level competitions. Mr. Seshasayana said that he would look into the matter.

A reply to an RTI from the Public Works Department (PWD) has revealed that rainwater harvesting (RWHs) systems are yet to be installed, or begin operations, in government schools and office buildings in the capital. This despite the National Green Tribunal (NGT) pulling up the Delhi government and asking it to file a response on the installation of RWH systems in schools and colleges in January.

The tribunal had given the government 30 days to file a response, following which it had ordered an inspection of areas that had not installed the systems in July. The RTI application was filed by activist Yogesh Kumar, but the PWD stated it has ""no information"" on such an application.

In January, the NGT had sought implementation of its November 2017 order, asking government and private schools, and colleges to install rainwater harvesting systems at their own cost. Moreover, Rule 50 of the Delhi Water and Sewer (Tariff and Metering) Regulations, 2012, makes it mandatory for all buildings on plots of 500 square metres or more to set up an RWH system.

The rainwater harvesting guidelines of the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) state that RWH systems are important to prevent a fall in groundwater levels and to increase availability of potable water.

With the Delhi government yet to notify the January order, the NGT had directed DJB to inspect all residential and commercial buildings on plots of 500 sq metres and above in July. The tribunal had also ordered a fine of Rs 5 lakh as environment compensation on buildings that haven't installed the systems.

As against about 30,000 enrollments recorded earlier, government degree colleges this year have succeeded in catching the attention of more than 40,000 students.
