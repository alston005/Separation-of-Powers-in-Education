Pics/Rane Ashish

The 148-year-old Antonio Da Silva High School in Dadar West has been witness to the ever increasing traffic around it. When the hub of Dadar attracted vendors to sell various kinds of goods, and the market grew, the hustle bustle around the school increased and with it rose the traffic chaos. The parents of students at the school have to brave the crowds to drop them to the institute and pick them up.

It is the presence of traffic marshals in front of the school, which has kept its buses, taxis and other vehicles moving. The school has a compound to accommodate parents who come to pick their children, so they need not wait on the road. Parents are happy that they are allowed to park their two-wheelers near the school while they pick up or drop their kids. Many prefer to take public transport such as BEST buses or trains. However the parking of the buses on an arterial road during the school leaving hours adds to woes of commuters.

The presence of traffic marshals in front of the school has kept its buses, taxis and other vehicles moving

Due to the presence of traffic personnel around the school, four wheelers are not allowed to stop in front of its gate, which is exactly at the turn towards Dadar station. As the spot is always busy since it is a market area, there is hardly any space to walk.

There are several popular locations in and around Dadar that pull in the crowds such as the Siddhivinayak temple; the proximity of the school to the station also keeps the area near it busy. Parents and locals pointed out that on Tuesdays the traffic and crowds increase. Many people walk on Tuesday from the station to the temple. When this happens at the same time as the school leaving hours, the area gets crowded.

Major Problems

. Buses parked outside the school after it is over

. Regular heavy traffic around Dadar station that adds to the problems of parents

. Hawkers thronging the footpath outside school"

Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has informed schools that Aadhaar will not be required for admissions in schools, Deccan Chronicle has reported. This comes after the recent Supreme Court (SC) verdict which ruled that Aadhaar cannot be demanded for school admissions, bank accounts and new mobile connections.

UIDAI chief executive officer (CEO) Ajay Bhushan Pandey has clarified that making Aadhaar mandatory for school admissions is against the law and no student should be denied admission on that basis. Hyderabad parents association told the paper that few of the parents have been facing this issue as schools are demanding Aadhaar card for new admissions as well.

The SC verdict had also emphasised that Aadhaar would not be mandatory for the examinations conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Examination (CBSE), National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for medical entrance and the University Grants Commission (UGC).

However, SC had ruled that Aadhaar requirement would remain valid for filing of Income Tax (IT) returns, allotment of Permanent Account Number (PAN) and welfare schemes.

Earlier in October, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has been directed by the Department of Telecom (DOT) to not disconnect services of the consumers during the document changing process. COAI includes members like Indian telecom giants Airtel, Vodafone Idea, Reliance Jio etc."

One of the parents, said, ""The school represented themselves in front of child rights commission and also in Bombay high court as CBSE board affiliated school despite not getting any affiliation from the board which is illegal.

Pics/Sneha Kharabe

The 155-year-old St Stanislaus School, among the oldest educational institutions in the city, is located bang on Bandra's bustling Hill Road. But, despite slotting different school hours for primary and secondary sections, the traffic congestion here continues to be a giant headache for parents and local residents alike.

Autorickshaws, vans and other vehicles ferrying children crowd the entrance to the school buildings every morning and evening. A row of auto rickshaws can be seen parked on both sides of the road. As St Stanislaus School doesn't offer transportation services, parents depend on these vans and autos as a more reliable and economical mode of transport. While some are able to find space close to the gate, others have to park on the opposite side or on the adjacent road, adding to the chaos.

Children and parents crossing the road in the middle of traffic adds to the general chaos

As soon as the bell rings, students of the primary section race to the gate. The auto drivers then wait until they have found all the students who will be crammed into their vehicles, holding up traffic in the narrow lane. At the gate of the high school section, one can see a long line of students crossing over the divider to get to their autos parked on another road. Due to the absence of the traffic police at the junction, motorists and the bus drivers can be seen stopping traffic even when the traffic lights are green.

Barring the safety factor of the students who cross the road on their own, a majority of the parents who come to pick up their children have a scooter and tend to park right in front of the gate. Most of the parents don't stop for longer than a minute, but multiple scooters lined up waiting outside the gate results in a massive traffic congestion on the busy road.

An illegally operating auto crammed with schoolchildren are a common sight in front of the school gate

PrincipalSpeak

Principal Anna Correa said, ""At the beginning of the year, we had set up a traffic committee, mostly made up of willing parents and some teachers. Parent volunteers come in the morning, at the lunch break and after school to help at the gate. Along with the school, they have worked out a way to reduce congestion problems. For instance, no parking is allowed at the main gate and vehicles have to be parked either before or after the gate. The senior boys enter through gate number 3 and the younger ones use gate number 1. Our disadvantage is that our main gate is common for both St Peter's Church and the school. It is not possible for us to control people from coming in for church services. While the traffic department agreed to send two officers to help, they only send one in the morning as they are understaffed.""

. Autos, vans, crowding the school entrance

. Parents parking their scooters or stopping their rickshaws to drop off or pick up kids, causing a traffic jam

Varsha Ashok Kaware, the headmaster's wife, had lodged a complaint with the police after the incident.

According to the First Information Report (FIR), on September 24, Kaware had punished five students for mischief at school. When the students complained to their parents, they rushed to the school to confront the headmaster. They then hurled abuses at Kaware and even beat him up.

I cannot keep waiting till then hoping that the schools will call me and inform about the vacancies. There needs to be a proper system. There cannot be so much of uncertainties.""

Ravi Varma, another parent, said, ""There should be clear information of vacancies and instructions to the parents. We have been approaching many schools since November for our son's admission to Standard II next year. But we are not getting any confirmation.""

Global Indian International School principal Amrita Vohra said, ""If there is a vacancy and the applicant is from a school affilated to the same board, we try to help the parents in the best possible way. It all depends on the vacancies for a particular year.""

On many occasions, students taking transfer to another school or shifting to another city do not withdraw the leaving certificates. ""Such situations lead to the lack of clarity on the vacancies,"" she said.

City Pride school principal Ashwini Kulkarni said, ""We have started putting up the vacancy information on our school website. We ask the parents to check the site after January 15 for the vacancies, instead of doing the rounds of the school.""

Anubha Sahai, an education activist and parent, said, ""It's difficult to get admission in some schools in both primary and secondary sections because of donations and higher fees for the in-between class cases. They keep parents waiting for months.""

Aam Aadmi Party, Pune, spokesperson Mukund Kirdat said, ""Ensuring an in-between class admission is a challenge for the parents and they keep on visiting the schools between December and March just to find out the vacancy positions.""

He added that the schools should put up information of the vacancies for in-between classes on the website ""instead of keeping them secret""."

Parents of Prajapati, who is a class five student in Gurunanak National High School, Sion, have alleged that their daughter fell ill from the Measles and Rubella (MR) vaccination provided by the government at her school. Prajapati is currently hospitalised and is being observed in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

Government health officials have refuted such allegations and have said the girl was already infected before being vaccinated. According to them, the fact that Prajapati fell ill after being vaccinated is only a coincidence. However, the situation has put school authorities in a fix as parents are no more consenting to vaccines.

The vaccinations were monitored at the Gurunanak National High School on November 29. Prajapati's sister, who is a class seven student in the same school, also received the MR vaccine on that day.

Prajapati's father, Tarkeshwar Prajapati, said, ""After receiving the vaccine my daughter complained of nausea and headache. She was also running a temperature. Since then, she has been under medication and on Sunday, we shifted her to the Sion hospital. Presently, she is in the ICU and has been diagnosed with pneumonia. At the time of the vaccination, she only had a mild cough. As per my knowledge, doctors were given instructions to not administer vaccines to students with a fever or cold and cough. If my daughter had a cough, they should not have vaccinated her.""

Such cases across the state have intimidated parents; they are hesitant to let their children take vaccinations at school.

A parent of another student of the Gurunanak National High School said, ""After reading related reports, I am hesitant to let my children be vaccinated at school. We have been asked to partake in a meeting with the doctors. Let us see what they have to say.""

The principal of the aforementioned school said, ""Most of the parents, though educated have refused to consent to vaccines. We cannot force them. We are organising a meet between parents and government doctors.""

Prashant Redij, secretary of the Mumbai School Principals Association, said, ""Eighty per cent schools have been successful in administering vaccines to their students. Only 15 to 20 per cent parents are doubtful. I think if parents want their children to be vaccinated by family doctors, the government should also direct these doctors to vaccinate children to make the project a success.""

Dr Santosh Revankar, Joint Executive Health Officer, BMC, said, ""Prajapati's case has nothing to do with the vaccine. It is only coincidence that she fell ill after being vaccinated. If the vaccine had to react, it would have reacted immediately; within an hour or so. Her nausea is due to the fear of vaccines.""

""It was noted that on compliance of the DoE order, the school would be in enormous deficit, even if the basis of calculations of DoE, which though contrary to the Rule position, is accepted. This huge deficit might even lead to the unceremonious closure of the school known for imparting qualitative education for over six decades,"" said the letter sent by Bluebells School International, East of Kailash.

""DoE had been apprised of the adverse effects of the order. However, the request has yet not yielded any result,"" the letter to parents stated.

The school, which is sited on government land, maintained that the implementation of the pay commission pay scales in 2017-18, as per DoE's directives, had resulted in ""enormous additional"" financial burden. ""Hence, charging the fee on the basis of 2016-17, as per the (August) order, would make it impossible to pay salaries to the staff members, leave aside the payment of balance of arrears... and meeting other essential expenses in 2018-19.""

Bluebells has moved Delhi high court on DoE's order, maintaining that it does not need government permission to raise school fees.

Parents say schools ask their children to bring extra books apart from routine timetable as they rush to complete portions. This adds to the load that students are carrying in their bags. The Union human resource development ministry has asked states to come up with norms of their own or follow the Maharashtra or Telangana models.

A parent from a Central school said, ""My daughter is in primary and she carries hardly four textbooks, but the size of those books is quite big. While they use worksheets, the weight of her bag is too much.""

The parent added, ""The school initially asked us not to give food from home in order to reduce the weight of school bag but her school canteen doesn't give healthy food. They have noodles and Chinese dishes that have left with upset tummy. So she carries tiffin which adds to the weight of her bag.""

According to a government order of 2017, the prescribed weight of school bags should be between 1,800 gm and 3,425 gm. Maharashtra's policy is that the weight of a bag should not exceed 10 per cent of a student's weight.

Jayant Jain of non-profit Forum for Fairness in Education said, ""The state education department has only formed a rule but it has not yet been implemented. The implementation will happen only when action is taken against schools that flout the norms. Students still carry heavy bags. The department doesn't have enough manpower to carry out inspections.""

Do you remember when getting an education was a simpler task? Go to school, study, write exams and move on to next class. While that may be oversimplifying it a bit, one must admit that students, parents and schools have their work cut out for them these days. While the pressure on students to perform, excel and succeed has been steadily increasing, parents too are scrambling to keep track of what is happening in their child's life. And school, where it all happens, not only needs to provide a challenging environment for the child to thrive but also ensure their safety.

Chirag Palande was having dinner with his wife one night when they began talking about an efficient way to be more involved in their daughters' academic progress, and everything else that was happening at school - tests, exams, last dates for fee payment, etc. The result was SchoolHandy.

This Mumbai-based app went live this year after Chirag spent a year-and-a-half doing research.

""We had done a survey to understand what schools need, and spoke to a group of parents as well. In some schools, there was no way to communicate with parents except having them attend PTAs, something which not all parents have the time for. Though some relay info through SMSes, many schools noted that parents don't check them,"" says 37-year-old Chirag.

SchoolHandy takes a stab at solving this communication gap by offering a gamut of services for an ""efficient schooling experience"". It is an end-to-end, cloud-based, parent updating app that covers it all: a child's safety and live school bus tracking, report cards and information dashboards, forums where the school can interact with parents, and a chat platform to get queries quickly answered.

Chirag notes that the app helps avoid any gaps in communication between the school and the parents. Take, for example, the live school bus tracking feature. With child safety becoming a growing concern in the country today, this feature helps to ensure the child is safe en route to or from school. This feature can be accessed by both the parents as well as school authorities.

SchoolHandy also provides a one-to-one chat platform and real-time updates on forum discussions between the school and the parents. This way, parents are kept in the loop and receive important notices, notifications and emergency alerts that schools send, which the children may fail to relay.

What's more, you can actually pay your child's school fees through the app too, besides monitoring your children's homework and accessing results after the annual exams. Its radio-frequency identification (RFID) based attendance system eliminates time-consuming roll call systems.

SchoolHandy installs hardware devices with a tracking mechanism in schools, which help record attendance and also alert parents that the kid has entered or left the classroom.

""In essence, with this app, parents will feel more involved while schools will have the relief of relaying vital information to them. The application is very simple to use,"" says Chirag. The app has 7,000 downloads so far on the Play Store.

Chirag has over 18 years of experience in marketing and innovation. He also founded brand 'Mobaccs', which sells VR glasses and remotes. He runs both SchoolHandy and Mobaccs; SchoolHandy is promoted, funded and managed by Mobaccs.

The SchoolHandy app is currently free to use for both schools and parents. The company, however, charges the school for its hardware such as GPS and attendance system and plans to add different features to the app like online shopping, kids insurance, loan for school fees, which will give them revenue in the future.

Around 80 Mumbai schools work with SchoolHandy at the moment. It is also working with four schools in Gujarat and three in Pune. The team of four is also in talks with more schools in Gujarat, Pune, and Hyderabad.

Running after schools and getting them on board was SchoolHandy's major challenge. Chirag says that in areas where these technologies are not that known or heard, this was even more difficult. However, demonstrations helped the team to convince the schools over time. The founder says they are open to customising offerings for the schools based on their needs.

A report by KPMG and Google says that the Indian edtech market will touch $1.96 billion by 2021, with close to 9.6 million users from $247 million and over 1.6 million users in 2016.

There are a few other players in this space like Applane Solutions, School Diary, Falcon, and Educhat.in, each focussed on specific services or offering slightly varied services.

According to Chirag, what gives SchoolHandy an edge over the competition is the fact that all the services are available on one platform.

SchoolHandy aims to cater to at least 100 schools across India by the end of three years, and also plans to add a feature for updates on cultural and other activities conducted in the schools - where photos, videos, can be shared. Creating a solid revenue model is also on the cards for this entrepreneur.

Apart from this, it plans to add a feature, where the books can be delivered at the doorstep with a nominal fee."

A toxic combination of poverty, poorly-paid teachers with anti-migrant prejudice and a lack of training on nonviolent discipline in government schools means marginalised children are significantly more likely to experience corporal punishment, said a new study.

Corporal punishment is a form of violence against children and is illegal in India.

Yet 80% of marginalised children report being punished by teachers, while an average of 43% said they were regularly beaten, up to three times a week, according to a new report by Agrasar, an NGO. In some schools the number of regularly beaten students rose to 88%.

The abuse does not end along with the school day. The majority of these children also experienced beatings at home (74%), while a similar proportion of parents admitting to doling out beatings at home (71%).

These are the findings of a survey from a randomised sample of 521 children and 100 parents in Gurugram, an area which experienced a 29% increase in migrant arrivals between 2000 and 2011, largely from poorer states, such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh.

However, ""given that the same mechanisms of economic deprivation and social exclusion are at work, the findings apply to disadvantaged children elsewhere in India"", the report said.

No positive outcomes of corporal punishment have been found, while it is established that physical and mental forms of abuse can have a detrimental effect on child health and wellbeing, including mental-health problems, behavioural issues and cognitive ability, according to the report.

The fear and stress associated with corporal punishment can create ""school-phobia"", leading to increased dropouts, low-retention rates and poor academic scores, significantly impacting on education outcomes, the report said. Children who have experienced such abuse are also more likely to display criminal behaviour, commit violent crimes as adults and suffer from substance abuse.

In 1992, India became one of 128 countries to agree to the United Nations (UN) Convention of Rights of the Child 1989, which outlawed school corporal punishment and required the government under article 28(2) to ensure that ""school discipline is administered in a manner consistent with the child's human dignity"".

The Right to Education Act 2009 further enshrined child safety in schools, stating no child ""shall be subjected to physical punishment or mental harassment"".

Yet, despite such legal protections, recent government studies have found the problem persists. Social structures enforcing the normalcy of corporal punishment remain pervasive in Indian society.

Teachers do not appear to discriminate on the basis of age when it comes to meting out corporal punishment. Both younger and older children alike experienced similarly severe forms of punishment and ""almost on a daily basis"", the report found.

The only difference is that younger children are more likely to experience physical punishment, compared to older children who are more likely to suffer from verbal abuse.

""Physical punishments were given to us when we were young. Now we get mostly verbal punishments, for example we are being ridiculed for our mistakes in front of the class,"" said one girl respondent in the 8th standard.

Marginalised children were found to experience corporal punishment more frequently, with 88% of those surveyed reporting they are regularly beaten at school, up to three times a week. This is ""significantly higher than then average and does not even include verbal abuse"", the report said.

Many children reported verbal and physical abuse on a daily basis, with at least one child reporting he experienced physical punishment ""two times a day minimum"".

As a result, many have become accustomed to such experiences as part of the school routine and fabric of their education experience--71% of children believed it's okay to be beaten up ""for a reason"", having been taught its for ""their own good"" and ""necessary"".

The types of physical and mental punishment distributed by teachers vary in levels of pain, with slapping, ear-pulling, denial of bathroom use and forced periods of standing mentioned as ""not so serious"" punishment forms.

This can increase to more painful types, such as a teacher caning palms and calves, striking the knuckles with a duster or scales and beating backs and heads with their hands, all of which are the ""most common forms of physical punishment"".

Many schools keep a dedicated stick to beat children, the report found.

Cases of brutal punishment, combined with ""psychological torture"", were also narrated by the surveyed children.

Banging students' heads against a wall was turned into ""a game"" by one teacher, with several children recounting that he would often pretend three or four times that he was going to bang the child's head against the wall before actually doing it.

Mental abuse is even more frequently handed out, which for the children of migrant workers in Gurugram often consist of derogatory and racist slurs which many children do not even recognise ""constitute a form of corporal punishment"".

Referencing their low socioeconomic status, these children are labelled as ""Bihari"" or ""Bengali""--denigrating and catch-all terms for any non-locals, regardless of their actual state-of-origin.

These slurs are often followed up with insults such as ""donkey"", ""good for nothing"", ""uneducated"", ""illiterate"" and comments that they had had ""a bad upbringing"", which tend to affect older children the most.

Girl students are subjected to relatively more verbal harassment than boys, often framed in sexist language which instill ""toxic gender stereotypes"". Teachers were found to often resort to comments about their looks, age and weight, ""recommending"" marriage instead of education and minimising their capabilities and skills compared to male peers.

Both male and female teachers were found to mete out corporal punishment in a ""ritualised and uniform way"", with marginal differences in the severity and frequency of punishment they enforced.

While many teachers were found to slap or hit students, some punished students ""with brutal and cruel violence that requires creativity and premeditation"".

Almost all parents (91%) approve of teachers using corporal punishment and use it at home themselves. However, this figure is likely to be higher, as parents tend to not consider ""mild"" forms of physical abuse and verbal harassment as a form of corporal punishment.

Trapped in abusive environments

""A complex mix of social and structural factors perpetuates corporal punishment in our classrooms,"" the report found.

While wealthier, better-educated children are not immune to receiving, disadvantaged children are exposed to a number of influential risk factors which increase their likelihood of experiencing corporal punishment.

Low-income families, living in poor conditions and often with both illiterate parents working long hours in the informal sector, are unable to properly support their children's education.

Absence during the day, followed by exhaustion in the evening, means parent's ""emotional resources"" are largely consumed by their struggle for survival.

Children must manage their own homework and school activities themselves, often in a troubled environment ""characterised by maltreatment and neglect"" brought about by poverty and ""existential"" stress.

Even mothers who were ""homemakers"" in Gurugram were found to interact with their children ""very little"" over school matters. They assumed that the child would bring up any serious issues with her if there were any and relied on elder siblings plus the child's ""own motivation to pursue their studies and education"".

Failure to submit homework, poor test-performance and school absences are major reasons for receiving corporal punishment and which end up hurting children from low socioeconomic backgrounds the most.

Even if they desired, parents are often unable to move their child from the free local government school to another, lacking the financial means to entertain other options.

Migrant children often become the target of ""disdain and contempt"" by teachers who withhold empathy and support. Teachers punish children for their inability to articulate themselves as per the teacher's ""expectations"", as bad language (commonly used at home by both parents and children) and poor language skills enter the classroom.

Periods of absence as migrant children return to their native state for long stretches of time, or even accompany their parents to work, further antagonise teachers, the report said. Upon their return to school, children are unfairly punished for their parents' decision to travel.

Such teacher attitudes are a result of sustained social stigma attached to the less-educated, migrant population, with discrimination against the ""labour class"" rubbing off onto their children.

Teachers feel it is not worthwhile to teach migrant children as ""they will only be cleaning someone's house later anyways"", the report found.

They believe the children are unable to perform well in school and think rationally, as teachers see poverty as ""a genetic predisposition"" which means the children are unworthy of education. They fail to understand that a lack of opportunity and access to resources is why they are struggling with formal education.

The social divide is also keeping parents and teachers from interacting and establishing a working relationship, further impeding the child's education.

Poorly-paid, over-worked and under-resourced teachers operating in sub-par working conditions further adds to the problem, as teachers ""vent out their anger and act aggressively towards students"" and ""rarely show awareness for professional conduct"".

Poor governance, such as a lack of Corporal Punishment Monitoring Cells--set up by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights to ensure the ban on corporal punishment is enforced--means unethical teacher conduct is not always properly dealt with, the report said.

The danger is that a toxic combination of all the above-mentioned factors means children are arbitrarily subjected to forms of violence, with no repercussions for teachers already operating with minimal oversight.

Children were found to be punished for ""normal childlike behaviours"" like going to the bathroom, talking in class and during breaks, running around the school yard and fighting with other children.

The cost of corporal punishment

Around 53% of children surveyed never tell their parents if they have been punished at school, undermining a ""trusted relationship"" between parent and child. This also means many children are internalising potentially traumatic experiences, with severe consequences for their mental health and wellbeing, the report found.

Perceiving that learning and corporal punishment ""go hand in hand"", children become desensitised to the violence they see everyday and even lose the ability to identify milder types of physical and mental harassment.

As violence goes unrecognised, resistance builds which in turn can lead to the severity of the violence increasing. Children who experience violence are also more likely to ""become violent perpetrators themselves"".

There is a risk that through the prevalence of corporal punishment, schools are teaching children ""on a large scale that violence is okay"" and is contributing to levels of violence in Indian society at large, the report said."

But if education is diverted only for financial benefit, there will be less space for formation of students. Surprisingly, some educational institutions are heading only for financial profit. Profit is priority. Students are secondary. This has placed education upside down. Instead of learning lessons for life, students learn only how to pay fees of different kinds from January to December. Financial burdens are increasing day by day. I say this in regard to post selection exam trauma of Cl. X and Cl. XII students in some schools across Nagaland.

Selection exams for Cl. X and Cl. XII are over in most of the schools in Nagaland. But after exams, there appear various fee collections. I still wonder as to why some schools have to collect money under numerous reasons or agreement with parents. Some of the best examples are Caution/security deposit, Coaching fee, Re-exam fee (if failed in 1/2 subjects), etc. Such collections of money have become normal routine in some schools. Parents accept this illegal routine blindly because it cost the future of their children. Many parents must be paying such amount ranging from rupees 6000 to 10,000 or even more after selection exam. The amount is high enough for many poor parents. Students who passed selection exam pay lesser amount because they are intelligent enough. With-held students are forced to pay more as per the number of failed subjects. In other words, payment is done according to the performance of students. Is this a healthy education? Is money equivalent to intellectual calibre of students? Do students perform better when they are forced to pay money to the School? Do Students pass their examination just because they have paid the said amount to the School? I do not think it so. The Principals and heads of Institutions are free to think otherwise. But it does not suit well under the banner of quality education. Parents are worried about the future of the children, while the school is worried about collection of money for various reasons. Yet, most money collections after selection exam are illegal and unnecessary. Schools must collect only what is necessary (e.g. Board Exam fee). What is not necessary must not be collected. The aim of getting good result need not be substituted by collection of money.

One student said that he has to pay rupees 200 per failed subject to re-write the paper. Another student said that they were asked to pay rupees 50 per subject. All the more, some students were asked to pay rupees 3000 per failed subject with the promise of getting back the amount if they succeed in board exam. This is not true education at all! What if they fail, who takes the money? It is a shame that some educational institutions see failure and success in term of money. If rupees 3000 per student is collected in the name of Coaching fee, multiply the amount according to the number of students in Cl. X and Cl. XII. Rupees 3000×150 students=4,50,000/- only. May be the whole amount is paid to those teachers who take extra classes to maintain good reputation of the school. All the same, students have already paid 12 months tuition fee. I hope there is no 13 month in the yearly calendar of the school.

Caution/security deposits are collected from students (rupees 2000×150 students=300000/- only). If a student absent himself or herself from coaching class, rupees 100/200 per day is deducted from it. Is this not a funny education? I am sure no school pays back the amount with interest after holding the money (7/8 month) till the declaration of result. Deduction takes place, but interest is not paid to students. One side of the coin does not match the other side. Are we heading for 'financial education' or 'education of students'? There is much hollowness in our educational system.

Few points for further reflection:-

If students have paid 12 months tuition fee, do they still have to pay coaching fee?

If they are to pay caution deposit, does the school return the amount with interest after holding the amount for 7/8 months?

Can student pass his/her exam by paying re-exam fee (in case re-exam is held under payment as practiced is some school?)

Is money equivalent to success and failure?

Are we heading for financial education rather than formation of students?

The day to day running of educational institutions are solely under the care and guidance of the principals or heads of institution. All rules and regulations in schools are aimed to discipline and form students in the best possible means. But many schools have numerous untold laws and rules like the above mentioned realities. Let no school become institute of 'educational extortion.' There are better ways of succeeding in life. Education is just one way. There are better means of forming students rather than imposing financial burdens on the weak shoulders of parents and students. The above dirty face of education needs some cleansing for the betterment of students. All schools do not come under this dirty blanket. All the same, what happens in schools and colleges are best known by the Principals, Parents and Students. In the process of aiming for best result, let us not deform young students. Change can best begin in schools. Let us not chain the expected change in our schools.

How do I tell my family I am gay? How do I put on a condom during sex? Madhavi Jadhavi founded ThatMate, a platform that understands all your questions and aims to address social issues and mental health. All this from Satara, a small town in Maharashtra.

Let's admit it, sex as a topic is still taboo with most Indians. Growing up, how often have you turned to the internet just because your parents found it awkward to discuss sex with you openly? In many households, it is not spoken of at all, despite how important it is to educate one's child on safe sex practices.

How many of your teachers skipped the entire chapter on 'human reproduction' in school because they were embarrassed to talk about it? Or, worse, how many of you were forbidden to talk about periods with boys or loudly in public?

A good education may not necessarily translate into awareness because of the stigma and taboos that exist in Indian society. This is why awareness of social issues and mental health is important at different levels.

Here's where ThatMate steps in. Founded by Madhavi Jadhav, it's a platform that aims to reduce the myths associated with sexual and mental health through engaging tools such as comic books, cartoon characters, workshops, online forums, and counselling.

Madhavi tells me that she's always been a rebel at heart. Raised in a small village in Satara district, Maharashtra, it was not unusual to witness girls getting married once they started menstruating.

""I was working with Shell after completing my education, and during this time, I realised I wanted to work for people rather than a big money-making firm. I decided to quit my job and shift to Satara. I explored many places and realised that there was a dire need for education and awareness among children as well as adults. I reached out to some of my friends and with their help, conducted workshops and seminars for children between the ages of seven and 10 about ""good touch-bad touch"" and safety. The workshop received a wonderful response and this prompted me to start ThatMate,"" she says.

ThatMate aims to bring topics that have been long-considered normal and commonplace in most Western societies.

""One trait that I want to work on is my ability to convince parents, teachers, and other adults to allow me to engage their children on different subjects. We want to encourage dialogue to dispel misnomers, misunderstandings, and ignorant stereotypes that can, at best, cause isolation and further prejudice and, at worst, lead to abuse and even death. However, I do not want to use that fear as a tool to convince adults that our mission is important. I would like to convince them through logic and other means. Fear is not effective, so I need to be able to bring in a constructive, concise dialogue, with the ability to listen and absorb, reformat my tactics and understand how to engage my audience better,"" adds Madhavi.

ThatMate uses a friendly, open, gender-neutral, culturally sensitive approach. It has collaborated with five schools in Satara and will engage with 500 schools in the Sangli district reaching out to approximately 2,00,000 students. It has reached over 13,000 youths through Sarahah (an anonymous social media app) and has conducted 24 Facebook live sessions.

Madhavi has presented ThatMate at platforms like Tedx and LeanIn India. It has also been incubated at Deshpande Foundation, UnLtd India and Atal Incubation Centre, Banasthali, a NITI Aayog initiative.

The startup is bootstrapped with the online platform following a ""freemium"" model.

Madhavi explains, ""Certain services are open to people who have agreed to pay for them. Those that have the free tier will be given advertising to help subsist the costs. This is primarily true for the forum where ads will be offered along with certain videos and services. Our workshops will be on a service model where we will ask for funds directly from the organisation, or through other organisations in the form of sponsors or donors.

Comic book sales are offered at tiered levels depending on the quality of the comics themselves and sponsored outreach. We have special pages for select advertising to reduce the overall cost of the comics to our demographic.""

The response to various programmes has been encouraging. Madhavi shares with us a few quotes from parents and teachers.

""I was abused by my neighbour when I was in the second standard. I didn't know about it until I was a part of the Safe Unsafe touch workshop."" - Student

""I now understand the difference between gender and sex. Also, I used to get scared of transgender people before. After the workshop, I have realised that they are also a part of society and should be treated equally."" - Parent

Madhavi is happy about starting up in a small town. ""The operational costs are lower and the acceptance rate is higher,"" she points out.

ThatMate's future plans include more workshops and partnerships with leading schools in Satara, Solapur, and Kolhapur.

""We will collaborate with NGOs like Tathapi, Stree Shakti Sansthan, Goonj and Enfold. Our immediate need is to raise funds to enable us to objectively achieve our goals. Our long-term goals include establishing a base of operations, hiring a technical team for developing applications, partnering with developers in the gaming and animation sectors, looking for partners in private and government areas, completing our comic book series and offering them in a variety of local languages, and growing our knowledge base with more subject matter experts. We want to reach out and change the lives of over one million children in the next five years, with an equivalent number of adults,"" says Madhavi."

Amitesh was one among the many students of Bethany High, Koramangala, who took part in the Digital Detox Champion Award. His essay goes on to end with, ""If we leave these games, we can spend more time outside and spend more quality time studying... This is how digital detox helps us.""

The Digital Detox initiative was launched in July, where children were told that regulating their use of the internet and gadgets could help them gain rewards and recognition. The management, students and parents agreed upon a policy that the parents will share the child's electronic usage time with the school. Dr Akash Ryall, director of Bethany High, says, ""Some parents approached us and told us they were struggling with having a conversation with their kids. They requested the school to intervene. When we researched digital addiction, we found that it can be worse than substance addiction.""

Rewards were distributed across three categories: Those who gave up their gadgets completely, those who used it only on weekends and those who used gadgets for only one hour every day. ""We announced the results during the general assembly so as to motivate more students to take part in it. And for those who didn't take part, we will be holding another round. The winners will be declared at the end of the school year, in March,"" says Dr Akash, adding that across seven institutions, around 100 students were given the award.

Beginning early

Besides schools, parents too are turning to digital detox programmes. In April, city-based mother Shalini Srivastava sent her 12-year-old daughter for a detox programme meant for kids aged 10-15 years old. Since it was during the summer vacation, Shalini didn't want her daughter watching TV or surfing the internet for hours. ""I thought it would be a good way for her to indulge in different activities. Once the programme was done, my daughter took an interest in gardening,"" says Shalini.

Ishwarya Kumar Ahmed and Sudhalini Devadason, co-founders and directors of Upturn Learning Solutions LLP, which launched the initiative, soon started getting requests from parents to launch the programme for younger children too. The duo introduced a junior slot (for five-eight year olds) for the second season of the initiative, which will begin towards the end of November.

During season 1, the programme was conducted over the course of eight days. Season two, however, has been planned over a span of 12 weeks. ""We wanted the programme to be more immersive. The kids will get a chance to recreate the famous Malgudi Days and develop an interest in reading and folklore, learn Kalaripayattu, take part in DIY projects and even be part of a fun offline science experiment,"" explains Ishwarya.

Plugging out

In the first week of October, Time Out From Plugins, an initiative started by city-based mother Tejaswi Uthappa, was launched at Delhi Public School - Bangalore North. The idea was simple: To get students to pledge to time out from plug-ins. Tejaswi recalls instances where parents in her circle would tell her they don't see themselves in their children's lives anymore or have to compete with a screen for their attention. ""The idea was never to abstain. Instead, by logging out of devices for two hours, we could prevent misuse and spend that time fostering real world connections with our loved ones,"" she says. Besides a social media campaign, more schools and hangouts are being approached in order to spread the word."

The school administration has claimed otherwise and said the structure was completely safe.

Parents of dozens of students studying in the Brahmand-based Rainbow International School were wary of the weather shed constructed a few months back by the school. The wary parents were shocked to see the temporary structure when they visited the premise recently and feared it could be a huge safety hazard for students who access it regularly for extra-curricular activities.

""The shed could collapse or some of the rods may give way and lead to serious injuries to the students,"" said a concerned parent.

While few parents had initially approached the school regarding the same, they later alerted the India-Wide Parents Association seeking their assistance in dealing with the issue. The association sought images of the structure from the parents and once convinced, immediately wrote to various education departments asking them to look into this matter urgently as the school is set to reopen on Friday.

""Building a temporary shed in a school was a violation of several safety norms including the child safety guidelines among others. The temporary structure could be a safety hazard for students who access the terrace area for extra-curricular activities. We have written to the NCPCR, the education minister, the Maharashtra State Child Right's Commission and the HRD ministry to conduct an inspection and take the necessary action,"" said Anubha Sahai, president of this association.

""The safety of our students is our first priority and the structure was put up as a shield against heat and rain.

In our run-up to Women's Entrepreneurship Day, we focus on women from non-metro cities who have battled many odds to become entrepreneurs. 'Small Towns, Big Dreams' pays tribute to their grit, determination and hard work. We start off with myskoolbus.

Born in a conservative Marwari family in Gujarat, Pooja Khemka, Co-founder of myskoolbus, deems herself lucky to have parents who stood by her in every endeavour. Despite some opposition, she joined college and later convinced her parents to allow her to study chartered accountancy.

Entrepreneurship happened to her quite by chance. Marriage and motherhood happened and a specific incident changed her life forever. Once, she was stuck in traffic and missed her son's school bus. She couldn't track the whereabouts of the bus as she was unable to reach the transport manager on the phone. The bus was on the move and it was a harrowing few moments until she located the bus.

These tense moments sowed the seeds for myskoolbus, a school bus GPS-tracking application for parents that she started with her friend Preeti Agarwal. Pooja recounts, ""Has anyone ever thought of the plight of a mother who is eagerly waiting for the arrival of her kids from school and they don't show up on time? I have personally experienced that and the incident left me traumatised.""

Started in 2013 in Ahmedabad, myskoolbus leverages advancements in information technology and telecommunications like GPS mobile tracking, radio frequency identification (RFID), cloud computing and mobile apps to address different pain points. It gives real-time visibility to parents and institute authorities while alerting them on any deviation from the defined thresholds. In short, it ensures the safety of your children, while on the move.

Pooja explains why starting up in Ahmedabad was a good choice. ""I am a homemaker, and for me to balance both family and business was very much essential. Apart from that, controlling costs like lower rents and cheaper resources since we are bootstrapped played a big factor. In addition, relationship and trust are key drivers of awareness and purchase in the small cities. I believe if you are able to carve a niche in a small town, you can corner the market by being the only one in the area,"" she says.

Being a woman entrepreneur based out of a non-metro comes with its own set of challenges. Pooja bemoans the lack of support from local media and feels that startup stories come mostly from metros. ""Also, convincing the clients that women-led startups can deliver long-term quality services at a competitive price was difficult. Communicating and convincing transport contractors and drivers was a major challenge,"" she points out.

""Often, the men would come and tell me in Gujarati, ben aa tamaru kaam nathi (Sister, this is not your work), and I used to be upset to hear that. But with the support of my parents and husband, I overcame situations with ease to provide effective solutions to my clients.""

The sheer lack of technology-led pitching events in a city like Ahmedabad is also a major impediment when it comes to networking. However, Pooja is happy with the mentoring support myskoolbus has received from the Cherie Blair Foundation - London, Facebook's SheLeadsTech programme and the Kalorex Group.

Within a short period, the response has been encouraging. ""When we started, there were many people who challenged our venture for four months saying you cannot do it. It's not a woman's job. In fact, some school authorities also took us lightly. But now the naysayers have been converted into satisfactory clients,"" says Pooja.

Future plans for myskoolbus includes working on transit surveillance with AI support to understand different situations that can arise during the journey like fights among students, misbehaviour or others. It is also planning to venture into individual women and child safety and tracking solutions that includes wristbands, safety bags, among others."

They claimed they had complained to the school management at the time of the incident but the authorities allegedly refused to take any legal action against the accused students. Police have registered a case against two students under POCSO Act.

Police said the alleged molestation took place during an inter-school competition held at the Greater Noida-based private school where students from different institutions had come to participate. The victim, who is a Class VIII student of a different school, had allegedly got into an argument with two senior students of the host school. After a heated exchange of words, the two students allegedly took the junior student to the washroom and molested him.

The 14-year-old boy's parents approached the police and alleged that the Greater Noida school had refused to take action against the two senior students. The police have, however, registered their complaint under Section 323 of the IPC for voluntarily causing hurt and under provisions of sections 7 and 8 of the Protection of Children Against Sexual Offenses (POCSO) Act.

The school management told TOI that the accused could be seen on CCTV taking the 14-year-old boy to the washroom. They said the authorities had conducted an internal investigation in which it was revealed that the junior students had been beaten up after he made a racial slur at the two senior students.

""The victim student had used a racial comment against the accused, which triggered the fight. After the incident came to light, both the victim and the accused students were made to confront each other. The allegations of molestation are baseless,"" a spokesperson of the school said."

State chief electoral officer Anand Kumar has asked district electoral officers (DEOs) to get letters of pledge signed by the students, especially of private schools in cities and towns, so that the voting percentage increases in urban areas.

In the last polls, government school students were asked to fill in the letters of pledge, which led to an increase in voting percentage. For the present assembly polls, Kumar wrote to DEOs last month to involve private school students in the exercise organised under the Systematic Voters' Education and Electoral Participation (SVEEP) programme, an election commission initiative.

In what is called urban apathy, many city people enrolled in the voters' list do not go to booths to exercise their franchise. Students of private schools will be roped in to nudge their parents and family members to vote, poll officials said.

The parents have been asked to post selfies with their children after voting, showing fingers with indelible ink marks. Three best selfies will be selected for felicitation on the National Voters' Day on January 25, 2019.

""Last time more than 65 lakh letters of pledge were filled in the state. This time the letters of pledge will be filled in from November 12 and submitted to district electoral officers by November 21,"" Kumar said in his letter.

In the 2008 assembly elections the polling percentage was 66.49%, which increased to 75.67% in 2013 in Rajasthan.

District electoral officers will appoint district education officers as nodal officers for the work, who will coordinate with SVEEP committees and schools, the letter said.

Though district education officers do not have direct control over private educational institutions, electoral officers will coordinate with English-medium schools to get the letters of pledge filled in.

""An orientation programme can also be organised at the private schools for the students, so that they can understand the action plan and get inspired to get the letters of pledge filled,"" the letter said."

In the absence of state guidelines to regulate school admissions, the process of enrolling students promises to be stressful for city parents.

Admission process for the academic year of 2019 have commenced with schools following their own timetable. This means parents are running around to fill application forms, attend in-person interviews and take school tours. Keeping track of the multiple timetables is a challenge.

""With the growing competition, one is not sure of making it to a top school and most parents apply in multiple schools. Since there is absolutely no uniformity in admission schedules, there is a lot of time and money lost in the process along with the additional pressure [of a child making the cut] till one gets through a school,"" said Andheri-based Aditi Singh, who is looking to enrol her three-year-old daughter into school this year.

In the past, several organisations and parent groups, like the PTA United Forum, have written to the state education department to come up with a timeframe within which schools across the Mumbai metropolitan region (MMR) can conduct admissions. However, in the absence of any such guidelines from the state government, each school follows its own schedule and process.

""Each school has its own requirements depending on the board it offers and other factors which make it difficult to regulate admissions,"" said an official at the state education department who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Admission schedules for city schools vary depending on the board they offer students. Most Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) schools and those offering the Indian Certificate for Secondary Education (ICSE) conduct admissions between October and February. Those offering the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE), International Baccalaureate (IB) and International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) begin admissions in August and the process often goes on until January. Most prominent schools under the state board begin their admissions process between December and January.

Prominent city schools charge anywhere between ₹500 and ₹3,000 for an admission form. Some schools also charge to arrange school tours before parents apply. Arundhati Chavan, president of the PTA United Forum said, ""With admissions for the next year beginning this early, parents are under immense stress. Many schools conduct interviews with parents and they have to keep up with all the different schedules while they have a full-time job.""

Psychiatrist Dr Sagar Mundada said admission-related anxiety is common in mothers during this season. ""We get many patients who are often anxious about getting through a particular school. Most of this pressure comes through competition with peers and the status attached to a 'good' school,"" said Mundada."

Srinagar: Taking cognizance of reports about some schools indulging in single-point-sale of books and uniforms, Private Schools Association of Jammu and Kashmir (PSAJK) today directed all of its member schools to remain fair and transparent in their dealings and allow books and uniforms to be sold in open market.

The Association in a meeting took strict notice of some reports in media and said that such a behaviour wherein a parent is forced to purchase books, uniforms and other school items from a particular shop or from school itself, won't be tolerated. ""This violates our ethics and principles and I am sure every school adheres to rules. Although there are some black sheep against whom we will take strict action,"" said G N Var Chairman PSAJK. ""We have decided to take steps to take care of such a problem.""

The Association has instructed all of its schools to allow books and uniforms to be sold in the open market. ""Parents can purchase books, uniforms and other items from any shop and there won't be any directive from any school. Plus there won't be any exorbitant rate on the items and everything will be priced reasonably,"" said Var.

The Association also held a meeting with DC Srinagar wherein it was decided that both the sides will take every possible steps to stop the practice. ""The administration will do its job and we will also prevent any abuse of power from our side. Our primary concern is the welfare of students and parents, which will be maintained,"" said Var.

The Association has also formed a committee of educational experts who will prescribe standard books, which can be used in the schools. ""There have been reports that some schools sell low-quality books at high rates just creating doubly whammy for parents. In order to stop this practice we will be coming out with a list of high-quality books that can be prescribed to students based on their merit,"" said Var.

The Association has called for help from the general public to help in streamlining the sector. ""If anybody feels that he is being fleeced by any school or forced to buy books or uniforms from any particular shop, he can contact us and we will immediately take action in this regard,"" said Var.

The Association said that most of the schools adhere to the agreed principles and maintain their standards, however, it is often one dirty fish that spoils the whole pond. The association appealed people to remain cautious of such schools and said that any person can register their complaint on Association Phone No 7889578450.

The JJB had in December last year declared that the juvenile, who was over 16 years at the time of the alleged murder, would face trial as an adult. It had taken cognisance of the amended Juvenile Justice Act, which says any juvenile in the age group of 16-18 can be treated as an adult in case of heinous offences.

But the juvenile's father had challenged the order before a sessions court, which had upheld the JJB order. The father had then filed a petition in the high court. On October 11, the high court had ruled that the case be referred back to the JJB for re-consideration and had dubbed the process adopted by the board for its judgment ""illegal"".

Sushil Tekriwal, counsel for the Class II student's parents, said on Thursday they had countered the ground on which the HC had passed its October 11 order. ""We have filed a petition in SC challenging the HC order,"" said Tekriwal.

While passing the order, the HC had considered the juvenile suspect's submission that they had not been given a copy of the social and psychological report, on the basis of which the juvenile had been declared an adult.

Apart from terming the JJB's process illegal, the HC had also directed the board to take the help of a psychologist. The SC petition challenged this, pointing out that the JJ Act clearly mentioned that seeking the help of an experienced psychologist or other experts for such an assessment was optional and not mandatory.

""The HC must have formed an independent medical board to corroborate the views of the two courts before passing the impugned order,"" the petition highlights.

Following the HC order, the JJB in Gurugram has started a fresh assessment of the juvenile. On Thursday, he was given a personal hearing by the board, which will now make an assessment. The JJB will also constitute a board on November 3 for medical and psychological assessment of the juvenile suspect.

The Class II student, whose parents moved the SC on Thursday, was found with his throat slit and oozing blood inside the school bathroom in September last year. Within hours of the incident, Gurugram police had arrested a bus conductor. Following a persistent demand by the aggrieved family, the Haryana government had handed over the probe to the CBI. The investigation agency arrested a Class XI student of the same school for the alleged murder and gave a clean chit to the bus conductor."

Interestingly, Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education (KITE) has begun a massive audit to ensure the schools are fully utilising the facilities. According to the parents, the District Education Officer during a recent visit found the school did not comply with the rules. R Sivankutty Nair, the parent of a student, said the school authorities shifted the classroom to wreak vengeance on the class teacher of 9A.

But teachers of Chinmaya Vidyalaya, Alappuzha don't seem to agree. It seems like 'good food' means boiled rice for them, and everything else is, well, not so great.

Students say the school, one of the prominent private higher secondary schools in the district, has made boiled rice mandatory for lunch for all students and has instructed them not to bring other food items for lunch more than twice a month - including rice-based dishes like idli and dosa.

""Sick parents"" are excused to pack something else for his/her ward for a day or two, but they must inform the concerned class teacher beforehand.

The school has also formed ""inspection teams"" consisting of two or three teachers, who visit classes during the lunch breaks almost every day, to check if students are following the order.

""They visit our class almost everyday to see what we are eating. If somebody is seen eating something else, they are asked why they have not brought rice and our parents are contacted over the phone. If the student repeats it, he/she is scolded by the teachers,"" a class VI student said.

However, school principal Dr S Lali refuted the claim. ""(Only) Non-vegetarian food items are strictly prohibited in the school. The teachers randomly visit classes to check if anybody is bringing meat to class. Biscuits, oily snacks, and aerated drinks are also not promoted in school. (Otherwise) Teachers are only asked to check if students are eating properly or not,"" she said.

She also said there are no other food restrictions in place in the school. ""Earlier, students of junior classes used to waste food and when asked they used to say they were packed things that they don't like. Some parents, looking for an easy way out, pack them items from the previous night after heating them. This monotony triggers a dislike towards food among them, she said.""

""No practice is in place that a parent should alert the class teacher for giving them something other than rice. But they bring chappati, idli, puttu or dosa all five days and rice is completely avoided,"" she went on to underline.

Not all parents agree. Stating that she usually contacts her daughter's class teacher when she has not packed rice, the mother of a class VII student said: ""No parent will purposefully give poor food to their ward and I don't think it is unfair to consider their tiffin preferences. Also, is it not a crime to be scolded before the whole class?""

'Rice is not special'

So, does the consumption of boiled rice make big a difference to the health of the child? Is it more nutritional than other popular food items?

No, says Dr Mumtaz Khalid Ismail, Kochi-based consultant clinical nutritionist.

""Rice is not mandatory. Calorie wise, there is only a negligible amount of difference between rice and wheat. Hence, there is no harm in giving them chappatis or curd rice for lunch. Packed lunch of a schoolgoer should meet one-third of his/her total daily calorie and protein requirements. They shouldn't skip breakfast or lunch but that doesn't mean rice should be force-fed. A balanced diet should be the only priority,"" she notes.

But, Dr Mumtaz agreed that it is better to avoid monotony and bring variety into the child's food habits.

Parents, though, ask how is this possible if the school authorities keep insisting on a particular food regime.

School principal Dr Lali said, ""If children prefer idli or dosa, let them have it. But it can't be permitted with just chutney or sambar; healthy side dishes like 'aviyal' or raw vegetables is a must.""

Parents' choice matters

But can a school possibly dictate what the students can eat and cannot?

""The school has no right to do so. Children of school-going age are minors and thus their guardians can decide what to cook for their children. Such a decision will be valid only if it is unanimously passed by the Parents Teachers Association,"" said advocate G Harikumar of District Court, Alappuzha.

Another parent stressed that no such meeting has happened yet at Chinmaya school. ""Usually, PTA meets happen class-wise. Can't talk for others but they haven't asked my opinion in this matter yet. Though I can understand the intention behind such a decision, I don't think all parents and kids will be okay with it. Rice is Kerala's staple food, but there are many who prefer other cereals over rice,"" the parent, whose child studies in Class X, said.

Pupils who spent their formative years abroad are allowed to bring other food for lunch, the principal confirmed.

That is another sore point. ""Are they not concerned about the nutrition needs of those students? If rules are implemented, everybody should be treated equally. Aren't such exemptions and preferences unfair?"" another parent asks."

On Tuesday, the situation was back to normal with the road flooded and the school un-approachable, parents rued.

Located just outside the boundaries of the Kadugodi ward, the road is partly under the jurisdiction of the Seegehalli Gram Panchayat. As a result, the road, around 2 kilometres in length from the main Whitefield-Kadugodi-Hosakote Road, is untarred, muddy and narrow. A few days ago, owing to heavy flooding, the school sent out a warning and operated shuttles till a residential neighbourhood to avoid having their students wade through the waters to reach school.

According to him, it is not possible to walk to school or get there by two-wheeler when the road is flooded. ""Added to this, is the chaos from the whitetopping work on the main road.

The good Samaritan, Rajesh Shah, runs a general store with his brother right where Arushi was spotted. Since his son studies in the same school, he recognised the uniform.

""From my shop, I spotted the little girl crying, and rushed there immediately. She was so scared, she could not answer questions properly. I immediately brought her to our shop, where my brother and I tried to calm her down. I called the school's landline, but was shocked when the official responded that I should contact the parents instead. I then called the number on the child's ID card and spoke to her father,"" said Shah.

""Understandably, her parents did not believe me at first. They thought their daughter was in school, and Nehru Nagar is nowhere near it. But once they confirmed it with the school, they rushed to my shop. Both of them were crying and distressed,"" he said, further adding, ""I am immensely happy that I was able to help the family. I read news reports about unfortunate incidents every day, and am glad that I was able to avoid one here.""

Rajesh Shah found the toddler and reunited her with her parents

What happened

According to Shweta, Anushi had fallen asleep on the bus, and the attendant forgot about her. Once the other kids alighted at the school, the bus headed to Kurla for some work. It was parked at Nehru Nagar, where Anushi woke up. Out of habit, she exited the bus but got scared upon realising that she was in an unfamiliar place. After walking on the footpath for a while, she started crying and was found by Shah.

Shah added that while her parents turned up soon after he called, the bus driver got there around 9.15 am, but the school authorities only arrived around 10 am. The Jains and Shah both called out the school's negligence.

Shweta said, ""Anushi was crying inconsolably after we were renuited. She told me that she was afraid of getting lost again, and so she did not want to go to school anymore.

""We took her home and then rushed to the police station to lodge a complaint against the school. But the school authorities have assured us of immediate action in the matter, promising more stringent regulations for students' safety. We want this assurance in writing, along with an apology letter, within 24 hours, otherwise we will lodge an FIR against the school,"" said Anushi's father, Piyush, while waiting at Govandi police station.

Other parents angry too

Shah said, ""My child studies in the same school, and if this is their approach towards safety, it is a matter of concern."" The incident caused major anger among other parents at the high-profile school as well. Several of them arrived at the police station in solidarity with the Jains, and laid out a list of issues with the school's transport services.

""It is a mandatory bus service by the school for all children, for which they charge heavily. The least we can expect is the safety of our children. It is very irresponsible of the lady attendant to forget a child. What is the point of having a lady attendant and CCTV cameras when our kids are still not safe? They charge us anywhere between Rs 24,000 and Rs 36,000 per year,"" said one of the parents.

Another added, ""How could the school not notice that the child was absent, even though she was marked present on the bus? The school should have at least been sensitive enough to swing into action upon finding out what had happened.""

School says

Rachana Laxminarayanan, school principal, said, ""It was an unfortunate incident, and we support the parents. We rushed to the spot as soon as we got to know about it. The attendant was unwell today, so there was a human error, as she did not switch on the CCTV surveillance. We are going to terminate the services of the bus contractor. A meeting will be held with parents to understand their concerns regarding transport services, to make appropriate changes.""

Expertspeak

There is no clarity on who should be held responsible for the incident, since the school bus policy does not apply to playgroups or nurseries. Social activist Indrani Malkhani, who was an integral part of the committee that formed the school bus policy, explained, ""The school bus policy is applicable to buses running for schools. School starts from Std I, so buses for lower classes can't be called schoolbuses."""

""Education is not only for getting a job but it also leads to development of the village or a society as a whole. It is very important because when children attend school, villages develop, the society is different and it can provide different opportunities especially in terms of livelihood.

The fate of 1,600 students enroled in the school hangs in balance as the government is mulling shutting down the school after at least two cases of sexual abuse of children were reported.

The department has already shut down pre-primary classes and has also reportedly recommended CBSE to de-recognise the school's primary and higher classes too. Parents allege that the education department officials have done precious little, despite tall promises, to get the 290 children who were enrolled in nursery and kindergarten classes readmitted in other schools.

Earlier, officials had promised parents that they would get assistance in securing admissions for their children in other schools of their choice. Now, several parents feel the department officials are shirking responsibility. ""How will we know which schools have affiliation and which don't? Instead of giving us names of recognised schools, they have just asked us to choose,"" says Aasiya Khanam, a parent. While parents have been vocal about not wanting the school to be shut down, lack of response from the school management has left parents in two minds.

It has come to light that soon after the closure of the pre-primary section, the management had assured parents that classes would be made operational. It had also assured that classes would be run during the Dussehra vacations to make up for those lost last month when the school for shut for 10 days. However, it "" unexpectedly' declared a 10-day long vacation on Monday, leaving parents confused about its intent. Earlier on 1 October, parents under the aegis of Azzan Internation Parents Association met the management and submitted a charter of demands.

These pertain to the removal of staff in including directors and principal; upgradation of security on the premises; and formulation of a parents, teachers and management association and a grievance cell.

Days after a 5-year-old girl was allegedly molested by a teacher at a Kolkata school, parents of students protested outside the premises Tuesday, calling for action against the accused. A case was lodged the same day, after which the accused teacher was arrested.

""The teacher has been accused of sexually abusing a minor student. A probe is on,"" Deputy Commissioner of Police (South East Division) Kalyan Mukherjee told The Indian Express. The incident allegedly occurred on September 26.

Police sources said the protest turned violent when police personnel were escorting 300-500 students out of the school premises. They suspect that the protesters saw teachers attempting to leave the school amidst the students, following which they began pelting stones. The police resorted to lathicharge to disperse the crowd.

Apart from the accused teacher, the police also arrested four protesters for their involvement in the violence, sources said. ""During the scrimmage, eight to 10 police personnel sustained injuries and are under treatment at different hospitals. One woman demonstrator was also injured but left the place on her own. Four trouble-makers have been arrested,"" said an official.

The police released a statement which read, ""Today at about 9.45 am, information was received from officer-in-charge of Lake police station that trouble sprouted at a school... Police were informed that aggrieved guardians of the students started staging a demonstration over an alleged molestation incident which reportedly happened on September 26 during school hours. The parents of the victim lodged a complaint at the police station today.""

Police sources said action was taken immediately after the complaint was lodged. A case was registered at Lake police station under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC and under the POCSO Act.

When police officers arrived at the school to nab the accused, guardians of students allegedly got into an altercation with school authorities and demanded that the accused be handed over to them. In the ruckus that followed, a teacher was manhandled and some protesters were injured.

Later, a meeting was held between parents, school authorities, police and a local councillor of Kolkata Municipal Corporation to solve the issue. During the meeting, parents demanded that no male teacher should be allowed in the school.

""They demanded that all male teachers be removed from the girls' school. I will convey this to the education minister. For the time being, it has been decided that only female teachers will take classes till Class V,"" said councillor Ratan Dey.

Primary school council chairman Kartick Chandra Manna told reporters, ""It is an unfortunate incident. Everything has been conveyed to our education minister. For the time being, the accused teacher will not be allowed in the school. If he is found guilty action will be taken. A probe will be done. A few outsiders took advantage of the incident and triggered tension in the area. Police have identified them and action will be taken against each of them.""

Repeated calls to school authorities went unanswered.

""If the school and police had acted in the very beginning, such vandalism wouldn't have taken place. Female protesters were beaten up by the police for no reason,"" said one of the protesters, Mousumi Mondal.

A team from the West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights also visited the spot. ""We are keeping a close watch on the incident. Police have already arrested the accused. If he is found to be guilty, proper action will be taken,"" said Ananya Chattopadhyay, chairperson of the West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights.

At least three guardians were injured, one of them having sustained head injury in the lathicharge. Besides, two teachers and 10 cops, including Lake police station OC Suman Kumar Dey and Gariahat police station OC Sumit Dasgupta, were injured. The accused teacher, Dipak Karmakar (58), a resident of Vidyasagar Colony, was taken to the Lake police station and arrested after his version seemed questionable. He has been charged with Section 10 of POCSO Act and several other sections of the IPC. Four guardians have also been rounded up for rioting and vandalizing and are likely to be arrested. ""We have arrested the accused. We are abiding by children rights commission's regulations. The situation turned tense as the residents took law in their hands. ,"" said a senior police officer. The cops claimed they apparently acted in defence.

The school education department has called for a probe even as it instructed the institute to lodge a complaint of rioting. Police have been asked to provide security on Wednesday, when an attempt will be made to reopen the school.

According to the girl's mother, the upper-KG girl was assaulted by Karmakar, who taught English and Bengali at the school, on September 26. Since it was the day the BJP had called a bandh, only 21of the 40 students were present. ""After she returned home, I noticed she was behaving unnaturally. But she did not open up. For the past few days, she had been refusing to go to school,"" her mother said. Only recently, did she tell her parents about the torture. The child reportedly told her parents that Karmakar had taken her to a separate room where he allegedly physically assaulted her. The parents informed the school about the assault but the authorities apparently did nothing about it. The parents claimed to have a doctor's report, saying child was physically abused. ""The school runs between 6.30am and 8.30am. after which the students are provided with mid-day meal around 9am before the classes are called off,"" an officer said. ""After that, special sessions are held for students facing difficulty with lessons. Karmakar apparently used this pretext to take the child to a room on the first floor, where he sexually assaulted her,"" said an officer.

The school, however, denied the allegation, saying they were informed about the incident only on Tuesday morning when the principal came out to speak to the survivor's mother. The principal alleged the girl's parents, along with scores of other guardians, demanded that Karmakar be handed over to them immediately and that they did not respond to her repeated attempts to open a dialogue. The police said it was around 8am that they received a call from the school. ""A team from the Lake police station went to the school and brought the accused to the police station. We questioned him, found his answers to be questionable and arrested him,"" said an officer. ""However as the word of sexual abuse spread, the crowd kept swelling. The parents initially staged a demonstration pointing to lax security at the school. But around 10am, they began demanding that the accused be handed over to them. When the crowd started to turn violent, we summoned forces from the Gariahat and Rabindra Sarobar police stations.""

""Stopped from barging into the school, the protesters reportedly pelted the cops with stones and managed to break open the main gate. But with cops standing as a barricade, they could go no further in but they attacked the personnel,"" claimed an officer. Some from the crowd -- ruffians from nearby slums also apparently joined in -- vandalized cars and bikes parked on the road. They even reportedly tried to torch a bike, after which cops resorted to lathicharge. What followed was a bloodied ""battle"" of three hours, in which the mother of a child suffered severe head injuries, after being allegedly hit by a cop with a lathi. Several guardians alleged they were kicked by cops. A teacher was attacked by the protesters only to be saved by the students.

Shortly, the school authorities sat with the cops and school education department officers and took four decisions: to reopen school within 24 hours with police help, the accused cannot attend school till the probe is over, a rioting case will be filed by school and a proper probe will be launched into abuse allegation and a report will be submitted. ""We have several CCTV cameras on the premises and we want the truth to come out,"" claimed a teacher.

Ananya Chakraborti, chairperson of the West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights, who visited the school said they were extending legal and counselling help. ""She is in trauma. The commission will keep an eye on the probe and may seek CCTV images,"" she said."

What are the major concerns surrounding the weight of school bags?

Schoolgoing children have been burdened with heavy bags. I have seen young students carry bags weighing upto 10 kg everyday on their shoulders. It is no more just books, but several other materials like project stationery, large or multiple tiffin boxes, umbrella, raincoat, sports uniform, etc. in additional to the conventional notebooks and stationery. All this will cause major health hazards for students, harming their growth, both physically and intellectually.

Has the government taken any step to check this?

The government has taken steps, but they aren't strong enough. There was a government directive in July 2015 which strictly restricted schools from allowing students carrying weight more than 10 per cent of their body weight. Even the PCMC education department recently started the 'No School Bag Day' policy on the first and third Saturday of every month in civic-run schools. But, all that cannot change the overall scenario, because both parents and schools need to be actively involved in its implementation. More awareness programmes and stringent laws can help.

Can you suggest possible solution(s) for this?

I have noticed students carry a lot of weight, just not of notebooks, but textbooks as well. One of the measures is to recycle books. These textbooks can be kept on the school premises and can be used by the students during school hours. Also, many students end up taking more books to school, even of those subjects which are not in the routine, in the fear of being called out in the class for not having it. Many a times, classes in school often get switched and the routine changes, so students are scared to be in such a spot. The recycling process, really helps as they would not have to carry any books at all. Also, if required, these students can keep another copy of the same book in their homes for home study or borrow the same books from the school during examinations. The other suggestion is spreading more awareness, which we have been working towards."

Angry over lack of teachers in a zilla parishad-run primary school at Karanjote village in Bhiwandi, parents of children attending classes there put a lock on the main gate of the school on September 25. Residents said they took the step after their demands for increasing the number of teachers ""fell on deaf ears"". The school currently has two teachers for more than 100 students, claimed a local resident.

Ramesh Jadhaw, father of a six-year-old girl, said: ""This is the only school for nearly five villages and adivasi padas. Children come from different villages, travelling several kilometres. However, there is no teacher for them. So what is the point of having a school?""

Jadhaw is one of the many residents, who have been demanding that the school be better equipped to teach over 100 students attending classes there.

""The school conducts classes till standard seven. The headmaster looks after a few standards, but mostly it is just one teacher who teaches all the subjects in all seven standards. How can one person teach so many children?"" asked Ashwini Gavle, parent of a seven-year-old.

Parents claimed that even those two teachers are absent on many occasions. ""Of the few days that the school was open, the teachers are mostly engaged in either government deputation or training. How are they expected to teach our children?"" Gavle added.

Residents of Karanjote village claimed to had written to all senior authorities. ""We wrote to the education officer at the zilla parishad multiple times since 2016. Some of us even visited the officer. But nothing changed,"" said Sukanya Jadhaw, a local resident.

""In September, the children had hardly a week of school... while the rest of the days were declared holiday. Why is the education department carrying on with this farce? This is not how a school functions,"" she added.

On September 25, when the teachers did not turn up at the school, parents took all the children out and put a lock on the front gate of the four-roomed school premises in the middle of the village, sources said. ""We won't let anyone reopen the school unless the number of teachers is increased. Under the Right to Education law, there has to be a teacher for 30 children. We want at least that rule to be followed,"" said Krushna Jadhaw, another parent.

Meanwhile, Bhiwandi Zilla Parishad Education Officer Sanjay Thorat said: ""There were supposed to be four teachers at the school. There were three earlier, one of whom had been involved in some tussle with the villagers. We have added one teacher to the current situation and the parents have agreed to start the school again from Tuesday. There is a shortage of staff."""

Three persons have been arrested for allegedly cheating parents of the students seeking admission at St Joseph and Don Bosco high schools.

While Chandrakant Bhosale (27) was arrested from Kurla railway station Tuesday, his associates, Radheshyam Bindra (32) and Shyamlal Rajbhar (34), were arrested by the Matunga police on September 27 after they were brought in for questioning. They have been accused of preparing fake payment receipts in the name of the schools.

Police said three cases came to light when the parents approached the school separately to check whether the seats in junior kindergartens have been confirmed for their children. ""When they went to the respective schools with the payment receipts, the parents came to know that they have been duped. The Father of St Joseph High School came to the police station and handed us a written complaint,"" said an officer.

During preliminary investigation, the police learnt that the group had cheated three parents of Rs 1.20 lakh, Rs 1.05 lakh and Rs 75,000, respectively.

""The parents identified the main accused as Chandrakant Bhosale, who had claimed that he is in good terms with the principals and could help them with their ward's admissions. Later, with the help of his call data records, Bhosale was arrested from Kurla station,"" the officer said.

""We came to know that the accused had given the parents receipts of much lesser amounts than to they had actually paid for admission. Bhosale had claimed that the school would not want to mention the donation amount in the receipt,"" the officer added.

Following Bhosale's arrest, the roles played by Bindra and Rajbhar came to light. ""Earlier this year, Bhosale had wanted to print fake receipts of the schools. He initially approached Bindra, who guided him to the third accused. Rajbhar has alleged that Bhosale was introduced to him as an employee of Don Bosco High School... and that the school would give him a printing contract on Bhosale's recommendation,"" the officer said.

So far, the police have come to know that the group has cheated three parents. The three have been booked under sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 465 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged), 472 (making or possessing counterfeit seal with intent to commit forgery punishable) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC.

The state education department mandates students submit government identity proof for its Students' Achievement Tracking System (SATS). Since Aadhaar card is the only option for students below 15 years of age, parents had to go through the process of obtaining a unique identification card for their children.

However, since UIDAI reveals biometrics of a person changes once they attain the age of 15 years, it's mandatory to get biometrics revised. This meant parents had to go through the process of obtaining an Aadhaar card for their wards twice.

Prejita Singh, from Electronics City and a parent of a 7-year-old, said, ""I am happy with the verdict of the Supreme Court. I was a little apprehensive when a prominent school in Electronics City asked for Aadhaar details. First, I didn't want to get Aadhaar before my child crossed 15 years of age, and second I had doubts over the security of the data.""

Mahesh Jain, from RT Nagar and a parent of a 12-yearold student, said: ""After a huge hue and cry, I had to submit, my son's Aadhaar card in school. I could not understand the point of submitting Aadhaar details. It left great scope for misuse since schools don't have safe websites or strong cyber teams to handle data theft. I am happy with the verdict.""

Most schools too are pleased with the verdict since it will reduce the workload on staff. M Srinivasan, principal, Gear International School and president, CBSE Schools Association, said, ""I am happy with the verdict. Parents were reluctant to share their children's biometric details with schools. They were not comfortable at all, but the Supreme Court's decision solves the problem.""

Echoing Srivivasan's view, Mansoor Ali Khan, member, board of directors, DPS, said, ""It was an additional task for school administrations to collect and maintain Aadhaar data. I hope the Karnataka government also does not make it mandatory, because it would then be difficult to make parents understand why it's important.""

'Will lead to corruption'

But others are unhappy with the court freeing the admission process of Aadhaar data.

""Having Aadhaar records made it possible for us to track students in the long run,"" said Shashi Kumar, general secretary, Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka. ""Through Aadhaar, we were able to secure details of hundreds of ghost students registered by schools for benefits. I hope it continues for RTE admissions."""

Alleging that the school management is behaving as if they are above the law, parents said the school has been reopened with the sole intention of showing the video to students.

""When police are investigating the issue and the medical report has stated that the girl was sexually exploited, the school has no business to show CCTV footage to students. In fact, the entire day was dedicated only for this purpose and all the staff was busy dealing with angry parents,"" said Mohammed Asif Hussain Sohail, a parent of a Class 2 student, adding that the management continued to show the video to students on Wednesday even after parents and police intervened.

Parents also demanded that if the school is going to remain open, it should have only female staff for the girl's block. They also demanded separate entry and exit points for girls and asked the school to ensure a thorough and professional background check of all the existing staff and new recruits. The worried parents also pointed out that even two weeks after the incident, they have no clarity on the future of their children as the education department has not yet issued any communication.

The school has been shut for the last 10 days. On Wednesday, as many as 162 parents met the DEO and requested her not to close down the school. They fear changing school in the middle of the year would be difficult and pose financial and logistical issues. Zareena Shah, mother of a class 10 student, says though the sexual harassment charges cannot be dismissed, future of other students cannot be overlooked.

""In view of the serious nature of the incidents, closure of the school appears to be the most likely action. But we are looking at all possibilities.

'35L students to be affected if budget schools are shut down'

Unhappy at the government's refusal to issue extension of temporary recognition (ETR) without insisting upon different No Objection Certificates -- fire, traffic and GHMC, the Telangana Recognised Schools Management Association (TRSMA) has called for a bandh of all budget schools on Friday. The term budget schools refers to schools which charge fee less than Rs 30,000. According to the TRSMA, the National Building Code came into force in 1998, fire NOC became mandatory in 2005 and traffic NOC from 2009 onwards, therefore nearly 80 per cent of schools established before these norms were enforced are now found to be violators. S Srinivas, president of TRSMA, alleged that the government is deliberately tightening the noose around the budget schools in order to shut them.

""As part of its KG to PG education programme, it plans to open up 500 more schools next year so they want to shut our schools. We are ready to even hand over the management of our schools to government so that it can run them government schools and regularise all our teachers too,"" he said. There are 35 lakh students in 1,200 budgets schools across the State and closure of these schools will affect their future."

Parents carried their wards on their back and shoulders while wading through the river. Still, 39 students of Government Senior Secondary School at Koti village missed their exams as they could not cross the river.

As it began raining from Sunday night, the water level of the Ghaggar rose when the students left for school on Monday morning. Exams from classes VI to XI were scheduled for Monday. On Saturday, 18 students from standard IX to XII had already missed the exam due to the same reason.

Jaipal Singh, a resident of Pathrothi village, had to carry his daughter Geetanjali of Standard IX on his back to help her cross the river so that she doesn't miss her exam. ""She was crying that she will miss her exam and at the same time got scared to cross the river. I knew it was risky for her and me too... but at least she felt safe that she was with her father,"" he said.

In Class VI, eight students missed the exam while in standard VII, four couldn't take the exam. Six students of Standard VIII, nine of Standard IX, seven of Standard X and five of Standard XI failed to take the exam. After walking for three to seven kilometres from their respective villages, these students reached the river bank but couldn't wade through Ghaggar.

Surinder, a student of Class X who had his maths exam, came covered in plastic but had to return from the river bank. Surinder had walked seven kilometres from his village Late Batoli to the river bank. But finding the Ghaggar swollen, he couldn't risk crossing the river.

""Does the administration only swing into action after a casualty? We feel so helpless. At least we can get a temporary bridge until a permanent solution is chalked out. What if we are trying to cross and get washed away by the strong current?"" said Surinder. ""We have our boards this time and these examinations are highly important for us. We don't even know whether the school will take our exam again,"" he added.

Brij Kishore Gautam, a teacher of the school, said they were in the process of sending a request to the district education office to allow them to take the exams for these students again.

We don't understand these official jargons. Why can't they provide a stopgap arrangement till then,"" said the teacher.

Gautam added that his son Tanmay has been constantly asking whether he would be able to go to school on Tuesday since he missed school today. Panchkula DC Mukul Kumar said he had spoken to the Block Development Officer who said that the villagers had been insisting on a permanent solution only.

However, when the DC was told that the villagers have been asking for at least a temporary solution at present, he said, ""Tomorrow itself, I will get the provision of a temporary bridge explored."" PWD officials said tenders have already been recalled and work will begin soon.

The school has witnessed enthusiasm and interest among parents even in its secondth operational year. Early learning village is grounded on a content-rich International Early Years Curriculum (IEYC) which lays the foundation of knowledge and learning for children aged 1.5 to 4.5 years. Children embark on their journey towards learning in an environment that provides stimulating spaces and exciting experiences.

""We are still receiving many enquiries from parents for admissions. This has primarily been achieved through references and word of mouth. In a short span of time, we have been able to make a difference to the teaching environment in the city with our focus on experiential and play-based learning. With the freedom to explore, our children engage in hands-on activities, learn to think creatively and evolve to develop skills like problem solving and critical thinking. When children enter our gates with enthusiasm, it only endorses our efforts and innovative teaching-style. We hope to empower and equip each child with the excitement, curiosity and love for learning for life!"" says Mrs Priya Saxena, co-founder and Principal at Early Learning Village.

""At Early Learning Village, we focus on quality and learning for both our children and teachers. We ensure the best of learning environment and material is provided to our students. We also commit to providing sufficient teaching training and resources to all our teachers. We are happy that both our students and teachers are in harmony with each other and are able to make so much more out of their association and friendship"", says Mr. Pradeep Jolly, Co-Founder, Early Learning Village.

Teaching at Early learning village is a very holistic process where not only the child's cognitive well-being is taken care of, but the child's emotional, social, physical and spiritual growth and needs are also taken care of. A child's day at Early Learning Village has a balance of open-ended activities, exploration, child-initiated play supported by adults, focused-learning with adult guiding the learning through playful and rich experiential activities. Through role-play, messy play, water and sand activities, construction and small world children at ELV engage, explore and learn. We value outdoor learning as much as indoor learning and invest a lot of time and planning to provide children with unique, safe, rich and dynamic experiences in our natural outdoor play spaces. Our outdoor activities provide children with a range of engaging and challenging opportunities to explore freely, develop physically, take risks, solve problems and grow in confidence while playing independently and collaboratively.

ELV outdoors offer children opportunities to play in the treehouse, vegetable farm, musical garden, sensory path and sensory fountain. All these activities are on the lines of international practices as the Co - founders of the school-Ms Priya Saxena, Ms Priya Dhawan and Ms Heba Zaidi Khosla, have taught at The British School and other global schools.

At Early Learning Village, ELV teachers work in small groups, with each teacher responsible for a group size of 4 - 6 children. Small group work increases the attention and focus the child receives. A unique feature of the school is that it encourages one of the parent of the child to be present during the first few days of transition.

The teachers at ELV are qualified teachers, who go through initial hand holding and shadow sessions and then work daily to master their expertise. This is important as it helps them align their knowledge and skills with the international curricula that this school offers. They make the children adept in storytelling, rhymes, phonics, coloring, art and crafts, painting, drawing, dance, music, singing, drama, theatre. There are specific classes for gardening, pottery, no flame cooking, etc.

ELV has partnered with 'Music Together' for music sessions, Art of Sport for physical development session and 'My dance academy' for dance session for their children. Field trips and story are a regular feature at ELV. ELV is more than just a workplace, it is a community of like-minded people who have come together for a common purpose - ""children first"".

Authorities at the New English School at Landewadi, in Ambegaon taluka of Pune district, have taken an initiative to ensure that parents get multiple updates about the students' whereabouts via SMS throughout the day.

""We have installed a device in all our buses and given I-cards, which contain a chip, to students. So, when the child boards the bus, he or she has to tap their I-card on that device, which automatically sends a message to the parent's phone, informing them that the child has entered the bus. While getting off the bus, the student has to again tap the device with the I-card, and a second message goes to the parent stating that the child has left the bus. A third message is sent when the child enters the school and taps the I-card on a device here. So, by the time the student reaches school, three communications between the parent and the school have taken place,"" said Shabnam Momin, principal of New English School.

""The same way, when children leave the school, they have to tap the device in the school and do the same when they are getting on and off the school bus. In one day, six messages are sent to the parent's phone, updating them on the child's whereabouts,"" she added.

Earlier, the school authorities had installed CCTV cameras and GPS tracking system inside the school buses.

Explaining the reason behind the security measures, Momin said, ""Several incidents of sexual harassment and bullying in school buses have been reported from across India. These are the steps we took to prevent such incidents. The safety and security of our students is always our main priority"".

Vidya Kale, whose three children study in New English School, said, ""This is a great step by the school to ensure the safety of our children. It also has other advantages. Now, I don't need to wait at the bus stop for a long time. I can always track the bus with my phone and go to the bus stop only when the bus is close by.""

Satish Bhere, a student of Class X, said, ""This system also has an added advantage when it comes to attendance.

Earlier, attendance was taken manually and that was a time-consuming job. Now, it is recorded automatically when the student taps the scanning device with his I-card and the data is stored in a database"".

The issue has been hanging fire for years, but while the authorities debate and delay, little children in the city's schools continue to carry the burden of homework and heavy schoolbags. It was in 2016 that the Union Ministry of Human Resources Development directed the CBSE to issue circulars to schools telling them to advise students of classes 1 and 2 not to carry school bags and to stop giving them homework.

The CBSE did issue the circular on September 12, 2016, but seeing little change on the ground, it was pulled up by the Madras High Court on August 11 this year, and advised to enforce its diktat more seriously. A few days later, on August 20, the court ordered the CBSE to publicise in the media that strict action would be taken against schools not following the 'No Homework' rule

And complying, the CBSE's recent circular has advised its affiliated schools to reduce the weight of school bags in the interests of the children's health and not to prescribe home work, which could add to their burden both literally and figuratively speaking. ""Young children whose spine is at a crucial stage of growth are most susceptible to hazards such as back pain, muscle pain, shoulder pain, fatigue and in extreme cases the distortion of spinal chord or shoulders that may most plausibly be attributed to heavy school bags,"" read the circular.

The Karnataka government, which too has been slack in reducing the burden of little children , seems to have finally woken up as well and held a meeting on September 3 this year with private school managements to discuss the twin issues of doing away with heavy school bags at least two days a week and homework all days of the week for students of UKG and classes 1 and 2.

The meeting clearly did not go down well as earlier this week, on September 11, the private school managements condemned the 'unscientific' draft guidelines prescribed by the Department of State Educational Research and Training (DSERT) for enforcement in the state

The new guidelines propose that a schoolbag should not be heavier than 10 per cent of the student's body weight and that students from lower kindergarten (LKG) to class 2 should not be allowed to carry more than 2 or 3 kgs of books and students from classes 4 to 7 more than 4 kgs.

Mr D. Shashikumar, general secretary of the Karnataka Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools (KAMS) is categorical in his opposition to these new norms, insisting that such decisions should be backed by proper research. ""The government should work scientifically and give orders that are acceptable to all stakeholders,"" he says, revealing that private school managements in the state are okay with only one ""No Bag Day"" a week.

President of the Managements of Independent CBSE Schools Association (MICSA), M. Srinivasan too is unhappy with the guidelines issued by his board, and insists that giving students homework is necessary as it encourages them to think constructively and contributes to ""better brain development and retention capabilities.""

""Homework encourages students to revise portions taught in school after class hours,"" he says. Strongly critical of both the CBSE and the DSERT for coming up with directives without scientific backing, he says that such decisions should be taken with care. ""A comprehensive survey should be done among students, teachers and parents before making these guidelines the norm,"" he stresses.

Give our kids homework: parents oppose policy

Parents are equally opposed tot he No Homework policy, say principals and teachers. ""Parents love to compare their children's academic progress with that of children from other schools. They like to look into their work books to assess their progress and help them revise what they have learnt in school during the day,"" says a principal of an ICSE school in the city. Arguing that the workload of students till second grade is very small and puts no pressure on them, he says homework helps build their interest in information outside their textbooks.

While one parent, Mr Ravi Nair, an advertising professional whose sons study in grade one and four in a city school, is happy with the government's move on reducing heavy school bags, he believes homework should be done online in future. Welcoming the proposal to have ""No Bag Days,"" he says, ""I have always felt that schools burden children with heavy books, which they don't always need. Instead, students should be trained to go online for any pending work on reaching home to make learning fun. While smartphone applications are easy and feasible to create, even budget schools can develop a platform to make learning and revision an interactive process from home,"" he suggests.

Education expert, Preethi Vickram, however, feels that it is high time the concept of homework underwent a comprehensive transformation. ""Rather than being mere revision, homework should enhance the communication and application skills of children at home. They should be encouraged to interact with parents to know how a particular concept taught at school is used in practice. In short, homework should play a complementary role, rather than being a repetitive process,"" she says.

Responding to the criticism of school managements, principals and parents on the issue, Prof. Niranjanaradhya V.P, head of the universalisation of equitable quality education programme at the Centre for Child and the Law, National Law School of India University (NLSIU) , who was on the committee which drafted the guidelines on homework and schoolbags, says it is unfounded.

""Such policy decisions are taken by the government only on the basis of systematic studies. Doctors were consulted to prescribe the optimal weight of school bags for children of various ages,"" he reveals adding that schools should not blame parents for encouraging them to do homework and instead convince them that their children can do well in their studies even without doing it at this stage of their learning.

They were joined by parents of other schoolchildren and members of some NGOs. They blocked the road and demanded justice for the child.

A Chinese kindergarten principal has apologized after allowing a pole dancer to perform on the school's opening day. Yes, you read that right. A Chinese kindergarten thought it was a good idea to have a scantily clad woman writhing around a pole in the school courtyard on Monday.

American writer Michael Standaert, who is based in the southern city of Shenzhen, was surprised, to say the least, when he and his wife took their children to the privately run Xinshahui kindergarten in the Bao'an district of Shenzhen on Monday.

There, on a stage in the courtyard, in front of rows of children aged 3 to 6, all first-day-ready in pristine white shirts and neatly pressed black shorts, a woman did a routine that would not be out of place in a downtown strip club.

Dressed in a tight, black midriff-baring top, black leather hotpants and high black sandals, she flung herself around the pole and down on the floor, flicking her hair suggestively.

Some little boys can be seen laughing and swinging around each other, while the little girls in red majorette-style outfits in the front appear frozen still. Several mothers can be seen hurriedly shooing their children away from the scene.

""Who would think this is a good idea?"" Standaert asked above one of several videos he posted on Twitter.

""The principal hung up on my wife when she called after saying it was 'international and good exercise' ... OK, yeah for adults maybe, but not 3- to 6-year-old kids,"" he added.

There were also advertisements for a pole dancing school around the school courtyard, leading Standaert to wonder if the principal had accepted money in return for allowing the unusual display. He later said by email that he had not been able to confirm whether this was the case.

After the videos garnered lots of unwanted attention on the internet, the Bao'an educational bureau said the pole dance was ""inappropriate."" In a statement on Weibo, the Chinese answer to Twitter, the bureau asked the owner of the kindergarten to apologize to the parents and the public, and to sack the principal.

The principal of the kindergarten, Lai Rong, issued an apology, saying she thought ""inviting professional dancers to the kindergarten to perform for the parents would liven up the mood"" on the first day back. ""I did not think through the contents of the performance ... It was a very terrible viewing experience for the kids and the parents. For that, I sincerely apologize,"" according to a report on Weibo of her message to parents.

Lai told The Washington Post that she sent the apology even before the local education bureau got involved.

""I was thinking of asking the forgiveness from the parents and also promising them that we would not teach the kids this kind of dance. I just want the kids to know the existence of this kind of dance. That's all,"" she told The Post.

Many Weibo commentators said it was not an appropriate spectacle for a kindergarten. But not everyone disapproved.

""This is probably something to encourage the dads to pick up their kids,"" said Weibo user @Janson_Mou. ""If my daughter's kindergarten is like this, I will go pick her up every day.""

The idea of having pole dancers or strippers at an event not usually associated with exotic dancing is not entirely new in China.

In 2015, the Chinese Culture Ministry cracked down on the ""bizarre and increasingly popular"" habit of having half-naked women perform at funerals, which was ""corrupting the social atmosphere.""

""Having exotic performances of this nature at funerals highlights the trappings of modern life in China, whereby vanity and snobbery prevail over traditions,"" the state news agency, Xinhua, reported at the time.

The practice appeared part of a tactic to attract more mourners to funerals, make the deceased look more popular and honor their life more fully. In flashy New China, it's also become a way to flaunt newly gotten wealth.

China has had a tradition of entertaining mourners at funerals as far back as the Qing Dynasty, established in 1636. Some experts said that having exotic dancers at funerals - and at weddings - was a form of fertility worship. ""In some local cultures, dancing with erotic elements can be used to convey the deceased's wishes of being blessed with many children,"" Huang Jianxing, a professor in Fujian Normal University's sociology department, told the Global Times.

The most eye-popping example of the exotic funeral occurred in Taiwan last year, when 50 women in lingerie pole-danced on moving black cars at the funeral of politician Tung Hsiang.

The Chiayi County Council speaker ""enjoyed a buzz"" so the funeral was designed to give him ""a happy departure,"" his son said, according to reports.

It is the presence of traffic marshals in front of the school, which has kept its buses, taxis and other vehicles moving.

Parents are happy that they are allowed to park their two-wheelers near the school while they pick up or drop their kids. Many prefer to take public transport such as BEST buses or trains. However the parking of the buses on an arterial road during the school leaving hours adds to woes of commuters.

The presence of traffic marshals in front of the school has kept its buses, taxis and other vehicles moving

Due to the presence of traffic personnel around the school, four wheelers are not allowed to stop in front of its gate, which is exactly at the turn towards Dadar station. As the spot is always busy since it is a market area, there is hardly any space to walk.

There are several popular locations in and around Dadar that pull in the crowds such as the Siddhivinayak temple; the proximity of the school to the station also keeps the area near it busy. Parents and locals pointed out that on Tuesdays the traffic and crowds increase. Many people walk on Tuesday from the station to the temple. When this happens at the same time as the school leaving hours, the area gets crowded.

. Buses parked outside the school after it is over

. Regular heavy traffic around Dadar station that adds to the problems of parents

The SC verdict had also emphasised that Aadhaar would not be mandatory for the examinations conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Examination (CBSE), National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for medical entrance and the University Grants Commission (UGC).

One of the parents, said, ""The school represented themselves in front of child rights commission and also in Bombay high court as CBSE board affiliated school despite not getting any affiliation from the board which is illegal.

Pics/Sneha Kharabe

The 155-year-old St Stanislaus School, among the oldest educational institutions in the city, is located bang on Bandra's bustling Hill Road. But, despite slotting different school hours for primary and secondary sections, the traffic congestion here continues to be a giant headache for parents and local residents alike.

Autorickshaws, vans and other vehicles ferrying children crowd the entrance to the school buildings every morning and evening. A row of auto rickshaws can be seen parked on both sides of the road. As St Stanislaus School doesn't offer transportation services, parents depend on these vans and autos as a more reliable and economical mode of transport. While some are able to find space close to the gate, others have to park on the opposite side or on the adjacent road, adding to the chaos.

Children and parents crossing the road in the middle of traffic adds to the general chaos

As soon as the bell rings, students of the primary section race to the gate. The auto drivers then wait until they have found all the students who will be crammed into their vehicles, holding up traffic in the narrow lane. At the gate of the high school section, one can see a long line of students crossing over the divider to get to their autos parked on another road. Due to the absence of the traffic police at the junction, motorists and the bus drivers can be seen stopping traffic even when the traffic lights are green.

Barring the safety factor of the students who cross the road on their own, a majority of the parents who come to pick up their children have a scooter and tend to park right in front of the gate. Most of the parents don't stop for longer than a minute, but multiple scooters lined up waiting outside the gate results in a massive traffic congestion on the busy road.

An illegally operating auto crammed with schoolchildren are a common sight in front of the school gate

PrincipalSpeak

Principal Anna Correa said, ""At the beginning of the year, we had set up a traffic committee, mostly made up of willing parents and some teachers. Parent volunteers come in the morning, at the lunch break and after school to help at the gate. Along with the school, they have worked out a way to reduce congestion problems. For instance, no parking is allowed at the main gate and vehicles have to be parked either before or after the gate. The senior boys enter through gate number 3 and the younger ones use gate number 1. Our disadvantage is that our main gate is common for both St Peter's Church and the school. It is not possible for us to control people from coming in for church services. While the traffic department agreed to send two officers to help, they only send one in the morning as they are understaffed.""

Major problems

. Autos, vans, crowding the school entrance

. Parents parking their scooters or stopping their rickshaws to drop off or pick up kids, causing a traffic jam

. Long lines of students crossing the road to get to their autos parked on the other side, holding up traffic

Varsha Ashok Kaware, the headmaster's wife, had lodged a complaint with the police after the incident.

According to the First Information Report (FIR), on September 24, Kaware had punished five students for mischief at school. When the students complained to their parents, they rushed to the school to confront the headmaster. They then hurled abuses at Kaware and even beat him up.

The principal of the aforementioned school said, ""Most of the parents, though educated have refused to consent to vaccines. We cannot force them. We are organising a meet between parents and government doctors.""

Prashant Redij, secretary of the Mumbai School Principals Association, said, ""Eighty per cent schools have been successful in administering vaccines to their students. Only 15 to 20 per cent parents are doubtful. I think if parents want their children to be vaccinated by family doctors, the government should also direct these doctors to vaccinate children to make the project a success.""

Dr Santosh Revankar, Joint Executive Health Officer, BMC, said, ""Prajapati's case has nothing to do with the vaccine. It is only coincidence that she fell ill after being vaccinated. If the vaccine had to react, it would have reacted immediately; within an hour or so. Her nausea is due to the fear of vaccines.""

Government health officials have refuted allegations made by Gunjan Prajapati's parents. According to them, the girl was already infected before being vaccinated"

Just a day after the amendments were approved by the cabinet, several RTE activists threatened to stage a protest if the government tried to implement them. BN Yogananda, general secretary of the RTE Students and Parents Association, said, ""It clearly shows that the government yielded to pressure from the private school lobby.

However, private schools welcomed the move.Subject experts feel that what the government is trying to do is according to the Act, but at the same time, it should ensure implementation of Sec 12 (12) of the RTE Act, which mandates that private unaided schools should provide education for weaker sections.

Dr VP Niranjanaradya, an expert on the issue said, ""I welcome this, but private unaided schools which have taken substantial benefit in terms of land and other facilities, should provide admission for weaker sections within the neighbourhood, and the state is not obliged to reimburse them.

""It was noted that on compliance of the DoE order, the school would be in enormous deficit, even if the basis of calculations of DoE, which though contrary to the Rule position, is accepted. This huge deficit might even lead to the unceremonious closure of the school known for imparting qualitative education for over six decades,"" said the letter sent by Bluebells School International, East of Kailash.

The school had planned to hike the fees to meet the burden of implementing the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission, but on August 1, DoE rejected the proposal after carrying out an audit. However, Bluebells claimed that DoE made an erroneous calculation of the institution's finances and the facts and figures submitted with documentary evidence were not acknowledged. ""DoE had been apprised of the adverse effects of the order. However, the request has yet not yielded any result,"" the letter to parents stated.

The school, which is sited on government land, maintained that the implementation of the pay commission pay scales in 2017-18, as per DoE's directives, had resulted in ""enormous additional"" financial burden. ""Hence, charging the fee on the basis of 2016-17, as per the (August) order, would make it impossible to pay salaries to the staff members, leave aside the payment of balance of arrears... and meeting other essential expenses in 2018-19.""

Bluebells has moved Delhi high court on DoE's order, maintaining that it does not need government permission to raise school fees.

Parents say schools ask their children to bring extra books apart from routine timetable as they rush to complete portions. This adds to the load that students are carrying in their bags. The Union human resource development ministry has asked states to come up with norms of their own or follow the Maharashtra or Telangana models.

A parent from a Central school said, ""My daughter is in primary and she carries hardly four textbooks, but the size of those books is quite big. While they use worksheets, the weight of her bag is too much.""

The parent added, ""The school initially asked us not to give food from home in order to reduce the weight of school bag but her school canteen doesn't give healthy food. They have noodles and Chinese dishes that have left with upset tummy. So she carries tiffin which adds to the weight of her bag.""

According to a government order of 2017, the prescribed weight of school bags should be between 1,800 gm and 3,425 gm. Maharashtra's policy is that the weight of a bag should not exceed 10 per cent of a student's weight.

Jayant Jain of non-profit Forum for Fairness in Education said, ""The state education department has only formed a rule but it has not yet been implemented. The implementation will happen only when action is taken against schools that flout the norms. Students still carry heavy bags. The department doesn't have enough manpower to carry out inspections.""

Swati Patil, another parent and activist who has filed a public interest litigation in Bombay High Court on this issue, said, ""We have learnt that only schools in urban areas are aware of these norms.""

However, there are some parents who feel the introduction of lockers by school has helped their kids to some extent. Lockers allow children to keep books in schools.

A parent of a Class V student of a civic-run school said, ""Earlier, my children used to carry their textbooks to school from home. But now their school has brought cupboards to keep the textbook.

Do you remember when getting an education was a simpler task? Go to school, study, write exams and move on to next class. While that may be oversimplifying it a bit, one must admit that students, parents and schools have their work cut out for them these days. While the pressure on students to perform, excel and succeed has been steadily increasing, parents too are scrambling to keep track of what is happening in their child's life. And school, where it all happens, not only needs to provide a challenging environment for the child to thrive but also ensure their safety.

Chirag Palande was having dinner with his wife one night when they began talking about an efficient way to be more involved in their daughters' academic progress, and everything else that was happening at school - tests, exams, last dates for fee payment, etc. The result was SchoolHandy.

This Mumbai-based app went live this year after Chirag spent a year-and-a-half doing research.

""We had done a survey to understand what schools need, and spoke to a group of parents as well. In some schools, there was no way to communicate with parents except having them attend PTAs, something which not all parents have the time for. Though some relay info through SMSes, many schools noted that parents don't check them,"" says 37-year-old Chirag.

SchoolHandy takes a stab at solving this communication gap by offering a gamut of services for an ""efficient schooling experience"". It is an end-to-end, cloud-based, parent updating app that covers it all: a child's safety and live school bus tracking, report cards and information dashboards, forums where the school can interact with parents, and a chat platform to get queries quickly answered.

Chirag notes that the app helps avoid any gaps in communication between the school and the parents. Take, for example, the live school bus tracking feature. With child safety becoming a growing concern in the country today, this feature helps to ensure the child is safe en route to or from school. This feature can be accessed by both the parents as well as school authorities.

SchoolHandy also provides a one-to-one chat platform and real-time updates on forum discussions between the school and the parents. This way, parents are kept in the loop and receive important notices, notifications and emergency alerts that schools send, which the children may fail to relay.

What's more, you can actually pay your child's school fees through the app too, besides monitoring your children's homework and accessing results after the annual exams. Its radio-frequency identification (RFID) based attendance system eliminates time-consuming roll call systems.

SchoolHandy installs hardware devices with a tracking mechanism in schools, which help record attendance and also alert parents that the kid has entered or left the classroom.

""In essence, with this app, parents will feel more involved while schools will have the relief of relaying vital information to them. The application is very simple to use,"" says Chirag. The app has 7,000 downloads so far on the Play Store.

Chirag has over 18 years of experience in marketing and innovation. He also founded brand 'Mobaccs', which sells VR glasses and remotes. He runs both SchoolHandy and Mobaccs; SchoolHandy is promoted, funded and managed by Mobaccs.

The SchoolHandy app is currently free to use for both schools and parents. The company, however, charges the school for its hardware such as GPS and attendance system and plans to add different features to the app like online shopping, kids insurance, loan for school fees, which will give them revenue in the future.

Around 80 Mumbai schools work with SchoolHandy at the moment. It is also working with four schools in Gujarat and three in Pune. The team of four is also in talks with more schools in Gujarat, Pune, and Hyderabad.

Running after schools and getting them on board was SchoolHandy's major challenge. Chirag says that in areas where these technologies are not that known or heard, this was even more difficult. However, demonstrations helped the team to convince the schools over time. The founder says they are open to customising offerings for the schools based on their needs.

A report by KPMG and Google says that the Indian edtech market will touch $1.96 billion by 2021, with close to 9.6 million users from $247 million and over 1.6 million users in 2016.

There are a few other players in this space like Applane Solutions, School Diary, Falcon, and Educhat.in, each focussed on specific services or offering slightly varied services.

According to Chirag, what gives SchoolHandy an edge over the competition is the fact that all the services are available on one platform.

SchoolHandy aims to cater to at least 100 schools across India by the end of three years, and also plans to add a feature for updates on cultural and other activities conducted in the schools - where photos, videos, can be shared. Creating a solid revenue model is also on the cards for this entrepreneur.

Apart from this, it plans to add a feature, where the books can be delivered at the doorstep with a nominal fee."

A toxic combination of poverty, poorly-paid teachers with anti-migrant prejudice and a lack of training on nonviolent discipline in government schools means marginalised children are significantly more likely to experience corporal punishment, said a new study.

Corporal punishment is a form of violence against children and is illegal in India.

Yet 80% of marginalised children report being punished by teachers, while an average of 43% said they were regularly beaten, up to three times a week, according to a new report by Agrasar, an NGO. In some schools the number of regularly beaten students rose to 88%.

The abuse does not end along with the school day. The majority of these children also experienced beatings at home (74%), while a similar proportion of parents admitting to doling out beatings at home (71%).

These are the findings of a survey from a randomised sample of 521 children and 100 parents in Gurugram, an area which experienced a 29% increase in migrant arrivals between 2000 and 2011, largely from poorer states, such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh.

However, ""given that the same mechanisms of economic deprivation and social exclusion are at work, the findings apply to disadvantaged children elsewhere in India"", the report said.

No positive outcomes of corporal punishment have been found, while it is established that physical and mental forms of abuse can have a detrimental effect on child health and wellbeing, including mental-health problems, behavioural issues and cognitive ability, according to the report.

The fear and stress associated with corporal punishment can create ""school-phobia"", leading to increased dropouts, low-retention rates and poor academic scores, significantly impacting on education outcomes, the report said. Children who have experienced such abuse are also more likely to display criminal behaviour, commit violent crimes as adults and suffer from substance abuse.

In 1992, India became one of 128 countries to agree to the United Nations (UN) Convention of Rights of the Child 1989, which outlawed school corporal punishment and required the government under article 28(2) to ensure that ""school discipline is administered in a manner consistent with the child's human dignity"".

The Right to Education Act 2009 further enshrined child safety in schools, stating no child ""shall be subjected to physical punishment or mental harassment"".

Yet, despite such legal protections, recent government studies have found the problem persists. Social structures enforcing the normalcy of corporal punishment remain pervasive in Indian society.

Teachers do not appear to discriminate on the basis of age when it comes to meting out corporal punishment. Both younger and older children alike experienced similarly severe forms of punishment and ""almost on a daily basis"", the report found.

The only difference is that younger children are more likely to experience physical punishment, compared to older children who are more likely to suffer from verbal abuse.

""Physical punishments were given to us when we were young. Now we get mostly verbal punishments, for example we are being ridiculed for our mistakes in front of the class,"" said one girl respondent in the 8th standard.

Marginalised children were found to experience corporal punishment more frequently, with 88% of those surveyed reporting they are regularly beaten at school, up to three times a week. This is ""significantly higher than then average and does not even include verbal abuse"", the report said.

Many children reported verbal and physical abuse on a daily basis, with at least one child reporting he experienced physical punishment ""two times a day minimum"".

As a result, many have become accustomed to such experiences as part of the school routine and fabric of their education experience--71% of children believed it's okay to be beaten up ""for a reason"", having been taught its for ""their own good"" and ""necessary"".

The types of physical and mental punishment distributed by teachers vary in levels of pain, with slapping, ear-pulling, denial of bathroom use and forced periods of standing mentioned as ""not so serious"" punishment forms.

This can increase to more painful types, such as a teacher caning palms and calves, striking the knuckles with a duster or scales and beating backs and heads with their hands, all of which are the ""most common forms of physical punishment"".

Many schools keep a dedicated stick to beat children, the report found.

Cases of brutal punishment, combined with ""psychological torture"", were also narrated by the surveyed children.

Banging students' heads against a wall was turned into ""a game"" by one teacher, with several children recounting that he would often pretend three or four times that he was going to bang the child's head against the wall before actually doing it.

Mental abuse is even more frequently handed out, which for the children of migrant workers in Gurugram often consist of derogatory and racist slurs which many children do not even recognise ""constitute a form of corporal punishment"".

Referencing their low socioeconomic status, these children are labelled as ""Bihari"" or ""Bengali""--denigrating and catch-all terms for any non-locals, regardless of their actual state-of-origin.

These slurs are often followed up with insults such as ""donkey"", ""good for nothing"", ""uneducated"", ""illiterate"" and comments that they had had ""a bad upbringing"", which tend to affect older children the most.

Girl students are subjected to relatively more verbal harassment than boys, often framed in sexist language which instill ""toxic gender stereotypes"". Teachers were found to often resort to comments about their looks, age and weight, ""recommending"" marriage instead of education and minimising their capabilities and skills compared to male peers.

Both male and female teachers were found to mete out corporal punishment in a ""ritualised and uniform way"", with marginal differences in the severity and frequency of punishment they enforced.

While many teachers were found to slap or hit students, some punished students ""with brutal and cruel violence that requires creativity and premeditation"".

Almost all parents (91%) approve of teachers using corporal punishment and use it at home themselves. However, this figure is likely to be higher, as parents tend to not consider ""mild"" forms of physical abuse and verbal harassment as a form of corporal punishment.

Trapped in abusive environments

""A complex mix of social and structural factors perpetuates corporal punishment in our classrooms,"" the report found.

While wealthier, better-educated children are not immune to receiving, disadvantaged children are exposed to a number of influential risk factors which increase their likelihood of experiencing corporal punishment.

Low-income families, living in poor conditions and often with both illiterate parents working long hours in the informal sector, are unable to properly support their children's education.

Absence during the day, followed by exhaustion in the evening, means parent's ""emotional resources"" are largely consumed by their struggle for survival.

Children must manage their own homework and school activities themselves, often in a troubled environment ""characterised by maltreatment and neglect"" brought about by poverty and ""existential"" stress.

Even mothers who were ""homemakers"" in Gurugram were found to interact with their children ""very little"" over school matters. They assumed that the child would bring up any serious issues with her if there were any and relied on elder siblings plus the child's ""own motivation to pursue their studies and education"".

Failure to submit homework, poor test-performance and school absences are major reasons for receiving corporal punishment and which end up hurting children from low socioeconomic backgrounds the most.

Even if they desired, parents are often unable to move their child from the free local government school to another, lacking the financial means to entertain other options.

Migrant children often become the target of ""disdain and contempt"" by teachers who withhold empathy and support. Teachers punish children for their inability to articulate themselves as per the teacher's ""expectations"", as bad language (commonly used at home by both parents and children) and poor language skills enter the classroom.

Periods of absence as migrant children return to their native state for long stretches of time, or even accompany their parents to work, further antagonise teachers, the report said. Upon their return to school, children are unfairly punished for their parents' decision to travel.

Such teacher attitudes are a result of sustained social stigma attached to the less-educated, migrant population, with discrimination against the ""labour class"" rubbing off onto their children.

Teachers feel it is not worthwhile to teach migrant children as ""they will only be cleaning someone's house later anyways"", the report found.

They believe the children are unable to perform well in school and think rationally, as teachers see poverty as ""a genetic predisposition"" which means the children are unworthy of education. They fail to understand that a lack of opportunity and access to resources is why they are struggling with formal education.

The social divide is also keeping parents and teachers from interacting and establishing a working relationship, further impeding the child's education.

Poorly-paid, over-worked and under-resourced teachers operating in sub-par working conditions further adds to the problem, as teachers ""vent out their anger and act aggressively towards students"" and ""rarely show awareness for professional conduct"".

Poor governance, such as a lack of Corporal Punishment Monitoring Cells--set up by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights to ensure the ban on corporal punishment is enforced--means unethical teacher conduct is not always properly dealt with, the report said.

The danger is that a toxic combination of all the above-mentioned factors means children are arbitrarily subjected to forms of violence, with no repercussions for teachers already operating with minimal oversight.

Children were found to be punished for ""normal childlike behaviours"" like going to the bathroom, talking in class and during breaks, running around the school yard and fighting with other children.

The cost of corporal punishment

Around 53% of children surveyed never tell their parents if they have been punished at school, undermining a ""trusted relationship"" between parent and child. This also means many children are internalising potentially traumatic experiences, with severe consequences for their mental health and wellbeing, the report found.

Perceiving that learning and corporal punishment ""go hand in hand"", children become desensitised to the violence they see everyday and even lose the ability to identify milder types of physical and mental harassment.

As violence goes unrecognised, resistance builds which in turn can lead to the severity of the violence increasing. Children who experience violence are also more likely to ""become violent perpetrators themselves"".

There is a risk that through the prevalence of corporal punishment, schools are teaching children ""on a large scale that violence is okay"" and is contributing to levels of violence in Indian society at large, the report said."

But if education is diverted only for financial benefit, there will be less space for formation of students. Surprisingly, some educational institutions are heading only for financial profit. Profit is priority. Students are secondary. This has placed education upside down. Instead of learning lessons for life, students learn only how to pay fees of different kinds from January to December. Financial burdens are increasing day by day. I say this in regard to post selection exam trauma of Cl. X and Cl. XII students in some schools across Nagaland.

Selection exams for Cl. X and Cl. XII are over in most of the schools in Nagaland. But after exams, there appear various fee collections. I still wonder as to why some schools have to collect money under numerous reasons or agreement with parents. Some of the best examples are Caution/security deposit, Coaching fee, Re-exam fee (if failed in 1/2 subjects), etc. Such collections of money have become normal routine in some schools. Parents accept this illegal routine blindly because it cost the future of their children. Many parents must be paying such amount ranging from rupees 6000 to 10,000 or even more after selection exam. The amount is high enough for many poor parents. Students who passed selection exam pay lesser amount because they are intelligent enough. With-held students are forced to pay more as per the number of failed subjects. In other words, payment is done according to the performance of students. Is this a healthy education? Is money equivalent to intellectual calibre of students? Do students perform better when they are forced to pay money to the School? Do Students pass their examination just because they have paid the said amount to the School? I do not think it so. The Principals and heads of Institutions are free to think otherwise. But it does not suit well under the banner of quality education. Parents are worried about the future of the children, while the school is worried about collection of money for various reasons. Yet, most money collections after selection exam are illegal and unnecessary. Schools must collect only what is necessary (e.g. Board Exam fee). What is not necessary must not be collected. The aim of getting good result need not be substituted by collection of money.

One student said that he has to pay rupees 200 per failed subject to re-write the paper. Another student said that they were asked to pay rupees 50 per subject. All the more, some students were asked to pay rupees 3000 per failed subject with the promise of getting back the amount if they succeed in board exam. This is not true education at all! What if they fail, who takes the money? It is a shame that some educational institutions see failure and success in term of money. If rupees 3000 per student is collected in the name of Coaching fee, multiply the amount according to the number of students in Cl. X and Cl. XII. Rupees 3000×150 students=4,50,000/- only. May be the whole amount is paid to those teachers who take extra classes to maintain good reputation of the school. All the same, students have already paid 12 months tuition fee. I hope there is no 13 month in the yearly calendar of the school.

Caution/security deposits are collected from students (rupees 2000×150 students=300000/- only). If a student absent himself or herself from coaching class, rupees 100/200 per day is deducted from it. Is this not a funny education? I am sure no school pays back the amount with interest after holding the money (7/8 month) till the declaration of result. Deduction takes place, but interest is not paid to students. One side of the coin does not match the other side. Are we heading for 'financial education' or 'education of students'? There is much hollowness in our educational system.

Few points for further reflection:-

If students have paid 12 months tuition fee, do they still have to pay coaching fee?

If they are to pay caution deposit, does the school return the amount with interest after holding the amount for 7/8 months?

Can student pass his/her exam by paying re-exam fee (in case re-exam is held under payment as practiced is some school?)

Is money equivalent to success and failure?

Are we heading for financial education rather than formation of students?

The day to day running of educational institutions are solely under the care and guidance of the principals or heads of institution. All rules and regulations in schools are aimed to discipline and form students in the best possible means. But many schools have numerous untold laws and rules like the above mentioned realities. Let no school become institute of 'educational extortion.' There are better ways of succeeding in life. Education is just one way. There are better means of forming students rather than imposing financial burdens on the weak shoulders of parents and students. The above dirty face of education needs some cleansing for the betterment of students. All schools do not come under this dirty blanket. All the same, what happens in schools and colleges are best known by the Principals, Parents and Students. In the process of aiming for best result, let us not deform young students. Change can best begin in schools. Let us not chain the expected change in our schools.

How do I tell my family I am gay? How do I put on a condom during sex? Madhavi Jadhavi founded ThatMate, a platform that understands all your questions and aims to address social issues and mental health. All this from Satara, a small town in Maharashtra.

Let's admit it, sex as a topic is still taboo with most Indians. Growing up, how often have you turned to the internet just because your parents found it awkward to discuss sex with you openly? In many households, it is not spoken of at all, despite how important it is to educate one's child on safe sex practices.

How many of your teachers skipped the entire chapter on 'human reproduction' in school because they were embarrassed to talk about it? Or, worse, how many of you were forbidden to talk about periods with boys or loudly in public?

A good education may not necessarily translate into awareness because of the stigma and taboos that exist in Indian society. This is why awareness of social issues and mental health is important at different levels.

Here's where ThatMate steps in. Founded by Madhavi Jadhav, it's a platform that aims to reduce the myths associated with sexual and mental health through engaging tools such as comic books, cartoon characters, workshops, online forums, and counselling.

Madhavi tells me that she's always been a rebel at heart. Raised in a small village in Satara district, Maharashtra, it was not unusual to witness girls getting married once they started menstruating.

""I was working with Shell after completing my education, and during this time, I realised I wanted to work for people rather than a big money-making firm. I decided to quit my job and shift to Satara. I explored many places and realised that there was a dire need for education and awareness among children as well as adults. I reached out to some of my friends and with their help, conducted workshops and seminars for children between the ages of seven and 10 about ""good touch-bad touch"" and safety. The workshop received a wonderful response and this prompted me to start ThatMate,"" she says.

ThatMate aims to bring topics that have been long-considered normal and commonplace in most Western societies.

""One trait that I want to work on is my ability to convince parents, teachers, and other adults to allow me to engage their children on different subjects. We want to encourage dialogue to dispel misnomers, misunderstandings, and ignorant stereotypes that can, at best, cause isolation and further prejudice and, at worst, lead to abuse and even death. However, I do not want to use that fear as a tool to convince adults that our mission is important. I would like to convince them through logic and other means. Fear is not effective, so I need to be able to bring in a constructive, concise dialogue, with the ability to listen and absorb, reformat my tactics and understand how to engage my audience better,"" adds Madhavi.

ThatMate uses a friendly, open, gender-neutral, culturally sensitive approach. It has collaborated with five schools in Satara and will engage with 500 schools in the Sangli district reaching out to approximately 2,00,000 students. It has reached over 13,000 youths through Sarahah (an anonymous social media app) and has conducted 24 Facebook live sessions.

Madhavi has presented ThatMate at platforms like Tedx and LeanIn India. It has also been incubated at Deshpande Foundation, UnLtd India and Atal Incubation Centre, Banasthali, a NITI Aayog initiative.

The startup is bootstrapped with the online platform following a ""freemium"" model.

Madhavi explains, ""Certain services are open to people who have agreed to pay for them. Those that have the free tier will be given advertising to help subsist the costs. This is primarily true for the forum where ads will be offered along with certain videos and services. Our workshops will be on a service model where we will ask for funds directly from the organisation, or through other organisations in the form of sponsors or donors.

Comic book sales are offered at tiered levels depending on the quality of the comics themselves and sponsored outreach. We have special pages for select advertising to reduce the overall cost of the comics to our demographic.""

The response to various programmes has been encouraging. Madhavi shares with us a few quotes from parents and teachers.

""I was abused by my neighbour when I was in the second standard. I didn't know about it until I was a part of the Safe Unsafe touch workshop."" - Student

""I now understand the difference between gender and sex. Also, I used to get scared of transgender people before. After the workshop, I have realised that they are also a part of society and should be treated equally."" - Parent

Madhavi is happy about starting up in a small town. ""The operational costs are lower and the acceptance rate is higher,"" she points out.

ThatMate's future plans include more workshops and partnerships with leading schools in Satara, Solapur, and Kolhapur.

""We will collaborate with NGOs like Tathapi, Stree Shakti Sansthan, Goonj and Enfold. Our immediate need is to raise funds to enable us to objectively achieve our goals. Our long-term goals include establishing a base of operations, hiring a technical team for developing applications, partnering with developers in the gaming and animation sectors, looking for partners in private and government areas, completing our comic book series and offering them in a variety of local languages, and growing our knowledge base with more subject matter experts. We want to reach out and change the lives of over one million children in the next five years, with an equivalent number of adults,"" says Madhavi."

Amitesh was one among the many students of Bethany High, Koramangala, who took part in the Digital Detox Champion Award. His essay goes on to end with, ""If we leave these games, we can spend more time outside and spend more quality time studying... This is how digital detox helps us.""

The Digital Detox initiative was launched in July, where children were told that regulating their use of the internet and gadgets could help them gain rewards and recognition. The management, students and parents agreed upon a policy that the parents will share the child's electronic usage time with the school. Dr Akash Ryall, director of Bethany High, says, ""Some parents approached us and told us they were struggling with having a conversation with their kids. They requested the school to intervene. When we researched digital addiction, we found that it can be worse than substance addiction.""

Rewards were distributed across three categories: Those who gave up their gadgets completely, those who used it only on weekends and those who used gadgets for only one hour every day. ""We announced the results during the general assembly so as to motivate more students to take part in it. And for those who didn't take part, we will be holding another round. The winners will be declared at the end of the school year, in March,"" says Dr Akash, adding that across seven institutions, around 100 students were given the award.

Beginning early

Besides schools, parents too are turning to digital detox programmes. In April, city-based mother Shalini Srivastava sent her 12-year-old daughter for a detox programme meant for kids aged 10-15 years old. Since it was during the summer vacation, Shalini didn't want her daughter watching TV or surfing the internet for hours. ""I thought it would be a good way for her to indulge in different activities. Once the programme was done, my daughter took an interest in gardening,"" says Shalini.

Ishwarya Kumar Ahmed and Sudhalini Devadason, co-founders and directors of Upturn Learning Solutions LLP, which launched the initiative, soon started getting requests from parents to launch the programme for younger children too. The duo introduced a junior slot (for five-eight year olds) for the second season of the initiative, which will begin towards the end of November.

During season 1, the programme was conducted over the course of eight days. Season two, however, has been planned over a span of 12 weeks. ""We wanted the programme to be more immersive. The kids will get a chance to recreate the famous Malgudi Days and develop an interest in reading and folklore, learn Kalaripayattu, take part in DIY projects and even be part of a fun offline science experiment,"" explains Ishwarya.

Plugging out

In the first week of October, Time Out From Plugins, an initiative started by city-based mother Tejaswi Uthappa, was launched at Delhi Public School - Bangalore North. The idea was simple: To get students to pledge to time out from plug-ins. Tejaswi recalls instances where parents in her circle would tell her they don't see themselves in their children's lives anymore or have to compete with a screen for their attention. ""The idea was never to abstain. Instead, by logging out of devices for two hours, we could prevent misuse and spend that time fostering real world connections with our loved ones,"" she says. Besides a social media campaign, more schools and hangouts are being approached in order to spread the word."

The school administration has claimed otherwise and said the structure was completely safe.

Parents of dozens of students studying in the Brahmand-based Rainbow International School were wary of the weather shed constructed a few months back by the school. The wary parents were shocked to see the temporary structure when they visited the premise recently and feared it could be a huge safety hazard for students who access it regularly for extra-curricular activities.

""The shed could collapse or some of the rods may give way and lead to serious injuries to the students,"" said a concerned parent.

While few parents had initially approached the school regarding the same, they later alerted the India-Wide Parents Association seeking their assistance in dealing with the issue. The association sought images of the structure from the parents and once convinced, immediately wrote to various education departments asking them to look into this matter urgently as the school is set to reopen on Friday.

""Building a temporary shed in a school was a violation of several safety norms including the child safety guidelines among others. The temporary structure could be a safety hazard for students who access the terrace area for extra-curricular activities. We have written to the NCPCR, the education minister, the Maharashtra State Child Right's Commission and the HRD ministry to conduct an inspection and take the necessary action,"" said Anubha Sahai, president of this association.

When contacted, the school authorities claimed the work on the shed was constructed in accordance with the safety norms.

""The safety of our students is our first priority and the structure was put up as a shield against heat and rain. The structure is extremely safe and the area is used only for dance and extra-curricular activities. We are surprised the parents are worried about this. They should have come to us first,"" said Amrita Pereira, spokesperson of the school.

In our run-up to Women's Entrepreneurship Day, we focus on women from non-metro cities who have battled many odds to become entrepreneurs. 'Small Towns, Big Dreams' pays tribute to their grit, determination and hard work. We start off with myskoolbus.

Born in a conservative Marwari family in Gujarat, Pooja Khemka, Co-founder of myskoolbus, deems herself lucky to have parents who stood by her in every endeavour. Despite some opposition, she joined college and later convinced her parents to allow her to study chartered accountancy.

Entrepreneurship happened to her quite by chance. Marriage and motherhood happened and a specific incident changed her life forever. Once, she was stuck in traffic and missed her son's school bus. She couldn't track the whereabouts of the bus as she was unable to reach the transport manager on the phone. The bus was on the move and it was a harrowing few moments until she located the bus.

These tense moments sowed the seeds for myskoolbus, a school bus GPS-tracking application for parents that she started with her friend Preeti Agarwal. Pooja recounts, ""Has anyone ever thought of the plight of a mother who is eagerly waiting for the arrival of her kids from school and they don't show up on time? I have personally experienced that and the incident left me traumatised.""

Started in 2013 in Ahmedabad, myskoolbus leverages advancements in information technology and telecommunications like GPS mobile tracking, radio frequency identification (RFID), cloud computing and mobile apps to address different pain points. It gives real-time visibility to parents and institute authorities while alerting them on any deviation from the defined thresholds. In short, it ensures the safety of your children, while on the move.

Pooja explains why starting up in Ahmedabad was a good choice. ""I am a homemaker, and for me to balance both family and business was very much essential. Apart from that, controlling costs like lower rents and cheaper resources since we are bootstrapped played a big factor. In addition, relationship and trust are key drivers of awareness and purchase in the small cities. I believe if you are able to carve a niche in a small town, you can corner the market by being the only one in the area,"" she says.

Being a woman entrepreneur based out of a non-metro comes with its own set of challenges. Pooja bemoans the lack of support from local media and feels that startup stories come mostly from metros. ""Also, convincing the clients that women-led startups can deliver long-term quality services at a competitive price was difficult. Communicating and convincing transport contractors and drivers was a major challenge,"" she points out.

""Often, the men would come and tell me in Gujarati, ben aa tamaru kaam nathi (Sister, this is not your work), and I used to be upset to hear that. But with the support of my parents and husband, I overcame situations with ease to provide effective solutions to my clients.""

The sheer lack of technology-led pitching events in a city like Ahmedabad is also a major impediment when it comes to networking. However, Pooja is happy with the mentoring support myskoolbus has received from the Cherie Blair Foundation - London, Facebook's SheLeadsTech programme and the Kalorex Group.

Within a short period, the response has been encouraging. ""When we started, there were many people who challenged our venture for four months saying you cannot do it. It's not a woman's job. In fact, some school authorities also took us lightly. But now the naysayers have been converted into satisfactory clients,"" says Pooja.

Future plans for myskoolbus includes working on transit surveillance with AI support to understand different situations that can arise during the journey like fights among students, misbehaviour or others. It is also planning to venture into individual women and child safety and tracking solutions that includes wristbands, safety bags, among others."

They claimed they had complained to the school management at the time of the incident but the authorities allegedly refused to take any legal action against the accused students. Police have registered a case against two students under POCSO Act.

Police said the alleged molestation took place during an inter-school competition held at the Greater Noida-based private school where students from different institutions had come to participate. The victim, who is a Class VIII student of a different school, had allegedly got into an argument with two senior students of the host school. After a heated exchange of words, the two students allegedly took the junior student to the washroom and molested him.

The 14-year-old boy's parents approached the police and alleged that the Greater Noida school had refused to take action against the two senior students. The police have, however, registered their complaint under Section 323 of the IPC for voluntarily causing hurt and under provisions of sections 7 and 8 of the Protection of Children Against Sexual Offenses (POCSO) Act.

The school management told TOI that the accused could be seen on CCTV taking the 14-year-old boy to the washroom. They said the authorities had conducted an internal investigation in which it was revealed that the junior students had been beaten up after he made a racial slur at the two senior students.

""The victim student had used a racial comment against the accused, which triggered the fight. After the incident came to light, both the victim and the accused students were made to confront each other. The allegations of molestation are baseless,"" a spokesperson of the school said."

State chief electoral officer Anand Kumar has asked district electoral officers (DEOs) to get letters of pledge signed by the students, especially of private schools in cities and towns, so that the voting percentage increases in urban areas.

In the last polls, government school students were asked to fill in the letters of pledge, which led to an increase in voting percentage. For the present assembly polls, Kumar wrote to DEOs last month to involve private school students in the exercise organised under the Systematic Voters' Education and Electoral Participation (SVEEP) programme, an election commission initiative.

In what is called urban apathy, many city people enrolled in the voters' list do not go to booths to exercise their franchise. Students of private schools will be roped in to nudge their parents and family members to vote, poll officials said.

The parents have been asked to post selfies with their children after voting, showing fingers with indelible ink marks. Three best selfies will be selected for felicitation on the National Voters' Day on January 25, 2019.

""Last time more than 65 lakh letters of pledge were filled in the state. This time the letters of pledge will be filled in from November 12 and submitted to district electoral officers by November 21,"" Kumar said in his letter.

In the 2008 assembly elections the polling percentage was 66.49%, which increased to 75.67% in 2013 in Rajasthan.

District electoral officers will appoint district education officers as nodal officers for the work, who will coordinate with SVEEP committees and schools, the letter said.

Though district education officers do not have direct control over private educational institutions, electoral officers will coordinate with English-medium schools to get the letters of pledge filled in.

""An orientation programme can also be organised at the private schools for the students, so that they can understand the action plan and get inspired to get the letters of pledge filled,"" the letter said."

In the absence of state guidelines to regulate school admissions, the process of enrolling students promises to be stressful for city parents.

Admission process for the academic year of 2019 have commenced with schools following their own timetable. This means parents are running around to fill application forms, attend in-person interviews and take school tours. Keeping track of the multiple timetables is a challenge.

""With the growing competition, one is not sure of making it to a top school and most parents apply in multiple schools. Since there is absolutely no uniformity in admission schedules, there is a lot of time and money lost in the process along with the additional pressure [of a child making the cut] till one gets through a school,"" said Andheri-based Aditi Singh, who is looking to enrol her three-year-old daughter into school this year.

In the past, several organisations and parent groups, like the PTA United Forum, have written to the state education department to come up with a timeframe within which schools across the Mumbai metropolitan region (MMR) can conduct admissions. However, in the absence of any such guidelines from the state government, each school follows its own schedule and process.

""Each school has its own requirements depending on the board it offers and other factors which make it difficult to regulate admissions,"" said an official at the state education department who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Admission schedules for city schools vary depending on the board they offer students. Most Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) schools and those offering the Indian Certificate for Secondary Education (ICSE) conduct admissions between October and February. Those offering the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE), International Baccalaureate (IB) and International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) begin admissions in August and the process often goes on until January. Most prominent schools under the state board begin their admissions process between December and January.

Prominent city schools charge anywhere between ₹500 and ₹3,000 for an admission form. Some schools also charge to arrange school tours before parents apply. Arundhati Chavan, president of the PTA United Forum said, ""With admissions for the next year beginning this early, parents are under immense stress. Many schools conduct interviews with parents and they have to keep up with all the different schedules while they have a full-time job.""

Psychiatrist Dr Sagar Mundada said admission-related anxiety is common in mothers during this season. ""We get many patients who are often anxious about getting through a particular school. Most of this pressure comes through competition with peers and the status attached to a 'good' school,"" said Mundada."

Srinagar: Taking cognizance of reports about some schools indulging in single-point-sale of books and uniforms, Private Schools Association of Jammu and Kashmir (PSAJK) today directed all of its member schools to remain fair and transparent in their dealings and allow books and uniforms to be sold in open market.

The Association in a meeting took strict notice of some reports in media and said that such a behaviour wherein a parent is forced to purchase books, uniforms and other school items from a particular shop or from school itself, won't be tolerated. ""This violates our ethics and principles and I am sure every school adheres to rules. Although there are some black sheep against whom we will take strict action,"" said G N Var Chairman PSAJK. ""We have decided to take steps to take care of such a problem.""

The Association has instructed all of its schools to allow books and uniforms to be sold in the open market. ""Parents can purchase books, uniforms and other items from any shop and there won't be any directive from any school. Plus there won't be any exorbitant rate on the items and everything will be priced reasonably,"" said Var.

The Association also held a meeting with DC Srinagar wherein it was decided that both the sides will take every possible steps to stop the practice. ""The administration will do its job and we will also prevent any abuse of power from our side. Our primary concern is the welfare of students and parents, which will be maintained,"" said Var.

The Association has also formed a committee of educational experts who will prescribe standard books, which can be used in the schools. ""There have been reports that some schools sell low-quality books at high rates just creating doubly whammy for parents. In order to stop this practice we will be coming out with a list of high-quality books that can be prescribed to students based on their merit,"" said Var.

The Association has called for help from the general public to help in streamlining the sector. ""If anybody feels that he is being fleeced by any school or forced to buy books or uniforms from any particular shop, he can contact us and we will immediately take action in this regard,"" said Var.

The Association said that most of the schools adhere to the agreed principles and maintain their standards, however, it is often one dirty fish that spoils the whole pond. The association appealed people to remain cautious of such schools and said that any person can register their complaint on Association Phone No 7889578450.

The JJB had in December last year declared that the juvenile, who was over 16 years at the time of the alleged murder, would face trial as an adult. It had taken cognisance of the amended Juvenile Justice Act, which says any juvenile in the age group of 16-18 can be treated as an adult in case of heinous offences.

But the juvenile's father had challenged the order before a sessions court, which had upheld the JJB order. The father had then filed a petition in the high court. On October 11, the high court had ruled that the case be referred back to the JJB for re-consideration and had dubbed the process adopted by the board for its judgment ""illegal"".

Sushil Tekriwal, counsel for the Class II student's parents, said on Thursday they had countered the ground on which the HC had passed its October 11 order. ""We have filed a petition in SC challenging the HC order,"" said Tekriwal.

While passing the order, the HC had considered the juvenile suspect's submission that they had not been given a copy of the social and psychological report, on the basis of which the juvenile had been declared an adult.

Apart from terming the JJB's process illegal, the HC had also directed the board to take the help of a psychologist. The SC petition challenged this, pointing out that the JJ Act clearly mentioned that seeking the help of an experienced psychologist or other experts for such an assessment was optional and not mandatory.

""The HC must have formed an independent medical board to corroborate the views of the two courts before passing the impugned order,"" the petition highlights.

Following the HC order, the JJB in Gurugram has started a fresh assessment of the juvenile. On Thursday, he was given a personal hearing by the board, which will now make an assessment. The JJB will also constitute a board on November 3 for medical and psychological assessment of the juvenile suspect.

The Class II student, whose parents moved the SC on Thursday, was found with his throat slit and oozing blood inside the school bathroom in September last year. Within hours of the incident, Gurugram police had arrested a bus conductor. Following a persistent demand by the aggrieved family, the Haryana government had handed over the probe to the CBI. The investigation agency arrested a Class XI student of the same school for the alleged murder and gave a clean chit to the bus conductor."

Interestingly, Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education (KITE) has begun a massive audit to ensure the schools are fully utilising the facilities. According to the parents, the District Education Officer during a recent visit found the school did not comply with the rules. R Sivankutty Nair, the parent of a student, said the school authorities shifted the classroom to wreak vengeance on the class teacher of 9A. ""The move also prevented the students from getting quality education.

But teachers of Chinmaya Vidyalaya, Alappuzha don't seem to agree. It seems like 'good food' means boiled rice for them, and everything else is, well, not so great.

Students say the school, one of the prominent private higher secondary schools in the district, has made boiled rice mandatory for lunch for all students and has instructed them not to bring other food items for lunch more than twice a month - including rice-based dishes like idli and dosa.

""Sick parents"" are excused to pack something else for his/her ward for a day or two, but they must inform the concerned class teacher beforehand.

The school has also formed ""inspection teams"" consisting of two or three teachers, who visit classes during the lunch breaks almost every day, to check if students are following the order.

""They visit our class almost everyday to see what we are eating. If somebody is seen eating something else, they are asked why they have not brought rice and our parents are contacted over the phone. If the student repeats it, he/she is scolded by the teachers,"" a class VI student said.

However, school principal Dr S Lali refuted the claim. ""(Only) Non-vegetarian food items are strictly prohibited in the school. The teachers randomly visit classes to check if anybody is bringing meat to class. Biscuits, oily snacks, and aerated drinks are also not promoted in school. (Otherwise) Teachers are only asked to check if students are eating properly or not,"" she said.

She also said there are no other food restrictions in place in the school. ""Earlier, students of junior classes used to waste food and when asked they used to say they were packed things that they don't like. Some parents, looking for an easy way out, pack them items from the previous night after heating them. This monotony triggers a dislike towards food among them, she said.""

""No practice is in place that a parent should alert the class teacher for giving them something other than rice. But they bring chappati, idli, puttu or dosa all five days and rice is completely avoided,"" she went on to underline.

Not all parents agree. Stating that she usually contacts her daughter's class teacher when she has not packed rice, the mother of a class VII student said: ""No parent will purposefully give poor food to their ward and I don't think it is unfair to consider their tiffin preferences. Also, is it not a crime to be scolded before the whole class?""

'Rice is not special'

So, does the consumption of boiled rice make big a difference to the health of the child? Is it more nutritional than other popular food items?

No, says Dr Mumtaz Khalid Ismail, Kochi-based consultant clinical nutritionist.

""Rice is not mandatory. Calorie wise, there is only a negligible amount of difference between rice and wheat. Hence, there is no harm in giving them chappatis or curd rice for lunch. Packed lunch of a schoolgoer should meet one-third of his/her total daily calorie and protein requirements. They shouldn't skip breakfast or lunch but that doesn't mean rice should be force-fed. A balanced diet should be the only priority,"" she notes.

But, Dr Mumtaz agreed that it is better to avoid monotony and bring variety into the child's food habits.

Parents, though, ask how is this possible if the school authorities keep insisting on a particular food regime.

School principal Dr Lali said, ""If children prefer idli or dosa, let them have it. But it can't be permitted with just chutney or sambar; healthy side dishes like 'aviyal' or raw vegetables is a must.""

Parents' choice matters

But can a school possibly dictate what the students can eat and cannot?

""The school has no right to do so. Children of school-going age are minors and thus their guardians can decide what to cook for their children. Such a decision will be valid only if it is unanimously passed by the Parents Teachers Association,"" said advocate G Harikumar of District Court, Alappuzha.

Another parent stressed that no such meeting has happened yet at Chinmaya school. ""Usually, PTA meets happen class-wise. Can't talk for others but they haven't asked my opinion in this matter yet. Though I can understand the intention behind such a decision, I don't think all parents and kids will be okay with it. Rice is Kerala's staple food, but there are many who prefer other cereals over rice,"" the parent, whose child studies in Class X, said.

Pupils who spent their formative years abroad are allowed to bring other food for lunch, the principal confirmed.

That is another sore point. ""Are they not concerned about the nutrition needs of those students? If rules are implemented, everybody should be treated equally. Aren't such exemptions and preferences unfair?"" another parent asks."

However, their joy was shortlived as the work, which began after an assurance by MLA Aravind Limbavalli, stopped the very next day with only the worst bits of the road being patched up in a hurried manner. On Tuesday, the situation was back to normal with the road flooded and the school un-approachable, parents rued.

Located just outside the boundaries of the Kadugodi ward, the road is partly under the jurisdiction of the Seegehalli Gram Panchayat. As a result, the road, around 2 kilometres in length from the main Whitefield-Kadugodi-Hosakote Road, is untarred, muddy and narrow. A few days ago, owing to heavy flooding, the school sent out a warning and operated shuttles till a residential neighbourhood to avoid having their students wade through the waters to reach school.

This incident finally caught the attention of the MLA who then assured that work would be done. ""I thought I would do a fact check and found that only a small stretch has been metalled. But that is not going to help in anyway,"" says Tinu Cherian, a parent.

According to him, it is not possible to walk to school or get there by two-wheeler when the road is flooded. ""Added to this, is the chaos from the whitetopping work on the main road. Just 2 kilometres of whitetopping has turned the area into a nightmare. My daughter uses the school bus and yet misses the first two classes on some days because of traffic and waterlogging,"" he said.

However, according to the BBMP, work will soon be underway to provide an alternative access road to the school. ""This road is partly the responsibility of the Seegehalli Gram Panchayat.

Meanwhile, the BBMP will create an alternative for the water that accumulates on the road to flow. ""We will at least ensure that there will be no water logging on the road. It is most likely due to some encroachments which will also be cleared,"" he said."

Shweta Jain thought she knew where her three-year-old was -- where else would she be on a Tuesday morning but in school? But an hour after she watched her daughter board the bus to her school in Chembur, her husband got a call from a stranger, informing them he had seen the toddler crying on the footpath in Kurla.

""We were at home when my husband received the call. We could not believe what we had heard, as I had watched Anushi boarding the school bus that morning,"" recalled Shweta.

Their daughter, Anushi, 3, is a nursery student at Green Acre school in Chembur. She was found on the footpath in Nehru Nagar, which was a whole 7 km away from the school and wasn't even on the bus route.

""We called the school first to verify what was happening. Only after our call did the school authorities check her class and realise that she was absent. We immediately rushed to Kurla to pick up our child. We are very fortunate that our daughter is safe,"" said the mother, expressing her gratitude to the caller who found her daughter.

Angry parents gather at Govandi police station to protest over the school's negligence

The good Samaritan, Rajesh Shah, runs a general store with his brother right where Arushi was spotted. Since his son studies in the same school, he recognised the uniform.

""From my shop, I spotted the little girl crying, and rushed there immediately. She was so scared, she could not answer questions properly. I immediately brought her to our shop, where my brother and I tried to calm her down. I called the school's landline, but was shocked when the official responded that I should contact the parents instead. I then called the number on the child's ID card and spoke to her father,"" said Shah.

""Understandably, her parents did not believe me at first. They thought their daughter was in school, and Nehru Nagar is nowhere near it. But once they confirmed it with the school, they rushed to my shop. Both of them were crying and distressed,"" he said, further adding, ""I am immensely happy that I was able to help the family. I read news reports about unfortunate incidents every day, and am glad that I was able to avoid one here.""

Rajesh Shah found the toddler and reunited her with her parents

What happened

According to Shweta, Anushi had fallen asleep on the bus, and the attendant forgot about her. Once the other kids alighted at the school, the bus headed to Kurla for some work. It was parked at Nehru Nagar, where Anushi woke up. Out of habit, she exited the bus but got scared upon realising that she was in an unfamiliar place. After walking on the footpath for a while, she started crying and was found by Shah.

Shah added that while her parents turned up soon after he called, the bus driver got there around 9.15 am, but the school authorities only arrived around 10 am. The Jains and Shah both called out the school's negligence.

Shweta said, ""Anushi was crying inconsolably after we were renuited. She told me that she was afraid of getting lost again, and so she did not want to go to school anymore.

""We took her home and then rushed to the police station to lodge a complaint against the school. But the school authorities have assured us of immediate action in the matter, promising more stringent regulations for students' safety. We want this assurance in writing, along with an apology letter, within 24 hours, otherwise we will lodge an FIR against the school,"" said Anushi's father, Piyush, while waiting at Govandi police station.

Other parents angry too

Shah said, ""My child studies in the same school, and if this is their approach towards safety, it is a matter of concern."" The incident caused major anger among other parents at the high-profile school as well. Several of them arrived at the police station in solidarity with the Jains, and laid out a list of issues with the school's transport services.

""It is a mandatory bus service by the school for all children, for which they charge heavily. The least we can expect is the safety of our children. It is very irresponsible of the lady attendant to forget a child. What is the point of having a lady attendant and CCTV cameras when our kids are still not safe? They charge us anywhere between Rs 24,000 and Rs 36,000 per year,"" said one of the parents.

Another added, ""How could the school not notice that the child was absent, even though she was marked present on the bus? The school should have at least been sensitive enough to swing into action upon finding out what had happened.""

School says

Rachana Laxminarayanan, school principal, said, ""It was an unfortunate incident, and we support the parents. We rushed to the spot as soon as we got to know about it. The attendant was unwell today, so there was a human error, as she did not switch on the CCTV surveillance. We are going to terminate the services of the bus contractor. A meeting will be held with parents to understand their concerns regarding transport services, to make appropriate changes.""

There is no clarity on who should be held responsible for the incident, since the school bus policy does not apply to playgroups or nurseries. Social activist Indrani Malkhani, who was an integral part of the committee that formed the school bus policy, explained, ""The school bus policy is applicable to buses running for schools. School starts from Std I, so buses for lower classes can't be called schoolbuses."""

Addressing a gathering on the concluding day of the Rangjadong Government LP School Golden Jubilee celebrations on Friday, Marwein said there are many poor families in Ranikor constituency who cannot afford to send their children to school.

""Education is not only for getting a job but it also leads to development of the village or a society as a whole. It is very important because when children attend school, villages develop, the society is different and it can provide different opportunities especially in terms of livelihood. As parents, even though we will have to face many problems to feed our families, we should not deprive children of education,"" he added.

While urging the people to take advantage of free education provided by the government, Marwein reminded parents that many successful people came from poor families. Marwein also lauded the efforts of the managing committee for running the school for the past 50 years.

The school was first established by the Wales Missionaries which was supported by the Welsh Calvinistic Methodist."

Li, however, refused to oblige. He is of the opinion that he worked hard to make his fortunes and will not just buy another car because others wanted him to.

The fate of 1,600 students enroled in the school hangs in balance as the government is mulling shutting down the school after at least two cases of sexual abuse of children were reported.

The department has already shut down pre-primary classes and has also reportedly recommended CBSE to de-recognise the school's primary and higher classes too. Parents allege that the education department officials have done precious little, despite tall promises, to get the 290 children who were enrolled in nursery and kindergarten classes readmitted in other schools.

Earlier, officials had promised parents that they would get assistance in securing admissions for their children in other schools of their choice. Now, several parents feel the department officials are shirking responsibility. ""How will we know which schools have affiliation and which don't? Instead of giving us names of recognised schools, they have just asked us to choose,"" says Aasiya Khanam, a parent. While parents have been vocal about not wanting the school to be shut down, lack of response from the school management has left parents in two minds.

It has come to light that soon after the closure of the pre-primary section, the management had assured parents that classes would be made operational. It had also assured that classes would be run during the Dussehra vacations to make up for those lost last month when the school for shut for 10 days. However, it "" unexpectedly' declared a 10-day long vacation on Monday, leaving parents confused about its intent. Earlier on 1 October, parents under the aegis of Azzan Internation Parents Association met the management and submitted a charter of demands.

These pertain to the removal of staff in including directors and principal; upgradation of security on the premises; and formulation of a parents, teachers and management association and a grievance cell. The management has sought time till October 15 to respond to these demands, failing which the association said it will take legal action.

Days after a 5-year-old girl was allegedly molested by a teacher at a Kolkata school, parents of students protested outside the premises Tuesday, calling for action against the accused. A case was lodged the same day, after which the accused teacher was arrested.

""The teacher has been accused of sexually abusing a minor student. A probe is on,"" Deputy Commissioner of Police (South East Division) Kalyan Mukherjee told The Indian Express. The incident allegedly occurred on September 26.

Police sources said the protest turned violent when police personnel were escorting 300-500 students out of the school premises. They suspect that the protesters saw teachers attempting to leave the school amidst the students, following which they began pelting stones. The police resorted to lathicharge to disperse the crowd.

Apart from the accused teacher, the police also arrested four protesters for their involvement in the violence, sources said. ""During the scrimmage, eight to 10 police personnel sustained injuries and are under treatment at different hospitals. One woman demonstrator was also injured but left the place on her own. Four trouble-makers have been arrested,"" said an official.

The police released a statement which read, ""Today at about 9.45 am, information was received from officer-in-charge of Lake police station that trouble sprouted at a school... Police were informed that aggrieved guardians of the students started staging a demonstration over an alleged molestation incident which reportedly happened on September 26 during school hours. The parents of the victim lodged a complaint at the police station today.""

Police sources said action was taken immediately after the complaint was lodged. A case was registered at Lake police station under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC and under the POCSO Act.

When police officers arrived at the school to nab the accused, guardians of students allegedly got into an altercation with school authorities and demanded that the accused be handed over to them. In the ruckus that followed, a teacher was manhandled and some protesters were injured.

Later, a meeting was held between parents, school authorities, police and a local councillor of Kolkata Municipal Corporation to solve the issue. During the meeting, parents demanded that no male teacher should be allowed in the school.

""They demanded that all male teachers be removed from the girls' school. I will convey this to the education minister. For the time being, it has been decided that only female teachers will take classes till Class V,"" said councillor Ratan Dey.

Primary school council chairman Kartick Chandra Manna told reporters, ""It is an unfortunate incident. Everything has been conveyed to our education minister. For the time being, the accused teacher will not be allowed in the school. If he is found guilty action will be taken. A probe will be done. A few outsiders took advantage of the incident and triggered tension in the area. Police have identified them and action will be taken against each of them.""

Repeated calls to school authorities went unanswered.

""If the school and police had acted in the very beginning, such vandalism wouldn't have taken place. Female protesters were beaten up by the police for no reason,"" said one of the protesters, Mousumi Mondal.

A team from the West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights also visited the spot. ""We are keeping a close watch on the incident. Police have already arrested the accused. If he is found to be guilty, proper action will be taken,"" said Ananya Chattopadhyay, chairperson of the West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights.

At least three guardians were injured, one of them having sustained head injury in the lathicharge. Besides, two teachers and 10 cops, including Lake police station OC Suman Kumar Dey and Gariahat police station OC Sumit Dasgupta, were injured. The accused teacher, Dipak Karmakar (58), a resident of Vidyasagar Colony, was taken to the Lake police station and arrested after his version seemed questionable. He has been charged with Section 10 of POCSO Act and several other sections of the IPC. Four guardians have also been rounded up for rioting and vandalizing and are likely to be arrested. ""We have arrested the accused. We are abiding by children rights commission's regulations. The situation turned tense as the residents took law in their hands. ,"" said a senior police officer. The cops claimed they apparently acted in defence.

The school education department has called for a probe even as it instructed the institute to lodge a complaint of rioting. Police have been asked to provide security on Wednesday, when an attempt will be made to reopen the school.

According to the girl's mother, the upper-KG girl was assaulted by Karmakar, who taught English and Bengali at the school, on September 26. Since it was the day the BJP had called a bandh, only 21of the 40 students were present. ""After she returned home, I noticed she was behaving unnaturally. But she did not open up. For the past few days, she had been refusing to go to school,"" her mother said. Only recently, did she tell her parents about the torture. The child reportedly told her parents that Karmakar had taken her to a separate room where he allegedly physically assaulted her. The parents informed the school about the assault but the authorities apparently did nothing about it. The parents claimed to have a doctor's report, saying child was physically abused. ""The school runs between 6.30am and 8.30am. after which the students are provided with mid-day meal around 9am before the classes are called off,"" an officer said. ""After that, special sessions are held for students facing difficulty with lessons. Karmakar apparently used this pretext to take the child to a room on the first floor, where he sexually assaulted her,"" said an officer.

The school, however, denied the allegation, saying they were informed about the incident only on Tuesday morning when the principal came out to speak to the survivor's mother. The principal alleged the girl's parents, along with scores of other guardians, demanded that Karmakar be handed over to them immediately and that they did not respond to her repeated attempts to open a dialogue. The police said it was around 8am that they received a call from the school. ""A team from the Lake police station went to the school and brought the accused to the police station. We questioned him, found his answers to be questionable and arrested him,"" said an officer. ""However as the word of sexual abuse spread, the crowd kept swelling. The parents initially staged a demonstration pointing to lax security at the school. But around 10am, they began demanding that the accused be handed over to them. When the crowd started to turn violent, we summoned forces from the Gariahat and Rabindra Sarobar police stations.""

""Stopped from barging into the school, the protesters reportedly pelted the cops with stones and managed to break open the main gate. But with cops standing as a barricade, they could go no further in but they attacked the personnel,"" claimed an officer. Some from the crowd -- ruffians from nearby slums also apparently joined in -- vandalized cars and bikes parked on the road. They even reportedly tried to torch a bike, after which cops resorted to lathicharge. What followed was a bloodied ""battle"" of three hours, in which the mother of a child suffered severe head injuries, after being allegedly hit by a cop with a lathi. Several guardians alleged they were kicked by cops. A teacher was attacked by the protesters only to be saved by the students.

Shortly, the school authorities sat with the cops and school education department officers and took four decisions: to reopen school within 24 hours with police help, the accused cannot attend school till the probe is over, a rioting case will be filed by school and a proper probe will be launched into abuse allegation and a report will be submitted. ""We have several CCTV cameras on the premises and we want the truth to come out,"" claimed a teacher.

Ananya Chakraborti, chairperson of the West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights, who visited the school said they were extending legal and counselling help. ""She is in trauma. The commission will keep an eye on the probe and may seek CCTV images,"" she said."

The government has taken steps, but they aren't strong enough. There was a government directive in July 2015 which strictly restricted schools from allowing students carrying weight more than 10 per cent of their body weight. Even the PCMC education department recently started the 'No School Bag Day' policy on the first and third Saturday of every month in civic-run schools. But, all that cannot change the overall scenario, because both parents and schools need to be actively involved in its implementation. More awareness programmes and stringent laws can help.

Can you suggest possible solution(s) for this?

I have noticed students carry a lot of weight, just not of notebooks, but textbooks as well. One of the measures is to recycle books. These textbooks can be kept on the school premises and can be used by the students during school hours. Also, many students end up taking more books to school, even of those subjects which are not in the routine, in the fear of being called out in the class for not having it. Many a times, classes in school often get switched and the routine changes, so students are scared to be in such a spot. The recycling process, really helps as they would not have to carry any books at all. Also, if required, these students can keep another copy of the same book in their homes for home study or borrow the same books from the school during examinations. The other suggestion is spreading more awareness, which we have been working towards."

Angry over lack of teachers in a zilla parishad-run primary school at Karanjote village in Bhiwandi, parents of children attending classes there put a lock on the main gate of the school on September 25. Residents said they took the step after their demands for increasing the number of teachers ""fell on deaf ears"". The school currently has two teachers for more than 100 students, claimed a local resident.

Ramesh Jadhaw, father of a six-year-old girl, said: ""This is the only school for nearly five villages and adivasi padas. Children come from different villages, travelling several kilometres. However, there is no teacher for them. So what is the point of having a school?""

Jadhaw is one of the many residents, who have been demanding that the school be better equipped to teach over 100 students attending classes there.

""The school conducts classes till standard seven. The headmaster looks after a few standards, but mostly it is just one teacher who teaches all the subjects in all seven standards. How can one person teach so many children?"" asked Ashwini Gavle, parent of a seven-year-old.

Parents claimed that even those two teachers are absent on many occasions. ""Of the few days that the school was open, the teachers are mostly engaged in either government deputation or training. How are they expected to teach our children?"" Gavle added.

Residents of Karanjote village claimed to had written to all senior authorities. ""We wrote to the education officer at the zilla parishad multiple times since 2016. Some of us even visited the officer. But nothing changed,"" said Sukanya Jadhaw, a local resident.

""In September, the children had hardly a week of school... while the rest of the days were declared holiday. Why is the education department carrying on with this farce? This is not how a school functions,"" she added.

On September 25, when the teachers did not turn up at the school, parents took all the children out and put a lock on the front gate of the four-roomed school premises in the middle of the village, sources said. ""We won't let anyone reopen the school unless the number of teachers is increased. Under the Right to Education law, there has to be a teacher for 30 children. We want at least that rule to be followed,"" said Krushna Jadhaw, another parent.

Meanwhile, Bhiwandi Zilla Parishad Education Officer Sanjay Thorat said: ""There were supposed to be four teachers at the school. There were three earlier, one of whom had been involved in some tussle with the villagers. We have added one teacher to the current situation and the parents have agreed to start the school again from Tuesday. There is a shortage of staff."""

Three persons have been arrested for allegedly cheating parents of the students seeking admission at St Joseph and Don Bosco high schools.

While Chandrakant Bhosale (27) was arrested from Kurla railway station Tuesday, his associates, Radheshyam Bindra (32) and Shyamlal Rajbhar (34), were arrested by the Matunga police on September 27 after they were brought in for questioning. They have been accused of preparing fake payment receipts in the name of the schools.

Police said three cases came to light when the parents approached the school separately to check whether the seats in junior kindergartens have been confirmed for their children. ""When they went to the respective schools with the payment receipts, the parents came to know that they have been duped. The Father of St Joseph High School came to the police station and handed us a written complaint,"" said an officer.

During preliminary investigation, the police learnt that the group had cheated three parents of Rs 1.20 lakh, Rs 1.05 lakh and Rs 75,000, respectively.

""The parents identified the main accused as Chandrakant Bhosale, who had claimed that he is in good terms with the principals and could help them with their ward's admissions. Later, with the help of his call data records, Bhosale was arrested from Kurla station,"" the officer said.

""We came to know that the accused had given the parents receipts of much lesser amounts than to they had actually paid for admission. Bhosale had claimed that the school would not want to mention the donation amount in the receipt,"" the officer added.

Following Bhosale's arrest, the roles played by Bindra and Rajbhar came to light. ""Earlier this year, Bhosale had wanted to print fake receipts of the schools. He initially approached Bindra, who guided him to the third accused. Rajbhar has alleged that Bhosale was introduced to him as an employee of Don Bosco High School... and that the school would give him a printing contract on Bhosale's recommendation,"" the officer said.

So far, the police have come to know that the group has cheated three parents. The three have been booked under sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 465 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged), 472 (making or possessing counterfeit seal with intent to commit forgery punishable) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC.

The state education department mandates students submit government identity proof for its Students' Achievement Tracking System (SATS). Since Aadhaar card is the only option for students below 15 years of age, parents had to go through the process of obtaining a unique identification card for their children.

However, since UIDAI reveals biometrics of a person changes once they attain the age of 15 years, it's mandatory to get biometrics revised. This meant parents had to go through the process of obtaining an Aadhaar card for their wards twice.

Prejita Singh, from Electronics City and a parent of a 7-year-old, said, ""I am happy with the verdict of the Supreme Court. I was a little apprehensive when a prominent school in Electronics City asked for Aadhaar details. First, I didn't want to get Aadhaar before my child crossed 15 years of age, and second I had doubts over the security of the data.""

Mahesh Jain, from RT Nagar and a parent of a 12-yearold student, said: ""After a huge hue and cry, I had to submit, my son's Aadhaar card in school. I could not understand the point of submitting Aadhaar details. It left great scope for misuse since schools don't have safe websites or strong cyber teams to handle data theft. I am happy with the verdict.""

Most schools too are pleased with the verdict since it will reduce the workload on staff. M Srinivasan, principal, Gear International School and president, CBSE Schools Association, said, ""I am happy with the verdict. Parents were reluctant to share their children's biometric details with schools. They were not comfortable at all, but the Supreme Court's decision solves the problem.""

Echoing Srivivasan's view, Mansoor Ali Khan, member, board of directors, DPS, said, ""It was an additional task for school administrations to collect and maintain Aadhaar data. I hope the Karnataka government also does not make it mandatory, because it would then be difficult to make parents understand why it's important.""

'Will lead to corruption'

But others are unhappy with the court freeing the admission process of Aadhaar data.

""Having Aadhaar records made it possible for us to track students in the long run,"" said Shashi Kumar, general secretary, Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka. ""Through Aadhaar, we were able to secure details of hundreds of ghost students registered by schools for benefits. I hope it continues for RTE admissions."""

Alleging that the school management is behaving as if they are above the law, parents said the school has been reopened with the sole intention of showing the video to students.

""When police are investigating the issue and the medical report has stated that the girl was sexually exploited, the school has no business to show CCTV footage to students. In fact, the entire day was dedicated only for this purpose and all the staff was busy dealing with angry parents,"" said Mohammed Asif Hussain Sohail, a parent of a Class 2 student, adding that the management continued to show the video to students on Wednesday even after parents and police intervened. Meanwhile, parents, who have already formed an ad-hoc committee, said they have submitted four representations to the management over the safety of their wards but have received no response so far.

Parents also demanded that if the school is going to remain open, it should have only female staff for the girl's block. They also demanded separate entry and exit points for girls and asked the school to ensure a thorough and professional background check of all the existing staff and new recruits.

The school has been shut for the last 10 days. On Wednesday, as many as 162 parents met the DEO and requested her not to close down the school. They fear changing school in the middle of the year would be difficult and pose financial and logistical issues.

'35L students to be affected if budget schools are shut down'

Unhappy at the government's refusal to issue extension of temporary recognition (ETR) without insisting upon different No Objection Certificates -- fire, traffic and GHMC, the Telangana Recognised Schools Management Association (TRSMA) has called for a bandh of all budget schools on Friday. The term budget schools refers to schools which charge fee less than Rs 30,000. According to the TRSMA, the National Building Code came into force in 1998, fire NOC became mandatory in 2005 and traffic NOC from 2009 onwards, therefore nearly 80 per cent of schools established before these norms were enforced are now found to be violators. S Srinivas, president of TRSMA, alleged that the government is deliberately tightening the noose around the budget schools in order to shut them.

""As part of its KG to PG education programme, it plans to open up 500 more schools next year so they want to shut our schools. We are ready to even hand over the management of our schools to government so that it can run them government schools and regularise all our teachers too,"" he said. There are 35 lakh students in 1,200 budgets schools across the State and closure of these schools will affect their future."

Parents carried their wards on their back and shoulders while wading through the river. Still, 39 students of Government Senior Secondary School at Koti village missed their exams as they could not cross the river.

As it began raining from Sunday night, the water level of the Ghaggar rose when the students left for school on Monday morning. Exams from classes VI to XI were scheduled for Monday. On Saturday, 18 students from standard IX to XII had already missed the exam due to the same reason.

Jaipal Singh, a resident of Pathrothi village, had to carry his daughter Geetanjali of Standard IX on his back to help her cross the river so that she doesn't miss her exam. ""She was crying that she will miss her exam and at the same time got scared to cross the river. I knew it was risky for her and me too... but at least she felt safe that she was with her father,"" he said.

Paramjeet Singh, another resident of the same village who also carried his daughter Payal, a student of Standard VII, said, ""We are fed up. The government says send your children to school. Yet, have they even provided a proper access to the school.""

In Class VI, eight students missed the exam while in standard VII, four couldn't take the exam. Six students of Standard VIII, nine of Standard IX, seven of Standard X and five of Standard XI failed to take the exam. After walking for three to seven kilometres from their respective villages, these students reached the river bank but couldn't wade through Ghaggar.

Surinder, a student of Class X who had his maths exam, came covered in plastic but had to return from the river bank. Surinder had walked seven kilometres from his village Late Batoli to the river bank. But finding the Ghaggar swollen, he couldn't risk crossing the river.

""Does the administration only swing into action after a casualty? We feel so helpless. At least we can get a temporary bridge until a permanent solution is chalked out. What if we are trying to cross and get washed away by the strong current?"" said Surinder. ""We have our boards this time and these examinations are highly important for us. We don't even know whether the school will take our exam again,"" he added.

Brij Kishore Gautam, a teacher of the school, said they were in the process of sending a request to the district education office to allow them to take the exams for these students again. ""Every minute has been difficult for us.

Gautam added that his son Tanmay has been constantly asking whether he would be able to go to school on Tuesday since he missed school today. Panchkula DC Mukul Kumar said he had spoken to the Block Development Officer who said that the villagers had been insisting on a permanent solution only.

However, when the DC was told that the villagers have been asking for at least a temporary solution at present, he said, ""Tomorrow itself, I will get the provision of a temporary bridge explored."" PWD officials said tenders have already been recalled and work will begin soon.

The school has witnessed enthusiasm and interest among parents even in its secondth operational year. Early learning village is grounded on a content-rich International Early Years Curriculum (IEYC) which lays the foundation of knowledge and learning for children aged 1.5 to 4.5 years. Children embark on their journey towards learning in an environment that provides stimulating spaces and exciting experiences.

""We are still receiving many enquiries from parents for admissions. This has primarily been achieved through references and word of mouth. In a short span of time, we have been able to make a difference to the teaching environment in the city with our focus on experiential and play-based learning. With the freedom to explore, our children engage in hands-on activities, learn to think creatively and evolve to develop skills like problem solving and critical thinking. When children enter our gates with enthusiasm, it only endorses our efforts and innovative teaching-style. We hope to empower and equip each child with the excitement, curiosity and love for learning for life!"" says Mrs Priya Saxena, co-founder and Principal at Early Learning Village.

""At Early Learning Village, we focus on quality and learning for both our children and teachers. We ensure the best of learning environment and material is provided to our students. We also commit to providing sufficient teaching training and resources to all our teachers. We are happy that both our students and teachers are in harmony with each other and are able to make so much more out of their association and friendship"", says Mr. Pradeep Jolly, Co-Founder, Early Learning Village.

Teaching at Early learning village is a very holistic process where not only the child's cognitive well-being is taken care of, but the child's emotional, social, physical and spiritual growth and needs are also taken care of. A child's day at Early Learning Village has a balance of open-ended activities, exploration, child-initiated play supported by adults, focused-learning with adult guiding the learning through playful and rich experiential activities. Through role-play, messy play, water and sand activities, construction and small world children at ELV engage, explore and learn. We value outdoor learning as much as indoor learning and invest a lot of time and planning to provide children with unique, safe, rich and dynamic experiences in our natural outdoor play spaces. Our outdoor activities provide children with a range of engaging and challenging opportunities to explore freely, develop physically, take risks, solve problems and grow in confidence while playing independently and collaboratively.

ELV outdoors offer children opportunities to play in the treehouse, vegetable farm, musical garden, sensory path and sensory fountain. All these activities are on the lines of international practices as the Co - founders of the school-Ms Priya Saxena, Ms Priya Dhawan and Ms Heba Zaidi Khosla, have taught at The British School and other global schools.

At Early Learning Village, ELV teachers work in small groups, with each teacher responsible for a group size of 4 - 6 children. Small group work increases the attention and focus the child receives. A unique feature of the school is that it encourages one of the parent of the child to be present during the first few days of transition.

The teachers at ELV are qualified teachers, who go through initial hand holding and shadow sessions and then work daily to master their expertise. This is important as it helps them align their knowledge and skills with the international curricula that this school offers. They make the children adept in storytelling, rhymes, phonics, coloring, art and crafts, painting, drawing, dance, music, singing, drama, theatre. There are specific classes for gardening, pottery, no flame cooking, etc.

ELV has partnered with 'Music Together' for music sessions, Art of Sport for physical development session and 'My dance academy' for dance session for their children. Field trips and story are a regular feature at ELV. ELV is more than just a workplace, it is a community of like-minded people who have come together for a common purpose - ""children first"".

ELV resonates compassion, love and laugher among all its stakeholders. It is a vibrant place for learning, for one and for all."

Also written by Alex Binoy

Authorities at the New English School at Landewadi, in Ambegaon taluka of Pune district, have taken an initiative to ensure that parents get multiple updates about the students' whereabouts via SMS throughout the day.

""We have installed a device in all our buses and given I-cards, which contain a chip, to students. So, when the child boards the bus, he or she has to tap their I-card on that device, which automatically sends a message to the parent's phone, informing them that the child has entered the bus. While getting off the bus, the student has to again tap the device with the I-card, and a second message goes to the parent stating that the child has left the bus. A third message is sent when the child enters the school and taps the I-card on a device here. So, by the time the student reaches school, three communications between the parent and the school have taken place,"" said Shabnam Momin, principal of New English School.

""The same way, when children leave the school, they have to tap the device in the school and do the same when they are getting on and off the school bus. In one day, six messages are sent to the parent's phone, updating them on the child's whereabouts,"" she added.

Earlier, the school authorities had installed CCTV cameras and GPS tracking system inside the school buses.

Explaining the reason behind the security measures, Momin said, ""Several incidents of sexual harassment and bullying in school buses have been reported from across India. These are the steps we took to prevent such incidents. The safety and security of our students is always our main priority"".

Vidya Kale, whose three children study in New English School, said, ""This is a great step by the school to ensure the safety of our children. It also has other advantages. Now, I don't need to wait at the bus stop for a long time. I can always track the bus with my phone and go to the bus stop only when the bus is close by.""

Satish Bhere, a student of Class X, said, ""This system also has an added advantage when it comes to attendance.

Earlier, attendance was taken manually and that was a time-consuming job. Now, it is recorded automatically when the student taps the scanning device with his I-card and the data is stored in a database"".

The issue has been hanging fire for years, but while the authorities debate and delay, little children in the city's schools continue to carry the burden of homework and heavy schoolbags. It was in 2016 that the Union Ministry of Human Resources Development directed the CBSE to issue circulars to schools telling them to advise students of classes 1 and 2 not to carry school bags and to stop giving them homework.

The CBSE did issue the circular on September 12, 2016, but seeing little change on the ground, it was pulled up by the Madras High Court on August 11 this year, and advised to enforce its diktat more seriously. A few days later, on August 20, the court ordered the CBSE to publicise in the media that strict action would be taken against schools not following the 'No Homework' rule

And complying, the CBSE's recent circular has advised its affiliated schools to reduce the weight of school bags in the interests of the children's health and not to prescribe home work, which could add to their burden both literally and figuratively speaking. ""Young children whose spine is at a crucial stage of growth are most susceptible to hazards such as back pain, muscle pain, shoulder pain, fatigue and in extreme cases the distortion of spinal chord or shoulders that may most plausibly be attributed to heavy school bags,"" read the circular.

The Karnataka government, which too has been slack in reducing the burden of little children , seems to have finally woken up as well and held a meeting on September 3 this year with private school managements to discuss the twin issues of doing away with heavy school bags at least two days a week and homework all days of the week for students of UKG and classes 1 and 2.

The meeting clearly did not go down well as earlier this week, on September 11, the private school managements condemned the 'unscientific' draft guidelines prescribed by the Department of State Educational Research and Training (DSERT) for enforcement in the state

The new guidelines propose that a schoolbag should not be heavier than 10 per cent of the student's body weight and that students from lower kindergarten (LKG) to class 2 should not be allowed to carry more than 2 or 3 kgs of books and students from classes 4 to 7 more than 4 kgs.

Mr D. Shashikumar, general secretary of the Karnataka Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools (KAMS) is categorical in his opposition to these new norms, insisting that such decisions should be backed by proper research. ""The government should work scientifically and give orders that are acceptable to all stakeholders,"" he says, revealing that private school managements in the state are okay with only one ""No Bag Day"" a week.

President of the Managements of Independent CBSE Schools Association (MICSA), M. Srinivasan too is unhappy with the guidelines issued by his board, and insists that giving students homework is necessary as it encourages them to think constructively and contributes to ""better brain development and retention capabilities.""

""Homework encourages students to revise portions taught in school after class hours,"" he says. Strongly critical of both the CBSE and the DSERT for coming up with directives without scientific backing, he says that such decisions should be taken with care. ""A comprehensive survey should be done among students, teachers and parents before making these guidelines the norm,"" he stresses.

Give our kids homework: parents oppose policy

Parents are equally opposed tot he No Homework policy, say principals and teachers. ""Parents love to compare their children's academic progress with that of children from other schools. They like to look into their work books to assess their progress and help them revise what they have learnt in school during the day,"" says a principal of an ICSE school in the city. Arguing that the workload of students till second grade is very small and puts no pressure on them, he says homework helps build their interest in information outside their textbooks.

While one parent, Mr Ravi Nair, an advertising professional whose sons study in grade one and four in a city school, is happy with the government's move on reducing heavy school bags, he believes homework should be done online in future. Welcoming the proposal to have ""No Bag Days,"" he says, ""I have always felt that schools burden children with heavy books, which they don't always need. Instead, students should be trained to go online for any pending work on reaching home to make learning fun. While smartphone applications are easy and feasible to create, even budget schools can develop a platform to make learning and revision an interactive process from home,"" he suggests.

Education expert, Preethi Vickram, however, feels that it is high time the concept of homework underwent a comprehensive transformation. ""Rather than being mere revision, homework should enhance the communication and application skills of children at home. They should be encouraged to interact with parents to know how a particular concept taught at school is used in practice. In short, homework should play a complementary role, rather than being a repetitive process,"" she says.

Responding to the criticism of school managements, principals and parents on the issue, Prof. Niranjanaradhya V.P, head of the universalisation of equitable quality education programme at the Centre for Child and the Law, National Law School of India University (NLSIU) , who was on the committee which drafted the guidelines on homework and schoolbags, says it is unfounded.

""Such policy decisions are taken by the government only on the basis of systematic studies. Doctors were consulted to prescribe the optimal weight of school bags for children of various ages,"" he reveals adding that schools should not blame parents for encouraging them to do homework and instead convince them that their children can do well in their studies even without doing it at this stage of their learning.

Family members of a three-and-a-half-year-old girl who was allegedly molested in her school at north west Delhi's Mukherjee Nagar last week staged a protest outside the school on Tuesday demanding action against the authorities.

They were joined by parents of other schoolchildren and members of some NGOs. They blocked the road and demanded justice for the child.

The parents of the child have alleged that she was sexually assaulted in her school last Tuesday. A case was registered by the district police under relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses (POCSO) Act.

The family alleges that when the girl came home on September 4, her private parts were bleeding. They took her to a doctor who suspected sexual assault following which the family reported the matter to the police.

The police today said that the Crime Branch will take over the probe into the alleged sexual assault of the girl.

A senior officer said the case has been transferred to the Crime Branch since it is a ""sensitive one"".

A Chinese kindergarten principal has apologized after allowing a pole dancer to perform on the school's opening day. Yes, you read that right. A Chinese kindergarten thought it was a good idea to have a scantily clad woman writhing around a pole in the school courtyard on Monday.

American writer Michael Standaert, who is based in the southern city of Shenzhen, was surprised, to say the least, when he and his wife took their children to the privately run Xinshahui kindergarten in the Bao'an district of Shenzhen on Monday.

There, on a stage in the courtyard, in front of rows of children aged 3 to 6, all first-day-ready in pristine white shirts and neatly pressed black shorts, a woman did a routine that would not be out of place in a downtown strip club.

Dressed in a tight, black midriff-baring top, black leather hotpants and high black sandals, she flung herself around the pole and down on the floor, flicking her hair suggestively.

Some little boys can be seen laughing and swinging around each other, while the little girls in red majorette-style outfits in the front appear frozen still. Several mothers can be seen hurriedly shooing their children away from the scene.

""Who would think this is a good idea?"" Standaert asked above one of several videos he posted on Twitter.

""The principal hung up on my wife when she called after saying it was 'international and good exercise' ... OK, yeah for adults maybe, but not 3- to 6-year-old kids,"" he added.

There were also advertisements for a pole dancing school around the school courtyard, leading Standaert to wonder if the principal had accepted money in return for allowing the unusual display. He later said by email that he had not been able to confirm whether this was the case.

After the videos garnered lots of unwanted attention on the internet, the Bao'an educational bureau said the pole dance was ""inappropriate."" In a statement on Weibo, the Chinese answer to Twitter, the bureau asked the owner of the kindergarten to apologize to the parents and the public, and to sack the principal.

The principal of the kindergarten, Lai Rong, issued an apology, saying she thought ""inviting professional dancers to the kindergarten to perform for the parents would liven up the mood"" on the first day back. ""I did not think through the contents of the performance ... It was a very terrible viewing experience for the kids and the parents. For that, I sincerely apologize,"" according to a report on Weibo of her message to parents.

Lai told The Washington Post that she sent the apology even before the local education bureau got involved.

""I was thinking of asking the forgiveness from the parents and also promising them that we would not teach the kids this kind of dance. I just want the kids to know the existence of this kind of dance. That's all,"" she told The Post.

Many Weibo commentators said it was not an appropriate spectacle for a kindergarten. But not everyone disapproved.

""This is probably something to encourage the dads to pick up their kids,"" said Weibo user @Janson_Mou. ""If my daughter's kindergarten is like this, I will go pick her up every day.""

The idea of having pole dancers or strippers at an event not usually associated with exotic dancing is not entirely new in China.

In 2015, the Chinese Culture Ministry cracked down on the ""bizarre and increasingly popular"" habit of having half-naked women perform at funerals, which was ""corrupting the social atmosphere.""

""Having exotic performances of this nature at funerals highlights the trappings of modern life in China, whereby vanity and snobbery prevail over traditions,"" the state news agency, Xinhua, reported at the time.

The practice appeared part of a tactic to attract more mourners to funerals, make the deceased look more popular and honor their life more fully. In flashy New China, it's also become a way to flaunt newly gotten wealth.

China has had a tradition of entertaining mourners at funerals as far back as the Qing Dynasty, established in 1636. Some experts said that having exotic dancers at funerals - and at weddings - was a form of fertility worship. ""In some local cultures, dancing with erotic elements can be used to convey the deceased's wishes of being blessed with many children,"" Huang Jianxing, a professor in Fujian Normal University's sociology department, told the Global Times.

The most eye-popping example of the exotic funeral occurred in Taiwan last year, when 50 women in lingerie pole-danced on moving black cars at the funeral of politician Tung Hsiang.

The Chiayi County Council speaker ""enjoyed a buzz"" so the funeral was designed to give him ""a happy departure,"" his son said, according to reports.

However the parking of the buses on an arterial road during the school leaving hours adds to woes of commuters.

Due to the presence of traffic personnel around the school, four wheelers are not allowed to stop in front of its gate, which is exactly at the turn towards Dadar station. As the spot is always busy since it is a market area, there is hardly any space to walk.

There are several popular locations in and around Dadar that pull in the crowds such as the Siddhivinayak temple; the proximity of the school to the station also keeps the area near it busy. Parents and locals pointed out that on Tuesdays the traffic and crowds increase. Many people walk on Tuesday from the station to the temple. When this happens at the same time as the school leaving hours, the area gets crowded.

Pics/Sneha Kharabe

The 155-year-old St Stanislaus School, among the oldest educational institutions in the city, is located bang on Bandra's bustling Hill Road. But, despite slotting different school hours for primary and secondary sections, the traffic congestion here continues to be a giant headache for parents and local residents alike.

Autorickshaws, vans and other vehicles ferrying children crowd the entrance to the school buildings every morning and evening. A row of auto rickshaws can be seen parked on both sides of the road. As St Stanislaus School doesn't offer transportation services, parents depend on these vans and autos as a more reliable and economical mode of transport. While some are able to find space close to the gate, others have to park on the opposite side or on the adjacent road, adding to the chaos.

Children and parents crossing the road in the middle of traffic adds to the general chaos

As soon as the bell rings, students of the primary section race to the gate. The auto drivers then wait until they have found all the students who will be crammed into their vehicles, holding up traffic in the narrow lane. At the gate of the high school section, one can see a long line of students crossing over the divider to get to their autos parked on another road. Due to the absence of the traffic police at the junction, motorists and the bus drivers can be seen stopping traffic even when the traffic lights are green.

Barring the safety factor of the students who cross the road on their own, a majority of the parents who come to pick up their children have a scooter and tend to park right in front of the gate. Most of the parents don't stop for longer than a minute, but multiple scooters lined up waiting outside the gate results in a massive traffic congestion on the busy road.

An illegally operating auto crammed with schoolchildren are a common sight in front of the school gate

PrincipalSpeak

Principal Anna Correa said, ""At the beginning of the year, we had set up a traffic committee, mostly made up of willing parents and some teachers. Parent volunteers come in the morning, at the lunch break and after school to help at the gate. Along with the school, they have worked out a way to reduce congestion problems. For instance, no parking is allowed at the main gate and vehicles have to be parked either before or after the gate. The senior boys enter through gate number 3 and the younger ones use gate number 1. Our disadvantage is that our main gate is common for both St Peter's Church and the school. It is not possible for us to control people from coming in for church services. While the traffic department agreed to send two officers to help, they only send one in the morning as they are understaffed.""

Major problems

. Autos, vans, crowding the school entrance

. Parents parking their scooters or stopping their rickshaws to drop off or pick up kids, causing a traffic jam

. Long lines of students crossing the road to get to their autos parked on the other side, holding up traffic

. Absence of a traffic cop when students come out"

Varsha Ashok Kaware, the headmaster's wife, had lodged a complaint with the police after the incident.

According to the First Information Report (FIR), on September 24, Kaware had punished five students for mischief at school. When the students complained to their parents, they rushed to the school to confront the headmaster. They then hurled abuses at Kaware and even beat him up.

Students and teachers of the Kannagi Government Girls Higher Secondary School at Villianur near here are living in constant fear of coming under the concrete slabs and girders as two floors in the south block of the 45-year-old building are in a dilapidated condition.

It becomes even more dangerous during the monsoon and the school administration has propped up wooden poles on the verandah fearing an imminent crash of the roof.

While the students from classes VI to X are accommodated in a new block, 500 children of Plus One and Plus Two attend classes in the South Block. The school has another Thendral block, which is in a good condition. But the block is used by the Kasturba Gandhi Government College for Women.

The South Block was constructed in the 1970s and all the 14 classrooms and labs for physics, chemistry and biology used by students of classes XI and XII have developed cracks on the ceiling and the roofs are leaking owing to lack of maintenance.

Keeping the students' interest in mind, the withdrawal of recognition would take effect on April 1, 2019, the order said, adding that no new admissions should be made in the meantime.

The school had argued that it had not been given land by the Delhi Development Authority on concessional rates, so the Delhi High Court judgment that gives the DoE the power to regulate fees of such schools was not applicable to it, the order said.

The DoE, however, said the March 9, 2000 allotment letter for the land given to the school showed it had been given the property at a concessional rate.

""It was noted that on compliance of the DoE order, the school would be in enormous deficit, even if the basis of calculations of DoE, which though contrary to the Rule position, is accepted. This huge deficit might even lead to the unceremonious closure of the school known for imparting qualitative education for over six decades,"" said the letter sent by Bluebells School International, East of Kailash.

The school had planned to hike the fees to meet the burden of implementing the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission, but on August 1, DoE rejected the proposal after carrying out an audit. However, Bluebells claimed that DoE made an erroneous calculation of the institution's finances and the facts and figures submitted with documentary evidence were not acknowledged. ""DoE had been apprised of the adverse effects of the order. However, the request has yet not yielded any result,"" the letter to parents stated.

The school, which is sited on government land, maintained that the implementation of the pay commission pay scales in 2017-18, as per DoE's directives, had resulted in ""enormous additional"" financial burden. ""Hence, charging the fee on the basis of 2016-17, as per the (August) order, would make it impossible to pay salaries to the staff members, leave aside the payment of balance of arrears... and meeting other essential expenses in 2018-19.""

Bluebells has moved Delhi high court on DoE's order, maintaining that it does not need government permission to raise school fees.

Principal Sumar Kumar told TOI, ""The school stands by its assurance that the final judicial decision of the authorities or the honourable court will be adhered to. It is always open to discussions with the parents, but it will be impossible to manage at the earlier fees.""

Parents say schools ask their children to bring extra books apart from routine timetable as they rush to complete portions. This adds to the load that students are carrying in their bags. The Union human resource development ministry has asked states to come up with norms of their own or follow the Maharashtra or Telangana models.

A parent from a Central school said, ""My daughter is in primary and she carries hardly four textbooks, but the size of those books is quite big. While they use worksheets, the weight of her bag is too much.""

The parent added, ""The school initially asked us not to give food from home in order to reduce the weight of school bag but her school canteen doesn't give healthy food. They have noodles and Chinese dishes that have left with upset tummy. So she carries tiffin which adds to the weight of her bag.""

According to a government order of 2017, the prescribed weight of school bags should be between 1,800 gm and 3,425 gm. Maharashtra's policy is that the weight of a bag should not exceed 10 per cent of a student's weight.

Jayant Jain of non-profit Forum for Fairness in Education said, ""The state education department has only formed a rule but it has not yet been implemented. The implementation will happen only when action is taken against schools that flout the norms. Students still carry heavy bags. The department doesn't have enough manpower to carry out inspections.""

Swati Patil, another parent and activist who has filed a public interest litigation in Bombay High Court on this issue, said, ""We have learnt that only schools in urban areas are aware of these norms.""

However, there are some parents who feel the introduction of lockers by school has helped their kids to some extent. Lockers allow children to keep books in schools.

A parent of a Class V student of a civic-run school said, ""Earlier, my children used to carry their textbooks to school from home. But now their school has brought cupboards to keep the textbook. This has brought great relief to us as even we too have experienced discomfort carrying heavy school bags while dropping our children to school in the morning."""

Do you remember when getting an education was a simpler task? Go to school, study, write exams and move on to next class. While that may be oversimplifying it a bit, one must admit that students, parents and schools have their work cut out for them these days. While the pressure on students to perform, excel and succeed has been steadily increasing, parents too are scrambling to keep track of what is happening in their child's life. And school, where it all happens, not only needs to provide a challenging environment for the child to thrive but also ensure their safety.

Chirag Palande was having dinner with his wife one night when they began talking about an efficient way to be more involved in their daughters' academic progress, and everything else that was happening at school - tests, exams, last dates for fee payment, etc. The result was SchoolHandy.

This Mumbai-based app went live this year after Chirag spent a year-and-a-half doing research.

""We had done a survey to understand what schools need, and spoke to a group of parents as well. In some schools, there was no way to communicate with parents except having them attend PTAs, something which not all parents have the time for. Though some relay info through SMSes, many schools noted that parents don't check them,"" says 37-year-old Chirag.

SchoolHandy takes a stab at solving this communication gap by offering a gamut of services for an ""efficient schooling experience"". It is an end-to-end, cloud-based, parent updating app that covers it all: a child's safety and live school bus tracking, report cards and information dashboards, forums where the school can interact with parents, and a chat platform to get queries quickly answered.

Chirag notes that the app helps avoid any gaps in communication between the school and the parents. Take, for example, the live school bus tracking feature. With child safety becoming a growing concern in the country today, this feature helps to ensure the child is safe en route to or from school. This feature can be accessed by both the parents as well as school authorities.

SchoolHandy also provides a one-to-one chat platform and real-time updates on forum discussions between the school and the parents. This way, parents are kept in the loop and receive important notices, notifications and emergency alerts that schools send, which the children may fail to relay.

What's more, you can actually pay your child's school fees through the app too, besides monitoring your children's homework and accessing results after the annual exams. Its radio-frequency identification (RFID) based attendance system eliminates time-consuming roll call systems.

SchoolHandy installs hardware devices with a tracking mechanism in schools, which help record attendance and also alert parents that the kid has entered or left the classroom.

""In essence, with this app, parents will feel more involved while schools will have the relief of relaying vital information to them. The application is very simple to use,"" says Chirag. The app has 7,000 downloads so far on the Play Store.

Chirag has over 18 years of experience in marketing and innovation. He also founded brand 'Mobaccs', which sells VR glasses and remotes. He runs both SchoolHandy and Mobaccs; SchoolHandy is promoted, funded and managed by Mobaccs.

The SchoolHandy app is currently free to use for both schools and parents. The company, however, charges the school for its hardware such as GPS and attendance system and plans to add different features to the app like online shopping, kids insurance, loan for school fees, which will give them revenue in the future.

Around 80 Mumbai schools work with SchoolHandy at the moment. It is also working with four schools in Gujarat and three in Pune. The team of four is also in talks with more schools in Gujarat, Pune, and Hyderabad.

Running after schools and getting them on board was SchoolHandy's major challenge. Chirag says that in areas where these technologies are not that known or heard, this was even more difficult. However, demonstrations helped the team to convince the schools over time. The founder says they are open to customising offerings for the schools based on their needs.

A report by KPMG and Google says that the Indian edtech market will touch $1.96 billion by 2021, with close to 9.6 million users from $247 million and over 1.6 million users in 2016.

There are a few other players in this space like Applane Solutions, School Diary, Falcon, and Educhat.in, each focussed on specific services or offering slightly varied services.

According to Chirag, what gives SchoolHandy an edge over the competition is the fact that all the services are available on one platform.

SchoolHandy aims to cater to at least 100 schools across India by the end of three years, and also plans to add a feature for updates on cultural and other activities conducted in the schools - where photos, videos, can be shared. Creating a solid revenue model is also on the cards for this entrepreneur.

Apart from this, it plans to add a feature, where the books can be delivered at the doorstep with a nominal fee."

A toxic combination of poverty, poorly-paid teachers with anti-migrant prejudice and a lack of training on nonviolent discipline in government schools means marginalised children are significantly more likely to experience corporal punishment, said a new study.

Corporal punishment is a form of violence against children and is illegal in India.

Yet 80% of marginalised children report being punished by teachers, while an average of 43% said they were regularly beaten, up to three times a week, according to a new report by Agrasar, an NGO. In some schools the number of regularly beaten students rose to 88%.

The abuse does not end along with the school day. The majority of these children also experienced beatings at home (74%), while a similar proportion of parents admitting to doling out beatings at home (71%).

These are the findings of a survey from a randomised sample of 521 children and 100 parents in Gurugram, an area which experienced a 29% increase in migrant arrivals between 2000 and 2011, largely from poorer states, such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh.

However, ""given that the same mechanisms of economic deprivation and social exclusion are at work, the findings apply to disadvantaged children elsewhere in India"", the report said.

No positive outcomes of corporal punishment have been found, while it is established that physical and mental forms of abuse can have a detrimental effect on child health and wellbeing, including mental-health problems, behavioural issues and cognitive ability, according to the report.

The fear and stress associated with corporal punishment can create ""school-phobia"", leading to increased dropouts, low-retention rates and poor academic scores, significantly impacting on education outcomes, the report said. Children who have experienced such abuse are also more likely to display criminal behaviour, commit violent crimes as adults and suffer from substance abuse.

In 1992, India became one of 128 countries to agree to the United Nations (UN) Convention of Rights of the Child 1989, which outlawed school corporal punishment and required the government under article 28(2) to ensure that ""school discipline is administered in a manner consistent with the child's human dignity"".

The Right to Education Act 2009 further enshrined child safety in schools, stating no child ""shall be subjected to physical punishment or mental harassment"".

Yet, despite such legal protections, recent government studies have found the problem persists. Social structures enforcing the normalcy of corporal punishment remain pervasive in Indian society.

Teachers do not appear to discriminate on the basis of age when it comes to meting out corporal punishment. Both younger and older children alike experienced similarly severe forms of punishment and ""almost on a daily basis"", the report found.

The only difference is that younger children are more likely to experience physical punishment, compared to older children who are more likely to suffer from verbal abuse.

""Physical punishments were given to us when we were young. Now we get mostly verbal punishments, for example we are being ridiculed for our mistakes in front of the class,"" said one girl respondent in the 8th standard.

Marginalised children were found to experience corporal punishment more frequently, with 88% of those surveyed reporting they are regularly beaten at school, up to three times a week. This is ""significantly higher than then average and does not even include verbal abuse"", the report said.

Many children reported verbal and physical abuse on a daily basis, with at least one child reporting he experienced physical punishment ""two times a day minimum"".

As a result, many have become accustomed to such experiences as part of the school routine and fabric of their education experience--71% of children believed it's okay to be beaten up ""for a reason"", having been taught its for ""their own good"" and ""necessary"".

The types of physical and mental punishment distributed by teachers vary in levels of pain, with slapping, ear-pulling, denial of bathroom use and forced periods of standing mentioned as ""not so serious"" punishment forms.

This can increase to more painful types, such as a teacher caning palms and calves, striking the knuckles with a duster or scales and beating backs and heads with their hands, all of which are the ""most common forms of physical punishment"".

Many schools keep a dedicated stick to beat children, the report found.

Cases of brutal punishment, combined with ""psychological torture"", were also narrated by the surveyed children.

Banging students' heads against a wall was turned into ""a game"" by one teacher, with several children recounting that he would often pretend three or four times that he was going to bang the child's head against the wall before actually doing it.

Mental abuse is even more frequently handed out, which for the children of migrant workers in Gurugram often consist of derogatory and racist slurs which many children do not even recognise ""constitute a form of corporal punishment"".

Referencing their low socioeconomic status, these children are labelled as ""Bihari"" or ""Bengali""--denigrating and catch-all terms for any non-locals, regardless of their actual state-of-origin.

These slurs are often followed up with insults such as ""donkey"", ""good for nothing"", ""uneducated"", ""illiterate"" and comments that they had had ""a bad upbringing"", which tend to affect older children the most.

Girl students are subjected to relatively more verbal harassment than boys, often framed in sexist language which instill ""toxic gender stereotypes"". Teachers were found to often resort to comments about their looks, age and weight, ""recommending"" marriage instead of education and minimising their capabilities and skills compared to male peers.

Both male and female teachers were found to mete out corporal punishment in a ""ritualised and uniform way"", with marginal differences in the severity and frequency of punishment they enforced.

While many teachers were found to slap or hit students, some punished students ""with brutal and cruel violence that requires creativity and premeditation"".

Almost all parents (91%) approve of teachers using corporal punishment and use it at home themselves. However, this figure is likely to be higher, as parents tend to not consider ""mild"" forms of physical abuse and verbal harassment as a form of corporal punishment.

Trapped in abusive environments

""A complex mix of social and structural factors perpetuates corporal punishment in our classrooms,"" the report found.

While wealthier, better-educated children are not immune to receiving, disadvantaged children are exposed to a number of influential risk factors which increase their likelihood of experiencing corporal punishment.

Low-income families, living in poor conditions and often with both illiterate parents working long hours in the informal sector, are unable to properly support their children's education.

Absence during the day, followed by exhaustion in the evening, means parent's ""emotional resources"" are largely consumed by their struggle for survival.

Children must manage their own homework and school activities themselves, often in a troubled environment ""characterised by maltreatment and neglect"" brought about by poverty and ""existential"" stress.

Even mothers who were ""homemakers"" in Gurugram were found to interact with their children ""very little"" over school matters. They assumed that the child would bring up any serious issues with her if there were any and relied on elder siblings plus the child's ""own motivation to pursue their studies and education"".

Failure to submit homework, poor test-performance and school absences are major reasons for receiving corporal punishment and which end up hurting children from low socioeconomic backgrounds the most.

Even if they desired, parents are often unable to move their child from the free local government school to another, lacking the financial means to entertain other options.

Migrant children often become the target of ""disdain and contempt"" by teachers who withhold empathy and support. Teachers punish children for their inability to articulate themselves as per the teacher's ""expectations"", as bad language (commonly used at home by both parents and children) and poor language skills enter the classroom.

Periods of absence as migrant children return to their native state for long stretches of time, or even accompany their parents to work, further antagonise teachers, the report said. Upon their return to school, children are unfairly punished for their parents' decision to travel.

Such teacher attitudes are a result of sustained social stigma attached to the less-educated, migrant population, with discrimination against the ""labour class"" rubbing off onto their children.

Teachers feel it is not worthwhile to teach migrant children as ""they will only be cleaning someone's house later anyways"", the report found.

They believe the children are unable to perform well in school and think rationally, as teachers see poverty as ""a genetic predisposition"" which means the children are unworthy of education. They fail to understand that a lack of opportunity and access to resources is why they are struggling with formal education.

The social divide is also keeping parents and teachers from interacting and establishing a working relationship, further impeding the child's education.

Poorly-paid, over-worked and under-resourced teachers operating in sub-par working conditions further adds to the problem, as teachers ""vent out their anger and act aggressively towards students"" and ""rarely show awareness for professional conduct"".

Poor governance, such as a lack of Corporal Punishment Monitoring Cells--set up by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights to ensure the ban on corporal punishment is enforced--means unethical teacher conduct is not always properly dealt with, the report said.

The danger is that a toxic combination of all the above-mentioned factors means children are arbitrarily subjected to forms of violence, with no repercussions for teachers already operating with minimal oversight.

Children were found to be punished for ""normal childlike behaviours"" like going to the bathroom, talking in class and during breaks, running around the school yard and fighting with other children.

The cost of corporal punishment

Around 53% of children surveyed never tell their parents if they have been punished at school, undermining a ""trusted relationship"" between parent and child. This also means many children are internalising potentially traumatic experiences, with severe consequences for their mental health and wellbeing, the report found.

Perceiving that learning and corporal punishment ""go hand in hand"", children become desensitised to the violence they see everyday and even lose the ability to identify milder types of physical and mental harassment.

As violence goes unrecognised, resistance builds which in turn can lead to the severity of the violence increasing. Children who experience violence are also more likely to ""become violent perpetrators themselves"".

There is a risk that through the prevalence of corporal punishment, schools are teaching children ""on a large scale that violence is okay"" and is contributing to levels of violence in Indian society at large, the report said."

But if education is diverted only for financial benefit, there will be less space for formation of students. Surprisingly, some educational institutions are heading only for financial profit. Profit is priority. Students are secondary. This has placed education upside down. Instead of learning lessons for life, students learn only how to pay fees of different kinds from January to December. Financial burdens are increasing day by day. I say this in regard to post selection exam trauma of Cl. X and Cl. XII students in some schools across Nagaland.

Selection exams for Cl. X and Cl. XII are over in most of the schools in Nagaland. But after exams, there appear various fee collections. I still wonder as to why some schools have to collect money under numerous reasons or agreement with parents. Some of the best examples are Caution/security deposit, Coaching fee, Re-exam fee (if failed in 1/2 subjects), etc. Such collections of money have become normal routine in some schools. Parents accept this illegal routine blindly because it cost the future of their children. Many parents must be paying such amount ranging from rupees 6000 to 10,000 or even more after selection exam. The amount is high enough for many poor parents. Students who passed selection exam pay lesser amount because they are intelligent enough. With-held students are forced to pay more as per the number of failed subjects. In other words, payment is done according to the performance of students. Is this a healthy education? Is money equivalent to intellectual calibre of students? Do students perform better when they are forced to pay money to the School? Do Students pass their examination just because they have paid the said amount to the School? I do not think it so. The Principals and heads of Institutions are free to think otherwise. But it does not suit well under the banner of quality education. Parents are worried about the future of the children, while the school is worried about collection of money for various reasons. Yet, most money collections after selection exam are illegal and unnecessary. Schools must collect only what is necessary (e.g. Board Exam fee). What is not necessary must not be collected. The aim of getting good result need not be substituted by collection of money.

One student said that he has to pay rupees 200 per failed subject to re-write the paper. Another student said that they were asked to pay rupees 50 per subject. All the more, some students were asked to pay rupees 3000 per failed subject with the promise of getting back the amount if they succeed in board exam. This is not true education at all! What if they fail, who takes the money? It is a shame that some educational institutions see failure and success in term of money. If rupees 3000 per student is collected in the name of Coaching fee, multiply the amount according to the number of students in Cl. X and Cl. XII. Rupees 3000×150 students=4,50,000/- only. May be the whole amount is paid to those teachers who take extra classes to maintain good reputation of the school. All the same, students have already paid 12 months tuition fee. I hope there is no 13 month in the yearly calendar of the school.

Caution/security deposits are collected from students (rupees 2000×150 students=300000/- only). If a student absent himself or herself from coaching class, rupees 100/200 per day is deducted from it. Is this not a funny education? I am sure no school pays back the amount with interest after holding the money (7/8 month) till the declaration of result. Deduction takes place, but interest is not paid to students. One side of the coin does not match the other side. Are we heading for 'financial education' or 'education of students'? There is much hollowness in our educational system.

Few points for further reflection:-

If students have paid 12 months tuition fee, do they still have to pay coaching fee?

If they are to pay caution deposit, does the school return the amount with interest after holding the amount for 7/8 months?

Can student pass his/her exam by paying re-exam fee (in case re-exam is held under payment as practiced is some school?)

Is money equivalent to success and failure?

Are we heading for financial education rather than formation of students?

The day to day running of educational institutions are solely under the care and guidance of the principals or heads of institution. All rules and regulations in schools are aimed to discipline and form students in the best possible means. But many schools have numerous untold laws and rules like the above mentioned realities. Let no school become institute of 'educational extortion.' There are better ways of succeeding in life. Education is just one way. There are better means of forming students rather than imposing financial burdens on the weak shoulders of parents and students. The above dirty face of education needs some cleansing for the betterment of students. All schools do not come under this dirty blanket. All the same, what happens in schools and colleges are best known by the Principals, Parents and Students. In the process of aiming for best result, let us not deform young students. Change can best begin in schools. Let us not chain the expected change in our schools.

How do I tell my family I am gay? How do I put on a condom during sex? Madhavi Jadhavi founded ThatMate, a platform that understands all your questions and aims to address social issues and mental health. All this from Satara, a small town in Maharashtra.

Let's admit it, sex as a topic is still taboo with most Indians. Growing up, how often have you turned to the internet just because your parents found it awkward to discuss sex with you openly? In many households, it is not spoken of at all, despite how important it is to educate one's child on safe sex practices.

How many of your teachers skipped the entire chapter on 'human reproduction' in school because they were embarrassed to talk about it? Or, worse, how many of you were forbidden to talk about periods with boys or loudly in public?

A good education may not necessarily translate into awareness because of the stigma and taboos that exist in Indian society. This is why awareness of social issues and mental health is important at different levels.

Here's where ThatMate steps in. Founded by Madhavi Jadhav, it's a platform that aims to reduce the myths associated with sexual and mental health through engaging tools such as comic books, cartoon characters, workshops, online forums, and counselling.

Madhavi tells me that she's always been a rebel at heart. Raised in a small village in Satara district, Maharashtra, it was not unusual to witness girls getting married once they started menstruating.

""I was working with Shell after completing my education, and during this time, I realised I wanted to work for people rather than a big money-making firm. I decided to quit my job and shift to Satara. I explored many places and realised that there was a dire need for education and awareness among children as well as adults. I reached out to some of my friends and with their help, conducted workshops and seminars for children between the ages of seven and 10 about ""good touch-bad touch"" and safety. The workshop received a wonderful response and this prompted me to start ThatMate,"" she says.

ThatMate aims to bring topics that have been long-considered normal and commonplace in most Western societies.

""One trait that I want to work on is my ability to convince parents, teachers, and other adults to allow me to engage their children on different subjects. We want to encourage dialogue to dispel misnomers, misunderstandings, and ignorant stereotypes that can, at best, cause isolation and further prejudice and, at worst, lead to abuse and even death. However, I do not want to use that fear as a tool to convince adults that our mission is important. I would like to convince them through logic and other means. Fear is not effective, so I need to be able to bring in a constructive, concise dialogue, with the ability to listen and absorb, reformat my tactics and understand how to engage my audience better,"" adds Madhavi.

ThatMate uses a friendly, open, gender-neutral, culturally sensitive approach. It has collaborated with five schools in Satara and will engage with 500 schools in the Sangli district reaching out to approximately 2,00,000 students. It has reached over 13,000 youths through Sarahah (an anonymous social media app) and has conducted 24 Facebook live sessions.

Madhavi has presented ThatMate at platforms like Tedx and LeanIn India. It has also been incubated at Deshpande Foundation, UnLtd India and Atal Incubation Centre, Banasthali, a NITI Aayog initiative.

The startup is bootstrapped with the online platform following a ""freemium"" model.

Madhavi explains, ""Certain services are open to people who have agreed to pay for them. Those that have the free tier will be given advertising to help subsist the costs. This is primarily true for the forum where ads will be offered along with certain videos and services. Our workshops will be on a service model where we will ask for funds directly from the organisation, or through other organisations in the form of sponsors or donors.

Comic book sales are offered at tiered levels depending on the quality of the comics themselves and sponsored outreach. We have special pages for select advertising to reduce the overall cost of the comics to our demographic.""

The response to various programmes has been encouraging. Madhavi shares with us a few quotes from parents and teachers.

""I was abused by my neighbour when I was in the second standard. I didn't know about it until I was a part of the Safe Unsafe touch workshop."" - Student

""I now understand the difference between gender and sex. Also, I used to get scared of transgender people before. After the workshop, I have realised that they are also a part of society and should be treated equally."" - Parent

Madhavi is happy about starting up in a small town. ""The operational costs are lower and the acceptance rate is higher,"" she points out.

ThatMate's future plans include more workshops and partnerships with leading schools in Satara, Solapur, and Kolhapur.

""We will collaborate with NGOs like Tathapi, Stree Shakti Sansthan, Goonj and Enfold. Our immediate need is to raise funds to enable us to objectively achieve our goals. Our long-term goals include establishing a base of operations, hiring a technical team for developing applications, partnering with developers in the gaming and animation sectors, looking for partners in private and government areas, completing our comic book series and offering them in a variety of local languages, and growing our knowledge base with more subject matter experts.

Amitesh was one among the many students of Bethany High, Koramangala, who took part in the Digital Detox Champion Award. His essay goes on to end with, ""If we leave these games, we can spend more time outside and spend more quality time studying... This is how digital detox helps us.""

The Digital Detox initiative was launched in July, where children were told that regulating their use of the internet and gadgets could help them gain rewards and recognition. The management, students and parents agreed upon a policy that the parents will share the child's electronic usage time with the school. Dr Akash Ryall, director of Bethany High, says, ""Some parents approached us and told us they were struggling with having a conversation with their kids. They requested the school to intervene. When we researched digital addiction, we found that it can be worse than substance addiction.""

Rewards were distributed across three categories: Those who gave up their gadgets completely, those who used it only on weekends and those who used gadgets for only one hour every day. ""We announced the results during the general assembly so as to motivate more students to take part in it. And for those who didn't take part, we will be holding another round. The winners will be declared at the end of the school year, in March,"" says Dr Akash, adding that across seven institutions, around 100 students were given the award.

Beginning early

Besides schools, parents too are turning to digital detox programmes. In April, city-based mother Shalini Srivastava sent her 12-year-old daughter for a detox programme meant for kids aged 10-15 years old. Since it was during the summer vacation, Shalini didn't want her daughter watching TV or surfing the internet for hours. ""I thought it would be a good way for her to indulge in different activities. Once the programme was done, my daughter took an interest in gardening,"" says Shalini.

Ishwarya Kumar Ahmed and Sudhalini Devadason, co-founders and directors of Upturn Learning Solutions LLP, which launched the initiative, soon started getting requests from parents to launch the programme for younger children too. The duo introduced a junior slot (for five-eight year olds) for the second season of the initiative, which will begin towards the end of November.

During season 1, the programme was conducted over the course of eight days. Season two, however, has been planned over a span of 12 weeks. ""We wanted the programme to be more immersive. The kids will get a chance to recreate the famous Malgudi Days and develop an interest in reading and folklore, learn Kalaripayattu, take part in DIY projects and even be part of a fun offline science experiment,"" explains Ishwarya.

Plugging out

In the first week of October, Time Out From Plugins, an initiative started by city-based mother Tejaswi Uthappa, was launched at Delhi Public School - Bangalore North. The idea was simple: To get students to pledge to time out from plug-ins. Tejaswi recalls instances where parents in her circle would tell her they don't see themselves in their children's lives anymore or have to compete with a screen for their attention. ""The idea was never to abstain. Instead, by logging out of devices for two hours, we could prevent misuse and spend that time fostering real world connections with our loved ones,"" she says. Besides a social media campaign, more schools and hangouts are being approached in order to spread the word."

The school administration has claimed otherwise and said the structure was completely safe.

Parents of dozens of students studying in the Brahmand-based Rainbow International School were wary of the weather shed constructed a few months back by the school. The wary parents were shocked to see the temporary structure when they visited the premise recently and feared it could be a huge safety hazard for students who access it regularly for extra-curricular activities.

""The shed could collapse or some of the rods may give way and lead to serious injuries to the students,"" said a concerned parent.

While few parents had initially approached the school regarding the same, they later alerted the India-Wide Parents Association seeking their assistance in dealing with the issue. The association sought images of the structure from the parents and once convinced, immediately wrote to various education departments asking them to look into this matter urgently as the school is set to reopen on Friday.

""Building a temporary shed in a school was a violation of several safety norms including the child safety guidelines among others. The temporary structure could be a safety hazard for students who access the terrace area for extra-curricular activities. We have written to the NCPCR, the education minister, the Maharashtra State Child Right's Commission and the HRD ministry to conduct an inspection and take the necessary action,"" said Anubha Sahai, president of this association.

When contacted, the school authorities claimed the work on the shed was constructed in accordance with the safety norms.

""The safety of our students is our first priority and the structure was put up as a shield against heat and rain.

In our run-up to Women's Entrepreneurship Day, we focus on women from non-metro cities who have battled many odds to become entrepreneurs. 'Small Towns, Big Dreams' pays tribute to their grit, determination and hard work. We start off with myskoolbus.

Born in a conservative Marwari family in Gujarat, Pooja Khemka, Co-founder of myskoolbus, deems herself lucky to have parents who stood by her in every endeavour. Despite some opposition, she joined college and later convinced her parents to allow her to study chartered accountancy.

Entrepreneurship happened to her quite by chance. Marriage and motherhood happened and a specific incident changed her life forever. Once, she was stuck in traffic and missed her son's school bus. She couldn't track the whereabouts of the bus as she was unable to reach the transport manager on the phone. The bus was on the move and it was a harrowing few moments until she located the bus.

These tense moments sowed the seeds for myskoolbus, a school bus GPS-tracking application for parents that she started with her friend Preeti Agarwal. Pooja recounts, ""Has anyone ever thought of the plight of a mother who is eagerly waiting for the arrival of her kids from school and they don't show up on time? I have personally experienced that and the incident left me traumatised.""

Started in 2013 in Ahmedabad, myskoolbus leverages advancements in information technology and telecommunications like GPS mobile tracking, radio frequency identification (RFID), cloud computing and mobile apps to address different pain points. It gives real-time visibility to parents and institute authorities while alerting them on any deviation from the defined thresholds. In short, it ensures the safety of your children, while on the move.

Pooja explains why starting up in Ahmedabad was a good choice. ""I am a homemaker, and for me to balance both family and business was very much essential. Apart from that, controlling costs like lower rents and cheaper resources since we are bootstrapped played a big factor. In addition, relationship and trust are key drivers of awareness and purchase in the small cities. I believe if you are able to carve a niche in a small town, you can corner the market by being the only one in the area,"" she says.

Being a woman entrepreneur based out of a non-metro comes with its own set of challenges. Pooja bemoans the lack of support from local media and feels that startup stories come mostly from metros. ""Also, convincing the clients that women-led startups can deliver long-term quality services at a competitive price was difficult. Communicating and convincing transport contractors and drivers was a major challenge,"" she points out.

""Often, the men would come and tell me in Gujarati, ben aa tamaru kaam nathi (Sister, this is not your work), and I used to be upset to hear that. But with the support of my parents and husband, I overcame situations with ease to provide effective solutions to my clients.""

The sheer lack of technology-led pitching events in a city like Ahmedabad is also a major impediment when it comes to networking. However, Pooja is happy with the mentoring support myskoolbus has received from the Cherie Blair Foundation - London, Facebook's SheLeadsTech programme and the Kalorex Group.

Within a short period, the response has been encouraging. ""When we started, there were many people who challenged our venture for four months saying you cannot do it. It's not a woman's job. In fact, some school authorities also took us lightly. But now the naysayers have been converted into satisfactory clients,"" says Pooja.

Future plans for myskoolbus includes working on transit surveillance with AI support to understand different situations that can arise during the journey like fights among students, misbehaviour or others. It is also planning to venture into individual women and child safety and tracking solutions that includes wristbands, safety bags, among others."

They claimed they had complained to the school management at the time of the incident but the authorities allegedly refused to take any legal action against the accused students. Police have registered a case against two students under POCSO Act.

Police said the alleged molestation took place during an inter-school competition held at the Greater Noida-based private school where students from different institutions had come to participate. The victim, who is a Class VIII student of a different school, had allegedly got into an argument with two senior students of the host school. After a heated exchange of words, the two students allegedly took the junior student to the washroom and molested him.

The 14-year-old boy's parents approached the police and alleged that the Greater Noida school had refused to take action against the two senior students. The police have, however, registered their complaint under Section 323 of the IPC for voluntarily causing hurt and under provisions of sections 7 and 8 of the Protection of Children Against Sexual Offenses (POCSO) Act.

The school management told TOI that the accused could be seen on CCTV taking the 14-year-old boy to the washroom. They said the authorities had conducted an internal investigation in which it was revealed that the junior students had been beaten up after he made a racial slur at the two senior students.

""The victim student had used a racial comment against the accused, which triggered the fight. After the incident came to light, both the victim and the accused students were made to confront each other. The allegations of molestation are baseless,"" a spokesperson of the school said."

In the last polls, government school students were asked to fill in the letters of pledge, which led to an increase in voting percentage. For the present assembly polls, Kumar wrote to DEOs last month to involve private school students in the exercise organised under the Systematic Voters' Education and Electoral Participation (SVEEP) programme, an election commission initiative.

In what is called urban apathy, many city people enrolled in the voters' list do not go to booths to exercise their franchise. Students of private schools will be roped in to nudge their parents and family members to vote, poll officials said.

The parents have been asked to post selfies with their children after voting, showing fingers with indelible ink marks. Three best selfies will be selected for felicitation on the National Voters' Day on January 25, 2019.

""Last time more than 65 lakh letters of pledge were filled in the state. This time the letters of pledge will be filled in from November 12 and submitted to district electoral officers by November 21,"" Kumar said in his letter.

In the 2008 assembly elections the polling percentage was 66.49%, which increased to 75.67% in 2013 in Rajasthan.

District electoral officers will appoint district education officers as nodal officers for the work, who will coordinate with SVEEP committees and schools, the letter said.

Though district education officers do not have direct control over private educational institutions, electoral officers will coordinate with English-medium schools to get the letters of pledge filled in.

""An orientation programme can also be organised at the private schools for the students, so that they can understand the action plan and get inspired to get the letters of pledge filled,"" the letter said."

In the absence of state guidelines to regulate school admissions, the process of enrolling students promises to be stressful for city parents.

Admission process for the academic year of 2019 have commenced with schools following their own timetable. This means parents are running around to fill application forms, attend in-person interviews and take school tours. Keeping track of the multiple timetables is a challenge.

""With the growing competition, one is not sure of making it to a top school and most parents apply in multiple schools. Since there is absolutely no uniformity in admission schedules, there is a lot of time and money lost in the process along with the additional pressure [of a child making the cut] till one gets through a school,"" said Andheri-based Aditi Singh, who is looking to enrol her three-year-old daughter into school this year.

In the past, several organisations and parent groups, like the PTA United Forum, have written to the state education department to come up with a timeframe within which schools across the Mumbai metropolitan region (MMR) can conduct admissions. However, in the absence of any such guidelines from the state government, each school follows its own schedule and process.

""Each school has its own requirements depending on the board it offers and other factors which make it difficult to regulate admissions,"" said an official at the state education department who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Admission schedules for city schools vary depending on the board they offer students. Most Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) schools and those offering the Indian Certificate for Secondary Education (ICSE) conduct admissions between October and February. Those offering the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE), International Baccalaureate (IB) and International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) begin admissions in August and the process often goes on until January. Most prominent schools under the state board begin their admissions process between December and January.

Prominent city schools charge anywhere between ₹500 and ₹3,000 for an admission form. Some schools also charge to arrange school tours before parents apply. Arundhati Chavan, president of the PTA United Forum said, ""With admissions for the next year beginning this early, parents are under immense stress. Many schools conduct interviews with parents and they have to keep up with all the different schedules while they have a full-time job.""

Psychiatrist Dr Sagar Mundada said admission-related anxiety is common in mothers during this season. ""We get many patients who are often anxious about getting through a particular school. Most of this pressure comes through competition with peers and the status attached to a 'good' school,"" said Mundada."

Srinagar: Taking cognizance of reports about some schools indulging in single-point-sale of books and uniforms, Private Schools Association of Jammu and Kashmir (PSAJK) today directed all of its member schools to remain fair and transparent in their dealings and allow books and uniforms to be sold in open market.

The Association in a meeting took strict notice of some reports in media and said that such a behaviour wherein a parent is forced to purchase books, uniforms and other school items from a particular shop or from school itself, won't be tolerated. ""This violates our ethics and principles and I am sure every school adheres to rules. Although there are some black sheep against whom we will take strict action,"" said G N Var Chairman PSAJK. ""We have decided to take steps to take care of such a problem.""

The Association has instructed all of its schools to allow books and uniforms to be sold in the open market. ""Parents can purchase books, uniforms and other items from any shop and there won't be any directive from any school. Plus there won't be any exorbitant rate on the items and everything will be priced reasonably,"" said Var.

The Association also held a meeting with DC Srinagar wherein it was decided that both the sides will take every possible steps to stop the practice. ""The administration will do its job and we will also prevent any abuse of power from our side. Our primary concern is the welfare of students and parents, which will be maintained,"" said Var.

The Association has also formed a committee of educational experts who will prescribe standard books, which can be used in the schools. ""There have been reports that some schools sell low-quality books at high rates just creating doubly whammy for parents. In order to stop this practice we will be coming out with a list of high-quality books that can be prescribed to students based on their merit,"" said Var.

The Association has called for help from the general public to help in streamlining the sector. ""If anybody feels that he is being fleeced by any school or forced to buy books or uniforms from any particular shop, he can contact us and we will immediately take action in this regard,"" said Var.

The Association said that most of the schools adhere to the agreed principles and maintain their standards, however, it is often one dirty fish that spoils the whole pond. The association appealed people to remain cautious of such schools and said that any person can register their complaint on Association Phone No 7889578450.

The JJB had in December last year declared that the juvenile, who was over 16 years at the time of the alleged murder, would face trial as an adult. It had taken cognisance of the amended Juvenile Justice Act, which says any juvenile in the age group of 16-18 can be treated as an adult in case of heinous offences.

But the juvenile's father had challenged the order before a sessions court, which had upheld the JJB order. The father had then filed a petition in the high court. On October 11, the high court had ruled that the case be referred back to the JJB for re-consideration and had dubbed the process adopted by the board for its judgment ""illegal"".

Sushil Tekriwal, counsel for the Class II student's parents, said on Thursday they had countered the ground on which the HC had passed its October 11 order. ""We have filed a petition in SC challenging the HC order,"" said Tekriwal.

While passing the order, the HC had considered the juvenile suspect's submission that they had not been given a copy of the social and psychological report, on the basis of which the juvenile had been declared an adult.

Apart from terming the JJB's process illegal, the HC had also directed the board to take the help of a psychologist. The SC petition challenged this, pointing out that the JJ Act clearly mentioned that seeking the help of an experienced psychologist or other experts for such an assessment was optional and not mandatory.

""The HC must have formed an independent medical board to corroborate the views of the two courts before passing the impugned order,"" the petition highlights.

Following the HC order, the JJB in Gurugram has started a fresh assessment of the juvenile. On Thursday, he was given a personal hearing by the board, which will now make an assessment. The JJB will also constitute a board on November 3 for medical and psychological assessment of the juvenile suspect.

The Class II student, whose parents moved the SC on Thursday, was found with his throat slit and oozing blood inside the school bathroom in September last year. Within hours of the incident, Gurugram police had arrested a bus conductor. Following a persistent demand by the aggrieved family, the Haryana government had handed over the probe to the CBI. The investigation agency arrested a Class XI student of the same school for the alleged murder and gave a clean chit to the bus conductor."

Interestingly, Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education (KITE) has begun a massive audit to ensure the schools are fully utilising the facilities. According to the parents, the District Education Officer during a recent visit found the school did not comply with the rules. R Sivankutty Nair, the parent of a student, said the school authorities shifted the classroom to wreak vengeance on the class teacher of 9A. ""The move also prevented the students from getting quality education.

It is a blatant violation of human rights and the students are being denied basic education. The government has spent several crore on setting up a hi-tech facility in schools.

But teachers of Chinmaya Vidyalaya, Alappuzha don't seem to agree. It seems like 'good food' means boiled rice for them, and everything else is, well, not so great.

Students say the school, one of the prominent private higher secondary schools in the district, has made boiled rice mandatory for lunch for all students and has instructed them not to bring other food items for lunch more than twice a month - including rice-based dishes like idli and dosa.

""Sick parents"" are excused to pack something else for his/her ward for a day or two, but they must inform the concerned class teacher beforehand.

The school has also formed ""inspection teams"" consisting of two or three teachers, who visit classes during the lunch breaks almost every day, to check if students are following the order.

""They visit our class almost everyday to see what we are eating. If somebody is seen eating something else, they are asked why they have not brought rice and our parents are contacted over the phone. If the student repeats it, he/she is scolded by the teachers,"" a class VI student said.

However, school principal Dr S Lali refuted the claim. ""(Only) Non-vegetarian food items are strictly prohibited in the school. The teachers randomly visit classes to check if anybody is bringing meat to class. Biscuits, oily snacks, and aerated drinks are also not promoted in school. (Otherwise) Teachers are only asked to check if students are eating properly or not,"" she said.

She also said there are no other food restrictions in place in the school. ""Earlier, students of junior classes used to waste food and when asked they used to say they were packed things that they don't like. Some parents, looking for an easy way out, pack them items from the previous night after heating them. This monotony triggers a dislike towards food among them, she said.""

""No practice is in place that a parent should alert the class teacher for giving them something other than rice. But they bring chappati, idli, puttu or dosa all five days and rice is completely avoided,"" she went on to underline.

Not all parents agree. Stating that she usually contacts her daughter's class teacher when she has not packed rice, the mother of a class VII student said: ""No parent will purposefully give poor food to their ward and I don't think it is unfair to consider their tiffin preferences. Also, is it not a crime to be scolded before the whole class?""

'Rice is not special'

So, does the consumption of boiled rice make big a difference to the health of the child? Is it more nutritional than other popular food items?

No, says Dr Mumtaz Khalid Ismail, Kochi-based consultant clinical nutritionist.

""Rice is not mandatory. Calorie wise, there is only a negligible amount of difference between rice and wheat. Hence, there is no harm in giving them chappatis or curd rice for lunch. Packed lunch of a schoolgoer should meet one-third of his/her total daily calorie and protein requirements. They shouldn't skip breakfast or lunch but that doesn't mean rice should be force-fed. A balanced diet should be the only priority,"" she notes.

But, Dr Mumtaz agreed that it is better to avoid monotony and bring variety into the child's food habits.

Parents, though, ask how is this possible if the school authorities keep insisting on a particular food regime.

School principal Dr Lali said, ""If children prefer idli or dosa, let them have it. But it can't be permitted with just chutney or sambar; healthy side dishes like 'aviyal' or raw vegetables is a must.""

Parents' choice matters

But can a school possibly dictate what the students can eat and cannot?

""The school has no right to do so. Children of school-going age are minors and thus their guardians can decide what to cook for their children. Such a decision will be valid only if it is unanimously passed by the Parents Teachers Association,"" said advocate G Harikumar of District Court, Alappuzha.

Another parent stressed that no such meeting has happened yet at Chinmaya school. ""Usually, PTA meets happen class-wise. Can't talk for others but they haven't asked my opinion in this matter yet. Though I can understand the intention behind such a decision, I don't think all parents and kids will be okay with it. Rice is Kerala's staple food, but there are many who prefer other cereals over rice,"" the parent, whose child studies in Class X, said.

Pupils who spent their formative years abroad are allowed to bring other food for lunch, the principal confirmed.

That is another sore point. ""Are they not concerned about the nutrition needs of those students? If rules are implemented, everybody should be treated equally. Aren't such exemptions and preferences unfair?"" another parent asks."

The four boys were taken into custody and the boarding school's director, principal, administration officer, his wife and hostel caretaker were also arrested for alleged destruction of evidence and trying to hush up the matter.

The CBSE had discontinued the school's affiliation as its response to a show cause notice was ""evasive and insensitive"", according to reports.

Advocate Chauhan has written to senior superintendent of Uttarakhand police as well, demanding an investigation into how the girl's identity was revealed.

The school authorities were not immediately available for the comment.

However, regional officer of CBSE Ranveer Singh said he has not received any such letter.

However, their joy was shortlived as the work, which began after an assurance by MLA Aravind Limbavalli, stopped the very next day with only the worst bits of the road being patched up in a hurried manner. On Tuesday, the situation was back to normal with the road flooded and the school un-approachable, parents rued.

Located just outside the boundaries of the Kadugodi ward, the road is partly under the jurisdiction of the Seegehalli Gram Panchayat. As a result, the road, around 2 kilometres in length from the main Whitefield-Kadugodi-Hosakote Road, is untarred, muddy and narrow. A few days ago, owing to heavy flooding, the school sent out a warning and operated shuttles till a residential neighbourhood to avoid having their students wade through the waters to reach school.

This incident finally caught the attention of the MLA who then assured that work would be done. ""I thought I would do a fact check and found that only a small stretch has been metalled. But that is not going to help in anyway,"" says Tinu Cherian, a parent.

According to him, it is not possible to walk to school or get there by two-wheeler when the road is flooded. ""Added to this, is the chaos from the whitetopping work on the main road. Just 2 kilometres of whitetopping has turned the area into a nightmare. My daughter uses the school bus and yet misses the first two classes on some days because of traffic and waterlogging,"" he said.

However, according to the BBMP, work will soon be underway to provide an alternative access road to the school. ""This road is partly the responsibility of the Seegehalli Gram Panchayat.

On Monday, there was a survey of the road and also of another route which can connect to the school. Work on this route will begin in 15 days,"" said S Muniswamy, Councillor of the Kadugodi ward.

Meanwhile, the BBMP will create an alternative for the water that accumulates on the road to flow. ""We will at least ensure that there will be no water logging on the road. It is most likely due to some encroachments which will also be cleared,"" he said."

Shweta Jain thought she knew where her three-year-old was -- where else would she be on a Tuesday morning but in school? But an hour after she watched her daughter board the bus to her school in Chembur, her husband got a call from a stranger, informing them he had seen the toddler crying on the footpath in Kurla.

""We were at home when my husband received the call. We could not believe what we had heard, as I had watched Anushi boarding the school bus that morning,"" recalled Shweta.

Their daughter, Anushi, 3, is a nursery student at Green Acre school in Chembur. She was found on the footpath in Nehru Nagar, which was a whole 7 km away from the school and wasn't even on the bus route.

""We called the school first to verify what was happening. Only after our call did the school authorities check her class and realise that she was absent. We immediately rushed to Kurla to pick up our child. We are very fortunate that our daughter is safe,"" said the mother, expressing her gratitude to the caller who found her daughter.

Angry parents gather at Govandi police station to protest over the school's negligence

The good Samaritan, Rajesh Shah, runs a general store with his brother right where Arushi was spotted. Since his son studies in the same school, he recognised the uniform.

""From my shop, I spotted the little girl crying, and rushed there immediately. She was so scared, she could not answer questions properly. I immediately brought her to our shop, where my brother and I tried to calm her down. I called the school's landline, but was shocked when the official responded that I should contact the parents instead. I then called the number on the child's ID card and spoke to her father,"" said Shah.

""Understandably, her parents did not believe me at first. They thought their daughter was in school, and Nehru Nagar is nowhere near it. But once they confirmed it with the school, they rushed to my shop. Both of them were crying and distressed,"" he said, further adding, ""I am immensely happy that I was able to help the family. I read news reports about unfortunate incidents every day, and am glad that I was able to avoid one here.""

Rajesh Shah found the toddler and reunited her with her parents

What happened

According to Shweta, Anushi had fallen asleep on the bus, and the attendant forgot about her. Once the other kids alighted at the school, the bus headed to Kurla for some work. It was parked at Nehru Nagar, where Anushi woke up. Out of habit, she exited the bus but got scared upon realising that she was in an unfamiliar place. After walking on the footpath for a while, she started crying and was found by Shah.

Shah added that while her parents turned up soon after he called, the bus driver got there around 9.15 am, but the school authorities only arrived around 10 am. The Jains and Shah both called out the school's negligence.

Shweta said, ""Anushi was crying inconsolably after we were renuited. She told me that she was afraid of getting lost again, and so she did not want to go to school anymore.

""We took her home and then rushed to the police station to lodge a complaint against the school. But the school authorities have assured us of immediate action in the matter, promising more stringent regulations for students' safety. We want this assurance in writing, along with an apology letter, within 24 hours, otherwise we will lodge an FIR against the school,"" said Anushi's father, Piyush, while waiting at Govandi police station.

Other parents angry too

Shah said, ""My child studies in the same school, and if this is their approach towards safety, it is a matter of concern."" The incident caused major anger among other parents at the high-profile school as well. Several of them arrived at the police station in solidarity with the Jains, and laid out a list of issues with the school's transport services.

""It is a mandatory bus service by the school for all children, for which they charge heavily. The least we can expect is the safety of our children. It is very irresponsible of the lady attendant to forget a child. What is the point of having a lady attendant and CCTV cameras when our kids are still not safe? They charge us anywhere between Rs 24,000 and Rs 36,000 per year,"" said one of the parents.

Another added, ""How could the school not notice that the child was absent, even though she was marked present on the bus? The school should have at least been sensitive enough to swing into action upon finding out what had happened.""

School says

Rachana Laxminarayanan, school principal, said, ""It was an unfortunate incident, and we support the parents. We rushed to the spot as soon as we got to know about it. The attendant was unwell today, so there was a human error, as she did not switch on the CCTV surveillance. We are going to terminate the services of the bus contractor. A meeting will be held with parents to understand their concerns regarding transport services, to make appropriate changes.""

Expertspeak

There is no clarity on who should be held responsible for the incident, since the school bus policy does not apply to playgroups or nurseries. Social activist Indrani Malkhani, who was an integral part of the committee that formed the school bus policy, explained, ""The school bus policy is applicable to buses running for schools. School starts from Std I, so buses for lower classes can't be called schoolbuses."""

""Parents should be asked to volunteer for an hour or so in schools to look after safety of their wards. This method is followed in the western countries and is very efficient.

Conversations from China's popular WeChat group have become viral online where it is seen one of the child's teacher writing that some guardians raised objection to Li choosing a fancy sports car to drop his kid at school for they fear that it could result in ""class divisions"" among the students in the classroom, Shanghaiist reported.

Li reportedly earns more than 4 million yuan a year (nearly INR 4.3 crore) and it is no wonder that he can afford a Ferrari as his mode of transportation. But his fellow parents have accused him of flaunting his wealth and advised him to choose a more modest vehicle when dropping his child at the institution.

Li, however, refused to oblige. He is of the opinion that he worked hard to make his fortunes and will not just buy another car because others wanted him to.

""What's wrong with wanting to provide the very best for my child? If seeing someone else driving a sports car hurts your children's feelings, then they are too sensitive,"" Li wrote.

The fate of 1,600 students enroled in the school hangs in balance as the government is mulling shutting down the school after at least two cases of sexual abuse of children were reported.

The department has already shut down pre-primary classes and has also reportedly recommended CBSE to de-recognise the school's primary and higher classes too. Parents allege that the education department officials have done precious little, despite tall promises, to get the 290 children who were enrolled in nursery and kindergarten classes readmitted in other schools.

Earlier, officials had promised parents that they would get assistance in securing admissions for their children in other schools of their choice. Now, several parents feel the department officials are shirking responsibility. ""How will we know which schools have affiliation and which don't? Instead of giving us names of recognised schools, they have just asked us to choose,"" says Aasiya Khanam, a parent. While parents have been vocal about not wanting the school to be shut down, lack of response from the school management has left parents in two minds.

It has come to light that soon after the closure of the pre-primary section, the management had assured parents that classes would be made operational. It had also assured that classes would be run during the Dussehra vacations to make up for those lost last month when the school for shut for 10 days. However, it "" unexpectedly' declared a 10-day long vacation on Monday, leaving parents confused about its intent. Earlier on 1 October, parents under the aegis of Azzan Internation Parents Association met the management and submitted a charter of demands.

These pertain to the removal of staff in including directors and principal; upgradation of security on the premises; and formulation of a parents, teachers and management association and a grievance cell. The management has sought time till October 15 to respond to these demands, failing which the association said it will take legal action.

Parents confused

Speaking to Express on the condition of anonymity a parent said: ""Safety of our children is our first priority, but we also do not want the school to shut down. This is why we asked for more safety features, but the management is trying to isolate us, paving way for its downfall."""

Days after a 5-year-old girl was allegedly molested by a teacher at a Kolkata school, parents of students protested outside the premises Tuesday, calling for action against the accused. A case was lodged the same day, after which the accused teacher was arrested.

""The teacher has been accused of sexually abusing a minor student. A probe is on,"" Deputy Commissioner of Police (South East Division) Kalyan Mukherjee told The Indian Express. The incident allegedly occurred on September 26.

Police sources said the protest turned violent when police personnel were escorting 300-500 students out of the school premises. They suspect that the protesters saw teachers attempting to leave the school amidst the students, following which they began pelting stones. The police resorted to lathicharge to disperse the crowd.

Apart from the accused teacher, the police also arrested four protesters for their involvement in the violence, sources said. ""During the scrimmage, eight to 10 police personnel sustained injuries and are under treatment at different hospitals. One woman demonstrator was also injured but left the place on her own. Four trouble-makers have been arrested,"" said an official.

The police released a statement which read, ""Today at about 9.45 am, information was received from officer-in-charge of Lake police station that trouble sprouted at a school... Police were informed that aggrieved guardians of the students started staging a demonstration over an alleged molestation incident which reportedly happened on September 26 during school hours. The parents of the victim lodged a complaint at the police station today.""

Police sources said action was taken immediately after the complaint was lodged. A case was registered at Lake police station under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC and under the POCSO Act.

When police officers arrived at the school to nab the accused, guardians of students allegedly got into an altercation with school authorities and demanded that the accused be handed over to them. In the ruckus that followed, a teacher was manhandled and some protesters were injured.

Later, a meeting was held between parents, school authorities, police and a local councillor of Kolkata Municipal Corporation to solve the issue. During the meeting, parents demanded that no male teacher should be allowed in the school.

""They demanded that all male teachers be removed from the girls' school. I will convey this to the education minister. For the time being, it has been decided that only female teachers will take classes till Class V,"" said councillor Ratan Dey.

Primary school council chairman Kartick Chandra Manna told reporters, ""It is an unfortunate incident. Everything has been conveyed to our education minister. For the time being, the accused teacher will not be allowed in the school. If he is found guilty action will be taken. A probe will be done. A few outsiders took advantage of the incident and triggered tension in the area. Police have identified them and action will be taken against each of them.""

Repeated calls to school authorities went unanswered.

""If the school and police had acted in the very beginning, such vandalism wouldn't have taken place. Female protesters were beaten up by the police for no reason,"" said one of the protesters, Mousumi Mondal.

A team from the West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights also visited the spot. ""We are keeping a close watch on the incident. Police have already arrested the accused. If he is found to be guilty, proper action will be taken,"" said Ananya Chattopadhyay, chairperson of the West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights.

At least three guardians were injured, one of them having sustained head injury in the lathicharge. Besides, two teachers and 10 cops, including Lake police station OC Suman Kumar Dey and Gariahat police station OC Sumit Dasgupta, were injured. The accused teacher, Dipak Karmakar (58), a resident of Vidyasagar Colony, was taken to the Lake police station and arrested after his version seemed questionable. He has been charged with Section 10 of POCSO Act and several other sections of the IPC. Four guardians have also been rounded up for rioting and vandalizing and are likely to be arrested. ""We have arrested the accused. We are abiding by children rights commission's regulations. The situation turned tense as the residents took law in their hands. ,"" said a senior police officer. The cops claimed they apparently acted in defence.

The school education department has called for a probe even as it instructed the institute to lodge a complaint of rioting. Police have been asked to provide security on Wednesday, when an attempt will be made to reopen the school.

According to the girl's mother, the upper-KG girl was assaulted by Karmakar, who taught English and Bengali at the school, on September 26. Since it was the day the BJP had called a bandh, only 21of the 40 students were present. ""After she returned home, I noticed she was behaving unnaturally. But she did not open up. For the past few days, she had been refusing to go to school,"" her mother said. Only recently, did she tell her parents about the torture. The child reportedly told her parents that Karmakar had taken her to a separate room where he allegedly physically assaulted her. The parents informed the school about the assault but the authorities apparently did nothing about it. The parents claimed to have a doctor's report, saying child was physically abused. ""The school runs between 6.30am and 8.30am. after which the students are provided with mid-day meal around 9am before the classes are called off,"" an officer said. ""After that, special sessions are held for students facing difficulty with lessons. Karmakar apparently used this pretext to take the child to a room on the first floor, where he sexually assaulted her,"" said an officer.

The school, however, denied the allegation, saying they were informed about the incident only on Tuesday morning when the principal came out to speak to the survivor's mother. The principal alleged the girl's parents, along with scores of other guardians, demanded that Karmakar be handed over to them immediately and that they did not respond to her repeated attempts to open a dialogue. The police said it was around 8am that they received a call from the school. ""A team from the Lake police station went to the school and brought the accused to the police station. We questioned him, found his answers to be questionable and arrested him,"" said an officer. ""However as the word of sexual abuse spread, the crowd kept swelling. The parents initially staged a demonstration pointing to lax security at the school. But around 10am, they began demanding that the accused be handed over to them. When the crowd started to turn violent, we summoned forces from the Gariahat and Rabindra Sarobar police stations.""

""Stopped from barging into the school, the protesters reportedly pelted the cops with stones and managed to break open the main gate. But with cops standing as a barricade, they could go no further in but they attacked the personnel,"" claimed an officer. Some from the crowd -- ruffians from nearby slums also apparently joined in -- vandalized cars and bikes parked on the road. They even reportedly tried to torch a bike, after which cops resorted to lathicharge. What followed was a bloodied ""battle"" of three hours, in which the mother of a child suffered severe head injuries, after being allegedly hit by a cop with a lathi. Several guardians alleged they were kicked by cops. A teacher was attacked by the protesters only to be saved by the students.

Shortly, the school authorities sat with the cops and school education department officers and took four decisions: to reopen school within 24 hours with police help, the accused cannot attend school till the probe is over, a rioting case will be filed by school and a proper probe will be launched into abuse allegation and a report will be submitted. ""We have several CCTV cameras on the premises and we want the truth to come out,"" claimed a teacher.

Ananya Chakraborti, chairperson of the West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights, who visited the school said they were extending legal and counselling help. ""She is in trauma. The commission will keep an eye on the probe and may seek CCTV images,"" she said."

What are the major concerns surrounding the weight of school bags?

Schoolgoing children have been burdened with heavy bags. I have seen young students carry bags weighing upto 10 kg everyday on their shoulders. It is no more just books, but several other materials like project stationery, large or multiple tiffin boxes, umbrella, raincoat, sports uniform, etc. in additional to the conventional notebooks and stationery. All this will cause major health hazards for students, harming their growth, both physically and intellectually.

Has the government taken any step to check this?

The government has taken steps, but they aren't strong enough. There was a government directive in July 2015 which strictly restricted schools from allowing students carrying weight more than 10 per cent of their body weight. Even the PCMC education department recently started the 'No School Bag Day' policy on the first and third Saturday of every month in civic-run schools. But, all that cannot change the overall scenario, because both parents and schools need to be actively involved in its implementation. More awareness programmes and stringent laws can help.

Can you suggest possible solution(s) for this?

I have noticed students carry a lot of weight, just not of notebooks, but textbooks as well. One of the measures is to recycle books. These textbooks can be kept on the school premises and can be used by the students during school hours. Also, many students end up taking more books to school, even of those subjects which are not in the routine, in the fear of being called out in the class for not having it. Many a times, classes in school often get switched and the routine changes, so students are scared to be in such a spot. The recycling process, really helps as they would not have to carry any books at all. Also, if required, these students can keep another copy of the same book in their homes for home study or borrow the same books from the school during examinations. The other suggestion is spreading more awareness, which we have been working towards."

Angry over lack of teachers in a zilla parishad-run primary school at Karanjote village in Bhiwandi, parents of children attending classes there put a lock on the main gate of the school on September 25. Residents said they took the step after their demands for increasing the number of teachers ""fell on deaf ears"". The school currently has two teachers for more than 100 students, claimed a local resident.

Ramesh Jadhaw, father of a six-year-old girl, said: ""This is the only school for nearly five villages and adivasi padas. Children come from different villages, travelling several kilometres. However, there is no teacher for them. So what is the point of having a school?""

Jadhaw is one of the many residents, who have been demanding that the school be better equipped to teach over 100 students attending classes there.

""The school conducts classes till standard seven. The headmaster looks after a few standards, but mostly it is just one teacher who teaches all the subjects in all seven standards. How can one person teach so many children?"" asked Ashwini Gavle, parent of a seven-year-old.

Parents claimed that even those two teachers are absent on many occasions. ""Of the few days that the school was open, the teachers are mostly engaged in either government deputation or training. How are they expected to teach our children?"" Gavle added.

Residents of Karanjote village claimed to had written to all senior authorities. ""We wrote to the education officer at the zilla parishad multiple times since 2016. Some of us even visited the officer. But nothing changed,"" said Sukanya Jadhaw, a local resident.

""In September, the children had hardly a week of school... while the rest of the days were declared holiday. Why is the education department carrying on with this farce? This is not how a school functions,"" she added.

On September 25, when the teachers did not turn up at the school, parents took all the children out and put a lock on the front gate of the four-roomed school premises in the middle of the village, sources said. ""We won't let anyone reopen the school unless the number of teachers is increased. Under the Right to Education law, there has to be a teacher for 30 children. We want at least that rule to be followed,"" said Krushna Jadhaw, another parent.

Meanwhile, Bhiwandi Zilla Parishad Education Officer Sanjay Thorat said: ""There were supposed to be four teachers at the school. There were three earlier, one of whom had been involved in some tussle with the villagers. We have added one teacher to the current situation and the parents have agreed to start the school again from Tuesday. There is a shortage of staff."""

Three persons have been arrested for allegedly cheating parents of the students seeking admission at St Joseph and Don Bosco high schools.

While Chandrakant Bhosale (27) was arrested from Kurla railway station Tuesday, his associates, Radheshyam Bindra (32) and Shyamlal Rajbhar (34), were arrested by the Matunga police on September 27 after they were brought in for questioning. They have been accused of preparing fake payment receipts in the name of the schools.

Police said three cases came to light when the parents approached the school separately to check whether the seats in junior kindergartens have been confirmed for their children. ""When they went to the respective schools with the payment receipts, the parents came to know that they have been duped. The Father of St Joseph High School came to the police station and handed us a written complaint,"" said an officer.

During preliminary investigation, the police learnt that the group had cheated three parents of Rs 1.20 lakh, Rs 1.05 lakh and Rs 75,000, respectively.

""The parents identified the main accused as Chandrakant Bhosale, who had claimed that he is in good terms with the principals and could help them with their ward's admissions. Later, with the help of his call data records, Bhosale was arrested from Kurla station,"" the officer said.

""We came to know that the accused had given the parents receipts of much lesser amounts than to they had actually paid for admission. Bhosale had claimed that the school would not want to mention the donation amount in the receipt,"" the officer added.

Following Bhosale's arrest, the roles played by Bindra and Rajbhar came to light. ""Earlier this year, Bhosale had wanted to print fake receipts of the schools. He initially approached Bindra, who guided him to the third accused. Rajbhar has alleged that Bhosale was introduced to him as an employee of Don Bosco High School... and that the school would give him a printing contract on Bhosale's recommendation,"" the officer said.

So far, the police have come to know that the group has cheated three parents. The three have been booked under sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 465 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged), 472 (making or possessing counterfeit seal with intent to commit forgery punishable) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC.

The association said that if the schools reserved the right to bully the government with a set of demands, justified or unjustified, the students, parents and teachers should also be tolerated when they exercised their right to basic protest or making a complaint against gross illegal profiteering by schools and their attitude to safety and security issues. The HSPA said neither the parents nor the teachers were a party to the bandh call.

The state education department mandates students submit government identity proof for its Students' Achievement Tracking System (SATS). Since Aadhaar card is the only option for students below 15 years of age, parents had to go through the process of obtaining a unique identification card for their children.

However, since UIDAI reveals biometrics of a person changes once they attain the age of 15 years, it's mandatory to get biometrics revised. This meant parents had to go through the process of obtaining an Aadhaar card for their wards twice.

Prejita Singh, from Electronics City and a parent of a 7-year-old, said, ""I am happy with the verdict of the Supreme Court. I was a little apprehensive when a prominent school in Electronics City asked for Aadhaar details. First, I didn't want to get Aadhaar before my child crossed 15 years of age, and second I had doubts over the security of the data.""

Mahesh Jain, from RT Nagar and a parent of a 12-yearold student, said: ""After a huge hue and cry, I had to submit, my son's Aadhaar card in school. I could not understand the point of submitting Aadhaar details. It left great scope for misuse since schools don't have safe websites or strong cyber teams to handle data theft. I am happy with the verdict.""

Most schools too are pleased with the verdict since it will reduce the workload on staff. M Srinivasan, principal, Gear International School and president, CBSE Schools Association, said, ""I am happy with the verdict. Parents were reluctant to share their children's biometric details with schools. They were not comfortable at all, but the Supreme Court's decision solves the problem.""

Echoing Srivivasan's view, Mansoor Ali Khan, member, board of directors, DPS, said, ""It was an additional task for school administrations to collect and maintain Aadhaar data. I hope the Karnataka government also does not make it mandatory, because it would then be difficult to make parents understand why it's important.""

'Will lead to corruption'

But others are unhappy with the court freeing the admission process of Aadhaar data.

""Having Aadhaar records made it possible for us to track students in the long run,"" said Shashi Kumar, general secretary, Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka. ""Through Aadhaar, we were able to secure details of hundreds of ghost students registered by schools for benefits. I hope it continues for RTE admissions."""

Alleging that the school management is behaving as if they are above the law, parents said the school has been reopened with the sole intention of showing the video to students.

""When police are investigating the issue and the medical report has stated that the girl was sexually exploited, the school has no business to show CCTV footage to students. In fact, the entire day was dedicated only for this purpose and all the staff was busy dealing with angry parents,"" said Mohammed Asif Hussain Sohail, a parent of a Class 2 student, adding that the management continued to show the video to students on Wednesday even after parents and police intervened. Meanwhile, parents, who have already formed an ad-hoc committee, said they have submitted four representations to the management over the safety of their wards but have received no response so far.

Parents also demanded that if the school is going to remain open, it should have only female staff for the girl's block. They also demanded separate entry and exit points for girls and asked the school to ensure a thorough and professional background check of all the existing staff and new recruits. The worried parents also pointed out that even two weeks after the incident, they have no clarity on the future of their children as the education department has not yet issued any communication. ""We don't know if the school will be closed down or will remain open or will be taken over from the management.

The school has been shut for the last 10 days. On Wednesday, as many as 162 parents met the DEO and requested her not to close down the school. They fear changing school in the middle of the year would be difficult and pose financial and logistical issues. Zareena Shah, mother of a class 10 student, says though the sexual harassment charges cannot be dismissed, future of other students cannot be overlooked.

""In view of the serious nature of the incidents, closure of the school appears to be the most likely action. But we are looking at all possibilities.

'35L students to be affected if budget schools are shut down'

Unhappy at the government's refusal to issue extension of temporary recognition (ETR) without insisting upon different No Objection Certificates -- fire, traffic and GHMC, the Telangana Recognised Schools Management Association (TRSMA) has called for a bandh of all budget schools on Friday. The term budget schools refers to schools which charge fee less than Rs 30,000. According to the TRSMA, the National Building Code came into force in 1998, fire NOC became mandatory in 2005 and traffic NOC from 2009 onwards, therefore nearly 80 per cent of schools established before these norms were enforced are now found to be violators. S Srinivas, president of TRSMA, alleged that the government is deliberately tightening the noose around the budget schools in order to shut them.

""As part of its KG to PG education programme, it plans to open up 500 more schools next year so they want to shut our schools. We are ready to even hand over the management of our schools to government so that it can run them government schools and regularise all our teachers too,"" he said. There are 35 lakh students in 1,200 budgets schools across the State and closure of these schools will affect their future."

Parents carried their wards on their back and shoulders while wading through the river. Still, 39 students of Government Senior Secondary School at Koti village missed their exams as they could not cross the river.

As it began raining from Sunday night, the water level of the Ghaggar rose when the students left for school on Monday morning. Exams from classes VI to XI were scheduled for Monday. On Saturday, 18 students from standard IX to XII had already missed the exam due to the same reason.

Jaipal Singh, a resident of Pathrothi village, had to carry his daughter Geetanjali of Standard IX on his back to help her cross the river so that she doesn't miss her exam. ""She was crying that she will miss her exam and at the same time got scared to cross the river. I knew it was risky for her and me too... but at least she felt safe that she was with her father,"" he said.

Paramjeet Singh, another resident of the same village who also carried his daughter Payal, a student of Standard VII, said, ""We are fed up. The government says send your children to school. Yet, have they even provided a proper access to the school.""

In Class VI, eight students missed the exam while in standard VII, four couldn't take the exam. Six students of Standard VIII, nine of Standard IX, seven of Standard X and five of Standard XI failed to take the exam. After walking for three to seven kilometres from their respective villages, these students reached the river bank but couldn't wade through Ghaggar.

The exam was scheduled to take place at 8.30 am. While Standard VI was to take the English exam, standards VII, VIII, IX, X and XI were to take science, Hindi, maths and history, respectively. Surinder, a student of Class X who had his maths exam, came covered in plastic but had to return from the river bank. Surinder had walked seven kilometres from his village Late Batoli to the river bank. But finding the Ghaggar swollen, he couldn't risk crossing the river.

""Does the administration only swing into action after a casualty? We feel so helpless. At least we can get a temporary bridge until a permanent solution is chalked out. What if we are trying to cross and get washed away by the strong current?"" said Surinder. ""We have our boards this time and these examinations are highly important for us. We don't even know whether the school will take our exam again,"" he added.

Brij Kishore Gautam, a teacher of the school, said they were in the process of sending a request to the district education office to allow them to take the exams for these students again. ""Every minute has been difficult for us. We don't even know if we will survive while crossing the river this season and the officials are just speaking about tenders being floated, tenders being opened and what not.... We don't understand these official jargons. Why can't they provide a stopgap arrangement till then,"" said the teacher.

Gautam added that his son Tanmay has been constantly asking whether he would be able to go to school on Tuesday since he missed school today. Panchkula DC Mukul Kumar said he had spoken to the Block Development Officer who said that the villagers had been insisting on a permanent solution only.

However, when the DC was told that the villagers have been asking for at least a temporary solution at present, he said, ""Tomorrow itself, I will get the provision of a temporary bridge explored."" PWD officials said tenders have already been recalled and work will begin soon.

The school has witnessed enthusiasm and interest among parents even in its secondth operational year. Early learning village is grounded on a content-rich International Early Years Curriculum (IEYC) which lays the foundation of knowledge and learning for children aged 1.5 to 4.5 years. Children embark on their journey towards learning in an environment that provides stimulating spaces and exciting experiences.

""We are still receiving many enquiries from parents for admissions. This has primarily been achieved through references and word of mouth. In a short span of time, we have been able to make a difference to the teaching environment in the city with our focus on experiential and play-based learning. With the freedom to explore, our children engage in hands-on activities, learn to think creatively and evolve to develop skills like problem solving and critical thinking. When children enter our gates with enthusiasm, it only endorses our efforts and innovative teaching-style. We hope to empower and equip each child with the excitement, curiosity and love for learning for life!"" says Mrs Priya Saxena, co-founder and Principal at Early Learning Village.

""At Early Learning Village, we focus on quality and learning for both our children and teachers. We ensure the best of learning environment and material is provided to our students. We also commit to providing sufficient teaching training and resources to all our teachers. We are happy that both our students and teachers are in harmony with each other and are able to make so much more out of their association and friendship"", says Mr. Pradeep Jolly, Co-Founder, Early Learning Village.

Teaching at Early learning village is a very holistic process where not only the child's cognitive well-being is taken care of, but the child's emotional, social, physical and spiritual growth and needs are also taken care of. A child's day at Early Learning Village has a balance of open-ended activities, exploration, child-initiated play supported by adults, focused-learning with adult guiding the learning through playful and rich experiential activities. Through role-play, messy play, water and sand activities, construction and small world children at ELV engage, explore and learn. We value outdoor learning as much as indoor learning and invest a lot of time and planning to provide children with unique, safe, rich and dynamic experiences in our natural outdoor play spaces. Our outdoor activities provide children with a range of engaging and challenging opportunities to explore freely, develop physically, take risks, solve problems and grow in confidence while playing independently and collaboratively.

ELV outdoors offer children opportunities to play in the treehouse, vegetable farm, musical garden, sensory path and sensory fountain. All these activities are on the lines of international practices as the Co - founders of the school-Ms Priya Saxena, Ms Priya Dhawan and Ms Heba Zaidi Khosla, have taught at The British School and other global schools.

At Early Learning Village, ELV teachers work in small groups, with each teacher responsible for a group size of 4 - 6 children. Small group work increases the attention and focus the child receives. A unique feature of the school is that it encourages one of the parent of the child to be present during the first few days of transition.

The teachers at ELV are qualified teachers, who go through initial hand holding and shadow sessions and then work daily to master their expertise. This is important as it helps them align their knowledge and skills with the international curricula that this school offers. They make the children adept in storytelling, rhymes, phonics, coloring, art and crafts, painting, drawing, dance, music, singing, drama, theatre. There are specific classes for gardening, pottery, no flame cooking, etc.

ELV has partnered with 'Music Together' for music sessions, Art of Sport for physical development session and 'My dance academy' for dance session for their children. Field trips and story are a regular feature at ELV. ELV is more than just a workplace, it is a community of like-minded people who have come together for a common purpose - ""children first"".

ELV resonates compassion, love and laugher among all its stakeholders. It is a vibrant place for learning, for one and for all."

Authorities at the New English School at Landewadi, in Ambegaon taluka of Pune district, have taken an initiative to ensure that parents get multiple updates about the students' whereabouts via SMS throughout the day.

""We have installed a device in all our buses and given I-cards, which contain a chip, to students. So, when the child boards the bus, he or she has to tap their I-card on that device, which automatically sends a message to the parent's phone, informing them that the child has entered the bus. While getting off the bus, the student has to again tap the device with the I-card, and a second message goes to the parent stating that the child has left the bus. A third message is sent when the child enters the school and taps the I-card on a device here. So, by the time the student reaches school, three communications between the parent and the school have taken place,"" said Shabnam Momin, principal of New English School.

""The same way, when children leave the school, they have to tap the device in the school and do the same when they are getting on and off the school bus. In one day, six messages are sent to the parent's phone, updating them on the child's whereabouts,"" she added.

Earlier, the school authorities had installed CCTV cameras and GPS tracking system inside the school buses.

Explaining the reason behind the security measures, Momin said, ""Several incidents of sexual harassment and bullying in school buses have been reported from across India. These are the steps we took to prevent such incidents. The safety and security of our students is always our main priority"".

Vidya Kale, whose three children study in New English School, said, ""This is a great step by the school to ensure the safety of our children. It also has other advantages. Now, I don't need to wait at the bus stop for a long time. I can always track the bus with my phone and go to the bus stop only when the bus is close by.""

Satish Bhere, a student of Class X, said, ""This system also has an added advantage when it comes to attendance.

Earlier, attendance was taken manually and that was a time-consuming job. Now, it is recorded automatically when the student taps the scanning device with his I-card and the data is stored in a database"".

The issue has been hanging fire for years, but while the authorities debate and delay, little children in the city's schools continue to carry the burden of homework and heavy schoolbags. It was in 2016 that the Union Ministry of Human Resources Development directed the CBSE to issue circulars to schools telling them to advise students of classes 1 and 2 not to carry school bags and to stop giving them homework.

The CBSE did issue the circular on September 12, 2016, but seeing little change on the ground, it was pulled up by the Madras High Court on August 11 this year, and advised to enforce its diktat more seriously. A few days later, on August 20, the court ordered the CBSE to publicise in the media that strict action would be taken against schools not following the 'No Homework' rule

And complying, the CBSE's recent circular has advised its affiliated schools to reduce the weight of school bags in the interests of the children's health and not to prescribe home work, which could add to their burden both literally and figuratively speaking. ""Young children whose spine is at a crucial stage of growth are most susceptible to hazards such as back pain, muscle pain, shoulder pain, fatigue and in extreme cases the distortion of spinal chord or shoulders that may most plausibly be attributed to heavy school bags,"" read the circular.

The Karnataka government, which too has been slack in reducing the burden of little children , seems to have finally woken up as well and held a meeting on September 3 this year with private school managements to discuss the twin issues of doing away with heavy school bags at least two days a week and homework all days of the week for students of UKG and classes 1 and 2.

The meeting clearly did not go down well as earlier this week, on September 11, the private school managements condemned the 'unscientific' draft guidelines prescribed by the Department of State Educational Research and Training (DSERT) for enforcement in the state

The new guidelines propose that a schoolbag should not be heavier than 10 per cent of the student's body weight and that students from lower kindergarten (LKG) to class 2 should not be allowed to carry more than 2 or 3 kgs of books and students from classes 4 to 7 more than 4 kgs.

Mr D. Shashikumar, general secretary of the Karnataka Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools (KAMS) is categorical in his opposition to these new norms, insisting that such decisions should be backed by proper research. ""The government should work scientifically and give orders that are acceptable to all stakeholders,"" he says, revealing that private school managements in the state are okay with only one ""No Bag Day"" a week.

President of the Managements of Independent CBSE Schools Association (MICSA), M. Srinivasan too is unhappy with the guidelines issued by his board, and insists that giving students homework is necessary as it encourages them to think constructively and contributes to ""better brain development and retention capabilities.""

""Homework encourages students to revise portions taught in school after class hours,"" he says. Strongly critical of both the CBSE and the DSERT for coming up with directives without scientific backing, he says that such decisions should be taken with care. ""A comprehensive survey should be done among students, teachers and parents before making these guidelines the norm,"" he stresses.

Give our kids homework: parents oppose policy

Parents are equally opposed tot he No Homework policy, say principals and teachers. ""Parents love to compare their children's academic progress with that of children from other schools. They like to look into their work books to assess their progress and help them revise what they have learnt in school during the day,"" says a principal of an ICSE school in the city. Arguing that the workload of students till second grade is very small and puts no pressure on them, he says homework helps build their interest in information outside their textbooks.

While one parent, Mr Ravi Nair, an advertising professional whose sons study in grade one and four in a city school, is happy with the government's move on reducing heavy school bags, he believes homework should be done online in future. Welcoming the proposal to have ""No Bag Days,"" he says, ""I have always felt that schools burden children with heavy books, which they don't always need. Instead, students should be trained to go online for any pending work on reaching home to make learning fun. While smartphone applications are easy and feasible to create, even budget schools can develop a platform to make learning and revision an interactive process from home,"" he suggests.

Education expert, Preethi Vickram, however, feels that it is high time the concept of homework underwent a comprehensive transformation. ""Rather than being mere revision, homework should enhance the communication and application skills of children at home. They should be encouraged to interact with parents to know how a particular concept taught at school is used in practice. In short, homework should play a complementary role, rather than being a repetitive process,"" she says.

Responding to the criticism of school managements, principals and parents on the issue, Prof. Niranjanaradhya V.P, head of the universalisation of equitable quality education programme at the Centre for Child and the Law, National Law School of India University (NLSIU) , who was on the committee which drafted the guidelines on homework and schoolbags, says it is unfounded.

""Such policy decisions are taken by the government only on the basis of systematic studies. Doctors were consulted to prescribe the optimal weight of school bags for children of various ages,"" he reveals adding that schools should not blame parents for encouraging them to do homework and instead convince them that their children can do well in their studies even without doing it at this stage of their learning.

Family members of a three-and-a-half-year-old girl who was allegedly molested in her school at north west Delhi's Mukherjee Nagar last week staged a protest outside the school on Tuesday demanding action against the authorities.

They were joined by parents of other schoolchildren and members of some NGOs. They blocked the road and demanded justice for the child.

The parents of the child have alleged that she was sexually assaulted in her school last Tuesday. A case was registered by the district police under relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses (POCSO) Act.

The family alleges that when the girl came home on September 4, her private parts were bleeding. They took her to a doctor who suspected sexual assault following which the family reported the matter to the police.

The police today said that the Crime Branch will take over the probe into the alleged sexual assault of the girl.

A senior officer said the case has been transferred to the Crime Branch since it is a ""sensitive one"".

Last week, police had said that it did not rule out the role of the school authority or any family member or neighbour.

Aslam Khan, the Deputy Commissioner of Police (northwest), had said, ""We are investigating the matter from all angles. We are not ruling out the role of the school authority or any family member or neighbour.""

A Chinese kindergarten principal has apologized after allowing a pole dancer to perform on the school's opening day. Yes, you read that right. A Chinese kindergarten thought it was a good idea to have a scantily clad woman writhing around a pole in the school courtyard on Monday.

American writer Michael Standaert, who is based in the southern city of Shenzhen, was surprised, to say the least, when he and his wife took their children to the privately run Xinshahui kindergarten in the Bao'an district of Shenzhen on Monday.

There, on a stage in the courtyard, in front of rows of children aged 3 to 6, all first-day-ready in pristine white shirts and neatly pressed black shorts, a woman did a routine that would not be out of place in a downtown strip club.

Dressed in a tight, black midriff-baring top, black leather hotpants and high black sandals, she flung herself around the pole and down on the floor, flicking her hair suggestively.

Some little boys can be seen laughing and swinging around each other, while the little girls in red majorette-style outfits in the front appear frozen still. Several mothers can be seen hurriedly shooing their children away from the scene.

""Who would think this is a good idea?"" Standaert asked above one of several videos he posted on Twitter.

""The principal hung up on my wife when she called after saying it was 'international and good exercise' ... OK, yeah for adults maybe, but not 3- to 6-year-old kids,"" he added.

There were also advertisements for a pole dancing school around the school courtyard, leading Standaert to wonder if the principal had accepted money in return for allowing the unusual display. He later said by email that he had not been able to confirm whether this was the case.

After the videos garnered lots of unwanted attention on the internet, the Bao'an educational bureau said the pole dance was ""inappropriate."" In a statement on Weibo, the Chinese answer to Twitter, the bureau asked the owner of the kindergarten to apologize to the parents and the public, and to sack the principal.

The principal of the kindergarten, Lai Rong, issued an apology, saying she thought ""inviting professional dancers to the kindergarten to perform for the parents would liven up the mood"" on the first day back. ""I did not think through the contents of the performance ... It was a very terrible viewing experience for the kids and the parents. For that, I sincerely apologize,"" according to a report on Weibo of her message to parents.

Lai told The Washington Post that she sent the apology even before the local education bureau got involved.

""I was thinking of asking the forgiveness from the parents and also promising them that we would not teach the kids this kind of dance. I just want the kids to know the existence of this kind of dance. That's all,"" she told The Post.

Many Weibo commentators said it was not an appropriate spectacle for a kindergarten. But not everyone disapproved.

""This is probably something to encourage the dads to pick up their kids,"" said Weibo user @Janson_Mou. ""If my daughter's kindergarten is like this, I will go pick her up every day.""

The idea of having pole dancers or strippers at an event not usually associated with exotic dancing is not entirely new in China.

In 2015, the Chinese Culture Ministry cracked down on the ""bizarre and increasingly popular"" habit of having half-naked women perform at funerals, which was ""corrupting the social atmosphere.""

""Having exotic performances of this nature at funerals highlights the trappings of modern life in China, whereby vanity and snobbery prevail over traditions,"" the state news agency, Xinhua, reported at the time.

The practice appeared part of a tactic to attract more mourners to funerals, make the deceased look more popular and honor their life more fully. In flashy New China, it's also become a way to flaunt newly gotten wealth.

China has had a tradition of entertaining mourners at funerals as far back as the Qing Dynasty, established in 1636. Some experts said that having exotic dancers at funerals - and at weddings - was a form of fertility worship. ""In some local cultures, dancing with erotic elements can be used to convey the deceased's wishes of being blessed with many children,"" Huang Jianxing, a professor in Fujian Normal University's sociology department, told the Global Times.

The most eye-popping example of the exotic funeral occurred in Taiwan last year, when 50 women in lingerie pole-danced on moving black cars at the funeral of politician Tung Hsiang.

The Chiayi County Council speaker ""enjoyed a buzz"" so the funeral was designed to give him ""a happy departure,"" his son said, according to reports.

The protest saw a fair police presence, with senior official addressing the crowd to stay calm and trust the system.

It is the presence of traffic marshals in front of the school, which has kept its buses, taxis and other vehicles moving. The school has a compound to accommodate parents who come to pick their children, so they need not wait on the road. Parents are happy that they are allowed to park their two-wheelers near the school while they pick up or drop their kids. Many prefer to take public transport such as BEST buses or trains. However the parking of the buses on an arterial road during the school leaving hours adds to woes of commuters.

The presence of traffic marshals in front of the school has kept its buses, taxis and other vehicles moving

Due to the presence of traffic personnel around the school, four wheelers are not allowed to stop in front of its gate, which is exactly at the turn towards Dadar station. As the spot is always busy since it is a market area, there is hardly any space to walk.

There are several popular locations in and around Dadar that pull in the crowds such as the Siddhivinayak temple; the proximity of the school to the station also keeps the area near it busy. Parents and locals pointed out that on Tuesdays the traffic and crowds increase. Many people walk on Tuesday from the station to the temple. When this happens at the same time as the school leaving hours, the area gets crowded.

Major Problems

. Buses parked outside the school after it is over

. Regular heavy traffic around Dadar station that adds to the problems of parents

The 155-year-old St Stanislaus School, among the oldest educational institutions in the city, is located bang on Bandra's bustling Hill Road. But, despite slotting different school hours for primary and secondary sections, the traffic congestion here continues to be a giant headache for parents and local residents alike.

Autorickshaws, vans and other vehicles ferrying children crowd the entrance to the school buildings every morning and evening. A row of auto rickshaws can be seen parked on both sides of the road. As St Stanislaus School doesn't offer transportation services, parents depend on these vans and autos as a more reliable and economical mode of transport. While some are able to find space close to the gate, others have to park on the opposite side or on the adjacent road, adding to the chaos.

Children and parents crossing the road in the middle of traffic adds to the general chaos

As soon as the bell rings, students of the primary section race to the gate. The auto drivers then wait until they have found all the students who will be crammed into their vehicles, holding up traffic in the narrow lane. At the gate of the high school section, one can see a long line of students crossing over the divider to get to their autos parked on another road. Due to the absence of the traffic police at the junction, motorists and the bus drivers can be seen stopping traffic even when the traffic lights are green.

Barring the safety factor of the students who cross the road on their own, a majority of the parents who come to pick up their children have a scooter and tend to park right in front of the gate. Most of the parents don't stop for longer than a minute, but multiple scooters lined up waiting outside the gate results in a massive traffic congestion on the busy road.

An illegally operating auto crammed with schoolchildren are a common sight in front of the school gate

PrincipalSpeak

Principal Anna Correa said, ""At the beginning of the year, we had set up a traffic committee, mostly made up of willing parents and some teachers. Parent volunteers come in the morning, at the lunch break and after school to help at the gate. Along with the school, they have worked out a way to reduce congestion problems. For instance, no parking is allowed at the main gate and vehicles have to be parked either before or after the gate. The senior boys enter through gate number 3 and the younger ones use gate number 1. Our disadvantage is that our main gate is common for both St Peter's Church and the school. It is not possible for us to control people from coming in for church services. While the traffic department agreed to send two officers to help, they only send one in the morning as they are understaffed.""

Varsha Ashok Kaware, the headmaster's wife, had lodged a complaint with the police after the incident.

According to the First Information Report (FIR), on September 24, Kaware had punished five students for mischief at school. When the students complained to their parents, they rushed to the school to confront the headmaster. They then hurled abuses at Kaware and even beat him up.

Students and teachers of the Kannagi Government Girls Higher Secondary School at Villianur near here are living in constant fear of coming under the concrete slabs and girders as two floors in the south block of the 45-year-old building are in a dilapidated condition.

It becomes even more dangerous during the monsoon and the school administration has propped up wooden poles on the verandah fearing an imminent crash of the roof.

The school has over 800 children on its rolls studying from classes VI to XII.

While the students from classes VI to X are accommodated in a new block, 500 children of Plus One and Plus Two attend classes in the South Block. The school has another Thendral block, which is in a good condition. But the block is used by the Kasturba Gandhi Government College for Women.

The South Block was constructed in the 1970s and all the 14 classrooms and labs for physics, chemistry and biology used by students of classes XI and XII have developed cracks on the ceiling and the roofs are leaking owing to lack of maintenance.

""The weight of the bag of a Class III student studying in a CBSE school varies between 7 and 9 kg. This, according to the guidelines, should be between 2 and 3 kg. I personally weighed the bags of children studying in different classes, in different schools. I found that only in a few cases were the children carrying lighter bags,"" said Basudev Bhatt, convener of All Odisha Parents' Association.

In a letter to school and mass education minister Badri Narayan Patra, Bhatt called for strict implementation of the guidelines and asked the state government to carry out random checks in schools.

""Due to the heavy weight of the school bags, most children complain of pain in the back, shoulder and problems of posture. Long-term distortion of the spinal cord is also possible. If departments conduct raids at regular intervals, things may improve,"" said Bhatt, adding that states such as Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi were working actively to lighten students' bags.

Both More and Mahesh are tense as they are yet to get any concrete response from the institutes about the chances of their wards' admissions for the middle school in the next academic year.

""Admissions at the entry level are easy, but not for the in-between classes. Most schools are not giving us any concrete answer. They don't even entertain our enquiries over the phone.

""It was noted that on compliance of the DoE order, the school would be in enormous deficit, even if the basis of calculations of DoE, which though contrary to the Rule position, is accepted. This huge deficit might even lead to the unceremonious closure of the school known for imparting qualitative education for over six decades,"" said the letter sent by Bluebells School International, East of Kailash.

The school had planned to hike the fees to meet the burden of implementing the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission, but on August 1, DoE rejected the proposal after carrying out an audit. However, Bluebells claimed that DoE made an erroneous calculation of the institution's finances and the facts and figures submitted with documentary evidence were not acknowledged. ""DoE had been apprised of the adverse effects of the order. However, the request has yet not yielded any result,"" the letter to parents stated.

The school, which is sited on government land, maintained that the implementation of the pay commission pay scales in 2017-18, as per DoE's directives, had resulted in ""enormous additional"" financial burden. ""Hence, charging the fee on the basis of 2016-17, as per the (August) order, would make it impossible to pay salaries to the staff members, leave aside the payment of balance of arrears... and meeting other essential expenses in 2018-19.""

Bluebells has moved Delhi high court on DoE's order, maintaining that it does not need government permission to raise school fees.

Parents say schools ask their children to bring extra books apart from routine timetable as they rush to complete portions. This adds to the load that students are carrying in their bags. The Union human resource development ministry has asked states to come up with norms of their own or follow the Maharashtra or Telangana models.

A parent from a Central school said, ""My daughter is in primary and she carries hardly four textbooks, but the size of those books is quite big. While they use worksheets, the weight of her bag is too much.""

The parent added, ""The school initially asked us not to give food from home in order to reduce the weight of school bag but her school canteen doesn't give healthy food. They have noodles and Chinese dishes that have left with upset tummy. So she carries tiffin which adds to the weight of her bag.""

According to a government order of 2017, the prescribed weight of school bags should be between 1,800 gm and 3,425 gm. Maharashtra's policy is that the weight of a bag should not exceed 10 per cent of a student's weight.

Jayant Jain of non-profit Forum for Fairness in Education said, ""The state education department has only formed a rule but it has not yet been implemented. The implementation will happen only when action is taken against schools that flout the norms. Students still carry heavy bags. The department doesn't have enough manpower to carry out inspections.""

Swati Patil, another parent and activist who has filed a public interest litigation in Bombay High Court on this issue, said, ""We have learnt that only schools in urban areas are aware of these norms.""

However, there are some parents who feel the introduction of lockers by school has helped their kids to some extent. Lockers allow children to keep books in schools.

A parent of a Class V student of a civic-run school said, ""Earlier, my children used to carry their textbooks to school from home. But now their school has brought cupboards to keep the textbook. This has brought great relief to us as even we too have experienced discomfort carrying heavy school bags while dropping our children to school in the morning."""

Do you remember when getting an education was a simpler task? Go to school, study, write exams and move on to next class. While that may be oversimplifying it a bit, one must admit that students, parents and schools have their work cut out for them these days. While the pressure on students to perform, excel and succeed has been steadily increasing, parents too are scrambling to keep track of what is happening in their child's life. And school, where it all happens, not only needs to provide a challenging environment for the child to thrive but also ensure their safety.

Chirag Palande was having dinner with his wife one night when they began talking about an efficient way to be more involved in their daughters' academic progress, and everything else that was happening at school - tests, exams, last dates for fee payment, etc. The result was SchoolHandy.

This Mumbai-based app went live this year after Chirag spent a year-and-a-half doing research.

""We had done a survey to understand what schools need, and spoke to a group of parents as well. In some schools, there was no way to communicate with parents except having them attend PTAs, something which not all parents have the time for. Though some relay info through SMSes, many schools noted that parents don't check them,"" says 37-year-old Chirag.

SchoolHandy takes a stab at solving this communication gap by offering a gamut of services for an ""efficient schooling experience"". It is an end-to-end, cloud-based, parent updating app that covers it all: a child's safety and live school bus tracking, report cards and information dashboards, forums where the school can interact with parents, and a chat platform to get queries quickly answered.

Chirag notes that the app helps avoid any gaps in communication between the school and the parents. Take, for example, the live school bus tracking feature. With child safety becoming a growing concern in the country today, this feature helps to ensure the child is safe en route to or from school. This feature can be accessed by both the parents as well as school authorities.

SchoolHandy also provides a one-to-one chat platform and real-time updates on forum discussions between the school and the parents. This way, parents are kept in the loop and receive important notices, notifications and emergency alerts that schools send, which the children may fail to relay.

What's more, you can actually pay your child's school fees through the app too, besides monitoring your children's homework and accessing results after the annual exams. Its radio-frequency identification (RFID) based attendance system eliminates time-consuming roll call systems.

SchoolHandy installs hardware devices with a tracking mechanism in schools, which help record attendance and also alert parents that the kid has entered or left the classroom.

""In essence, with this app, parents will feel more involved while schools will have the relief of relaying vital information to them. The application is very simple to use,"" says Chirag. The app has 7,000 downloads so far on the Play Store.

Chirag has over 18 years of experience in marketing and innovation. He also founded brand 'Mobaccs', which sells VR glasses and remotes. He runs both SchoolHandy and Mobaccs; SchoolHandy is promoted, funded and managed by Mobaccs.

The SchoolHandy app is currently free to use for both schools and parents. The company, however, charges the school for its hardware such as GPS and attendance system and plans to add different features to the app like online shopping, kids insurance, loan for school fees, which will give them revenue in the future.

Around 80 Mumbai schools work with SchoolHandy at the moment. It is also working with four schools in Gujarat and three in Pune. The team of four is also in talks with more schools in Gujarat, Pune, and Hyderabad.

Running after schools and getting them on board was SchoolHandy's major challenge. Chirag says that in areas where these technologies are not that known or heard, this was even more difficult. However, demonstrations helped the team to convince the schools over time. The founder says they are open to customising offerings for the schools based on their needs.

A report by KPMG and Google says that the Indian edtech market will touch $1.96 billion by 2021, with close to 9.6 million users from $247 million and over 1.6 million users in 2016.

There are a few other players in this space like Applane Solutions, School Diary, Falcon, and Educhat.in, each focussed on specific services or offering slightly varied services.

According to Chirag, what gives SchoolHandy an edge over the competition is the fact that all the services are available on one platform.

SchoolHandy aims to cater to at least 100 schools across India by the end of three years, and also plans to add a feature for updates on cultural and other activities conducted in the schools - where photos, videos, can be shared. Creating a solid revenue model is also on the cards for this entrepreneur.

Apart from this, it plans to add a feature, where the books can be delivered at the doorstep with a nominal fee."

A toxic combination of poverty, poorly-paid teachers with anti-migrant prejudice and a lack of training on nonviolent discipline in government schools means marginalised children are significantly more likely to experience corporal punishment, said a new study.

Corporal punishment is a form of violence against children and is illegal in India.

Yet 80% of marginalised children report being punished by teachers, while an average of 43% said they were regularly beaten, up to three times a week, according to a new report by Agrasar, an NGO. In some schools the number of regularly beaten students rose to 88%.

The abuse does not end along with the school day. The majority of these children also experienced beatings at home (74%), while a similar proportion of parents admitting to doling out beatings at home (71%).

These are the findings of a survey from a randomised sample of 521 children and 100 parents in Gurugram, an area which experienced a 29% increase in migrant arrivals between 2000 and 2011, largely from poorer states, such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh.

However, ""given that the same mechanisms of economic deprivation and social exclusion are at work, the findings apply to disadvantaged children elsewhere in India"", the report said.

No positive outcomes of corporal punishment have been found, while it is established that physical and mental forms of abuse can have a detrimental effect on child health and wellbeing, including mental-health problems, behavioural issues and cognitive ability, according to the report.

The fear and stress associated with corporal punishment can create ""school-phobia"", leading to increased dropouts, low-retention rates and poor academic scores, significantly impacting on education outcomes, the report said. Children who have experienced such abuse are also more likely to display criminal behaviour, commit violent crimes as adults and suffer from substance abuse.

In 1992, India became one of 128 countries to agree to the United Nations (UN) Convention of Rights of the Child 1989, which outlawed school corporal punishment and required the government under article 28(2) to ensure that ""school discipline is administered in a manner consistent with the child's human dignity"".

The Right to Education Act 2009 further enshrined child safety in schools, stating no child ""shall be subjected to physical punishment or mental harassment"".

Yet, despite such legal protections, recent government studies have found the problem persists. Social structures enforcing the normalcy of corporal punishment remain pervasive in Indian society.

Teachers do not appear to discriminate on the basis of age when it comes to meting out corporal punishment. Both younger and older children alike experienced similarly severe forms of punishment and ""almost on a daily basis"", the report found.

The only difference is that younger children are more likely to experience physical punishment, compared to older children who are more likely to suffer from verbal abuse.

""Physical punishments were given to us when we were young. Now we get mostly verbal punishments, for example we are being ridiculed for our mistakes in front of the class,"" said one girl respondent in the 8th standard.

Marginalised children were found to experience corporal punishment more frequently, with 88% of those surveyed reporting they are regularly beaten at school, up to three times a week. This is ""significantly higher than then average and does not even include verbal abuse"", the report said.

Many children reported verbal and physical abuse on a daily basis, with at least one child reporting he experienced physical punishment ""two times a day minimum"".

As a result, many have become accustomed to such experiences as part of the school routine and fabric of their education experience--71% of children believed it's okay to be beaten up ""for a reason"", having been taught its for ""their own good"" and ""necessary"".

The types of physical and mental punishment distributed by teachers vary in levels of pain, with slapping, ear-pulling, denial of bathroom use and forced periods of standing mentioned as ""not so serious"" punishment forms.

This can increase to more painful types, such as a teacher caning palms and calves, striking the knuckles with a duster or scales and beating backs and heads with their hands, all of which are the ""most common forms of physical punishment"".

Many schools keep a dedicated stick to beat children, the report found.

Cases of brutal punishment, combined with ""psychological torture"", were also narrated by the surveyed children.

Banging students' heads against a wall was turned into ""a game"" by one teacher, with several children recounting that he would often pretend three or four times that he was going to bang the child's head against the wall before actually doing it.

Mental abuse is even more frequently handed out, which for the children of migrant workers in Gurugram often consist of derogatory and racist slurs which many children do not even recognise ""constitute a form of corporal punishment"".

Referencing their low socioeconomic status, these children are labelled as ""Bihari"" or ""Bengali""--denigrating and catch-all terms for any non-locals, regardless of their actual state-of-origin.

These slurs are often followed up with insults such as ""donkey"", ""good for nothing"", ""uneducated"", ""illiterate"" and comments that they had had ""a bad upbringing"", which tend to affect older children the most.

Girl students are subjected to relatively more verbal harassment than boys, often framed in sexist language which instill ""toxic gender stereotypes"". Teachers were found to often resort to comments about their looks, age and weight, ""recommending"" marriage instead of education and minimising their capabilities and skills compared to male peers.

Both male and female teachers were found to mete out corporal punishment in a ""ritualised and uniform way"", with marginal differences in the severity and frequency of punishment they enforced.

While many teachers were found to slap or hit students, some punished students ""with brutal and cruel violence that requires creativity and premeditation"".

Almost all parents (91%) approve of teachers using corporal punishment and use it at home themselves. However, this figure is likely to be higher, as parents tend to not consider ""mild"" forms of physical abuse and verbal harassment as a form of corporal punishment.

Trapped in abusive environments

""A complex mix of social and structural factors perpetuates corporal punishment in our classrooms,"" the report found.

While wealthier, better-educated children are not immune to receiving, disadvantaged children are exposed to a number of influential risk factors which increase their likelihood of experiencing corporal punishment.

Low-income families, living in poor conditions and often with both illiterate parents working long hours in the informal sector, are unable to properly support their children's education.

Absence during the day, followed by exhaustion in the evening, means parent's ""emotional resources"" are largely consumed by their struggle for survival.

Children must manage their own homework and school activities themselves, often in a troubled environment ""characterised by maltreatment and neglect"" brought about by poverty and ""existential"" stress.

Even mothers who were ""homemakers"" in Gurugram were found to interact with their children ""very little"" over school matters. They assumed that the child would bring up any serious issues with her if there were any and relied on elder siblings plus the child's ""own motivation to pursue their studies and education"".

Failure to submit homework, poor test-performance and school absences are major reasons for receiving corporal punishment and which end up hurting children from low socioeconomic backgrounds the most.

Even if they desired, parents are often unable to move their child from the free local government school to another, lacking the financial means to entertain other options.

Migrant children often become the target of ""disdain and contempt"" by teachers who withhold empathy and support. Teachers punish children for their inability to articulate themselves as per the teacher's ""expectations"", as bad language (commonly used at home by both parents and children) and poor language skills enter the classroom.

Periods of absence as migrant children return to their native state for long stretches of time, or even accompany their parents to work, further antagonise teachers, the report said. Upon their return to school, children are unfairly punished for their parents' decision to travel.

Such teacher attitudes are a result of sustained social stigma attached to the less-educated, migrant population, with discrimination against the ""labour class"" rubbing off onto their children.

Teachers feel it is not worthwhile to teach migrant children as ""they will only be cleaning someone's house later anyways"", the report found.

They believe the children are unable to perform well in school and think rationally, as teachers see poverty as ""a genetic predisposition"" which means the children are unworthy of education. They fail to understand that a lack of opportunity and access to resources is why they are struggling with formal education.

The social divide is also keeping parents and teachers from interacting and establishing a working relationship, further impeding the child's education.

Poorly-paid, over-worked and under-resourced teachers operating in sub-par working conditions further adds to the problem, as teachers ""vent out their anger and act aggressively towards students"" and ""rarely show awareness for professional conduct"".

Poor governance, such as a lack of Corporal Punishment Monitoring Cells--set up by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights to ensure the ban on corporal punishment is enforced--means unethical teacher conduct is not always properly dealt with, the report said.

The danger is that a toxic combination of all the above-mentioned factors means children are arbitrarily subjected to forms of violence, with no repercussions for teachers already operating with minimal oversight.

Children were found to be punished for ""normal childlike behaviours"" like going to the bathroom, talking in class and during breaks, running around the school yard and fighting with other children.

The cost of corporal punishment

Around 53% of children surveyed never tell their parents if they have been punished at school, undermining a ""trusted relationship"" between parent and child. This also means many children are internalising potentially traumatic experiences, with severe consequences for their mental health and wellbeing, the report found.

Perceiving that learning and corporal punishment ""go hand in hand"", children become desensitised to the violence they see everyday and even lose the ability to identify milder types of physical and mental harassment.

As violence goes unrecognised, resistance builds which in turn can lead to the severity of the violence increasing. Children who experience violence are also more likely to ""become violent perpetrators themselves"".

There is a risk that through the prevalence of corporal punishment, schools are teaching children ""on a large scale that violence is okay"" and is contributing to levels of violence in Indian society at large, the report said."

But if education is diverted only for financial benefit, there will be less space for formation of students. Surprisingly, some educational institutions are heading only for financial profit. Profit is priority. Students are secondary. This has placed education upside down. Instead of learning lessons for life, students learn only how to pay fees of different kinds from January to December. Financial burdens are increasing day by day. I say this in regard to post selection exam trauma of Cl. X and Cl. XII students in some schools across Nagaland.

Selection exams for Cl. X and Cl. XII are over in most of the schools in Nagaland. But after exams, there appear various fee collections. I still wonder as to why some schools have to collect money under numerous reasons or agreement with parents. Some of the best examples are Caution/security deposit, Coaching fee, Re-exam fee (if failed in 1/2 subjects), etc. Such collections of money have become normal routine in some schools. Parents accept this illegal routine blindly because it cost the future of their children. Many parents must be paying such amount ranging from rupees 6000 to 10,000 or even more after selection exam. The amount is high enough for many poor parents. Students who passed selection exam pay lesser amount because they are intelligent enough. With-held students are forced to pay more as per the number of failed subjects. In other words, payment is done according to the performance of students. Is this a healthy education? Is money equivalent to intellectual calibre of students? Do students perform better when they are forced to pay money to the School? Do Students pass their examination just because they have paid the said amount to the School? I do not think it so. The Principals and heads of Institutions are free to think otherwise. But it does not suit well under the banner of quality education. Parents are worried about the future of the children, while the school is worried about collection of money for various reasons. Yet, most money collections after selection exam are illegal and unnecessary. Schools must collect only what is necessary (e.g. Board Exam fee). What is not necessary must not be collected. The aim of getting good result need not be substituted by collection of money.

One student said that he has to pay rupees 200 per failed subject to re-write the paper. Another student said that they were asked to pay rupees 50 per subject. All the more, some students were asked to pay rupees 3000 per failed subject with the promise of getting back the amount if they succeed in board exam. This is not true education at all! What if they fail, who takes the money? It is a shame that some educational institutions see failure and success in term of money. If rupees 3000 per student is collected in the name of Coaching fee, multiply the amount according to the number of students in Cl. X and Cl. XII. Rupees 3000×150 students=4,50,000/- only. May be the whole amount is paid to those teachers who take extra classes to maintain good reputation of the school. All the same, students have already paid 12 months tuition fee. I hope there is no 13 month in the yearly calendar of the school.

Caution/security deposits are collected from students (rupees 2000×150 students=300000/- only). If a student absent himself or herself from coaching class, rupees 100/200 per day is deducted from it. Is this not a funny education? I am sure no school pays back the amount with interest after holding the money (7/8 month) till the declaration of result. Deduction takes place, but interest is not paid to students. One side of the coin does not match the other side. Are we heading for 'financial education' or 'education of students'? There is much hollowness in our educational system.

Few points for further reflection:-

If students have paid 12 months tuition fee, do they still have to pay coaching fee?

If they are to pay caution deposit, does the school return the amount with interest after holding the amount for 7/8 months?

Can student pass his/her exam by paying re-exam fee (in case re-exam is held under payment as practiced is some school?)

Is money equivalent to success and failure?

Are we heading for financial education rather than formation of students?

The day to day running of educational institutions are solely under the care and guidance of the principals or heads of institution. All rules and regulations in schools are aimed to discipline and form students in the best possible means. But many schools have numerous untold laws and rules like the above mentioned realities. Let no school become institute of 'educational extortion.' There are better ways of succeeding in life. Education is just one way. There are better means of forming students rather than imposing financial burdens on the weak shoulders of parents and students. The above dirty face of education needs some cleansing for the betterment of students. All schools do not come under this dirty blanket. All the same, what happens in schools and colleges are best known by the Principals, Parents and Students. In the process of aiming for best result, let us not deform young students. Change can best begin in schools. Let us not chain the expected change in our schools.

How do I tell my family I am gay? How do I put on a condom during sex? Madhavi Jadhavi founded ThatMate, a platform that understands all your questions and aims to address social issues and mental health. All this from Satara, a small town in Maharashtra.

Let's admit it, sex as a topic is still taboo with most Indians. Growing up, how often have you turned to the internet just because your parents found it awkward to discuss sex with you openly? In many households, it is not spoken of at all, despite how important it is to educate one's child on safe sex practices.

How many of your teachers skipped the entire chapter on 'human reproduction' in school because they were embarrassed to talk about it? Or, worse, how many of you were forbidden to talk about periods with boys or loudly in public?

A good education may not necessarily translate into awareness because of the stigma and taboos that exist in Indian society. This is why awareness of social issues and mental health is important at different levels.

Here's where ThatMate steps in. Founded by Madhavi Jadhav, it's a platform that aims to reduce the myths associated with sexual and mental health through engaging tools such as comic books, cartoon characters, workshops, online forums, and counselling.

Madhavi tells me that she's always been a rebel at heart. Raised in a small village in Satara district, Maharashtra, it was not unusual to witness girls getting married once they started menstruating.

""I was working with Shell after completing my education, and during this time, I realised I wanted to work for people rather than a big money-making firm. I decided to quit my job and shift to Satara. I explored many places and realised that there was a dire need for education and awareness among children as well as adults. I reached out to some of my friends and with their help, conducted workshops and seminars for children between the ages of seven and 10 about ""good touch-bad touch"" and safety. The workshop received a wonderful response and this prompted me to start ThatMate,"" she says.

ThatMate aims to bring topics that have been long-considered normal and commonplace in most Western societies.

""One trait that I want to work on is my ability to convince parents, teachers, and other adults to allow me to engage their children on different subjects. We want to encourage dialogue to dispel misnomers, misunderstandings, and ignorant stereotypes that can, at best, cause isolation and further prejudice and, at worst, lead to abuse and even death. However, I do not want to use that fear as a tool to convince adults that our mission is important. I would like to convince them through logic and other means. Fear is not effective, so I need to be able to bring in a constructive, concise dialogue, with the ability to listen and absorb, reformat my tactics and understand how to engage my audience better,"" adds Madhavi.

ThatMate uses a friendly, open, gender-neutral, culturally sensitive approach. It has collaborated with five schools in Satara and will engage with 500 schools in the Sangli district reaching out to approximately 2,00,000 students. It has reached over 13,000 youths through Sarahah (an anonymous social media app) and has conducted 24 Facebook live sessions.

Madhavi has presented ThatMate at platforms like Tedx and LeanIn India. It has also been incubated at Deshpande Foundation, UnLtd India and Atal Incubation Centre, Banasthali, a NITI Aayog initiative.

The startup is bootstrapped with the online platform following a ""freemium"" model.

Madhavi explains, ""Certain services are open to people who have agreed to pay for them. Those that have the free tier will be given advertising to help subsist the costs. This is primarily true for the forum where ads will be offered along with certain videos and services. Our workshops will be on a service model where we will ask for funds directly from the organisation, or through other organisations in the form of sponsors or donors.

Comic book sales are offered at tiered levels depending on the quality of the comics themselves and sponsored outreach. We have special pages for select advertising to reduce the overall cost of the comics to our demographic.""

The response to various programmes has been encouraging. Madhavi shares with us a few quotes from parents and teachers.

""I was abused by my neighbour when I was in the second standard. I didn't know about it until I was a part of the Safe Unsafe touch workshop."" - Student

""I now understand the difference between gender and sex. Also, I used to get scared of transgender people before. After the workshop, I have realised that they are also a part of society and should be treated equally."" - Parent

Madhavi is happy about starting up in a small town. ""The operational costs are lower and the acceptance rate is higher,"" she points out.

ThatMate's future plans include more workshops and partnerships with leading schools in Satara, Solapur, and Kolhapur.

""We will collaborate with NGOs like Tathapi, Stree Shakti Sansthan, Goonj and Enfold. Our immediate need is to raise funds to enable us to objectively achieve our goals. Our long-term goals include establishing a base of operations, hiring a technical team for developing applications, partnering with developers in the gaming and animation sectors, looking for partners in private and government areas, completing our comic book series and offering them in a variety of local languages, and growing our knowledge base with more subject matter experts. We want to reach out and change the lives of over one million children in the next five years, with an equivalent number of adults,"" says Madhavi."

Amitesh was one among the many students of Bethany High, Koramangala, who took part in the Digital Detox Champion Award. His essay goes on to end with, ""If we leave these games, we can spend more time outside and spend more quality time studying... This is how digital detox helps us.""

The Digital Detox initiative was launched in July, where children were told that regulating their use of the internet and gadgets could help them gain rewards and recognition. The management, students and parents agreed upon a policy that the parents will share the child's electronic usage time with the school. Dr Akash Ryall, director of Bethany High, says, ""Some parents approached us and told us they were struggling with having a conversation with their kids. They requested the school to intervene. When we researched digital addiction, we found that it can be worse than substance addiction.""

Rewards were distributed across three categories: Those who gave up their gadgets completely, those who used it only on weekends and those who used gadgets for only one hour every day. ""We announced the results during the general assembly so as to motivate more students to take part in it. And for those who didn't take part, we will be holding another round. The winners will be declared at the end of the school year, in March,"" says Dr Akash, adding that across seven institutions, around 100 students were given the award.

Beginning early

Besides schools, parents too are turning to digital detox programmes. In April, city-based mother Shalini Srivastava sent her 12-year-old daughter for a detox programme meant for kids aged 10-15 years old. Since it was during the summer vacation, Shalini didn't want her daughter watching TV or surfing the internet for hours. ""I thought it would be a good way for her to indulge in different activities. Once the programme was done, my daughter took an interest in gardening,"" says Shalini.

Ishwarya Kumar Ahmed and Sudhalini Devadason, co-founders and directors of Upturn Learning Solutions LLP, which launched the initiative, soon started getting requests from parents to launch the programme for younger children too. The duo introduced a junior slot (for five-eight year olds) for the second season of the initiative, which will begin towards the end of November.

During season 1, the programme was conducted over the course of eight days. Season two, however, has been planned over a span of 12 weeks. ""We wanted the programme to be more immersive. The kids will get a chance to recreate the famous Malgudi Days and develop an interest in reading and folklore, learn Kalaripayattu, take part in DIY projects and even be part of a fun offline science experiment,"" explains Ishwarya.

Plugging out

In the first week of October, Time Out From Plugins, an initiative started by city-based mother Tejaswi Uthappa, was launched at Delhi Public School - Bangalore North. The idea was simple: To get students to pledge to time out from plug-ins. Tejaswi recalls instances where parents in her circle would tell her they don't see themselves in their children's lives anymore or have to compete with a screen for their attention. ""The idea was never to abstain. Instead, by logging out of devices for two hours, we could prevent misuse and spend that time fostering real world connections with our loved ones,"" she says. Besides a social media campaign, more schools and hangouts are being approached in order to spread the word."

The school administration has claimed otherwise and said the structure was completely safe.

Parents of dozens of students studying in the Brahmand-based Rainbow International School were wary of the weather shed constructed a few months back by the school. The wary parents were shocked to see the temporary structure when they visited the premise recently and feared it could be a huge safety hazard for students who access it regularly for extra-curricular activities.

""The shed could collapse or some of the rods may give way and lead to serious injuries to the students,"" said a concerned parent.

While few parents had initially approached the school regarding the same, they later alerted the India-Wide Parents Association seeking their assistance in dealing with the issue. The association sought images of the structure from the parents and once convinced, immediately wrote to various education departments asking them to look into this matter urgently as the school is set to reopen on Friday.

""Building a temporary shed in a school was a violation of several safety norms including the child safety guidelines among others. The temporary structure could be a safety hazard for students who access the terrace area for extra-curricular activities. We have written to the NCPCR, the education minister, the Maharashtra State Child Right's Commission and the HRD ministry to conduct an inspection and take the necessary action,"" said Anubha Sahai, president of this association.

When contacted, the school authorities claimed the work on the shed was constructed in accordance with the safety norms.

""The safety of our students is our first priority and the structure was put up as a shield against heat and rain. The structure is extremely safe and the area is used only for dance and extra-curricular activities. We are surprised the parents are worried about this. They should have come to us first,"" said Amrita Pereira, spokesperson of the school.

In our run-up to Women's Entrepreneurship Day, we focus on women from non-metro cities who have battled many odds to become entrepreneurs. 'Small Towns, Big Dreams' pays tribute to their grit, determination and hard work. We start off with myskoolbus.

Born in a conservative Marwari family in Gujarat, Pooja Khemka, Co-founder of myskoolbus, deems herself lucky to have parents who stood by her in every endeavour. Despite some opposition, she joined college and later convinced her parents to allow her to study chartered accountancy.

Entrepreneurship happened to her quite by chance. Marriage and motherhood happened and a specific incident changed her life forever. Once, she was stuck in traffic and missed her son's school bus. She couldn't track the whereabouts of the bus as she was unable to reach the transport manager on the phone. The bus was on the move and it was a harrowing few moments until she located the bus.

These tense moments sowed the seeds for myskoolbus, a school bus GPS-tracking application for parents that she started with her friend Preeti Agarwal. Pooja recounts, ""Has anyone ever thought of the plight of a mother who is eagerly waiting for the arrival of her kids from school and they don't show up on time? I have personally experienced that and the incident left me traumatised.""

Started in 2013 in Ahmedabad, myskoolbus leverages advancements in information technology and telecommunications like GPS mobile tracking, radio frequency identification (RFID), cloud computing and mobile apps to address different pain points. It gives real-time visibility to parents and institute authorities while alerting them on any deviation from the defined thresholds. In short, it ensures the safety of your children, while on the move.

Pooja explains why starting up in Ahmedabad was a good choice. ""I am a homemaker, and for me to balance both family and business was very much essential. Apart from that, controlling costs like lower rents and cheaper resources since we are bootstrapped played a big factor. In addition, relationship and trust are key drivers of awareness and purchase in the small cities. I believe if you are able to carve a niche in a small town, you can corner the market by being the only one in the area,"" she says.

Being a woman entrepreneur based out of a non-metro comes with its own set of challenges. Pooja bemoans the lack of support from local media and feels that startup stories come mostly from metros. ""Also, convincing the clients that women-led startups can deliver long-term quality services at a competitive price was difficult. Communicating and convincing transport contractors and drivers was a major challenge,"" she points out.

""Often, the men would come and tell me in Gujarati, ben aa tamaru kaam nathi (Sister, this is not your work), and I used to be upset to hear that. But with the support of my parents and husband, I overcame situations with ease to provide effective solutions to my clients.""

The sheer lack of technology-led pitching events in a city like Ahmedabad is also a major impediment when it comes to networking. However, Pooja is happy with the mentoring support myskoolbus has received from the Cherie Blair Foundation - London, Facebook's SheLeadsTech programme and the Kalorex Group.

Within a short period, the response has been encouraging. ""When we started, there were many people who challenged our venture for four months saying you cannot do it. It's not a woman's job. In fact, some school authorities also took us lightly. But now the naysayers have been converted into satisfactory clients,"" says Pooja.

Future plans for myskoolbus includes working on transit surveillance with AI support to understand different situations that can arise during the journey like fights among students, misbehaviour or others. It is also planning to venture into individual women and child safety and tracking solutions that includes wristbands, safety bags, among others."

They claimed they had complained to the school management at the time of the incident but the authorities allegedly refused to take any legal action against the accused students. Police have registered a case against two students under POCSO Act.

Police said the alleged molestation took place during an inter-school competition held at the Greater Noida-based private school where students from different institutions had come to participate. The victim, who is a Class VIII student of a different school, had allegedly got into an argument with two senior students of the host school. After a heated exchange of words, the two students allegedly took the junior student to the washroom and molested him.

The 14-year-old boy's parents approached the police and alleged that the Greater Noida school had refused to take action against the two senior students. The police have, however, registered their complaint under Section 323 of the IPC for voluntarily causing hurt and under provisions of sections 7 and 8 of the Protection of Children Against Sexual Offenses (POCSO) Act.

The school management told TOI that the accused could be seen on CCTV taking the 14-year-old boy to the washroom. They said the authorities had conducted an internal investigation in which it was revealed that the junior students had been beaten up after he made a racial slur at the two senior students.

""The victim student had used a racial comment against the accused, which triggered the fight. After the incident came to light, both the victim and the accused students were made to confront each other. The allegations of molestation are baseless,"" a spokesperson of the school said."

State chief electoral officer Anand Kumar has asked district electoral officers (DEOs) to get letters of pledge signed by the students, especially of private schools in cities and towns, so that the voting percentage increases in urban areas.

In the last polls, government school students were asked to fill in the letters of pledge, which led to an increase in voting percentage. For the present assembly polls, Kumar wrote to DEOs last month to involve private school students in the exercise organised under the Systematic Voters' Education and Electoral Participation (SVEEP) programme, an election commission initiative.

In what is called urban apathy, many city people enrolled in the voters' list do not go to booths to exercise their franchise. Students of private schools will be roped in to nudge their parents and family members to vote, poll officials said.

The parents have been asked to post selfies with their children after voting, showing fingers with indelible ink marks. Three best selfies will be selected for felicitation on the National Voters' Day on January 25, 2019.

""Last time more than 65 lakh letters of pledge were filled in the state. This time the letters of pledge will be filled in from November 12 and submitted to district electoral officers by November 21,"" Kumar said in his letter.

In the 2008 assembly elections the polling percentage was 66.49%, which increased to 75.67% in 2013 in Rajasthan.

District electoral officers will appoint district education officers as nodal officers for the work, who will coordinate with SVEEP committees and schools, the letter said.

Though district education officers do not have direct control over private educational institutions, electoral officers will coordinate with English-medium schools to get the letters of pledge filled in.

""An orientation programme can also be organised at the private schools for the students, so that they can understand the action plan and get inspired to get the letters of pledge filled,"" the letter said."

In the absence of state guidelines to regulate school admissions, the process of enrolling students promises to be stressful for city parents.

Admission process for the academic year of 2019 have commenced with schools following their own timetable. This means parents are running around to fill application forms, attend in-person interviews and take school tours. Keeping track of the multiple timetables is a challenge.

""With the growing competition, one is not sure of making it to a top school and most parents apply in multiple schools. Since there is absolutely no uniformity in admission schedules, there is a lot of time and money lost in the process along with the additional pressure [of a child making the cut] till one gets through a school,"" said Andheri-based Aditi Singh, who is looking to enrol her three-year-old daughter into school this year.

In the past, several organisations and parent groups, like the PTA United Forum, have written to the state education department to come up with a timeframe within which schools across the Mumbai metropolitan region (MMR) can conduct admissions. However, in the absence of any such guidelines from the state government, each school follows its own schedule and process.

""Each school has its own requirements depending on the board it offers and other factors which make it difficult to regulate admissions,"" said an official at the state education department who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Admission schedules for city schools vary depending on the board they offer students. Most Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) schools and those offering the Indian Certificate for Secondary Education (ICSE) conduct admissions between October and February. Those offering the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE), International Baccalaureate (IB) and International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) begin admissions in August and the process often goes on until January. Most prominent schools under the state board begin their admissions process between December and January.

Prominent city schools charge anywhere between ₹500 and ₹3,000 for an admission form. Some schools also charge to arrange school tours before parents apply. Arundhati Chavan, president of the PTA United Forum said, ""With admissions for the next year beginning this early, parents are under immense stress. Many schools conduct interviews with parents and they have to keep up with all the different schedules while they have a full-time job.""

Psychiatrist Dr Sagar Mundada said admission-related anxiety is common in mothers during this season. ""We get many patients who are often anxious about getting through a particular school. Most of this pressure comes through competition with peers and the status attached to a 'good' school,"" said Mundada."

Srinagar: Taking cognizance of reports about some schools indulging in single-point-sale of books and uniforms, Private Schools Association of Jammu and Kashmir (PSAJK) today directed all of its member schools to remain fair and transparent in their dealings and allow books and uniforms to be sold in open market.

The Association in a meeting took strict notice of some reports in media and said that such a behaviour wherein a parent is forced to purchase books, uniforms and other school items from a particular shop or from school itself, won't be tolerated. ""This violates our ethics and principles and I am sure every school adheres to rules. Although there are some black sheep against whom we will take strict action,"" said G N Var Chairman PSAJK. ""We have decided to take steps to take care of such a problem.""

The Association has instructed all of its schools to allow books and uniforms to be sold in the open market. ""Parents can purchase books, uniforms and other items from any shop and there won't be any directive from any school. Plus there won't be any exorbitant rate on the items and everything will be priced reasonably,"" said Var.

The Association also held a meeting with DC Srinagar wherein it was decided that both the sides will take every possible steps to stop the practice. ""The administration will do its job and we will also prevent any abuse of power from our side. Our primary concern is the welfare of students and parents, which will be maintained,"" said Var.

The Association has also formed a committee of educational experts who will prescribe standard books, which can be used in the schools. ""There have been reports that some schools sell low-quality books at high rates just creating doubly whammy for parents. In order to stop this practice we will be coming out with a list of high-quality books that can be prescribed to students based on their merit,"" said Var.

The Association has called for help from the general public to help in streamlining the sector. ""If anybody feels that he is being fleeced by any school or forced to buy books or uniforms from any particular shop, he can contact us and we will immediately take action in this regard,"" said Var.

The Association said that most of the schools adhere to the agreed principles and maintain their standards, however, it is often one dirty fish that spoils the whole pond. The association appealed people to remain cautious of such schools and said that any person can register their complaint on Association Phone No 7889578450.

The JJB had in December last year declared that the juvenile, who was over 16 years at the time of the alleged murder, would face trial as an adult. It had taken cognisance of the amended Juvenile Justice Act, which says any juvenile in the age group of 16-18 can be treated as an adult in case of heinous offences.

But the juvenile's father had challenged the order before a sessions court, which had upheld the JJB order. The father had then filed a petition in the high court. On October 11, the high court had ruled that the case be referred back to the JJB for re-consideration and had dubbed the process adopted by the board for its judgment ""illegal"".

Sushil Tekriwal, counsel for the Class II student's parents, said on Thursday they had countered the ground on which the HC had passed its October 11 order. ""We have filed a petition in SC challenging the HC order,"" said Tekriwal.

While passing the order, the HC had considered the juvenile suspect's submission that they had not been given a copy of the social and psychological report, on the basis of which the juvenile had been declared an adult.

Apart from terming the JJB's process illegal, the HC had also directed the board to take the help of a psychologist. The SC petition challenged this, pointing out that the JJ Act clearly mentioned that seeking the help of an experienced psychologist or other experts for such an assessment was optional and not mandatory.

""The HC must have formed an independent medical board to corroborate the views of the two courts before passing the impugned order,"" the petition highlights.

Following the HC order, the JJB in Gurugram has started a fresh assessment of the juvenile. On Thursday, he was given a personal hearing by the board, which will now make an assessment. The JJB will also constitute a board on November 3 for medical and psychological assessment of the juvenile suspect.

The Class II student, whose parents moved the SC on Thursday, was found with his throat slit and oozing blood inside the school bathroom in September last year. Within hours of the incident, Gurugram police had arrested a bus conductor. Following a persistent demand by the aggrieved family, the Haryana government had handed over the probe to the CBI. The investigation agency arrested a Class XI student of the same school for the alleged murder and gave a clean chit to the bus conductor."

Interestingly, Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education (KITE) has begun a massive audit to ensure the schools are fully utilising the facilities. According to the parents, the District Education Officer during a recent visit found the school did not comply with the rules. R Sivankutty Nair, the parent of a student, said the school authorities shifted the classroom to wreak vengeance on the class teacher of 9A. ""The move also prevented the students from getting quality education.

It is a blatant violation of human rights and the students are being denied basic education. The government has spent several crore on setting up a hi-tech facility in schools.

Badarsaman, headmaster of the school, while refuting the charge said the equipment could not be installed in some classrooms owing to the unavailability of technicians who have expertise in installation. ""There are some assigned people. Once the technicians shift it to the recently-constructed building, all students will be able to use the facilities.

But teachers of Chinmaya Vidyalaya, Alappuzha don't seem to agree. It seems like 'good food' means boiled rice for them, and everything else is, well, not so great.

Students say the school, one of the prominent private higher secondary schools in the district, has made boiled rice mandatory for lunch for all students and has instructed them not to bring other food items for lunch more than twice a month - including rice-based dishes like idli and dosa.

""Sick parents"" are excused to pack something else for his/her ward for a day or two, but they must inform the concerned class teacher beforehand.

The school has also formed ""inspection teams"" consisting of two or three teachers, who visit classes during the lunch breaks almost every day, to check if students are following the order.

""They visit our class almost everyday to see what we are eating. If somebody is seen eating something else, they are asked why they have not brought rice and our parents are contacted over the phone. If the student repeats it, he/she is scolded by the teachers,"" a class VI student said.

However, school principal Dr S Lali refuted the claim. ""(Only) Non-vegetarian food items are strictly prohibited in the school. The teachers randomly visit classes to check if anybody is bringing meat to class. Biscuits, oily snacks, and aerated drinks are also not promoted in school. (Otherwise) Teachers are only asked to check if students are eating properly or not,"" she said.

She also said there are no other food restrictions in place in the school. ""Earlier, students of junior classes used to waste food and when asked they used to say they were packed things that they don't like. Some parents, looking for an easy way out, pack them items from the previous night after heating them. This monotony triggers a dislike towards food among them, she said.""

""No practice is in place that a parent should alert the class teacher for giving them something other than rice. But they bring chappati, idli, puttu or dosa all five days and rice is completely avoided,"" she went on to underline.

Not all parents agree. Stating that she usually contacts her daughter's class teacher when she has not packed rice, the mother of a class VII student said: ""No parent will purposefully give poor food to their ward and I don't think it is unfair to consider their tiffin preferences. Also, is it not a crime to be scolded before the whole class?""

'Rice is not special'

So, does the consumption of boiled rice make big a difference to the health of the child? Is it more nutritional than other popular food items?

No, says Dr Mumtaz Khalid Ismail, Kochi-based consultant clinical nutritionist.

""Rice is not mandatory. Calorie wise, there is only a negligible amount of difference between rice and wheat. Hence, there is no harm in giving them chappatis or curd rice for lunch. Packed lunch of a schoolgoer should meet one-third of his/her total daily calorie and protein requirements. They shouldn't skip breakfast or lunch but that doesn't mean rice should be force-fed. A balanced diet should be the only priority,"" she notes.

But, Dr Mumtaz agreed that it is better to avoid monotony and bring variety into the child's food habits.

Parents, though, ask how is this possible if the school authorities keep insisting on a particular food regime.

School principal Dr Lali said, ""If children prefer idli or dosa, let them have it. But it can't be permitted with just chutney or sambar; healthy side dishes like 'aviyal' or raw vegetables is a must.""

Parents' choice matters

But can a school possibly dictate what the students can eat and cannot?

""The school has no right to do so. Children of school-going age are minors and thus their guardians can decide what to cook for their children. Such a decision will be valid only if it is unanimously passed by the Parents Teachers Association,"" said advocate G Harikumar of District Court, Alappuzha.

Another parent stressed that no such meeting has happened yet at Chinmaya school. ""Usually, PTA meets happen class-wise. Can't talk for others but they haven't asked my opinion in this matter yet. Though I can understand the intention behind such a decision, I don't think all parents and kids will be okay with it. Rice is Kerala's staple food, but there are many who prefer other cereals over rice,"" the parent, whose child studies in Class X, said.

Pupils who spent their formative years abroad are allowed to bring other food for lunch, the principal confirmed.

That is another sore point. ""Are they not concerned about the nutrition needs of those students? If rules are implemented, everybody should be treated equally. Aren't such exemptions and preferences unfair?"" another parent asks."

""Her parents tried to get her admission into many private schools of the city, but they all refused. While the other schools did not give the parents any explanation, one private school categorically told them that they cannot give admission to her as she is a rape victim,"" Chauhan said.

The girl had been allegedly gang raped by four students of her former boarding school on August 14. Although she had informed school authorities, they tried to hush it up. The matter came to light in September, when the girl thought she was pregnant and informed her elder sister, following which Dehradun's senior superintendent of police (SSP) Nivedita Kureti was tipped off.

The four boys were taken into custody and the boarding school's director, principal, administration officer, his wife and hostel caretaker were also arrested for alleged destruction of evidence and trying to hush up the matter.

The CBSE had discontinued the school's affiliation as its response to a show cause notice was ""evasive and insensitive"", according to reports.

Advocate Chauhan has written to senior superintendent of Uttarakhand police as well, demanding an investigation into how the girl's identity was revealed.

""The biggest question is that how did the school get to know the child was a rape victim? By law, her identity has to be protected. We want the police to investigate who is behind this,"" she said.

The school authorities were not immediately available for the comment.

Chauhan also demanded the cancellation of the school's affiliation by Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).

However, regional officer of CBSE Ranveer Singh said he has not received any such letter.

""It is the school's prerogative to give admission or not. There are many factors which influence a school's decision. It is not right on the parts of parents and the lawyer to make such allegations,"" Singh said.

Chauhan said the ""defeated"" parents of the girl wanted to shift her out of Dehradun from the next academic session, but were ""left with no choice"" and got her admitted to a school in a different state.

However, their joy was shortlived as the work, which began after an assurance by MLA Aravind Limbavalli, stopped the very next day with only the worst bits of the road being patched up in a hurried manner. On Tuesday, the situation was back to normal with the road flooded and the school un-approachable, parents rued.

Located just outside the boundaries of the Kadugodi ward, the road is partly under the jurisdiction of the Seegehalli Gram Panchayat. As a result, the road, around 2 kilometres in length from the main Whitefield-Kadugodi-Hosakote Road, is untarred, muddy and narrow. A few days ago, owing to heavy flooding, the school sent out a warning and operated shuttles till a residential neighbourhood to avoid having their students wade through the waters to reach school.

This incident finally caught the attention of the MLA who then assured that work would be done. ""I thought I would do a fact check and found that only a small stretch has been metalled. But that is not going to help in anyway,"" says Tinu Cherian, a parent.

According to him, it is not possible to walk to school or get there by two-wheeler when the road is flooded. ""Added to this, is the chaos from the whitetopping work on the main road. Just 2 kilometres of whitetopping has turned the area into a nightmare. My daughter uses the school bus and yet misses the first two classes on some days because of traffic and waterlogging,"" he said.

However, according to the BBMP, work will soon be underway to provide an alternative access road to the school. ""This road is partly the responsibility of the Seegehalli Gram Panchayat. However, since the condition was pitiable, we did some very basic road repairs with jelly and other materials. On Monday, there was a survey of the road and also of another route which can connect to the school. Work on this route will begin in 15 days,"" said S Muniswamy, Councillor of the Kadugodi ward.

Meanwhile, the BBMP will create an alternative for the water that accumulates on the road to flow. ""We will at least ensure that there will be no water logging on the road. It is most likely due to some encroachments which will also be cleared,"" he said."

Shweta Jain thought she knew where her three-year-old was -- where else would she be on a Tuesday morning but in school? But an hour after she watched her daughter board the bus to her school in Chembur, her husband got a call from a stranger, informing them he had seen the toddler crying on the footpath in Kurla.

""We were at home when my husband received the call. We could not believe what we had heard, as I had watched Anushi boarding the school bus that morning,"" recalled Shweta.

Their daughter, Anushi, 3, is a nursery student at Green Acre school in Chembur. She was found on the footpath in Nehru Nagar, which was a whole 7 km away from the school and wasn't even on the bus route.

""We called the school first to verify what was happening. Only after our call did the school authorities check her class and realise that she was absent. We immediately rushed to Kurla to pick up our child. We are very fortunate that our daughter is safe,"" said the mother, expressing her gratitude to the caller who found her daughter.

Angry parents gather at Govandi police station to protest over the school's negligence

The good Samaritan, Rajesh Shah, runs a general store with his brother right where Arushi was spotted. Since his son studies in the same school, he recognised the uniform.

""From my shop, I spotted the little girl crying, and rushed there immediately. She was so scared, she could not answer questions properly. I immediately brought her to our shop, where my brother and I tried to calm her down. I called the school's landline, but was shocked when the official responded that I should contact the parents instead. I then called the number on the child's ID card and spoke to her father,"" said Shah.

""Understandably, her parents did not believe me at first. They thought their daughter was in school, and Nehru Nagar is nowhere near it. But once they confirmed it with the school, they rushed to my shop. Both of them were crying and distressed,"" he said, further adding, ""I am immensely happy that I was able to help the family. I read news reports about unfortunate incidents every day, and am glad that I was able to avoid one here.""

Rajesh Shah found the toddler and reunited her with her parents

What happened

According to Shweta, Anushi had fallen asleep on the bus, and the attendant forgot about her. Once the other kids alighted at the school, the bus headed to Kurla for some work. It was parked at Nehru Nagar, where Anushi woke up. Out of habit, she exited the bus but got scared upon realising that she was in an unfamiliar place. After walking on the footpath for a while, she started crying and was found by Shah.

Shah added that while her parents turned up soon after he called, the bus driver got there around 9.15 am, but the school authorities only arrived around 10 am. The Jains and Shah both called out the school's negligence.

Shweta said, ""Anushi was crying inconsolably after we were renuited. She told me that she was afraid of getting lost again, and so she did not want to go to school anymore.

""We took her home and then rushed to the police station to lodge a complaint against the school. But the school authorities have assured us of immediate action in the matter, promising more stringent regulations for students' safety. We want this assurance in writing, along with an apology letter, within 24 hours, otherwise we will lodge an FIR against the school,"" said Anushi's father, Piyush, while waiting at Govandi police station.

Other parents angry too

Shah said, ""My child studies in the same school, and if this is their approach towards safety, it is a matter of concern."" The incident caused major anger among other parents at the high-profile school as well. Several of them arrived at the police station in solidarity with the Jains, and laid out a list of issues with the school's transport services.

""It is a mandatory bus service by the school for all children, for which they charge heavily. The least we can expect is the safety of our children. It is very irresponsible of the lady attendant to forget a child. What is the point of having a lady attendant and CCTV cameras when our kids are still not safe? They charge us anywhere between Rs 24,000 and Rs 36,000 per year,"" said one of the parents.

Another added, ""How could the school not notice that the child was absent, even though she was marked present on the bus? The school should have at least been sensitive enough to swing into action upon finding out what had happened.""

School says

Rachana Laxminarayanan, school principal, said, ""It was an unfortunate incident, and we support the parents. We rushed to the spot as soon as we got to know about it. The attendant was unwell today, so there was a human error, as she did not switch on the CCTV surveillance. We are going to terminate the services of the bus contractor. A meeting will be held with parents to understand their concerns regarding transport services, to make appropriate changes.""

Expertspeak

There is no clarity on who should be held responsible for the incident, since the school bus policy does not apply to playgroups or nurseries. Social activist Indrani Malkhani, who was an integral part of the committee that formed the school bus policy, explained, ""The school bus policy is applicable to buses running for schools. School starts from Std I, so buses for lower classes can't be called schoolbuses."""

The fate of 1,600 students enroled in the school hangs in balance as the government is mulling shutting down the school after at least two cases of sexual abuse of children were reported.

The department has already shut down pre-primary classes and has also reportedly recommended CBSE to de-recognise the school's primary and higher classes too. Parents allege that the education department officials have done precious little, despite tall promises, to get the 290 children who were enrolled in nursery and kindergarten classes readmitted in other schools.

Earlier, officials had promised parents that they would get assistance in securing admissions for their children in other schools of their choice. Now, several parents feel the department officials are shirking responsibility. ""How will we know which schools have affiliation and which don't? Instead of giving us names of recognised schools, they have just asked us to choose,"" says Aasiya Khanam, a parent. While parents have been vocal about not wanting the school to be shut down, lack of response from the school management has left parents in two minds.

It has come to light that soon after the closure of the pre-primary section, the management had assured parents that classes would be made operational. It had also assured that classes would be run during the Dussehra vacations to make up for those lost last month when the school for shut for 10 days. However, it "" unexpectedly' declared a 10-day long vacation on Monday, leaving parents confused about its intent. Earlier on 1 October, parents under the aegis of Azzan Internation Parents Association met the management and submitted a charter of demands.

These pertain to the removal of staff in including directors and principal; upgradation of security on the premises; and formulation of a parents, teachers and management association and a grievance cell. The management has sought time till October 15 to respond to these demands, failing which the association said it will take legal action.

Parents confused

Speaking to Express on the condition of anonymity a parent said: ""Safety of our children is our first priority, but we also do not want the school to shut down. This is why we asked for more safety features, but the management is trying to isolate us, paving way for its downfall."""

Days after a 5-year-old girl was allegedly molested by a teacher at a Kolkata school, parents of students protested outside the premises Tuesday, calling for action against the accused. A case was lodged the same day, after which the accused teacher was arrested.

""The teacher has been accused of sexually abusing a minor student. A probe is on,"" Deputy Commissioner of Police (South East Division) Kalyan Mukherjee told The Indian Express. The incident allegedly occurred on September 26.

Police sources said the protest turned violent when police personnel were escorting 300-500 students out of the school premises. They suspect that the protesters saw teachers attempting to leave the school amidst the students, following which they began pelting stones. The police resorted to lathicharge to disperse the crowd.

Apart from the accused teacher, the police also arrested four protesters for their involvement in the violence, sources said. ""During the scrimmage, eight to 10 police personnel sustained injuries and are under treatment at different hospitals. One woman demonstrator was also injured but left the place on her own. Four trouble-makers have been arrested,"" said an official.

The police released a statement which read, ""Today at about 9.45 am, information was received from officer-in-charge of Lake police station that trouble sprouted at a school... Police were informed that aggrieved guardians of the students started staging a demonstration over an alleged molestation incident which reportedly happened on September 26 during school hours. The parents of the victim lodged a complaint at the police station today.""

Police sources said action was taken immediately after the complaint was lodged. A case was registered at Lake police station under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC and under the POCSO Act.

When police officers arrived at the school to nab the accused, guardians of students allegedly got into an altercation with school authorities and demanded that the accused be handed over to them. In the ruckus that followed, a teacher was manhandled and some protesters were injured.

Later, a meeting was held between parents, school authorities, police and a local councillor of Kolkata Municipal Corporation to solve the issue. During the meeting, parents demanded that no male teacher should be allowed in the school.

""They demanded that all male teachers be removed from the girls' school. I will convey this to the education minister. For the time being, it has been decided that only female teachers will take classes till Class V,"" said councillor Ratan Dey.

Primary school council chairman Kartick Chandra Manna told reporters, ""It is an unfortunate incident. Everything has been conveyed to our education minister. For the time being, the accused teacher will not be allowed in the school. If he is found guilty action will be taken. A probe will be done. A few outsiders took advantage of the incident and triggered tension in the area. Police have identified them and action will be taken against each of them.""

Repeated calls to school authorities went unanswered.

""If the school and police had acted in the very beginning, such vandalism wouldn't have taken place. Female protesters were beaten up by the police for no reason,"" said one of the protesters, Mousumi Mondal.

A team from the West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights also visited the spot. ""We are keeping a close watch on the incident. Police have already arrested the accused. If he is found to be guilty, proper action will be taken,"" said Ananya Chattopadhyay, chairperson of the West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights.

At least three guardians were injured, one of them having sustained head injury in the lathicharge. Besides, two teachers and 10 cops, including Lake police station OC Suman Kumar Dey and Gariahat police station OC Sumit Dasgupta, were injured. The accused teacher, Dipak Karmakar (58), a resident of Vidyasagar Colony, was taken to the Lake police station and arrested after his version seemed questionable. He has been charged with Section 10 of POCSO Act and several other sections of the IPC. Four guardians have also been rounded up for rioting and vandalizing and are likely to be arrested. ""We have arrested the accused. We are abiding by children rights commission's regulations. The situation turned tense as the residents took law in their hands. ,"" said a senior police officer. The cops claimed they apparently acted in defence.

The school education department has called for a probe even as it instructed the institute to lodge a complaint of rioting. Police have been asked to provide security on Wednesday, when an attempt will be made to reopen the school.

According to the girl's mother, the upper-KG girl was assaulted by Karmakar, who taught English and Bengali at the school, on September 26. Since it was the day the BJP had called a bandh, only 21of the 40 students were present. ""After she returned home, I noticed she was behaving unnaturally. But she did not open up. For the past few days, she had been refusing to go to school,"" her mother said. Only recently, did she tell her parents about the torture. The child reportedly told her parents that Karmakar had taken her to a separate room where he allegedly physically assaulted her. The parents informed the school about the assault but the authorities apparently did nothing about it. The parents claimed to have a doctor's report, saying child was physically abused. ""The school runs between 6.30am and 8.30am. after which the students are provided with mid-day meal around 9am before the classes are called off,"" an officer said. ""After that, special sessions are held for students facing difficulty with lessons. Karmakar apparently used this pretext to take the child to a room on the first floor, where he sexually assaulted her,"" said an officer.

The school, however, denied the allegation, saying they were informed about the incident only on Tuesday morning when the principal came out to speak to the survivor's mother. The principal alleged the girl's parents, along with scores of other guardians, demanded that Karmakar be handed over to them immediately and that they did not respond to her repeated attempts to open a dialogue. The police said it was around 8am that they received a call from the school. ""A team from the Lake police station went to the school and brought the accused to the police station. We questioned him, found his answers to be questionable and arrested him,"" said an officer. ""However as the word of sexual abuse spread, the crowd kept swelling. The parents initially staged a demonstration pointing to lax security at the school. But around 10am, they began demanding that the accused be handed over to them. When the crowd started to turn violent, we summoned forces from the Gariahat and Rabindra Sarobar police stations.""

""Stopped from barging into the school, the protesters reportedly pelted the cops with stones and managed to break open the main gate. But with cops standing as a barricade, they could go no further in but they attacked the personnel,"" claimed an officer. Some from the crowd -- ruffians from nearby slums also apparently joined in -- vandalized cars and bikes parked on the road. They even reportedly tried to torch a bike, after which cops resorted to lathicharge. What followed was a bloodied ""battle"" of three hours, in which the mother of a child suffered severe head injuries, after being allegedly hit by a cop with a lathi. Several guardians alleged they were kicked by cops. A teacher was attacked by the protesters only to be saved by the students.

Shortly, the school authorities sat with the cops and school education department officers and took four decisions: to reopen school within 24 hours with police help, the accused cannot attend school till the probe is over, a rioting case will be filed by school and a proper probe will be launched into abuse allegation and a report will be submitted. ""We have several CCTV cameras on the premises and we want the truth to come out,"" claimed a teacher.

Ananya Chakraborti, chairperson of the West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights, who visited the school said they were extending legal and counselling help. ""She is in trauma. The commission will keep an eye on the probe and may seek CCTV images,"" she said."

What are the major concerns surrounding the weight of school bags?

Schoolgoing children have been burdened with heavy bags. I have seen young students carry bags weighing upto 10 kg everyday on their shoulders. It is no more just books, but several other materials like project stationery, large or multiple tiffin boxes, umbrella, raincoat, sports uniform, etc. in additional to the conventional notebooks and stationery. All this will cause major health hazards for students, harming their growth, both physically and intellectually.

Has the government taken any step to check this?

The government has taken steps, but they aren't strong enough. There was a government directive in July 2015 which strictly restricted schools from allowing students carrying weight more than 10 per cent of their body weight. Even the PCMC education department recently started the 'No School Bag Day' policy on the first and third Saturday of every month in civic-run schools. But, all that cannot change the overall scenario, because both parents and schools need to be actively involved in its implementation. More awareness programmes and stringent laws can help.

Can you suggest possible solution(s) for this?

I have noticed students carry a lot of weight, just not of notebooks, but textbooks as well. One of the measures is to recycle books. These textbooks can be kept on the school premises and can be used by the students during school hours. Also, many students end up taking more books to school, even of those subjects which are not in the routine, in the fear of being called out in the class for not having it. Many a times, classes in school often get switched and the routine changes, so students are scared to be in such a spot. The recycling process, really helps as they would not have to carry any books at all. Also, if required, these students can keep another copy of the same book in their homes for home study or borrow the same books from the school during examinations. The other suggestion is spreading more awareness, which we have been working towards."

Angry over lack of teachers in a zilla parishad-run primary school at Karanjote village in Bhiwandi, parents of children attending classes there put a lock on the main gate of the school on September 25. Residents said they took the step after their demands for increasing the number of teachers ""fell on deaf ears"". The school currently has two teachers for more than 100 students, claimed a local resident.

Ramesh Jadhaw, father of a six-year-old girl, said: ""This is the only school for nearly five villages and adivasi padas. Children come from different villages, travelling several kilometres. However, there is no teacher for them. So what is the point of having a school?""

Jadhaw is one of the many residents, who have been demanding that the school be better equipped to teach over 100 students attending classes there.

""The school conducts classes till standard seven. The headmaster looks after a few standards, but mostly it is just one teacher who teaches all the subjects in all seven standards. How can one person teach so many children?"" asked Ashwini Gavle, parent of a seven-year-old.

Parents claimed that even those two teachers are absent on many occasions. ""Of the few days that the school was open, the teachers are mostly engaged in either government deputation or training. How are they expected to teach our children?"" Gavle added.

Residents of Karanjote village claimed to had written to all senior authorities. ""We wrote to the education officer at the zilla parishad multiple times since 2016. Some of us even visited the officer. But nothing changed,"" said Sukanya Jadhaw, a local resident.

""In September, the children had hardly a week of school... while the rest of the days were declared holiday. Why is the education department carrying on with this farce? This is not how a school functions,"" she added.

On September 25, when the teachers did not turn up at the school, parents took all the children out and put a lock on the front gate of the four-roomed school premises in the middle of the village, sources said. ""We won't let anyone reopen the school unless the number of teachers is increased. Under the Right to Education law, there has to be a teacher for 30 children. We want at least that rule to be followed,"" said Krushna Jadhaw, another parent.

Meanwhile, Bhiwandi Zilla Parishad Education Officer Sanjay Thorat said: ""There were supposed to be four teachers at the school.

Three persons have been arrested for allegedly cheating parents of the students seeking admission at St Joseph and Don Bosco high schools.

While Chandrakant Bhosale (27) was arrested from Kurla railway station Tuesday, his associates, Radheshyam Bindra (32) and Shyamlal Rajbhar (34), were arrested by the Matunga police on September 27 after they were brought in for questioning. They have been accused of preparing fake payment receipts in the name of the schools.

Police said three cases came to light when the parents approached the school separately to check whether the seats in junior kindergartens have been confirmed for their children. ""When they went to the respective schools with the payment receipts, the parents came to know that they have been duped. The Father of St Joseph High School came to the police station and handed us a written complaint,"" said an officer.

During preliminary investigation, the police learnt that the group had cheated three parents of Rs 1.20 lakh, Rs 1.05 lakh and Rs 75,000, respectively.

""The parents identified the main accused as Chandrakant Bhosale, who had claimed that he is in good terms with the principals and could help them with their ward's admissions. Later, with the help of his call data records, Bhosale was arrested from Kurla station,"" the officer said.

""We came to know that the accused had given the parents receipts of much lesser amounts than to they had actually paid for admission. Bhosale had claimed that the school would not want to mention the donation amount in the receipt,"" the officer added.

Following Bhosale's arrest, the roles played by Bindra and Rajbhar came to light. ""Earlier this year, Bhosale had wanted to print fake receipts of the schools. He initially approached Bindra, who guided him to the third accused. Rajbhar has alleged that Bhosale was introduced to him as an employee of Don Bosco High School... and that the school would give him a printing contract on Bhosale's recommendation,"" the officer said.

So far, the police have come to know that the group has cheated three parents. The three have been booked under sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 465 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged), 472 (making or possessing counterfeit seal with intent to commit forgery punishable) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC.

The association said that if the schools reserved the right to bully the government with a set of demands, justified or unjustified, the students, parents and teachers should also be tolerated when they exercised their right to basic protest or making a complaint against gross illegal profiteering by schools and their attitude to safety and security issues. The HSPA said neither the parents nor the teachers were a party to the bandh call.

The state education department mandates students submit government identity proof for its Students' Achievement Tracking System (SATS). Since Aadhaar card is the only option for students below 15 years of age, parents had to go through the process of obtaining a unique identification card for their children.

However, since UIDAI reveals biometrics of a person changes once they attain the age of 15 years, it's mandatory to get biometrics revised. This meant parents had to go through the process of obtaining an Aadhaar card for their wards twice.

Prejita Singh, from Electronics City and a parent of a 7-year-old, said, ""I am happy with the verdict of the Supreme Court. I was a little apprehensive when a prominent school in Electronics City asked for Aadhaar details. First, I didn't want to get Aadhaar before my child crossed 15 years of age, and second I had doubts over the security of the data.""

Mahesh Jain, from RT Nagar and a parent of a 12-yearold student, said: ""After a huge hue and cry, I had to submit, my son's Aadhaar card in school. I could not understand the point of submitting Aadhaar details. It left great scope for misuse since schools don't have safe websites or strong cyber teams to handle data theft. I am happy with the verdict.""

Most schools too are pleased with the verdict since it will reduce the workload on staff. M Srinivasan, principal, Gear International School and president, CBSE Schools Association, said, ""I am happy with the verdict. Parents were reluctant to share their children's biometric details with schools. They were not comfortable at all, but the Supreme Court's decision solves the problem.""

Echoing Srivivasan's view, Mansoor Ali Khan, member, board of directors, DPS, said, ""It was an additional task for school administrations to collect and maintain Aadhaar data. I hope the Karnataka government also does not make it mandatory, because it would then be difficult to make parents understand why it's important.""

'Will lead to corruption'

But others are unhappy with the court freeing the admission process of Aadhaar data.

""Having Aadhaar records made it possible for us to track students in the long run,"" said Shashi Kumar, general secretary, Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka. ""Through Aadhaar, we were able to secure details of hundreds of ghost students registered by schools for benefits. I hope it continues for RTE admissions."""

Alleging that the school management is behaving as if they are above the law, parents said the school has been reopened with the sole intention of showing the video to students.

""When police are investigating the issue and the medical report has stated that the girl was sexually exploited, the school has no business to show CCTV footage to students. In fact, the entire day was dedicated only for this purpose and all the staff was busy dealing with angry parents,"" said Mohammed Asif Hussain Sohail, a parent of a Class 2 student, adding that the management continued to show the video to students on Wednesday even after parents and police intervened. Meanwhile, parents, who have already formed an ad-hoc committee, said they have submitted four representations to the management over the safety of their wards but have received no response so far.

Parents also demanded that if the school is going to remain open, it should have only female staff for the girl's block. They also demanded separate entry and exit points for girls and asked the school to ensure a thorough and professional background check of all the existing staff and new recruits. The worried parents also pointed out that even two weeks after the incident, they have no clarity on the future of their children as the education department has not yet issued any communication. ""We don't know if the school will be closed down or will remain open or will be taken over from the management.

The school has been shut for the last 10 days. On Wednesday, as many as 162 parents met the DEO and requested her not to close down the school. They fear changing school in the middle of the year would be difficult and pose financial and logistical issues. Zareena Shah, mother of a class 10 student, says though the sexual harassment charges cannot be dismissed, future of other students cannot be overlooked.

""An investigation is going on and the DEO should allow classes to continue under her supervision,"" she says. ""If there were lapses on the part of school management, take action against them.

""In view of the serious nature of the incidents, closure of the school appears to be the most likely action. But we are looking at all possibilities.

'35L students to be affected if budget schools are shut down'

Unhappy at the government's refusal to issue extension of temporary recognition (ETR) without insisting upon different No Objection Certificates -- fire, traffic and GHMC, the Telangana Recognised Schools Management Association (TRSMA) has called for a bandh of all budget schools on Friday. The term budget schools refers to schools which charge fee less than Rs 30,000. According to the TRSMA, the National Building Code came into force in 1998, fire NOC became mandatory in 2005 and traffic NOC from 2009 onwards, therefore nearly 80 per cent of schools established before these norms were enforced are now found to be violators. S Srinivas, president of TRSMA, alleged that the government is deliberately tightening the noose around the budget schools in order to shut them.

""As part of its KG to PG education programme, it plans to open up 500 more schools next year so they want to shut our schools. We are ready to even hand over the management of our schools to government so that it can run them government schools and regularise all our teachers too,"" he said. There are 35 lakh students in 1,200 budgets schools across the State and closure of these schools will affect their future."

To avoid missing the half-yearly exam, students piggybacked to school in Koti village on Monday as the water level of the Ghaggar in Morni rose due to the incessant downpour. Parents carried their wards on their back and shoulders while wading through the river. Still, 39 students of Government Senior Secondary School at Koti village missed their exams as they could not cross the river.

As it began raining from Sunday night, the water level of the Ghaggar rose when the students left for school on Monday morning. Exams from classes VI to XI were scheduled for Monday. On Saturday, 18 students from standard IX to XII had already missed the exam due to the same reason.

Jaipal Singh, a resident of Pathrothi village, had to carry his daughter Geetanjali of Standard IX on his back to help her cross the river so that she doesn't miss her exam. ""She was crying that she will miss her exam and at the same time got scared to cross the river. I knew it was risky for her and me too... but at least she felt safe that she was with her father,"" he said.

Paramjeet Singh, another resident of the same village who also carried his daughter Payal, a student of Standard VII, said, ""We are fed up. The government says send your children to school. Yet, have they even provided a proper access to the school.""

In Class VI, eight students missed the exam while in standard VII, four couldn't take the exam. Six students of Standard VIII, nine of Standard IX, seven of Standard X and five of Standard XI failed to take the exam. After walking for three to seven kilometres from their respective villages, these students reached the river bank but couldn't wade through Ghaggar.

The exam was scheduled to take place at 8.30 am. While Standard VI was to take the English exam, standards VII, VIII, IX, X and XI were to take science, Hindi, maths and history, respectively. Surinder, a student of Class X who had his maths exam, came covered in plastic but had to return from the river bank. Surinder had walked seven kilometres from his village Late Batoli to the river bank. But finding the Ghaggar swollen, he couldn't risk crossing the river.

""Does the administration only swing into action after a casualty? We feel so helpless. At least we can get a temporary bridge until a permanent solution is chalked out. What if we are trying to cross and get washed away by the strong current?"" said Surinder. ""We have our boards this time and these examinations are highly important for us. We don't even know whether the school will take our exam again,"" he added.

Brij Kishore Gautam, a teacher of the school, said they were in the process of sending a request to the district education office to allow them to take the exams for these students again. ""Every minute has been difficult for us. We don't even know if we will survive while crossing the river this season and the officials are just speaking about tenders being floated, tenders being opened and what not.... We don't understand these official jargons. Why can't they provide a stopgap arrangement till then,"" said the teacher.

Gautam added that his son Tanmay has been constantly asking whether he would be able to go to school on Tuesday since he missed school today. Panchkula DC Mukul Kumar said he had spoken to the Block Development Officer who said that the villagers had been insisting on a permanent solution only.

However, when the DC was told that the villagers have been asking for at least a temporary solution at present, he said, ""Tomorrow itself, I will get the provision of a temporary bridge explored."" PWD officials said tenders have already been recalled and work will begin soon.

The school has witnessed enthusiasm and interest among parents even in its secondth operational year. Early learning village is grounded on a content-rich International Early Years Curriculum (IEYC) which lays the foundation of knowledge and learning for children aged 1.5 to 4.5 years. Children embark on their journey towards learning in an environment that provides stimulating spaces and exciting experiences.

""We are still receiving many enquiries from parents for admissions. This has primarily been achieved through references and word of mouth. In a short span of time, we have been able to make a difference to the teaching environment in the city with our focus on experiential and play-based learning. With the freedom to explore, our children engage in hands-on activities, learn to think creatively and evolve to develop skills like problem solving and critical thinking. When children enter our gates with enthusiasm, it only endorses our efforts and innovative teaching-style. We hope to empower and equip each child with the excitement, curiosity and love for learning for life!"" says Mrs Priya Saxena, co-founder and Principal at Early Learning Village.

""At Early Learning Village, we focus on quality and learning for both our children and teachers. We ensure the best of learning environment and material is provided to our students. We also commit to providing sufficient teaching training and resources to all our teachers. We are happy that both our students and teachers are in harmony with each other and are able to make so much more out of their association and friendship"", says Mr. Pradeep Jolly, Co-Founder, Early Learning Village.

Teaching at Early learning village is a very holistic process where not only the child's cognitive well-being is taken care of, but the child's emotional, social, physical and spiritual growth and needs are also taken care of. A child's day at Early Learning Village has a balance of open-ended activities, exploration, child-initiated play supported by adults, focused-learning with adult guiding the learning through playful and rich experiential activities. Through role-play, messy play, water and sand activities, construction and small world children at ELV engage, explore and learn. We value outdoor learning as much as indoor learning and invest a lot of time and planning to provide children with unique, safe, rich and dynamic experiences in our natural outdoor play spaces. Our outdoor activities provide children with a range of engaging and challenging opportunities to explore freely, develop physically, take risks, solve problems and grow in confidence while playing independently and collaboratively.

ELV outdoors offer children opportunities to play in the treehouse, vegetable farm, musical garden, sensory path and sensory fountain. All these activities are on the lines of international practices as the Co - founders of the school-Ms Priya Saxena, Ms Priya Dhawan and Ms Heba Zaidi Khosla, have taught at The British School and other global schools.

At Early Learning Village, ELV teachers work in small groups, with each teacher responsible for a group size of 4 - 6 children. Small group work increases the attention and focus the child receives. A unique feature of the school is that it encourages one of the parent of the child to be present during the first few days of transition.

The teachers at ELV are qualified teachers, who go through initial hand holding and shadow sessions and then work daily to master their expertise. This is important as it helps them align their knowledge and skills with the international curricula that this school offers. They make the children adept in storytelling, rhymes, phonics, coloring, art and crafts, painting, drawing, dance, music, singing, drama, theatre. There are specific classes for gardening, pottery, no flame cooking, etc.

ELV has partnered with 'Music Together' for music sessions, Art of Sport for physical development session and 'My dance academy' for dance session for their children. Field trips and story are a regular feature at ELV. ELV is more than just a workplace, it is a community of like-minded people who have come together for a common purpose - ""children first"".

ELV resonates compassion, love and laugher among all its stakeholders. It is a vibrant place for learning, for one and for all."

Authorities at the New English School at Landewadi, in Ambegaon taluka of Pune district, have taken an initiative to ensure that parents get multiple updates about the students' whereabouts via SMS throughout the day.

""We have installed a device in all our buses and given I-cards, which contain a chip, to students. So, when the child boards the bus, he or she has to tap their I-card on that device, which automatically sends a message to the parent's phone, informing them that the child has entered the bus. While getting off the bus, the student has to again tap the device with the I-card, and a second message goes to the parent stating that the child has left the bus. A third message is sent when the child enters the school and taps the I-card on a device here. So, by the time the student reaches school, three communications between the parent and the school have taken place,"" said Shabnam Momin, principal of New English School.

""The same way, when children leave the school, they have to tap the device in the school and do the same when they are getting on and off the school bus. In one day, six messages are sent to the parent's phone, updating them on the child's whereabouts,"" she added.

Earlier, the school authorities had installed CCTV cameras and GPS tracking system inside the school buses.

Explaining the reason behind the security measures, Momin said, ""Several incidents of sexual harassment and bullying in school buses have been reported from across India. These are the steps we took to prevent such incidents. The safety and security of our students is always our main priority"".

Vidya Kale, whose three children study in New English School, said, ""This is a great step by the school to ensure the safety of our children. It also has other advantages. Now, I don't need to wait at the bus stop for a long time. I can always track the bus with my phone and go to the bus stop only when the bus is close by.""

Satish Bhere, a student of Class X, said, ""This system also has an added advantage when it comes to attendance.

Earlier, attendance was taken manually and that was a time-consuming job. Now, it is recorded automatically when the student taps the scanning device with his I-card and the data is stored in a database"".

The issue has been hanging fire for years, but while the authorities debate and delay, little children in the city's schools continue to carry the burden of homework and heavy schoolbags. It was in 2016 that the Union Ministry of Human Resources Development directed the CBSE to issue circulars to schools telling them to advise students of classes 1 and 2 not to carry school bags and to stop giving them homework.

The CBSE did issue the circular on September 12, 2016, but seeing little change on the ground, it was pulled up by the Madras High Court on August 11 this year, and advised to enforce its diktat more seriously. A few days later, on August 20, the court ordered the CBSE to publicise in the media that strict action would be taken against schools not following the 'No Homework' rule

And complying, the CBSE's recent circular has advised its affiliated schools to reduce the weight of school bags in the interests of the children's health and not to prescribe home work, which could add to their burden both literally and figuratively speaking. ""Young children whose spine is at a crucial stage of growth are most susceptible to hazards such as back pain, muscle pain, shoulder pain, fatigue and in extreme cases the distortion of spinal chord or shoulders that may most plausibly be attributed to heavy school bags,"" read the circular.

The Karnataka government, which too has been slack in reducing the burden of little children , seems to have finally woken up as well and held a meeting on September 3 this year with private school managements to discuss the twin issues of doing away with heavy school bags at least two days a week and homework all days of the week for students of UKG and classes 1 and 2.

The meeting clearly did not go down well as earlier this week, on September 11, the private school managements condemned the 'unscientific' draft guidelines prescribed by the Department of State Educational Research and Training (DSERT) for enforcement in the state

The new guidelines propose that a schoolbag should not be heavier than 10 per cent of the student's body weight and that students from lower kindergarten (LKG) to class 2 should not be allowed to carry more than 2 or 3 kgs of books and students from classes 4 to 7 more than 4 kgs.

Mr D. Shashikumar, general secretary of the Karnataka Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools (KAMS) is categorical in his opposition to these new norms, insisting that such decisions should be backed by proper research. ""The government should work scientifically and give orders that are acceptable to all stakeholders,"" he says, revealing that private school managements in the state are okay with only one ""No Bag Day"" a week.

President of the Managements of Independent CBSE Schools Association (MICSA), M. Srinivasan too is unhappy with the guidelines issued by his board, and insists that giving students homework is necessary as it encourages them to think constructively and contributes to ""better brain development and retention capabilities.""

""Homework encourages students to revise portions taught in school after class hours,"" he says. Strongly critical of both the CBSE and the DSERT for coming up with directives without scientific backing, he says that such decisions should be taken with care. ""A comprehensive survey should be done among students, teachers and parents before making these guidelines the norm,"" he stresses.

Give our kids homework: parents oppose policy

Parents are equally opposed tot he No Homework policy, say principals and teachers. ""Parents love to compare their children's academic progress with that of children from other schools. They like to look into their work books to assess their progress and help them revise what they have learnt in school during the day,"" says a principal of an ICSE school in the city. Arguing that the workload of students till second grade is very small and puts no pressure on them, he says homework helps build their interest in information outside their textbooks.

While one parent, Mr Ravi Nair, an advertising professional whose sons study in grade one and four in a city school, is happy with the government's move on reducing heavy school bags, he believes homework should be done online in future. Welcoming the proposal to have ""No Bag Days,"" he says, ""I have always felt that schools burden children with heavy books, which they don't always need. Instead, students should be trained to go online for any pending work on reaching home to make learning fun. While smartphone applications are easy and feasible to create, even budget schools can develop a platform to make learning and revision an interactive process from home,"" he suggests.

Education expert, Preethi Vickram, however, feels that it is high time the concept of homework underwent a comprehensive transformation. ""Rather than being mere revision, homework should enhance the communication and application skills of children at home. They should be encouraged to interact with parents to know how a particular concept taught at school is used in practice. In short, homework should play a complementary role, rather than being a repetitive process,"" she says.

Responding to the criticism of school managements, principals and parents on the issue, Prof. Niranjanaradhya V.P, head of the universalisation of equitable quality education programme at the Centre for Child and the Law, National Law School of India University (NLSIU) , who was on the committee which drafted the guidelines on homework and schoolbags, says it is unfounded.

""Such policy decisions are taken by the government only on the basis of systematic studies. Doctors were consulted to prescribe the optimal weight of school bags for children of various ages,"" he reveals adding that schools should not blame parents for encouraging them to do homework and instead convince them that their children can do well in their studies even without doing it at this stage of their learning.

The UKG student, who came back home at 12.30 pm, then complained of pain in her private parts to her parents, who were shocked at her plight. She told them how the accused lured her with a chocolate and forced himself on her.

Following a complaint from the parents, a case under Section 376 (rape) of the IPC and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act was registered against the accused, who has been taken into custody. Police, however, have not named the accused and said they were questioning him.

Meanwhile, at around 8 pm, locals on knowing about the incident, reached the school in large numbers and raised slogans against the school. Some protesters pelted stones on the school bus, while a few angry women destroyed plastic chairs on the school premises. They raised slogans demanding justice for the family.

Police, who reached the spot, promised the protesters of stringent action against the accused after the enquiry. Following an assurance, the crowds dispersed from the school. However, to prevent further trouble, police rushed additional forces to the school."

Family members of a three-and-a-half-year-old girl who was allegedly molested in her school at north west Delhi's Mukherjee Nagar last week staged a protest outside the school on Tuesday demanding action against the authorities.

They were joined by parents of other schoolchildren and members of some NGOs. They blocked the road and demanded justice for the child.

The parents of the child have alleged that she was sexually assaulted in her school last Tuesday. A case was registered by the district police under relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses (POCSO) Act.

The family alleges that when the girl came home on September 4, her private parts were bleeding. They took her to a doctor who suspected sexual assault following which the family reported the matter to the police.

The police today said that the Crime Branch will take over the probe into the alleged sexual assault of the girl.

A senior officer said the case has been transferred to the Crime Branch since it is a ""sensitive one"".

Last week, police had said that it did not rule out the role of the school authority or any family member or neighbour.

Aslam Khan, the Deputy Commissioner of Police (northwest), had said, ""We are investigating the matter from all angles. We are not ruling out the role of the school authority or any family member or neighbour.""

""The doctor has confirmed that it is a case of sexual assault. We have registered an FIR under Section 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act,"" Khan had said.

The police had claimed that the girl was ""touched"" inappropriately.

Meanwhile, the principal of the school said that they have cooperated with the police and have provided all the help needed. Police have checked CCTV footage and have not found anything suspicious, he said.

The CCTV recording has been handed over to the police, he said."

The incident is reported to have happened in the Chinese city of Shenzhen.

A video showing a woman wearing a tiny pair of tight black shorts and a black crop top is seen dancing at a school ceremony.

The video also shows children along with their parents watching the show.

The video was shared online by a journalist Michael Standaert whose children were also part of the school celebration.

The journalist posted the video on Twitter saying, ""The principal hung up on my wife when she called after saying it was ""international and good exercise"" ... okay, yeah for adults maybe, but not 3-6 year old kids"".

The journalist also speculated that the head of the school might have received payments for the dance as he saw several advertisements of the pole dancer.

The dance was condemned by the local education bureau and the head of the school was also dismissed after the video went viral."

A Chinese kindergarten principal has apologized after allowing a pole dancer to perform on the school's opening day. Yes, you read that right. A Chinese kindergarten thought it was a good idea to have a scantily clad woman writhing around a pole in the school courtyard on Monday.

American writer Michael Standaert, who is based in the southern city of Shenzhen, was surprised, to say the least, when he and his wife took their children to the privately run Xinshahui kindergarten in the Bao'an district of Shenzhen on Monday.

There, on a stage in the courtyard, in front of rows of children aged 3 to 6, all first-day-ready in pristine white shirts and neatly pressed black shorts, a woman did a routine that would not be out of place in a downtown strip club.

Dressed in a tight, black midriff-baring top, black leather hotpants and high black sandals, she flung herself around the pole and down on the floor, flicking her hair suggestively.

Some little boys can be seen laughing and swinging around each other, while the little girls in red majorette-style outfits in the front appear frozen still. Several mothers can be seen hurriedly shooing their children away from the scene.

""Who would think this is a good idea?"" Standaert asked above one of several videos he posted on Twitter.

""The principal hung up on my wife when she called after saying it was 'international and good exercise' ... OK, yeah for adults maybe, but not 3- to 6-year-old kids,"" he added.

There were also advertisements for a pole dancing school around the school courtyard, leading Standaert to wonder if the principal had accepted money in return for allowing the unusual display. He later said by email that he had not been able to confirm whether this was the case.

After the videos garnered lots of unwanted attention on the internet, the Bao'an educational bureau said the pole dance was ""inappropriate."" In a statement on Weibo, the Chinese answer to Twitter, the bureau asked the owner of the kindergarten to apologize to the parents and the public, and to sack the principal.

The principal of the kindergarten, Lai Rong, issued an apology, saying she thought ""inviting professional dancers to the kindergarten to perform for the parents would liven up the mood"" on the first day back. ""I did not think through the contents of the performance ... It was a very terrible viewing experience for the kids and the parents. For that, I sincerely apologize,"" according to a report on Weibo of her message to parents.

Lai told The Washington Post that she sent the apology even before the local education bureau got involved.

""I was thinking of asking the forgiveness from the parents and also promising them that we would not teach the kids this kind of dance. I just want the kids to know the existence of this kind of dance. That's all,"" she told The Post.

Many Weibo commentators said it was not an appropriate spectacle for a kindergarten. But not everyone disapproved.

""This is probably something to encourage the dads to pick up their kids,"" said Weibo user @Janson_Mou. ""If my daughter's kindergarten is like this, I will go pick her up every day.""

The idea of having pole dancers or strippers at an event not usually associated with exotic dancing is not entirely new in China.

In 2015, the Chinese Culture Ministry cracked down on the ""bizarre and increasingly popular"" habit of having half-naked women perform at funerals, which was ""corrupting the social atmosphere.""

""Having exotic performances of this nature at funerals highlights the trappings of modern life in China, whereby vanity and snobbery prevail over traditions,"" the state news agency, Xinhua, reported at the time.

The practice appeared part of a tactic to attract more mourners to funerals, make the deceased look more popular and honor their life more fully. In flashy New China, it's also become a way to flaunt newly gotten wealth.

China has had a tradition of entertaining mourners at funerals as far back as the Qing Dynasty, established in 1636. Some experts said that having exotic dancers at funerals - and at weddings - was a form of fertility worship. ""In some local cultures, dancing with erotic elements can be used to convey the deceased's wishes of being blessed with many children,"" Huang Jianxing, a professor in Fujian Normal University's sociology department, told the Global Times.

The most eye-popping example of the exotic funeral occurred in Taiwan last year, when 50 women in lingerie pole-danced on moving black cars at the funeral of politician Tung Hsiang.

The Chiayi County Council speaker ""enjoyed a buzz"" so the funeral was designed to give him ""a happy departure,"" his son said, according to reports.

While police are yet to identify the accused boys who committed the crime, they suspect the students might have gone underground.

The parents of the Charkop-based school staged a huge protest in the school premises on Saturday, wherein they came in large numbers demanding justice to the victim, the arrest of the four boys who did the shameful act and removal of the school's principal. The protest saw a fair police presence, with senior official addressing the crowd to stay calm and trust the system. The police official also ensured that the probe will pick up the pace on Tuesday after the school reopens post the long weekend.

An official, on the condition of anonymity, said, ""The four male students of standard nine are yet to be identified. The police have already sought the footage of the CCTV camera units placed in the school canteen. An officer said, ""We have registered a case and got the victim's medical examination done. We have taken the relevant CCTV footage and will be seeking expert help to get clearer images.""

The police said the incident took place on Thursday, and a case was registered a day later. As per the procedure, the investigation began later on Friday, during which the school hours were already over. In the light of a holiday on Monday for Janmashtami, the school was closed for a long weekend (Saturday, Sunday and Monday), which is when most of the families go out of town. The family members, however, weren't to be pacified and shouted slogans against the school and police, demanding a fair and clean investigation in the case. They want each and every student of the school interrogated."
