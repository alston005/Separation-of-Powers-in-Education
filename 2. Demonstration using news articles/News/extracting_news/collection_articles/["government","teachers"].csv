EXPRESSING ""SERIOUS concern"" over the findings of an investigation by The Indian Express on student suicides in Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) Tuesday issued notice to the school education secretary in the HRD Ministry seeking a response within six weeks.

On December 24, 2018, The Indian Express reported that the central government's residential schools for talented rural children witnessed 49 student suicides from 2013 to 2017, including that of 25 Dalit and tribal students. The investigation also revealed that there are no trained counsellors on campus, and that it's largely left to ""overburdened"" teachers to look after the welfare of students.

Taking suo motu cognizance of the findings, the NHRC, headed by former Chief Justice of India H L Dattu, directed the ministry to submit its response on three aspects: whether trained counsellors are available on campus; if there is dedicated staff to ensure students are not left alone in their rooms; and whether students have access to emergency assistance through counselling over telephone and a suicide hotline service.

""The Commission has observed that the contents of the media report, if true, cannot be ignored or overlooked as this reported pattern of suicides by so many students in JNVs might still increase, if not checked in time with appropriate measures... The proportion of suicides of students from the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities is also a matter of concern for a society, which aspires for an inclusive growth,"" the NHRC said.

Citing the findings of The Indian Express investigation, NHRC said a total of 2.53 lakh students in the age group of nine to 19 were enrolled across roughly 600 JNVs for the year 2017 and that in the same year, the number of suicides touched 14."

And it's not a pretty sight for students of Gurugram, with only 55% managing to pass. The results were uploaded on the Saksham Haryana Education portal last week. The tests are conducted by the state education department to track and improve the learning ability of government school students.

Students of Mahendergarh topped with a pass percentage of 69%, with Yamunanagar bringing up the rear at 36%. English is the subject most students struggled with, especially in higher classes. Across the state, barely 35% students managed to clear it.

Satyanarayan Yadav, state secretary of Haryana School Teachers Association, said, ""Most students find it hard to learn English as they speak in Hindi. Effort is needed to ensure students improve their English scores."" In contrast, most students performed well in fine arts and music scoring overall 91% and 81%, respectively.

Of 21 districts, Gurugram was ranked 16th in the Class X Haryana Board Examination of 2017-18, with a pass percentage of 45.67%. In 2016-17, too, it was ranked 16th but with a pass percentage of 43.68%.

District elementary education officer Prem Lata Yadav said, ""From this year onwards, I'll ensure kids take their class tests seriously. I'm sure results will improve."" In the block-wise comparison of SAT scores for the district, Sohna scored 49%, Farrukhnagar 56%, Gurugram 57% and Pataudi 62%.

In Government Senior Secondary School, Khetawas, out of 18 students who appeared for the Class XII exam, only three passed. The principal said: ""As most students belong to families of migrant workers, they don't have the environment to study at home. How can they clear board exams on the basis of class teaching alone?""

The SAT results are shared with district education officers to evaluate performance of students and teachers, followed by classes under the learning enhancement programme to bridge gaps. Jyoti Chaudhary, director, SCERT, said, ""All efforts are being taken by SCERT to increase learning level of students."""

The move has drawn flak from opposition parties that said the government should rather work towards improving the ""deteriorating quality of education"".

As per notifications issued on Monday (December 31) by the Directorate of Primary Education and Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB), students of class 1-12 of the government, grant-in-aid and self-financed schools will have to respond to attendance call with 'Jai Hind' or 'Jai Bharat', starting January 1.

Chavda alleged that the quality of primary education is going down in Gujarat. ""The quality is even worse than many other under-developed states,"" he said.

""The standard of primary education in Gujarat has gone down significantly over the last several years. The BJP government engages only in talks and programmes in the name of improving quality,"" the Congress leader alleged.

The first two weeks of the drive, to begin on January 16, is for students up till the age of 15. According to a Directorate of Education (DoE) circular dated December 19, 2018, since the MR campaign is a central government policy, no consent is required from beneficiaries and their parents. A December 24 circular on the same states: ""For vaccination sessions in educational institutes/schools, teachers and parents will play a key role in ensuring that targeted students are well informed and immunised during the campaign.""

Teachers have been told to be part of the vaccination teams, along with the designated health workers, and to create awareness and sensitisation regarding the vaccine among students and parents in all government, government-aided and unaided recognised schools in Delhi. However, some teachers have expressed their discomfort about being placed at the forefront of the drive. ""I have been asked to tell parents that this vaccine is safe when I myself do not know enough about this. We are trained as teachers, not health functionaries.

A teacher at a private school also said she was uncomfortable convincing parents about this.

""I am not convinced that this campaign is essential, and we have read many news reports of children falling ill after receiving the vaccine in Maharashtra and Gujarat.

Lakhs of women lined up across Kerala's 14 districts on Tuesday to form a human wall as part of the state government's 'vanitha mathil' or women's wall. The wall was organised by the CPI(M)-led LDF government and community outfits backing its stand on the entry of women at the Sabarimala temple.

Although the wall was envisaged as a counter to the Sangh Parivar campaign against the entry of women of all ages at Sabarimala temple following the Supreme Court verdict, the CPI(M) has managed to project the event as a statement of ""progressive Kerala"".

State Minister for Health and Family Welfare K K Shailaja was the starting point of the wall in the northern Kasaragod district, while senior CPI(M) leader and Politburo member Brinda Karat stood as the concluding link of the wall at the southern tip of Thiruvananthapuram district.

The entire ruling LDF cabinet, leaders of community organisations like the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam - which represents the Hindu Ezhava community - , leaders of the Punnala Sreekumar faction of the Kerala Pulaya Mahasabha representing the SC community, and Left-aligned intellectuals, writers, thinkers, activists and actors participated in the movement.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan stated on Facebook, ""The women's wall has become the largest women movement in the country to protect their rights enshrined in the Constitution and defend the attempts to deny them gender justice. This wall is a warning to the conservative-communal forces, which try to deny women their legitimate rights and renaissance values. The women's wall has emerged as a loud announcement that Kerala women are with the progressive thought.""

However, the Opposition Congress boycotted the wall, dubbing it ""communal"" as Hindu organisations were actively involved in the campaign. BJP and upper caste Hindu organisations such as Nair Service Society also kept away from the wall. The BJP had last week lighted an 'ayyappa jyothi' across the state to the northern as a counter to the women's wall.

NSS general secretary Sukumaran Nair, who is leading the Hindu communities opposed to the entry of women of all ages to Sabarimala, said Kerala would become a ""Satan's land"" after the women wall. ""No Chief Minister can destroy traditions and rituals,"" he said.

In Kasaragod district, an attempt to disrupt the wall was reported when a group of men, allegedly belonging to BJP, set on fire a wayside grassland to prevent women from lining up along the road. Police chased them away.

At Edappally - one of the busiest traffic points in Ernakulam district in central Kerala, scores of women lined up on the side of national highway 66. While there were not many minors, there were many elderly women. Exactly at 3.30 pm, the women stood shoulder to shoulder along the entire stretch of the highway, with many wearing the traditional 'kasavu mundu'. Announcements were made over a microphone, requesting the women to not clog roads and to avoid accidents. Senior CPI(M) leadership, including district secretary CN Mohanan, former secretary P Rajeev, Politburo member M A Baby, Politburo member Subhashini Ali, and writer M Leelavathy were present. Nuns of the Jacobite faction of the Christian Church were also present.

At 4.00 pm, the women were requested to raise their hands forward and take a pledge to uphold and protect the social reform values of Kerala and to support the constitutional tenets of gender equality.

In Kochi, Christian nuns also joined the wall while in Malappuram, Muslim women trooped to streets in large numbers to stand for the wall.

Nithya, 23, who works at the IT hub of Infopark in the city, said she had come to show her solidarity with ""the government's vision of a gender equal society"".

""We have to create a new generation that's well aware of our state's rich social reform movements and what they stand for. We have to fight against blind traditions and superstitions,"" she said.

Elizabeth, a school teacher and a member of the Left-backed Kerala State Teachers Association, said the movement was an important marker of female empowerment at a time when the women's right to pray has been violated by male-dominated protests at Sabarimala. ""Viswasam ulla sthreekal keranam (Those who have belief in the deity must be able to enter and pray),"" she said. ""It's a Supreme Court order and the Kerala government has to follow it. The government is handling it in a mature manner. Some political organisations are playing games by making women stand in front.""

At the same time, some participants could not rationally explain why they were there. It was evident that they had been mobilised by community organisations for the sake of building a crowd.

There were also those who took contradictory positions.

Ani, a housewife, said she came for the programme to stand for the rights of women. ""But in the Sabarimala issue, we are on the side of belief (which bars women of menstruation age),"" she said. Her friend Sarada, agreed.

Shortly after the women's wall disbanded, 91-year-old M Leelavathy - one of Kerala's most admired and respected literary critics and writers - underlined in a short speech at a public meeting that gender equality must not remain restricted to cultural and social spheres.

""There must be changes in the political sphere too,"" she said. ""For example, there's a women's reservation bill in Parliament. It advocates 33% reservation for women in Parliamentary constituencies. But I ask, why 33 per cent? Why not 50 per cent? After all, women are half of the country's population. Political leaders must ensure that they pass the bill, ' she said.

Subhashini Ali in her address said she felt wonderful to see scores of women from one end of Kerala to the other upholding principles of equality.

""Many extreme reactionary voices have been speaking on behalf of women in Kerala for the last few months. They have been trying to tell people 'women want this, women don't want this'. Today, lakhs of women have come here to say that you don't need to speak on our behalf. We can speak for ourselves. We want our rights, our equality and we have to move forward. They are telling these people that we have rejected their regressive traditions,"" she said."

The inflow to various points of the highway started much earlier and by 4 p.m. there was a large crowd who joined the human chain from Oachira to Kadambattukonam. Politicians, social activists, professionals, government employees, cashew workers, Kudumbashree workers, artists and teachers participated in the event and took the Renaissance pledge.

It is now mandatory for college lecturers to undertake a self-assessment test from this academic year.

The Department of Collegiate Education, last month, issued an order stating that it was compulsory for lecturers from all 412 government first grade degree colleges to undertake these tests. The order states that academic audits will have to be undertaken in April every year.

Officials said that self-assessment would also help teachers reflect on their strengths and weaknesses. ""It will help them identify areas of improvement and how the classes can be improved,"" said a senior official from the DCE. Besides self-assessment, the department also seeks feedback from students on the performance of their lecturers.

The self-assessment exercise, which is mandatory, requires lecturers to fill a detailed form with 35 questions. These include details of the paper they are teaching, the workload they have every week, preparation of teaching material, and use of teaching aid. Besides this, it also asks lecturers to key in the assignments given to students as well as the seminars and field visits conducted for the students. Lecturers also have to submit details on the trainings, research and professional development programmes they have undertaken.

It also asks lecturers to write down the additional responsibilities they have undertaken in college and seeks feedback about the viability of the student strength, with the intention of addressing the challenges they face.

H. Prakash, president, Karnataka Government College Teachers' Association, said the assessment would help develop accountability among lecturers.

Perhaps, the only jarring gap in the wall of women was at Chettukundu in Kasaragode where persons suspected to be Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers unleashed violence against those who tried to line up on the road. The police fired tear gas shells to subdue the mob.

Suspected BJP workers attacked police officers, journalists, passersby and damaged vehicles. Law enforcers diverted traffic away from the spot, which continued to be a conflict zone late into the evening.

Women from all walks of life participated in the programme which the LDF had posited as a political counter to Hindu right-wing forces opposed to the entry of women to Sabarimala.

Senior women, homemakers, women clad in hijabs, lawyers, transwomen, actors, artists, doctors, teachers, students, authors, civil servants, unskilled workers, government employees, members of social organisations such as the Kerala Pulayar Maha Sabha and the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam congregated alongside National Highways. They stood shoulder to shoulder for 15 minutes after 4 p.m. to form a human wall with few apparent cracks in the line.

The programme ended with a joint pledge to harness the power of Enlightenment principles to insulate society against revanchist forces that sought to push Kerala back to the dark ages of casteism and discriminatory religious practices.

The wall of women was not without discord and, if anything, starkly underscored the fault lines of Kerala society.

NSS general secretary G. Sukumaran Nair, said that the wall would transform Kerala into a ""devil's own"" country riven by social strife. The NSS had opposed the wall.

SNDP general secretary Vellapally Natesan said the wall was a riposte to those who sought to turn Kerala into a ""madhouse"" of caste-based discrimination.

Mr. Nair criticised Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan for intervening in matters of faith while Mr Natesan defended the government's stance on fighting revanchist forces.

He said the government should prioritise improving the ""significantly deteriorating"" quality of education in the state.

""Instead of improving the quality of education, the education minister is talking about teaching patriotism to Gujarat's youth and children.

The ruling CPM-led government has backed the entry of women of all ages and stressed the legal responsibility of the government to abide by the top court verdict on the matter. The women's wall has been envisaged as a counter to the RSS-BJP campaign behind the Sabarimala protests where the latter has taken a position backing the traditions of the temple which do not favour the entry of women of menstruating age.

At the same time, as common with political rallies and public events, there were participants who could not rationally explain why they were there. It was evident that they had been mobilised by community organisations for the sake of building a crowd.

There were also those who took contradictory positions.

Ani, a housewife and a member of the KPMS from Vypeen, said she came for the programme to stand for the rights of women.

""But in the Sabarimala issue, we are on the side of belief (which bars women of menstruation age),"" she responded smiling. Her friend, Sarada, also from the same neighborhood, laughed and nodded.

Shortly after the women's wall disbanded, at a public meeting, 91-year-old M Leelavathy, one of Kerala's most admired and respected literary critics and writers, underlined in a short speech that gender equality must not remain restricted to cultural and social spheres. ""There must be changes in the political sphere too,"" she said.

""For example, there's a women's reservation bill in Parliament. It advocates 33% reservation for women in parliamentary constituencies. But I ask, why 33%? Why not 50%? after all, women are half of the country's population. Political leaders must ensure that they pass the bill,"" she said.

Subhashini Ali in her address said she felt wonderful to see scores of women from one end of Kerala to the other upholding principles of equality.

""Many extreme reactionary voices have been speaking on behalf of women in Kerala for the last few months. They have been trying to tell people, 'women want this, women don't want this'. Today, lakhs of women have come here to say that you don't need to speak on our behalf. We can speak for ourselves. We want our rights, our equality and we have to move forward. They are telling these people that we have rejected their regressive traditions,"" she said."

The BJP-led Gujarat government has come under fire for asking schools to ensure that students respond with 'Jai Hind' or 'Jai Bharat' during roll call instead of the customary 'Yes Sir', with the Opposition arguing the move will ""not change the quality of education"".

According to a notification issued on Monday by the Directorate of Primary Education and Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB), students of class 1-12 of the government, grant-in-aid and self-financed schools will have to respond to the attendance call with

'Jai Hind' or 'Jai Bharat', starting January 1.

The objective of the new practice is to ""foster patriotism among students right from childhood"", it said.

Chavda said the BJP government had made several efforts to instill patriotism among school students.

""Altering a certain practice will not improve the standard of education,"" he said.

The Congress leader alleged that the quality of primary education was going down in Gujarat.

""The quality is even worse than many other under-developed states. The standard of primary eduction in Gujarat has gone down significantly over the last several years. The BJP government only engages in talks and programmes in the name of improving quality,"" he said.

Chavda asked the state government to rather focus on improving school infrastructure, recruiting teachers to fill the huge backlog of vacancies and ""not forcing teachers to do non-teaching jobs for the government"".

Patidar leader Hardik Patel said, ""The children and youth of Gujarat should not be forced to express their patriotism, as that feeling runs in their blood"".

He said the government should prioritise improving the ""significantly deteriorated"" quality of education in the state.

""Instead of improving the quality of education, the education minister is talking about teaching patriotism to Gujarat's youth and children. He should know that everybody here is born with the feeling of patriotism,"" Patel said.

""This is an attempt to deflect from the right issues. Schools are getting closed. Shortage of teachers is also an important issue,"" the Patidar leader added.

Even as the BJP and opposition parties engage in a verbal duel over the propriety of the move, students PTI spoke with seemed to have no issues with the new directive.

""The concept (of saying 'Jai Hind' or 'Jai Bharat') is very good. Being an Indian, saying 'Jai Bharat' fills us with a sense of pride for our great country. It reminds me of the glorious history of our country's struggle for Independence,"" a student said.

""We are proud of our country's struggle for freedom. The concept is very good and should be accepted by all the schools in the country,"" said another student of a private school.

Meanwhile, the state education minister said the government should be open to accepting ""good suggestions"".

""Jai Bharat and Jai Hind are much better than 'Yes Sir'. Saying 'Jai Hind' or 'Jai Bharat' creates a feeling of patriotism, which is why I have decided to make the changes,"" he told reporters.

Criticising the Gujarat government, state Congress unit president Amit Chavda said the new practice ""will not change the quality of education"" in the government and affiliated schools.

""The BJP government has made several efforts to instill patriotism among school students. Altering a certain practice will not improve the standard of education,"" he said.

Chavda alleged that the quality of primary education is going down in Gujarat. ""The quality is even worse than many other under-developed states,"" he said.

""The standard of primary eduction in Gujarat has gone down significantly over the last several years. The BJP government engages only in talks and programmes in the name of improving quality,"" the Congress leader alleged.

He asked the Gujarat government to focus on improving school infrastructure, recruiting teachers to fill huge backlog of vacancies and ""not forcing teachers to do non-teaching jobs for the government"".

Patidar leader Hardik Patel said the children and youths of Gujarat should not be forced to express their patriotism, ""as that feeling runs in their blood"".

He said the government should prioritise improving the ""significantly deteriorated"" quality of education in the state.

""Instead of improving the quality of education, the education minister is talking about teaching patriotism to Gujarat's youth and children. He should know that everybody here is born with the feeling of patriotism,"" Hardik Patel said.

Nobody has the right to force anybody to say something he/she dislikes, he said.

""This is an attempt to deflect from the right issue. Schools are getting closed. Shortage of teachers is also an important issue,"" Hardik Patel said.

Every year, authorities here announce the closure of schools with the onset of winter in the first week of December.

Closure of schools during winters becomes inevitable here given the very low temperatures and poor infrastructure of our schools which hinders the continuity of academic activities because these institutions San any kind of heating arrangements. Had been our schools equipped with proper heating arrangements, the long winter breaks could have been avoided.

That is not the case here. It will take us hundreds of years to develop our institutions on those lines. If authorities are really sincere enough to elevate our educational standards then such steps and measures should be kept in pipeline for coming future.

Traditionally, Kashmiri parents would arrange tutors for their children to overcome the academic deficit of winters. Some two decades back, winter tuition was preferably carried out in the homes of teachers or qualified unemployed youth. But, now, the concept of private coaching centers has revolutionized the concept of winter tutioning.

This coaching has become a big industry in our valley. I won't talk here about the role and contribution of these coaching centers but I would definitely talk about low access of poor children to these centres. Authorities had probably recognized the fact, and winter tutorials were made operational at selective schools, particularly during the last winter. The move of authorities was hailed by one and all particularly by the parents of the poor children.

Government schoolTeachers were deputed to teach at these centres which had been instrumental in the academic prosperity of the student community. Last year, I was part of such a winter tutorial where many hundred students of our own village and the children of adjacent of villages were taken care off.It had minimized the academic deficit of winters in our schools.

This winter, all the parents and children were waiting for such centres to be made operational. Many parents were in close touch with me for the winter tutioning of their wards. Even I too was anticipating an order in this regard but, alas ! Authorities have either linked the future of our children with unemployment or with the additional remuneration of teachers deputed at these centres. Bizzare and tragic ! The incumbent authorities should have appreciated and acknowledged the teachers deputed at these centres. Remuneration should have been increased.Even Authorities could have made it mandatory for teachers to work in these centres.

No, the case is not so. Teachers have been removed from the assignment. The children of lesser God are waiting for a compassionate direction from authorities but their wish will remain a wish only. Authorities have off late decided to run a few coaching centers in some higher secondary schools but to the utter resentment and surprise of parents, these centres are yet to be made operational. One-third part of the vacations is over. There is no clue of the people who are supposed to teach in these centres. The proposed centre at higher secondary school Naidkhai is just a kilometre away from my residence, and believe me, there is no one to teach the children.Many children from my own neighborhood are repeatedly asking me if the said centre will be made functional or not.

I can't reply them with authority. I wonder if authorities are really sincere enough to elevate our educational standards. I pity the plight of these children who are unconsciously wasting their precious time, playing with glass pebbles or marbles in the streets and alleys of villages.These children are supposed to assume the chairs of teachers, engineers and doctor of our nation. Who is jeopardizing the future of these children and the collective future of our society? Let people open their eyes.

Let people at the helm of affairs revisit their plans and policies. Don't link the education of children with unemployment or money. Let parents know that teachers are hapless to impart the education to their children.

After vacations, the teachers are blamed for all the mess in the department.When children remain out of touch with their books, how can they do well after the reopening of the schools in the March. Children are roaming like sheep and there is no one to take care of them. I don't want monetary benefits for everything. Let authorities force teachers to teach at these centres. I will be the first to volunteer myself for the cause. I hope most of the teachers of our department will turn up as volunteers but at least issue a simple order. Let you bell the cat and I guarantee people that our teachers will not give you any opportunity of complaint. I request parents and the respectable citizens of our society to stop blaming teachers alone. Let people at the helm be made accountable. Intellectuals and respected citizens of our nation must come forward for the rescue of our innocent children. Teachers are ready to face any kind of challenge lest you should test their potential.We are not lazy and shirkers but we lack a proper platform."

From a Kolkata girls' school accusing ten of its students of 'indulging in lesbianism', to Kamaal R Khan making homophobic and transphobic comments on his Youtube channel, to the death of Sridevi, a desi queer icon for most of us Bollywood loving gaysis, 2018 has not been an year of complete euphoria.

2018 has been a mixed bag in terms of our constitution and its laws. While same-sex relationships have finally been decriminalized thanks to Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code being partially struck down, it has been bad for the Indian trans community due to the recent passing of the Transgender Persons Protection of Rights Bill a couple of days back. It has been a long time fighting for Indian gay and lesbian relationships since the reinstating of Section 377 in 2013, and countless petitions by LGBTQ individuals, organizations, and allies against the judgement helped the archaic law to be overturned.

The Transgender Persons Protection of Rights Bill is a huge step back. According to this bill, an Indian trans individual will be required to have an ID, with a thorough 'screening' process on various governmental levels that will certify whether they are trans or not (I find myself shaking my head at this), and sex reassignment surgery (SRS) will be mandatory for all trans individuals. While SRS is a costly procedure in itself, many trans and other gender non-conforming individuals have their own reasons not to undergo the surgery since it is an extremely personal, biological decision. The bill conveniently also does not say anything about creating education and job opportunities for trans Indians, but ironically, criminalizes begging for the community (it is interesting to note that the Indian constitution currently does not criminalize begging under any other law). Also, this bill also enforces that trans individuals get themselves admitted into government approved lodging and rehabilitation institutions, which may be extremely regressive, given that a lot of trans folks are forced to leave their homes in order to escape the abuse meted out to them by family and friends.

On the non-governmental front, however, things seem to be looking up for the trans community in the light of the recent governmental law changes. Godrej India Culture Lab has put out A Manifesto for Trans Inclusion in the Indian Workplace, in association with the Keshav Suri Foundation, Humsafar Trust, Periferry, TWEET Foundation, and Community Business. This could ensure some amount of accountability and safety for the Indian trans people in employment at private organizations. In February, the VLCC Institute announced a free ""Assistant Beauty Therapist"" training course for transgender individuals at its Hyderabad branch out of which over two dozen people have already completed the course. In July, Uber Eats -- the global ride-sharing company's online food delivery subsidiary - hired India's first transgender delivery agent in Chennai. In Kolkata, the Medica Superspecialty Hospital (part of the largest chain of hospitals in eastern India) hired two transgender operating theatre technicians on a six month internship. With such big names taking steps to integrate trans-inclusive policies in recent times, it looks like India Inc is finally waking up to the benefits of diversity and trans-inclusion.

The year has not been completely bereft of its share of homophobia as well. From a Kolkata girls' school accusing ten of its students of 'indulging in lesbianism', to Kamaal R Khan making homophobic and transphobic comments on his Youtube channel, to the death of Sridevi, a desi queer icon for most of us Bollywood loving gaysis, 2018 has not been an year of complete euphoria. However, we have had our small wins compared to our small losses as well. Akkai Padmashali, transwoman and activist, officially registered her marriage with Vasudev V, earlier this year in January, making the union to be the first officially recognized trans marriage. Earlier this year, Prince Manvendra Singh Gohil opened the doors of his palace for ostracized LGBTQ folks seeking home and protection. Many cities such as Jamshedpur and Bhubaneshwar had their first Pride march this year, with previous cities and editions recapping as well. Pride march attendance witnessed a massive increase post the striking down of Section 377, with many queer individuals coming out onto the streets for the first time to celebrate the verdict. Online dating for queer individuals has evolved, with the Delta app, India's first homegrown LGBTQ dating app dropping into the market, as well as Tinder upping their game by adding 23 new categories in the self gender identification, which previously only had male and female in its options.

When it comes to our media, we just received a first look of what may possibly be the first mainstream Bollywood major release (after Fire) with a lesbian couple at its centre, Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga, with Sonam Kapoor playing one of the leads! From the first look of the trailer, it seems to be made with a good and seasoned cast, and what really appeals to me is that the story seems to be set in small town Punjab, which as we all are used to seeing as a hotbed for toxic masculinity and ingrained misogyny in our Bollywood films. Here's to hoping the best for this film! We got our first look at Lihaaf, starring Tannishtha Chatterjee, the cinematic adaptation of the famous lesbian short story by Ismat Chughtai at the India Pavillion at Cannes Film Festival 2018 in May. Apart from this, we also have numerous web series streaming that showcase LGBTQ characters, one of the most recent ones being Selection Day by Netflix, which explores these themes. Priyanka Chopra starred in the Hollywood film A Kid Like Jake, which shows a young child being encouraged by their parents and teachers to explore their non-binary inclinations, among the many international releases this year.

Here's to 10 years of Gaysi, and many more in the years to come. Here's to hoping that 2019 has a better take on our laws, with more inclusion in Bollywood and Indian media beyond, with lesser hate crimes on gaysis. I, for one, would like to see more queer collectives grow and bloom in colleges and other institutions, seeing how the IIT queer collective, Pravriti, had such a pivotal role in the decriminalization of Section 377 this year. Now that some laws have changed, and some more need to be changed, let's hope for sensitization towards the LGBTQ community on a grassroots level from the new year onwards."

Class 10 students in Kashmir's Pulwama & Shopian districts excelled with highest pass percentage, even though schools there were closed for more than 100 days.

New Delhi: Community schooling and continuous efforts by the locals is what led to excellent Class 10 results in south Kashmir's Pulwama and Shopian districts, the most disturbed region in the Kashmir Valley last year, say local residents and students.

The Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education (JKBOSE) announced the Class 10 results for Kashmir division on Saturday, and Pulwama and Shopian districts in south Kashmir recorded the highest pass percentage. While Pulwama recorded a pass percentage of 84.5 per cent, the pass percentage in Shopian was 83 per cent. Both these figures are higher than that of Srinagar, which recorded a pass percentage of 81.9 per cent.

The overall pass percentage in Kashmir this year was 75.44, compared to 62.94 last year.

According to the state government data, in 2018, schools in Pulwama district were shut for 170 days and, in Shopian they were closed for 118 days by the administration due to fear of disturbance. This shutdown was apart from the number of regular holidays that the students got.

During the 2016 unrest in Kashmir following the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani, 32 school buildings were burnt and most of them were in south Kashmir. In 2017, the HRD Ministry had devised a roadmap for Kashmir to improve the education scenario in the state. Construction of school buildings was also a part of the ministry's plan. However, no construction has happened so far in Pulwama and Shopian districts.

While the district administration credited the government's efforts for the results, school teachers said it was largely because of the intervention by the local residents.

""Schools were shut down for most part of the academic year and there was no way they could have completed their syllabus. It was largely because the locals ran community schools for students in several parts of the districts, that they were able to study,"" said Masood Taing, a teacher at a government school in Shopian.

Community schools are like coaching classes, where a couple of teachers gather to teach students either at somebody's home or a community centre, depending on availability. There are more community schools in rural Kashmir than in urban areas.

""We used to study at home most of the time because schools were shut. We used to write down all the doubts and clarify them with our teachers when schools reopened. Community schools also shut down during curfew in the town, (but) they were mostly open in villages,"" said Abid Hassan, a student from Pulwama district who scored 88 per cent.

Reham Mir, who scored 90 per cent marks, also said he studied at home and with the help of a community school.

Malik Mohammad, a resident of Pulwama, praised the efforts of the students in south Kashmir.

""Schools were closed for more than five months in Pulwama district. How can one expect students to finish their syllabus? Despite all these odds they have managed to study and not just study, get excellent results. All of this is because they are self-motivated and get help from locals who run community schools,"" Mohammad said.

""Students from south Kashmir are traditionally known to be excellent in studies because they know that they will not get support from schools, so they have to be self-dependent,"" he added.

G.N. Itoo, director of school education, gave all the credit to students. ""Despite all the problems students have shown excellent results in Shopian and Pulwama. They are all very hard-working students,"" he said.

The feat comes as another feather in the cap of Bengaluru government schools, where science and maths are no longer dreaded by students, thanks to initiatives like setting up of STEM (science technology engineering mathematics) laboratories in the institutions by NGOs and volunteers.

""I have designed a smokeless train using solar panels. I am experimenting with wind energy to make it faster and more efficient,"" said Ravi Kumar D, a class 7 student from the Hebbal school. The other winners are Mithun from class 6, who came up with a waste management model, and Anil and Vasant Kumar from class 8, whose project was based on wind energy.

""Our students were on a par with their private school counterparts, who have access to good science labs,"" said Umme Salma, science teacher at the government school.

The school has had a science lab for long but it was not used due to shortage of time and logistics. Mobile science labs began visiting the school and teachers started holding classes at a science centre set up on the campus by an NGO. The enhanced quality of education reflected in the numbers -- admissions went up from 425 in 2017 to 535 in 2018.

""When we started mobile science labs for students in government schools, the excitement to learn was palpable. Some of the kids are quick learners. That's what made us set up this centre. Students from 10 nearby government schools can visit the centre, innovate and experiment,"" said Dilip Gowda, head of the science centre set up in the school by Agastya International Foundation.

The foundation runs about eight science centres in government schools in Immadihalli, Electronics City, Yelahanka, Sarjapur Road and Kengeri, among other places.

Ramesh Atloori, son of a construction worker and resident of a 100sq ft tenement in Viveknagar, has two foreign jaunts to his credit. In 2016, he represented a robotics team at Robocup International in Leipzig, Germany, and he visited Japan the next year to take part in the event's 2017 edition. He was accompanied by his schoolmates Aravind Reddy, Ramakrishna and Lawrence Aga, who have a similar background like his. ""It was a dream come true. It was our teacher's motivation which took us to these places,"" said Ramesh.

The quartet was from Seva Bharath Trust Government Telugu Higher Primary School, Viveknagar, and was drawn to robotics during their STEM education classes.

Sridhar P, an IISc graduate, who left his cushy job to train government school students in robotics, has taken students from six government institutions to international competitions. ""STEM labs help in students' overall development, instilling qualities like peer learning, leadership and creativity in them. They give students the confidence that they can make something work. They also connect science and maths to real-world problems. Unconsciously, the students become computer literate too,"" said Sridhar.

""Thanks to the robotics project we started on a pilot basis in Seva Bharath Trust Government Telugu Higher Primary School, students wanted to spend more time in class. They created LEGO robots, a humanoid and what not. Students are bright enough to grasp concepts; it's all about giving them access,"" said Sushmita Ananth from Akshara Foundation.

Vandana P, a teacher from RT Nagar Government School, said that lack of access to labs and rote learning of science with focus on theory make students fear the subject.

""When students are made to do experiments their textbooks cite, they begin to love the subject,"" said Praveen Kumar from Swami Vivekanand Youth Movement, which is currently teaching STEM in 25 primary and 25 high schools in Bengaluru and Dharwad each."

Union Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar had announced earlier this year that the content of National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) books being taught in schools will be reduced by half in the coming years to ease the burden on students.

Following the announcement, the NCERT constituted a committee to work out where and how the syllabus can be cut, and the panel has now submitted its report to the council.

Sources in the NCERT say that while it is not possible to reduce the syllabus by half, they are working on reducing portions wherever possible.

For the exercise, the HRD ministry had also invited suggestions from the public, with everyone from parents to teachers, and even people interested in the field of education, encouraged to weigh in.

The government received more than one lakh suggestions.

According to sources, while a large number of people said the syllabus should be reduced by 50 per cent, many others suggested a calculated approach not driven by this target.

Some people, meanwhile, suggested increasing the syllabus in some of the subjects, especially science, to bring it on a par with international standards, the sources said.

The NCERT is now studying the suggestions of the panel as well as the public to finalise the cuts.

A comparison of the syllabus for the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (ICSE), which includes some NCERT books, and that of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), where they form the bulk of the curriculum, shows that the latter is anyway lighter.

The hike will be in the range of 4-25 % and is expected to garner the state government an additional revenue of Rs 500 crore annually.

The major hike will be for premium and mid-sized Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) in the range of 20-25 % while small brands will face a hike of just 5 %.

Foreign liquor brands will face a duty of around 4% now.

The state government on Monday issued a notification to amend the Maharashtra Potable Liqour Rules, 1996 to make way for this hike.

Justifying the hike, an excise department official, who did not want to be named, said that the duty has been raised after five years and nine months. ""We have hiked the duty after a detailed study. This should not add too much of a burden and things will stabilise in the coming months,"" he said. The official explained that some brands such as Antiquity, Royal Stag, Teachers and VAT 69, going by their current manufacturing costs, were likely to see a bigger hike.

Some of the smaller brands like Haywards and Bagpiper, however, would not see much of a price hike. ""We have deliberately kept the low segment IMFL and foreign liquor taxes low as this would have encouraged more smuggling from neighbouring states like Goa and Daman,"" he added. The reason was that the price difference between the states is very high and this encourages many to smuggle from other states.

However, liquor shops are not happy with the hike saying it will hurt their business. ""Our daily turnover will reduce by this move and it will also hit our profits,"" said a senior office bearer of Association of Progressive Retail Liquor Vendors, who also did not want to be named.

The state government gets Rs7,000 in revenue as excise duty annually. With the state's finances under a severe crunch due to a farm-loan waiver, seventh pay commission and recent removal of surcharge on fuel, the state is hoping that this duty hike can make up for the losses."

The farmers refused to let the cows free and allow school to run in a desperate protest to gain administration's attention to deal with the stray cattle problem. This was the third incident reported from the region in the past few days. On December 27, cattle had replaced students in classrooms in Ghanshyampur Katra of Sachendi area in the district. The same day, villagers also locked up stray cows in a police outpost in Bharthana area of Etawah.

Devi said, ""I tried to convince the farmers but they refused to unlock the school. They said they will continue to lock the animals in government buildings -- hospitals and even police stations till authorities find a permanent solution to the menace of stray cattle. The school couldn't be opened and teachers and students returned home.""

Block education officer (BEO) Sunil Dwivedi said the matter has been brought to the knowledge of senior officials.

""Such action will only hamper studies of farmers' children, apart from the cattle damaging school property. If farmers do not relent, we'll seek police help to clear the school of cattle..."", also seeing ""handiwork of anti-social elements with vested interests"".

The bizarre protest comes at a time when CM Yogi Adityanath directed officials concerned to make immediate arrangements for proper care of stray cows."

What emerges is that systemic violence and discrimination against women, especially in rural areas, runs deep, and goes beyond just the sexual.

Bundelkhand, as of late 2018, is poor, dry and stuck in a paralysis of governance, far from the 'feel good' narratives that most state-sponsored PR and blindsided patriotism seems buoyed by. Things are not getting better here, but things are also not the same. Cheap internet connections and smartphones are aglow in villages that dot the barren ghats. Women are at work, 'lower castes' are in public spaces, changing and redefining them. Large bribes are paid so that the women of the family can be teachers and nurses, earning hefty permanent salaries, and supporting unemployed male members.

But what of the dark lining below these stories of social and economic change? What does the workplace look like for these women who are resetting centuries of gender, class and caste oppression? Can they speak truth to power as we hear women in other places speaking? Or is silence a small price for the slow-moving liberties that they have gained? What shape can #MeToo take here?

I. Rajkumari*, 25, Journalist

The editorial structure of the media here is shaped like an inverted pyramid, with the number of paid editorial staff reducing to a pinpoint as you go lower and deeper into up country or rural locations, and where advertising revenues are slim. Large media corporations may have stringers, who, since they are not on the payroll, work for multiple organisations, and double as advertising agents with revenue targets and hefty commissions. In this game of mobility, networking, insecure finances, blackmail and political and administrative power brokering, women are rarely seen or heard. The ones who are, are treated with some curiosity and a lot of lewd relish.

Her Story

He made it impossible for me to go to the administrative offices.

Everyone was under his thumb.

No one would speak to me.

I stopped reporting.

Rajkumari never finished school, and in her late teens when she had the opportunity to be trained as a professional journalist, she took it. A Dalit, her family has had few avenues of livelihood, and there were many sisters to support. Rajkumari began working as a reporter. After her marriage, her marital family wasn't supportive of her 'gallivanting about' at unpredictable hours, and so she had to leave.

Years of economic and domestic strife later, she pleaded her way back to journalism. She began to work in the Ajaygarh block of Panna district in Madhya Pradesh, a short bus ride across the border from her village in Banda. Rajkumari saw no other women reporting, as she began to establish herself in her new beat, familiarising herself with villages, panchayat level workers and local influencers. When she went to the block office to question a few relevant officials on her first lot of stories, she was accompanied by a colleague, a senior reporter. It was clear immediately that the block office was controlled by one man, Ram Milan Pande, the Block Pramukh. (The Block Pramukh is the highest level of elected official at the block level.) Panchayat elections are both overtly and implicitly political, and Pande was a longstanding Congressman, with strong influence in the region. He had ambitions of running for an MLA position, in the upcoming Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections, and he saw Rajkumari, a young, confident and mobile woman in the area, as a creative tool for campaigning. ""He was pretty friendly and quite aged, must have been more than 50 years old,"" Rajkumari's colleague Rajni told us.

In the weeks after, as Rajkumari began to report independently, she was a frequent visitor to the block headquarters. This was when Pande 'started sharing things with Rajkumari to win her confidence'. Well aware that this was par for the course, she suffered Pande's overtures just to get her stories done. But then, one morning in July this year, at the block to interview Pande for a story, Rajkumari's repeated requests were ignored. There was a meeting on she was told, and many officials from the block were present. Pande dealt with the issues at hand, and slowly, the room emptied out, leaving Rajkumari alone with him. He asked her to wait, have tea, he wanted to speak to her about something. He said he would pay for her fuel costs, and she should do some campaigning for him in the block. When she backed away, he grabbed her hand and said,""Not a leaf in this area moves without me. I'll have your newspaper shut down.""

Rajkumari left the office.

In the weeks that passed, she wasn't entertained by any official in the block, none of her requests for interviews or bytes were acknowledged. She slowly stopped reporting in the area.

Within a month, citing domestic reasons, Rajkumari left work again.

II. Seema*, 25, lawyer and activist

Dalit politics in Uttar Pradesh has been a dirty, petty thing, resulting in deep and complex shifts in caste dynamics and social structures in the region over the last three decades. One important historical factor was the establishment of the Bahujan Samaj party in 1984 by Kanshiram, and its mobilisation in Uttar Pradesh. Kanshiram's successor, Mayawati, played a key role in the grassroots mobilisation and spread of an empowering Dalit politics in the state. Increasing political awareness worked alongside policies (including affirmative action for 'other backward castes') that benefited the 'lower' castes in Uttar Pradesh, significantly differently from other north Indian states. Youth in Uttar Pradesh have grown up in this atmosphere of political and social opportunism and opportunity, both frustrated and buoyed at the promises of political emancipation, as well as disappointed by the poverty and unemployment that deep-rooted gender and caste based discrimination still has them trapped in.

Her Story

If I say that I was wrong, people will say I brought it on myself, through my own actions.

I can't name people in the party (BSP) who have abused me. It will give the party a bad name. But many have. They've posted abuse on Facebook, photos and comments. If they see this Dalit girl stepping beyond her boundaries, they do everything they can to pull you down.

Seema was married at 13, in a village that was shadowed by the threat of the notorious 'Babli Kol daku' of Bundelkhand. She is Dalit, and like many Dalit parents, hers brought her up to value education above anything else. She studied even after she was married, and despite resistance from her in-laws, got a job in the labour department in Chitrakoot. Her friendship with a distant relative proved to be a lifelong trauma for Seema, as the boy, observant of her ambitions and perseverance, took photos and posted them online, in the early days of Facebook, resulting in public shame and the end of Seema's marriage. He would call her from different numbers, blackmail her, even come to her home and abuse her. Work became more and more important for Seema to survive both personal strife and economic upheaval,""When I have scars, I lie and say I fell from the roof. Even though everyone in my mohalla knows I'm being harassed and abused, everyone knows I'm being used. Now if he says something or does something, I won't stay quiet. I will fight back. If I don't fight, what hope is there for the next generation? Even though I feel that I'm so aware, I've had to bear so much.""

Meera lives in the district headquarters now, and has been studying law and running her own practice in the district court in Chitrakoot. Over the years, to cope with public and domestic abuse, she has networked with women's groups, political parties and bureaucracy, to help her along the thorny path of a Dalit woman trying to get by in the world. The more mobile and aware she is, the more the forces seem to close-in to throttle her. The district court in Karwi, Chitrakoot, is a sea of upper caste men fighting to maintain the status quo, and make a quick buck as and when they can. ""You know how it is, when you should charge 50, they charge 100; when they should charge 500, they charge a 1000,"" she says. Enter Seema, young, slight, Dalit, smart and articulate.""When I go into the courts, and see women testifying about rape, and see what questions and comments they have to face, the filthy abuse, so loud and aggressive, I understand how someone would be driven to say, it didn't happen, I wasn't raped, I've filed a false case - even if that is entirely untrue. I've seen this happen.""

Last year, her Facebook account was hacked and controversial videos and posts were circulated from it, causing her great stress and public shame.""They plant their people in cyber cafes to watch which Dalit girls are coming and what their Facebook IDs are. And then they post objectionable videos and photos from your accounts. I couldn't eat for days, I was terrified my parents would find out, and commit suicide. But if you work in an office, you have to compromise. People will say, 'Bring us tea, if we come to your home, won't you serve us tea?' And you ignore them, else, how will you feed your children?""

Even as a politically conscious and mobile young woman, Meera is not enough for the forces of gender, caste and feudal power that conspire to hold her down in the world.

III. Susheela*, 53, Auxillary Nurse Midwife

The Auxillary Nurse Midwife or ANM is a permanent or contractual government health worker located in a village level sub-centre. She is responsible for catering to the basic healthcare needs as well as childbirth for a population of 5000. The ANM is a salaried worker, and has a joint account with the village pradhan, into which she receives a fund of Rs 10,000, for various equipment or tasks. The job of an ANM is a prestigious one. It also involves being beholden to a network of village and block level officials, health department staff and politicians. The ANM is crucial to the system of maternal and community healthcare, but is also a woman embroiled in the highly corrupt and chimerical world of local politics and bureaucracy.

Her Story

I was abused.

Let me tell you the story.

It was the 25th of September.

I was at the Panchayat Bhavan.

It's been four months, but every time I think of that incident and those people I become a mess.

It was evening, most people had left. I was waiting for my son to take me home.

My husband is dead, people know I am alone.

Susheela has worked as an ANM for the past 18 years in a remote area of Bundelkhand's Banda district, surrounded by mountains and forests, and regularly visited by dacoits.""You can go to any family in this area and ask about my credentials, if I have ever had a complaint against me,"" Susheela says. She does not stop weeping throughout our interview. Through her tears, Susheela explains the topography of her area of work, through the network of men she must 'work' with -- the sarpanch, local BJP leaders, the Chief Medical Officer, doctors, police superintendent, constables, and local thugs.

As a long-term government employee of the area, she is regularly asked to pay the pradhan ""for expenses of the party, I don't even know what the party is and what they want the money for"". The money that comes into her (joint) account, recently for sanitation tasks in the health centre, is paid to the pradhan. On the fateful evening she describes, Susheela was asking the pradhan to sign in her register to acknowledge she had given him the money -- Rs 8,000.""There were many people around, but I only recognised the three of them, the pradhan, his brother, and the (BJP) treasurer. They began to abuse me loudly, beat their chests. They grabbed my register and tore it, looked at me in a way that terrified me. So many people saw, but no one said a word. Isn't this molestation?""

Susheela went into shock, but later that evening, called the local police station.""They told me I should have dialled 100. I said I wasn't feeling well. Then I spoke to the CMO. Within a day, they had arranged to get me transferred. They don't want me creating trouble."" For months, Susheela resisted this transfer away from her family, her government housing and her familiar area -- at the age of 53.""They told me to go from one official to the other, one doctor to another -- each wants a cut. How can a woman be tormented like this? People ask me to pay them money, then circulate these rumours that I extract money from people. Ask anyone whether I ever did any wrong. The SP, DIG or the Mahila Aayog hasn't heard me out."" She went into a kind of trauma, still visible in her broken, rambling speech. She hasn't been paid a salary in four months, since the incident took place. She received death threats from the pradhan and his brother, and calls from the local police station -- ""Madam, thane mei aakar FIR kar dijiye"" -- calls she recognised as barely concealed threats if she didn't 'compromise'.""Why will I file a case? I need to live in this area. I want my posting cancelled.""

As of 19 December, her transfer has been nullified. She has been reinstated to the sub-centre where she has been working for 18 years, where she slowly adjusts to living in fear.""I haven't slept in four months. I feel like I should call the BJP (party workers, media) and kill myself in front of them.""

This will be his second visit to Palamu in a month.

During his hour-long visit, Modi will lay the foundation stone for the project and also address a public meeting, thus virtually kicking-off the BJP's campaign for the 2019 general elections. As per the schedule, Modi will be in Palamu between 10:30 am and 11:30 am. The rally will be organised at Chiyanki Airport Grounds.

The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has claimed that about 80,000 people will attend the Prime Minister's rally. Chief Minister Raghubar Das and BJP's Jharkhand unit president Laxman Gilua will be present on the occasion.

Meanwhile, the local administration said that leaves of all government officials have been cancelled and the camp office has been set up at the venue. Palamu SP Inderjeet Mahtha said that he has personally inspected the ground and assured that all security measures will be adopted in view of Modi's visit.

According to a report in The Indian Express, police have issued an order banning the use of black clothes by those attending the Prime Minister's event. There are reports that contractual teachers could protest during the event to press for their demand to regularise them.

The Mandal Dam project is a very ambitious project for both Bihar and Jharkhand. Once the dam is ready, it will benefit people of Palamu, Garhwa, Latehar districts of Jharkhand and Gaya, Aurangabad districts of Bihar. The foundation stone of the dam was laid in 1970 when Karpuri Thakur was the CM of Bihar. The work on the project was expected to be over by 1989 but in 1998-99, the work was stopped after Maoists attacked the workers killing one engineer."

This year the school education sector in Punjab certainly saw some ups even as the last quarter of 2018 was marked by two-month-long protests by Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and RMSA teachers from October.

As the contractual teachers protested against the state government's decision to regularise 8,886 teachers, but with pay cut, as many as 2,265 government schools saw a facelift with world-class infrastructure. Also the students of several government schools set unprecedented examples of their IQ level. And last, but not the least, English, the subject, in which maximum number of students fail in the final exams of Punjab School Education Board, is no more dreaded in many government schools now.

The schools were given a facelift under 'Smart School Project' launched by the government. Crores have been spent on attractive clean buildings, smart classrooms, computer rooms, hygienic toilets, playgrounds, drinking water facilities and colourful premises. Government, however, has not spent from its pocket, but motivated individual donors, Non-government Organisations (NGOs), charitable trusts, firms, and Non-resident Indians to financially help the schools.

Even Director General School Education-cum-Project Director Parshant Goyal had written to several NGOs, charitable trusts and firms to contribute towards digital classrooms, laboratories and toilets, provide books in libraries, uniforms to the students, create infrastructure for Midday Meals and sports, install solar power plants and Reverse Osmosis system and any way that the donor or the school deemed fit.

Education Secretary Krishan Kumar confirmed the infrastructure in 2,265 schools have already been improved and by the end of this academic session, a total of 4,250 institutes will be covered. He said some 100 teachers of Punjab are supporting them hugely by motivating people.

""With the contribution of such people and organisations, it will become a sustainable model of community ownership and accountability,"" said he, adding the government will provide support on pedagogy, ways of teaching, resolving specific problems etc. ""It will enhance the performance of the government schools in every possible manner. We will cover all 20,000 government schools in a few years,"" said he.

Several government schools, including government middle schools at Rajgarh village (Ludhiana), Malwa and Nawanshahr, have already started getting applications from people in advance for reservation of seats for their wards for the next session, revealed the education secretary. ""Two government school teachers in Nawanshahr have got admitted their wards,"" said he.

""It is a dream come true for us as we belong to poor families and haven't even thought of having access to facilities like e-content, computer labs and libraries,"" said one Kamljit Kaur of Kishangarh village in Mansa district. Along with the infrastructure, the education standard has also started improving. The students of Government Primary School, Jhangerian, in Nurpur Bedi block of Ropar district, have set an example. Several students of this schools have memorised the names of all 117 Assembly segments, 13 Lok Sabha constituencies, names of several countries with their respective capitals, that of Punjabi and Indian English writers, Indian scientists, Indian festivals, national holidays and neighbouring countries. The Class I children of this school have memorised tables up to 20, while as per syllabus, they need to learn just up to 5.

Education secretary has also uploaded the videos of these children on social media. ""Under Parho Paunjab Project, we have designed several programmes and now our students are speaking in English without any hesitation and several schools have started conducting prayers in English now,"" said District Mentor of English, Chander Shekhar.

Even, a renowned missionary-run convent school, St Francis in Batala (Gurdaspur district) had invited the government school students during a Science and maths fair recently. ""The government school students explained maths and science equations in fluent English to their convent counterparts,"" said Principal of St Francis School, P J Joseph."

Ahead of the State-wide plastic ban on January 1, the local body established 16 plastic collection centres to celebrate 'No plastic New Year and Bhogi'. Several members of resident welfare associations, school students and traders visited the stalls and exchanged their single-use plastic materials including spoons, flags, plastic covers and polythene bags.

Those residents who bought their material in bulk received tiffin boxes as additional gifts. Some resident welfare associations pro-actively handed out saplings to the participants of the exchange.

V. Muthupandi, a businessman from Teachers Colony, said that residents participated with lot of enthusiasm in his area. ""Unless such initiatives are organised by the government, public may not know about such initiatives. Though change from plastic to other materials will be slow, it will be effective. We hope to see more awareness campaigns in the future,"" he said.

Corporation Commissioner S. Aneesh Sekhar who distributed bags at MGR Bus Stand said that the Tamil Nadu Government's move to ban plastic would help in the protection of the environment, reduce littering and even save waterbodies in Madurai. ""Residents should begin switching from plastic bags to cloth, jute and biodegradable alternatives as it becomes illegal to use single-use plastic from January 1. People are still using non-woven bags but this too has been banned. We hope the message reaches the people,"" he said.

He added that the Corporation often managed to collect mounds of plastic waste during their cleanliness drives on the Vaigai river bank.

""Plastic bags often lead to soil degradation and do not allow groundwater percolation. With the support of the public and trade bodies, we can make a significant difference,"" he said.

He also said that cloth bags should be reused and citizens should take carriers to restaurants for their takeaways to prevent use of plastic in the future."

Though some or most parts of that ideology may not be adhered to, the very fact that a proper ideology and/or action programme has been formulated shows that the party hierarchy is wedded to what has been enumerated. Moreover, political parties with long years of struggle have better and wider experience of nation building though the leadership may not have the required experience of what needs to be done for the masses, i.e. the right strategy for development.

The right priorities for ensuring development for the major section of the population is obviously the key and not just calculating GDP growth on wrong assumptions and data. The crisis plaguing the Government on the economic front lies in lack of infrastructure development and investment in the farm sector. This is being echoed again and again by economists of all shades and more so after the results of the recent elections.

On the social front, the country cannot be allowed to be divided on communal or religious lines. We are a secular country and population belonging to whatever religion, sect, caste or class should enjoy same benefits and allowed to stay without any fear on their rights and privileges. In a functional democracy, every individual should have rights to voice their opinion, which may be critical to the policies advocated by the party in power.

It is a well known fact that the poor and impoverished are at the receiving end and the present situation has accentuated the crisis. Lack of proper governance and wanton corruption is manifest all around to aid the rich and the powerful in all matters.

In this connection, it may be pertinent to refer to the poor social infrastructure in the rural countryside on India considered an emerging economy. This is manifest from a recent report of Niti Aayog titled Strategy for New [email protected], it has rightly been pointed out that expenditure in education has to be increased to six per cent of GDP which has been echoed by educationists for quite some time. The report suggested testing teachers tri-annually on the same test designed for their students and putting greater emphasis on continuous and comprehensive evaluation to boost education outcomes.

In the health sector, the report highlighted shortage of doctors, nurses and paramedics and called for reforms and regulation of medical education to raise number of doctors and specialists. The document rightly suggested achieving a doctor-population ratio of at least 1:1400 against the WHO norm of 1:1000 and nurse population ratio of at least 1:500 by 2022-23. It also proposed generating at least 1.5 million jobs in the public health sector by 2022-23, a large number of which may employ women.

The pitiable condition of health centres in most villages, specially in the North and Central India is also there not to speak of sub-divisional hospitals. These are places where the poor and the economically weaker sections and also the low income groups go for treatment but are frustrated at the state of affairs there. It is imperative for the policy makers to ponder over the matter before thinking of bullet trains and modernising airports which are all aimed at the upper echelons of society. In this connection, the Niti Aayog document has suggested incentivising State governments to invest in creating a dedicated cadre for public health at the State, district and block levels and including Ayush into the mainstream.

Coming to the political parties, the BJP has performed in a rather poor manner, both in the social and economic front. Primarily it has antagonised the minorities, specially the Muslims and encroached on their lifestyles and food habits. Moreover, the dalits, the scheduled castes and tribes have felt betrayed due to lack of concern for these backward castes. In fact, there is social chaos all around but more distressing is that there are apprehensions of the intrinsic unity being eroded.

The scenario all around is one of mistrust and hatred coupled with lack of freedom of expression. Dissent is not tolerated by most political parties with BJP leading the way. Unfortunately, this has never happened in the country before and most intellectuals are frustrated with the attitude of the ruling party at the Centre.

The Congress with its glorious past may be the only national alternative in the present state of affairs. With its right ideological moorings - most of which it may not have been followed - is well geared to take the country in the right track and save it from being divided on religious, caste and class lines. There may have been failures in the past but learning from its past experience it appears that the party may follow the right approach in future. However, one needs to mention here that the Left parties have also consistently followed an ideological path but their influence and acceptance has all along been concentrated to three States, namely West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura.

However, it needs to be pointed out that the Congress has to invent a new imagination, a new India of ideas which is civilisational and relevant to present day needs. It cannot be just another opposition but a dream of an alternative India. This demands a ground-level approach and a hard amount of radical intellectual thinking going beyond the unnecessary of Right and Left. The party has to aggregate new pluralism of various segments -- peasant, farmers, tribe, elderly, youth, unemployed and the exploited teacher, the obsolescent technologist -- into a coherent holism, not into a mechanical grid of patriotism and nationalism that is being evident presently.

The most important aspect in this regard is adhering to decentralisation, which was advocated by none other than Mahatma Gandhi long ago. It was the Congress which brought the 73 and 74 amendments empowering the panchayats and it is now time to give more power to these and ensure proper economic decentralisation. Moreover, there is need to involve the masses in the decision-making process at the grass root levels so that their requirements are not dictated from above. The Congress, in keeping with Gandhi's philosophy, needs to come up with ideas and values of the ashram which complements the policy thinking of think tanks and use it for formulating the right developmental strategy.

If proper emphasis is given to the rural sector - specially to agricultural development and promotion of cottage and small industries at the block levels, then the face of the villages may improve, providing employment opportunities to the rural youth. Though the Congress has been accused of urban bias in Indian planning, it is time that now this trend would be reversed in greater interest. There is the example of China, which concentrated on development of rural infrastructure for rapid growth of the country.

Finally, keeping in view the right priorities of development at this juncture, in the New Year the Congress has to follow the left of the centre stance in policy-making and development concerns to ensure that the poor and the weaker sections get an opportunity to improve their incomes and lifestyles. If necessary, collaboration with the Leftist parties in welfare matters would not be a bad idea till the scenario improves. This has to be the cornerstone of the party in the future, if it is successful in the coming Lok Sabha elections. -- INFA"

This is a list of ten articles that were read the most on The Wire in 2018. They were on topics as diverse as the depiction of women in Bollywood, media exposés, the PM's Research Fellowship and the realities of the education system in India. And they're worth revisiting on this last day of the year: for a snapshot of 2018's most popular preoccupations.

1. 'At The End of Your Magnum Opus... I Felt Reduced to a Vagina - Only'

In an open letter to director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, actor Swara Bhaskar spelled out how his movie Padmaavat glorified Jauhar and Sati, and reduced women to simply being ""walking talking vaginas"". Condoning such practices at a time when 'honour' killings and the practice of Female Genital Mutilation only aid in propelling patriarchal, misogynist and problematic ideas is a mistake, she argues.

Practices like Sati, Jauhar, FGM, Honour Killings should not be glorified because they don't merely deny women equality, they deny women personhood. They deny women humanity. They deny women the right to life. And that is wrong. One would have assumed that in 2018, this is not a point that even needs to be made; but apparently, it does. Surely, you wouldn't consider making a film glorifying FGM or Honour Killings!

The context of art, any art is the time and place when it was created and consumed. And that's why this gang-rape infested India, this rape condoning mindset, this victim blaming society is the actual context of your film, Sir. Surely in this context, you could have offered some sort of a critique of Sati and Jauhar in your film?

2. Cobrapost Sting: Big Media Houses Say Yes to Hindutva, Black Money, Paid News

Second on the list is a deep dive into the Cobrapost exposé which revealed how some of the biggest names in the Indian media agreed to business proposals by an undercover reporter seeking the promotion of the Hindutva agenda.

For the sting, an undercover journalist, Pushp Sharma, posed as ""Acharya Atal"", a man who identified himself as a representative of an unnamed ""sangathan"", or organisation, but who gave the impression that he was a member of or close to the Nagpur-based Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS).

The biggest name to be stung by Cobrapost was Times Group owner and managing director Vineet Jain. In a number of videotaped conversations, Jain and the group's executive president, Sanjeev Shah, can be seen and heard discussing the proposed deal in which Acharya Atal said he would pay Rs 500 crore in exchange for advertorials and events that that would be presented as programming on Krishna and the Bhagvad Gita but which would serve as a cover for Hindutva and its political agenda.

3. Why I Am Resigning From the BJP

In an open letter to the BJP, Shivam Shankar Singh, who worked on the BJP's election campaigns in the Northeast, broke down why he could not support the BJP any more even though he had believed Narendra Modi was a ray of hope in 2014.

Hindu khatre mein hai - they've ingrained it into the minds of people that Hindus and Hinduism are in danger, and that Modi is the only option to save ourselves. In reality Hindus have been living the same lives much before this government and nothing has changed except people's mindset. Were we Hindus in danger in 2007? At least I didn't hear about it everyday and I see no improvement in the condition of Hindus, just more fear mongering and hatred.

Speak against the government and you're anti-national and more recently, anti-Hindu. Legitimate criticism of the government is shut up with this labelling. Prove your nationalism, sing Vande Mataram everywhere (even though BJP leaders don't know the words themselves, they'll force you to sing it!). I'm a proud nationalist and my nationalism won't allow me to let anyone force me to showcase it. I will sing the national anthem and national song with pride when the occasion calls for it, or when I feel like it, but I won't let anyone force me to sing it based on their whims.

4. With Ministers Like These, Every Day Must Be Science Day

There's a lot that India can do to improve the cause of science within its borders and but doesn't because of the way it thinks about the subject. Perhaps the most notable example is Science Day itself - one day reserved to celebrating science when in fact that should be every day. Its historical basis doesn't inspire much confidence either.

We're not faced with a group of ministers bungling their jobs but a group that knows exactly what it's doing: angle for what they say is the 'national interest', and force everything else to tag along. By cornering our reasons to celebrate science into the confines of a single workday, we're at risk of abetting what our ministers are doing: abdicating responsibilities towards science on other days.

... Science is an everyday endeavour; celebrate it, scrutinise it, share it, demand it on every day of the year. Just the same way marking 'Earth Hour' is doing nothing to help Earth if you're not going to have environmentally conscious daily routines, you might as well not mark 'Science Day' if you're going to mark it on just one day.

5. Why Modi Walked Out in 2007 and the BJP Now Shuns Me

In the fifth spot is an excerpt from Karan Thapar's book Devil's Advocate: The Untold Story that told the complete tale of his infamous interview with Narendra Modi in 2007 where the future prime minister ended the interview abruptly when Thapar raised questions about the 2002 Gujarat riots.

'Why can't you say that you regret the killings that happened? Why can't you say maybe the government should have done more to protect Muslims?'

'What I have to say I have said at that time, and you can find out my statements.'

'Just say it again.'

'Not necessary I have to talk about in 2007 everything you want to talk about.'

'But by not saying it again, by not letting people hear the message repeatedly, you are allowing an image that is contrary to the interest of Gujarat to continue. It's in your hands to change it.'

Right through the two or three minutes this exchange lasted, Narendra Modi's face remained expressionless. But it was also clear he wasn't happy. His eyes were cold and hard. Perhaps he was making an effort to keep his face calm and steady. But now his patience or, perhaps, his resolve snapped. He had had enough and ended the interview. With the words 'I have to rest. I need some water' he started to take the microphone off.

6. Exclusive: Punya Prasun Bajpai Reveals the Story Behind His Exit From ABP News

In an explosive exclusive in August, former ABP News anchor Punya Prasun Bajpai wrote about the circumstances of his departure from the channel and the official diktats which preceded it.

Say, a channel does not confine itself to showing the Modi regime in a positive light at all times but occasionally includes stories with a negative tone or, on the basis of facts, shows the Modi government's truth to be a lie. Immediately, BJP spokespersons are told to stop appearing on those channels; that is, they do not participate in any political discussion conducted by that channel.

This started happening on ABP News from the last week of June this year - BJP spokespersons stopped appearing on its debates. A few days later, BJP leaders stopped giving bytes to the channel. The day the truth of the Prime Minister's 'Mann ki Baat' was outed on Masterstroke, RSS ideologues too were told to stay off the channel.

7. IAS Officer Being 'Taught a Lesson' for Taking on Modi, Says Family

At the seventh position is a story by Gaurav Vivek Bhatnagar that blew the lid off the harassment faced by an IAS officer in Gujarat for having acted against Narendra Modi.

IAS officer Pradeep Sharma spent another day in Sabarmati central jail in Ahmedabad on Friday even as his son is getting married in the United States since a special anti-corruption court in Bhavnagar on March 27 denied him bail - both regular as well as temporary for a week - to view his son's wedding from India via a video link, and the high court too refused an urgent hearing in the matter.

A close relative of Sharma insisted that the family was clear in its mind that Pradeep Sharma - who has seen 10 FIRs being filed against him over the last eight years - has suffered all these years ""because of that girl"" who is at the centre of what has come to be known as the Snoopgate scandal.

8. Can't Find 'Vikas' or #AccheDin? Check Narendra Modi's Twitter Timeline

Next is Karnika Kohli's unravelling of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Twitter feed and his conspicuous silences on issues that took the country by storm.

Like Manmohan Singh, Modi the prime minister has remained conspicuously quiet about issues that make his government look bad. While he is quick to wish his foreign counterparts on their birthdays - and express condolences after minor attacks in their countries - Akhlaq's brutal lynching, people who lost their lives waiting in queues after demonetisation, cow vigilantism, the Una lynching, the brutal rapes in Kathua and Unnao and many other incidents didn't make the cut.

Predictably, the prime minister has maintained a stoic silence on the police firing in which 12 people protesting the Sterlite unit in Thoothukudi were killed on May 22. People in the coastal Tamil Nadu town have been protesting for over 100 days, claiming that the unit is polluting the environment and has resulted in illnesses.

9. One Year On, the PM's Research Fellowship Is off to a Sputtering Start

The first year of the PM's Research Fellowship, already much criticised for severe conceptual issues, didn't help its cause. The MHRD awarded only 135 scholars with the fellowship out of a promised 1,000 and didn't clarify how the money allocated for the unselected 865 would be used. Together with a host of other issues, this only strengthens the impression that the government wanted to rebut in the first place: that the PMRF has been ""designed to pile privilege on privilege"".

The 1,800 students who applied from this pool of candidates were those who had already cleared many levels of implicit selection. An analysis of the student composition of IITs shows that not all economic and social backgrounds have equal representation in these elite institutions. There is a whole chain of filters based on economic and caste status, quality of schooling, the ability to afford the coaching required to clear the various entrance exams, and the ability to pay the prohibitively expensive fees that several of these institutes charge - along with hostel fees, mess fees and peer-pressured booze and pizza fees, which introduce inequality in the opportunity available to Indian students to avail a world-class education. It is only a half-joke that the IISc is often called the ""Iyer-Iyengar Institute of Science"".

10. A Sick Society That Manufactures Failures - the True Face of Education in India

In a scathing attack on the education system in India and how it destroys young minds, Avijit Pathak defines why the idea of 'success' has failed students.

Anyone familiar with school education in India knows how parents and teachers pressurise children to opt for science/commerce even if they are not inclined to it. In fact, many of them are never given the space to look at themselves, and understand their unique traits and aptitudes. This is the beginning of alienation in the child's life. This alienation is further intensified when the societal pressure restricts their imagination, and forces them to believe that life is necessarily dark and bleak without medical science/engineering/management.

In this reckless preparation for 'success' their alienated selves find no joy, no ecstasy; coaching centres have no humour, guide books are devoid of creative imagination, 'success mantras' require war strategies, not the spirit of wonder, and the joy of learning is replaced by the neurotic urge to be a 'topper'.

However, this 'success', as I wish to argue, has its own discontents. The reason is that, for most of them, it is an immensely alienating experience. It kills one's creativity; it makes one one-dimensional; it robs one of the spirit of positive life-energy."

They are eagerly awaiting announcement of the implementation of the revised UGC pay scales as all the formalities of consultations with the stakeholders have been completed. The revised pay scales, which have been implemented in all the central and several state universities with effect from January 2016, are most likely to be implemented in the universities of Bihar in January. The pay scales of teachers and non-teaching staff were last revised in 2006.

Hard-pressed teachers of universities and colleges, who have been working overtime to complete their academic assignments for the past several years, are likely to heave a sigh of relief as the constitution of a new university service panel is likely to materialise soon. A gazette notification for separating the university appointments from the Bihar Public Service Commission and constitution of an independent university service panel has already been notified by the state government. The said commission will see the light of the day as soon as the ongoing appointment of assistant professors by the BPSC is completed.

It is expected that the new commission will be constituted by mid-2019 and at least 9,000 posts of assistant professors in different subjects will be advertised subsequently. Meanwhile, the universities have started the process of making ad hoc appointment of teachers against existing vacancies on payment of honorarium at the rate of Rs 1,000 per class subject to a maximum of Rs 1,000 a month.

The chancellor's secretariat has started an exercise for modernisation of libraries and laboratories in all the colleges and universities of the state. Both undergraduate and postgraduate students can hope for better amenities in their libraries and laboratories this year if the state government provides the required funds to the universities for the purpose.

If everything goes right, all the universities and colleges of the state will be accredited by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) by the end of this year. Patna University is almost ready to upload its self study report to the NAAC's website and several of its colleges are also gearing up for their assessment and accreditation. The chancellor has directed all the universities to get their institutions accredited without further delay failing which government grants to these institutions will be stopped.

For the first time, with a view to promoting healthy competition among the academics, the best performers will be given chancellor's awards in different categories. ""Applications have already been invited from eligible candidates for the best student (separately in academics, sports and cultural activities), teacher, college, girls' college, principal and vice-chancellor. Such incentives will go a long way in creating a healthy academic atmosphere in the state,"" said Federation of University Teachers Associations of Bihar working president K B Sinha."

The Ashok Gehlot government is about to make superficial changes to usher in visibly and academically different schooling for lakhs of students enrolled in public schools, which will have financial implications for both the state treasury and parents of students.

One of the proposals put up before the government is to change the uniforms of the students in government schools. School education minister Govind Singh Dotasra reviewed the department's works on Monday and said, ""The BJP government has changed the school syllabus to impose ideology of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).We will review the school uniforms of students.""

Other things under scanner are transfer of teachers effected by the Vasundhara Raje government, colour of the bicycles that were painted saffron and given away to meritorious students and the syllabus, he added.

Congress leaders, said sources, pointed out that the existing school dress is identical to khaki colour worn by the members of right-wing outfit. This was brought to the notice of the state education department and has been placed under review. If a change in uniform is ordered, it will impact students in 69,000 government schools across state.

A change in the uniform will lead to financial burden on the parents. The uniform of students was changed only last year. More than 84 lakh students are studying in government schools across the state. On an average, a set of uniform costs Rs 500. In such a situation, there will be an additional financial burden of Rs 420 crore on parents of 84 lakh students, in case they choose to purchase one set of uniform.

Over the last twenty years, the uniforms were changed twice in the state government schools. The BJP government changed the uniform both the time. ""We changed the school uniform after twenty years. This uniform colour is also in practice in several private schools of the country and in state. Changing the uniform after a year is wrong,"" former education minister Vasudev Devnani told DNA.

The Raje government had introduced the new uniform in government schools in the academic session 2017-18. After two decades, the uniform of students enrolled in government schools was changed. In the year 1997, the then BJP government's education minister Gulab Chand Kataria had ordered a change in the uniform of government schools.

The BJP government introduced shirts of light brown colour and khaki pants for boys. For the girls, light brown kurti and salwar and khaki-coloured dupatta was finalised. The uniforms of RSS members include khaki pants.

Congress has earlier accused the BJP government of attempting to impose RSS ideology on students by effecting a change in uniforms. In spite of opposition from the Congress, the BJP government went ahead and implemented the new dress.

Before 1997, the colour of school uniforms was khaki and white. Gulab Chand Kataria who was the education minister then replaced sky blue tops in place of white. In 2017, the uniform in light brown and khaki colour was introduced replacing the sky blue colour."

12 skyways in 2019

As many as 12 skyways and grade separators will take shape in 2019 under the Strategic Road Development Plan (SRDP). The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation has set a target to complete the Durgam Cheruvu cable stayed bridge by March. The long-pending flyover work at Amberpet 6 No and the controversial KBR stretch will be grounded. Predominantly, IT corridors would get relief with the completion of skyways at Bio-Diversity junction and Rajiv Gandhi statue, and JNTU in Kukatpally. In addition to this, the Roads and Buildings Department is constructing elevated corridors in Uppal, 6 Number junction and Shamshabad airport road to facilitate free flow of traffic.

First Night Safari to open

If everything goes according to plan, the first night safari park will open in 125 acres in Kothwalguda. A team of experts who designed the night safari park in Singapore inspected the proposed venue at Kothwalguda on Monday and gave its approval. The safari park will also hold shows of traditional tribal dances and other performances that exhibit the culture of Telangana.

Electric buses to hit roads

These are to finally hit the roads in 2019 according to the Road Transport Corporation as the charging stations are being readied. Railway connectivity to Medak and Karimnagar: Extension of the railways to two main districts of Medak and Karimnagar will be ready by the end of March 2019. Apart from boosting transport facilities to these regions, it will enhance tourism and inter district trade relations.

Friendly policing

Citizen-friendly policing to be more effective in the state with police personnel reaching out to the public to deliver better services. A feedback mechanism will be provided to assess the quality of service so as to improve it.

High-tech traffic system

Traffic management will go more high-tech. As part of Integrated Traffic Management System, the evidence based ticketing system, or e-challan will be implemented across the state in all police stations.

Electronic summons

Another step towards preventive policing is the complete integration of courts, police department, jails, the forensic department and the Finger Print Bureau in the state for effective policing. Electronic delivery of summons and warrants through smartphones will be seen this year in Hyderabad.

Boost to e-surveillance

The entire state to go under electronic surveillance in another three years with installation of about 15 lakh cameras, including 10 lakh cameras in areas under the Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda commissionerates that cover about five districts.

Forest cover to rise

The forest department is about to come up with its plans for better wildlife and forest protection. The forest department will create water sources in every two sq km grid for wild animals. The forest department is also taking new steps to control forest fires. The first forest department is planning to add about 22 lakh acres of land to its bank, which was illegally occupied. The forest department is taking steps to make tigers resident at Kawal tiger reserve. About 1,858 forest beat officers, 90 section officers and 60 range officers will take charge will be appointed this year.

Mass health screenings

After the successful screening of eyes in Telangana state, the government is gearing up for screening of ear and dental infections. The health department is preparing a master plan for the screening programme. Screenings for other health problems will be carried out to determine the health profile of the state.

Telangana High Court

With the formation of the High Court for the state of Telangana, advocates and employees are expecting more filling up of many vacant posts which would result in the speedy disposal of cases. More than one lakh cases are pending currently in the court.

Metro to Hitec city

The much wanted connectivity to Hitec City via Metro Rail will indeed be a boost for the city. With more than 2 lakh people using the Metro train services the extension to Hitec will see the much wanted decongestion on city roads.

Mission Bhagiratha

It was launched in August 2016. It is Telangana's ambitious project to supply drinking water to every household outside municipal corporation limits. As the project nears its deadline on March 31, 2019, government officials say that 1,00,200 km of the 1,04,749 km network of pipelines 1 which is around two-and-a-half times the Earth's circumference has been laid. The project is also aimed at resolving a serious health crisis in Nalgonda and Medak districts, where much of the groundwater is contaminated by fluoride.

Kaleshwaram project: Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, who held a marathon review of the Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Scheme's progress last week, set March 2019 as the deadline for its completion. The pace of work has been stepped up and work is being done in shifts. Officials claimed that 96.41 per cent of the works on the barrage were completed so far. L&T which has been executing the Medigadda barrage work has been laying an average 5,000 to 6,000 cubic metres of concrete a day. About 76.71 per cent of the work on the flood banks has been completed. So far as the execution of earthworks is concerned, 96 per cent has been completed on the Medigadda project as against 100 per cent on the Annaram project and 98 per cent on Sundilla project.

Water for city

Works pertaining to 10 tmc ft reservoir construction at Keshavapuram would be grounded in 2019. The Water Board has completed the tender process and initiated the land acquisition process. The Water Board requires 1,585 acres of government land, 1,235 acres of forest land, 185 acres of endowments land, 335 acres of government assigned land and 555 acres from private persons. The project which had run at snail's pace is likely to see brisk progress in 2019.

200 check dams

2019 will see the completion of 200 check dams. The Roads & Buildings Department is constructing 200 check dams with potential for storing 18,695 lakh litres of water. The project will incur very little additional expenditure as part of constructing bridges across various streams and rivulets across Telangana. As part of a Rs 18,000 crore project for strengthening, widening and laying roads, the government identified 532 bridges where such check dams could be constructed.

Cheaper film tickets

The Telugu film industry is bringing in the New Year with good news as the new Goods and Services Tax (GST) applies from January 1 onwards providing big relief. The GST Council reduced the tax rate to 12 per cent from 18 per cent on tickets below Rs 100 and from 28 per cent to 18 per cent above Rs 100. The producers and distributors will also pay lesser amount of tax and with this new tax, the industry will benefit.

Tech and teachers

Initiatives to make teachers better equipped in terms of technology and also insisting that they work more professionally will be stressed.

Stiff target to officials

Make Telangana the first state where every house receives filtered drinking water through an individual connection in the kitchen or outside, Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao said. He came back to power this month."

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). With effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions.

The Samagra Shiksha scheme focuses on improvement of quality of education by providing support for different interventions like; in-service training of teachers and schools heads, conduct of achievement surveys at National and State level, provision of textbooks as per Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, ICT and digital initiatives, vocational education, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment has been increased and from this year provisions for library grants and grants for sports and physical education have also been introduced.

The Government has also launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities.

e PATHSHALA: a single point repository of e ­resources containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-­print materials.

The Central Government, supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme namely 'Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat' (PBBB) in foundational years of schooling.

(iii) MHRD, has launched a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform popularly known as SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) on 9 July, 2017. The portal is offering various online courses for school education and higher education. NCERT has been developing course modules for Massive Open and Online Course (MOOCs) for school education system in 12 subject areas (Accountancy, business studies, biology, chemistry, economic, history, geography, mathematics, physics, political science, psychology and sociology) for classes IX-XII. Twelve (12) courses and twenty one (21) courses have been completed in the first cycle and second cycle (completed on 30 Nov. 2018) on SWAYAM platform (https://swayam.gov.in/) respectively. Nearly 22,000 students and 30,000 students were registered in the first cycle and second cycle respectively.

(iv) CIET-NCERT has been assigned the task of developing e-resources for Master of Education (M.Ed.) course jointly with Allahabad University. One course (Educational Administration, Management and Leadership in School Education) has been completed first cycle on SWAYAM platform in which 2115 were enrolled. The second cycle of this course is offered from 2 July 2018.

Besides, an online course on action research for teachers is conducted in regular intervals in the MOODLE platform (http://ictcurriculum.gov.in/ ). Post Graduate Diploma in Guidance and Counselling for in-service teachers is also offered through the same course portal. Several other online courses are developed for inservice teachers professional development and delivered through the portal https://itpd.ncert.org.in/.

(v) A programme for utilization of satellite communication technologies for transmission of educational e-contents through 32 National Channels i.e. SWAYAM PRABHA DTH-TV has been launched. CIET-NCERT is the national coordinator for one DTH TV channel i.e., Kishore Manch (#31) and has started feeding a 24x7 educational TV channel w.e.f. 09 July, 2018. Everyday four hour fresh slot is telecast and repeated six times in 24 hours to provide learning opportunities for the stake holders, as per their convenience. Besides, NIOS is running 5 channels for teachers, for Secondary and Sr. Secondary levels and for sign language.

(vi) MHRD has launched Diksha Portal for providing digital platform to teachers giving them an opportunity to learn and train themselves and connect with teacher community. The portal envisages to help teachers boost their teaching skills and create their own separate profile with their skills and knowledge, and help in improving quality of education with use of latest technologies in education sector.

After introducing the Singur land agitation in history syllabus of schools in 2017, the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education is all set to include a new poem by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to its curriculum.

A poem penned by Banerjee to promote the Safe Drive, Save Life campaign in the state will be taught to students to inculcate awareness about road safety. Another song by Banerjee written for the state's Kanyashree project for the girl child also features in the new plan for students.

As part of its physical education curriculum, teachers have been instructed to teach students the Safe Drive, Save Life theme poem. Launching the campaign in 2016, Banerjee had stated that it was aimed to achieve cohesion among civil society, police, transport, health, roads and other government departments and NGOs to sensitise people about different aspects of safe driving and road safety.

It is indeed a great step. Our CM has written several books and poems. We are proud of her, TMC MP Idris Ali said, adding that his leader was a true all-rounder.

The BJP, however, mocked the initiative, terming it a misuse of public money.

India as a country, in terms of expanse and population, is huge. With a population of over 1.2 billion, 39% are children, which is around 470 million. Children are not just our future, but our present too, and we need to work collectively to ensure that their rights are protected.

Was 2018 a game-changer for India's children? While some decisions taken by the Centre have been a step towards the right direction, events in which child rights have been violated have slowed down the growth process. Certain cases like Kathua, Unnao and the Bihar shelter homes incident depict the grim severity of the situation, and the urgency for us to step up as citizens to take a definitive action against these incidents.

Shelter Homes and The Trafficking of Persons Bill

One of the monumental decisions taken by the Parliament was the passing of The Trafficking of Persons (Prevention, Protection and Rehabilitation) Bill 2018 by the Lok Sabha in the July session. It proposes a punishment ranging from 10 years of rigorous imprisonment to life term and a fine of not less than Rs 1 lakh for people caught in carrying out trafficking activities. It aims to create institutional mechanisms at the district, state and central level to curb trafficking.Hundreds of children go missing in India every year and are sold for labour or sexual exploitation. The bill has provisions to provide rehabilitation, skill development and education to the victims.

As the Parliament winter session is ongoing, over 12,000 trafficking survivors from 14 states have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the passage of the Trafficking bill in the Rajya Sabha. Women and Child development minister Maneka Gandhi also expressed hope for the passage of the crucial trafficking bill.

The Deoria shelter home incident was another case that gained limelight. A shelter home in Deoria, Uttar Pradesh, run by Girija Tripathi was found to be engaging in illegal activities. The girls in the shelter home were subjected to physical, sexual and mental abuse. Tripathi used her clout with influential local politicians and bureaucrats to run the home and get away with these barbaric acts. 24 girls aged 5-15 were rescued from being trafficked, but 18 are still missing.

The Kathua Rape Case Shook the Nation

The year started on a shocking note. In January 2018, 8-year-old Asifa Bano was abducted, drugged with sedatives, brutally raped and murdered in Kathua, Jammu & Kashmir. A week after she went missing, her body was found by villagers of the neighbouring village.

The Kathua rape case was just one of the many. After the incident, the Parliament took a stand and passed the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill 2018. The amendment calls for death punishment for rapists who have raped girls below the age of 12. If the girl is under 16, the minimum punishment will be 20 years to life imprisonment; a change from the previous 10 year sentence. In case of gangrape of a girl below 12 years of age, the accused will be sentenced to life imprisonment or death. The bill also mandates that the investigation and trial must be completed within two months and dismissed.

Children and Health

United Nations Child Mortality Report released this year stated that there were 1.14 million children deaths in India every year. This means 3 infants die every minute. Most of the children die before they turn 5 due to curable and preventable diseases like pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria and birth complications.The number of deaths was the lowest India has had in 5 years but is still the highest in the world.

This September, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Ayushman Bharat Scheme. This scheme is supposedly the world's largest health care scheme. It will provide 10 crore poor households a reimbursement of upto Rs.5 lakh for secondary and tertiary hospitalisation charges of the entire family. This year 17 crore children were given polio drops catering to a healthy childhood.

Children in Schools

Twelve million children are yet to be enrolled in schools.The dropout rate is fairly high either due to affordability or some other social issue. Girls are married off at a young age and forced to quit schools. 1 in every 3 child brides in the world is a girl in India. The National Social Assistance programme has allocated Rs. 9975 crore by the government this year. The budget plans to treat education holistically.

The emphasis is on improving education by giving proper training to teachers. A merger of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan is in the pipeline. This joint scheme envisions to ensure inclusive and equitable education from nursery to the senior secondary stage.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that the country is looking to spend Rs 1 trillion to revitalize the infrastructure of higher educational institutions.

The Gender Divide

According to the Lancet Global Health Journal released in May 2018, around 2,39,000 girls under the age of 5 die each year in India due to gender discrimination.

Once the girl is born, negligence in her upbringing leads to illnesses. 32% of the girls enrolled in schools drop out. This is because of family constraints, insufficient funds and lack of sanitation facilities during their menstruation cycle. Therefore, the percentage of literate women and girls is less in comparison to men.

The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme started by the Government in 2015 aims to improve the efficiency of implementation of welfare schemes for women. Through the government campaigns people have started realizing that gender doesn't define capability. This programme has increased the intake of girls in schools but it still has a long way to go.

2018 has seen a number of child rights violation cases, but also seen steps to resolve them and prevent such events in future. We, as responsible citizens, need to question and observe the life children are leading and do our bit to save their childhood. A small step towards the right direction can go a long way in making India safe for children."

It is not disputed that security of the country is of prime concern. But the government's new order does not lay down the conditions under which such surveillance of private information can be accessed and safeguards to avoid the order's misuse. Though the old order was introduced in 2009, the feeling of being threatened did not exist. As a parallel example, when Aadhaar was introduced, it had a narrower scope. But this government extended it to so many services that that the Supreme Court had to take up the matter and guarantee fundamental rights under the Constitution. - SN Iyer

Naseeruddin Shah's comment over growing intolerance is genuine (""The Daily Fix: The vicious reaction to Naseeruddin Shah underscores shrinking space for minorities""). There's consensus among the well-wishers of this country that this growing intolerance will harm national integrity and trust in the rule of law in this great nation. However the treatment Shah has received from the ruling BJP suggests that the party and its affiliates are only interested in the electoral politics and not in the diversity and integrity of the nation. - Rehan Ansar

While this article raises some valid points, there is one aspect that it totally ignores - the near-complete absence of Muslim faculty members at the IIMs (""IIMs have used autonomy for self-aggrandisement, says professor pushing for faculty diversity""). After reading this article, I went through the listed faculty directories of all IIMs (except Rohtak and Hamirpur, as the websites weren't working) and saw that only five core faculty memebers were Muslim. This dearth of Muslims can also be seen even the visiting faculty and teachers for elective courses are offered by the institutes. If we are talking about diversity, then why is there no discussion on religion? - Ahmed Ashhar

***

The interview with the IIM Bangalore professor is an eye opener. His views on being responsible corporate citizens are much needed. We do not want to go the American way, where chasing money at any cost, even family, is legitimate.

The IIMs look at themselves as the Indian equivalent of Western business schools. The difference, not acknowledged by them, is that the Indian taxpayer funds the IIMs. Hence, IIMs have a holistic responsibility towards Indian citizens and not just to enriching themselves.

Indian citizens, therefore, have concerns that need to be addressed within the business models taught at IIMs.

His concern about environmental pollution and social diversity are a reality of the Indian citizens and should be adopted wholeheartedly with a responsibility. This, along with other concerns, like environmental destruction due to industrial activity and others, will make Indian IIMs global leaders in progressive and responsible business models. By not addressing these realities, IIMs are wasting an opportunity to lead the world in a new kind of business model. - Rajratna Jadhav

I could not agree more with Deepak Malghan.

I am worried by news of India's $1.4 billion aid package for the Maldives (""India declares $1.4 billion aid to Maldives""). I cannot understand the rationale behind giving so much money to another nation when our own country is struggling with financial insecurity.

When so many vital things are pending in our country for want of funds, how can people at the helm of governance act like this, that too to a country that has acted in a bitter way towards our nation, by sending back Indian workers and refusing to issue visas to them?

He also informed that JNV Bundi gave magnificent results yet again with 14 students qualified for KVPY Stage 2.

Verma Sir added that Resonance has always served as a major incubator to develop and showcase these talents and help the students prepare for IIT-JEE, NEET, Olympiad, KVPY and other national competitive examinations.

Students of Resonance have been excelling in some of the most challenging examinations in the country that require deep conceptual understanding. KVPY exam is meant for the students of Class XI and XII. Minimum 75% is required for General Category in 10th Boards and 65% for SC, ST and OBC to be eligible for this exam.

The objective of the program (KVPY) is to identify students with talent and aptitude for research; help them realize their academic potential; encourage them to take up research careers in Science, and ensure the growth of the best scientific minds for research and development in the country. This is a remarkable program as students who qualify for KVPY scholarship program will receive scholarship till their post-graduation for pursuing basic Science courses and research career in Science. Students must also secure 60% for General Category in XII boards and 50% for SC, ST and physically disabled students. Students will be vouchsafed a scholarship of Rs. 5,000 every month in the three-year tenure of B.Sc. and Rs. 7,000 every month during the two years of M.Sc. Apart from the aforementioned scholarship, students are entitled to a grant of Rs. 20,000 every year during their graduation and Rs. 28,000 every year during their post-graduation.

People from Keviti community of Nuvvularevu village met me. Ten thousand people belonging to this community live in this village. And this community was not categorized earlier. During the course of my father's padayatra, this fact was brought to his notice. He also saw for himself the difficulties they went through. As soon as he came to power, he ensured that the community was included in the BC-A category. Recalling his gesture, members of this community met me to express their gratitude. This community has an interesting custom. Girls of marriageable age are married off in a mass marriage ceremony once in two years. Every home is liberated from the burden of huge financial expenses of marriage when these weddings happen all this once lighting up all homes. I truly feel that their social customs would serve as a source of inspiration.

For a community which depends on fishing for its livelihood, survival is becoming increasingly difficult without jetties to help them continue fishing. Middlemen control everything and deceive the fishermen whose plight is worsened by non-availability of cold storage facilities.

Student union representatives of various universities as also teachers met me this morning and told me that in over four years, the TDP government has not filled up a single post. There are over 2200 posts lying vacant in universities across the state. They described in detail how the TDP government was watering down the university system which functioned under the framework of the government. They expressed their anguish stating that seven universities in the state did not have vice-chancellors and this itself proves how negligent the Chandrababu Naidu regime is towards higher education.

On the one hand, the TDP government is diluting higher education system in the public sector and on the other, it is rolling out a red carpet to private universities. The status of the fee reimbursement scheme is no different. It is obvious that the Chandrababu Naidu government patronises corporate education at the cost of depriving the poor of it. There is an urgent need to change this situation.

Palasa is synonymous with cashew nuts. And in these parts, it is popularly known as white gold. There are about 300 cashew nut based industries in this region. Cashew nut from Palasa has acquired international reputation and is used in Tirupati Laddoos as well. Locals speak of these facts with great pride. However, behind this success story lies the dark side of the lives of the workers in these cashew nut based industries. There are about 20,000 workers in these units. During my father's rule, cashew nut industry was brought under the cover of agri-based industry and the taxes were lowered.

However, workers point out that subsequent government did not pay any attention to their plight. They brought to notice the indifference of the government which did not consider treating the industry as a cottage industry. They said that labour laws were not applied to them. Moreover, for those who peel cashews, fingerprints gets scrubbed over a period of time and this in turn has been a reason for the government denying them welfare schemes, they lamented. To make matters worse, local TDP leaders extorted money from them, they complained.

My poser to the chief minister -- You had promised at the time of elections that you would set up an agro-processing unit, cold storage, godown in ever mandal and a mega food park in every district. You had also committed yourself to establishing export processing centres and agricultural processing industries. What happened to these promises made in manifesto? Is there a single measure of benefit you can cite which your government extended to agro-based industries?"

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-IPFT (Indigenous People's Front of Tripura) coalition swept the polls, winning 44 seats in the 60-member assembly. The BJP alone secured 36 seats, while the IPFT, a tribal-oriented party, won eight seats. The CPM won the remaining 16.

Before the 2018 polls, neither the BJP nor the IPFT had won a seat in the assembly and their vote share was less than two or three per cent.

The 2018 polls were also a major setback for the Congress, which had ruled the state for 23 years (1959-1977 and 1988-1993). For the first time in 40 years, the key opposition party remained unrepresented in the assembly.

""The CPM's tally (16 seats) would have been much less if they had not got the support of the minorities, specially the Muslims,"" renowned political analyst and writer Sekhar Datta told IANS.

In October, the BJP swept the local bodies' bypolls, winning 3,386 seats in different Panchayati Raj institutions. The CPM and Congress alleged that through intimidation, attacks and arson, BJP candidates had won 96% of the unopposed seats and the remaining through large-scale rigging.

On the welfare front, the BJP-led government in October, hiked the salaries and allowances of 219,454 government employees and pensioners in line with the 7th Central Pay Commission recommendations, fulfilling the saffron party's pre-poll promise.

In a major breather, the Supreme Court last month extended the services of 10,323 Tripura government teachers by two more years, as the state government had appealed for.

The year 2018 also saw a crusade against the drug menace in Tripura. Immediately after the BJP-IPFT government headed by chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb came to power, security agencies, comprising state and central paramilitary forces, along with the district administrations, began a war against the cultivation, trade and smuggling of drugs, especially cannabis.

""Different security agencies in the past nine months have seized 65,000 kg of dry cannabis, over two crore ganja plants, one lakh bottles of various types of cough syrups (which serve as intoxicants), 1.65 lakh habit-forming tablets, 2,626 grams of brown sugar and heroin in Tripura,"" officials of Tripura's home and revenue departments said.

Deb, who pledged to make Tripura a 'drug-free state', said, ""During the short period of nine months, over 200 people who are involved in drug trade had to go to jail. As the drug-related activities were reduced, 40% atrocities on women and 10% incidents of rape of young girls have decreased.""

According to an official document of Tripura Police, there were 78 and 124 instances of rioting in 2016 and 2017 respectively, but this shot up to 245 in 2018.

Former chief minister and CPM politburo member Manik Sarkar, while evaluating the governance of the coalition government, said that its dictatorial and illegal acts, like bulldozing of hundreds of opposition party offices, houses and assets belonging to Left party members and supporters are creating 'total unprecedented anarchy' in the state.

""There is a huge crisis of food and jobs in Tripura, specially in the hilly and interior areas. The state's economy is entirely shattered. Without dealing with the basic crisis, the BJP government is only bulldozing opposition party offices and continuing with its undemocratic activities,"" Sarkar told IANS. agencies"

Speaking to TOI, vice- chancellor of the university, P Duraisamy said, ""We expect all the affiliated colleges to follow the notification issued by University Grants Commission (UGC) in connection with this issue. Clear instructions will be given to colleges again in the principals' meeting.""

This decision comes in the wake of news that a 30-year-old faculty member from Madras Institute of Technology, Chrompet, committed suicide after Sree Sastha Institute of Engineering and Technology, his previous employer, refused to return his original certificates.

Though the college refuted the allegations, Anna University and All India Council for Technical Education sent a circular to all the affiliated colleges to return the certificates after checking them at the time of recruitment. The situation was no different in colleges affiliated to University of Madras.

One assistant professor, who has been earning only Rs 12,000 for the past three years, said he had been pleading with the management to release his certificates so that he can apply for other jobs. ""Though the college promised an annual increment, nothing changed since 2014. So, the only option left is to apply elsewhere where the pay is better,"" he said.

In another case, the services of a faculty member working with a college since 2002, were terminated in 2016 and he is yet to receive his certificates, clear his provident fund or send a relieving order.

Among the many schemes and interventions like starting of English-medium 'schools of excellence' and teaching English courses, what really caught attention was the 'happiness curriculum'.

The curriculum was really a class for students from Nursery to Class VIII studying in Delhi government schools in which they were taught to concentrate and were taught values so that they could have holistic growth. Prepared after rigorous deliberations for six months by a team of teachers from Delhi government schools, principals of District Institute of Education and Training (DIET), members from different NGOs and officials of DoE, it was launched in July by the Dalai Lama.

Without books or tests, it was a joyful exercise of 45 minutes for the children. But teachers had to periodically assess the progress of the children. Teachers of all 1,100 government schools were trained in the course. But so far, the impact of the course is merely anecdotal -- from better attendance to increasing confidence among students.

For the teachers, the curriculum meant a new addition to their paperwork and another change in routine. School principals had a different take on this. ""How well this curriculum works depends on the teachers and the freedom s/he is given to teach. But in government schools, teachers have constraints in terms of having a model class ratio and abiding by rule books set by the government,"" said a principal of a south Delhi school.

The Delhi government saw the happiness curriculum as a step in imparting quality education. The other step was Mission Buniyaad.

It was an extension of the earlier Chunauti scheme, but included even corporation schools. Run during summer vacation, the government claimed to have improved learning levels of more children by dividing them into groups of those who could read texts and those who could not. Corporation schools, though, struggled to get their students attend it.

Education experts expressed reservations about segregating children into groups.

The other red mark was examination results. The performance of government schools in CBSE Class X exams didn't impress even though the government introduced several interventions.

The newly formed Congress government in Rajasthan has decided to restore right to contest, improve benefits under social security schemes and review change in textbooks that were made during previous BJP government. In the first cabinet meeting held on Saturday, chief minister Ashok Gehlot reversed the key decisions taken by the previous Vasundhara Raje government in the state. While handing over the party's manifesto to the chief secretary, the cabinet unanimously decided that it would be the policy document of the state government and a cabinet committee would be constituted to ensure its effective implementation. The key takeaways of the meeting included reopening of Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar Law University and Haridev Joshi University of Journalism and Mass Communication that were closed by the Raje government, elimination of the provision of minimum educational qualification in the Panchayati Raj elections, and removal of Deendayal Upadhyay logo from official documents. To effectively execute its loan waiver announcement, the Gehlot government decided to constitute an inter-departmental committee to waive the short-term crop loan. The chief minister has been authorised to nominate members in the said committee that will set the eligibility criteria for the waiver in cooperative banks, nationalised banks, and regional rural and land development banks. Putting an emphasis on the social security schemes, the government announced increment in the pension received by old-age, widow and disabled persons under its old-age pension scheme. The Congress, while in opposition, had called out the Raje-led BJP government for halting the pension of eligible beneficiaries. ""For the past five years, the Raje government didn't increase the pension that was previously set by our government. Keeping in mind the present scenario, we have increased the pension from Rs 500 to Rs 750 for men and women above 55 years of age and from Rs 750 to Rs 1000 for the pensioners in the age bracket of 75 years and above,"" Master Bhawarlal Meghwal, minister of social justice and empowerment in the Rajasthan government, told The Wire. ALSO READ: Rajasthan Cabinet turns manifesto into policy doc, to ensure implementation The state council also decided to constitute a committee for resolving the issues of the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) workers, para-teachers, Urdu para-teachers, anganwadi workers, education workers, panchayat assistants and a few others working on a contractual basis in state. During Raje's tenure earlier this year, several NRHM who showed black flags to PM Narendra Modi demanding permanent employment were arrested for 'sloganeering' and 'obstructing police personnel in discharging their duties'. The government also decided to abolish the criteria set by the previous BJP government for the educational qualification of candidates for panchayati raj and local body elections to ensure each person gets a right to contest elections. The state government under the BJP had brought in an ordinance a few days ahead of panchayat polls in 2014 making it mandatory for candidates contesting zila parishad and panchayat samiti polls to be Class X pass and those contesting sarpanch elections to be class VIII pass. In the scheduled areas, the criteria was class V pass. It later led to an amendment to the Rajasthan Panchayati Raj Act, 1994. Civil society members who have been consistently fighting to restore the right to contest have welcomed the step. ""The law was discriminatory and elitist.

It was maliciously brought in Rajasthan to break the Congress control over the panchayats. After its implementation, 65% of the elected representatives were under 35 and it completely ruled out the older people and tribals who had no adequate means for education. The law was basically brought in to woo the youth, the only base of the Bhartiya Janta Party in rural areas,"" Kavita Srivastava, Rajasthan president of the People's Union for Civil Liberties, told The Wire."

It has been both good and bad. And at the fag-end of the year and the threshold of the New Year, with the benefit of the hindsight we can only look back and reminiscence of the time gone by.

In the state of Meghalaya, 2018 started with fun and fervour because election to the state Assembly was round the corner. Then as expected after the February election, the outcome was a fractured mandate and the only option was a coalition government. The National Peoples' Party (NPP) under the leadership of its national president formed the government which is supported by the BJP and the three regional parties. Christened the Meghalaya Democratic Alliance (MDA) the government started on a high note with people expecting the new government led by a young, suave and savvy leader would deliver. Unfortunately, now that the government has been in power for nearly nine months the public is yet to see the common minimum program that the coalition partners have promised.

The MDA government is therefore working without a roadmap as every minister is given a carte blanche by the Chief Minister. Of course the government can claim that within a few months of being in power, it was able to come out with a State Education Policy. But what use is the Policy if the teachers have to strike work every time because they are not paid regularly. And what change can a Policy bring if LP school buildings in the villages are in a dilapidated condition and basic infrastructure is lacking in the schools? Education policy without motivated teachers and basic school infrastructure is like a body with an unhealthy soul and a weak mind.

The 2018 election outcome is that there is a general consensus across party lines that money has played a major role in the election Some even said that this has corroded the moral fabric of the society. Money has indeed had a big influence in the last election and this can be seen from the fact that candidates organised election rallies are estimated to cost a bomb.

The election also ushered in a new era in Meghalaya politics with the rise of several political dynasties in Meghalaya. The state not only witnessed the rise and rise of the two Sangma dynasties in the Garo hills region of Meghalaya, but there is also the Dhar family which have won three out of four seats they have contested. And of course another dynasty in the making is the father-son duo of Charles Pyngrope David Nongrum.

The next issue that had hit the headlines of newspapers in the state for quite some time was the Punjabi lane or Them Iewmawlong imbroglio. The skirmish between few people had unfortunately escalated and took a different turn, leading to a serious law and order situation in the state. This was then followed by the clash between the police and the mob which also brought a bad name to Shillong in particular and Meghalaya in general.

The issue compelled the Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh to send few Congress MLAs to meet Chief Minister Conrad Sangma. Manjit Singh Rai, member of the National Commission for Minorities also visited the state to assess the situation. Before that, Mohinderjit Singh member of the United Sikh Organisation led a five member delegation to meet the Home Minister, James Sangma to take stock of the situation.

The High Level Committee which was instituted after the conflict is yet come up with a proposal to solve this chronic problem, once and for all. Instead it was reported that the Punjab government has sanctioned rupees sixty lakhs as compensation to the victims affected by the conflict.

The other issue which has captured the eyeballs of the people in Meghalaya was the Bill introduced by the Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council. The Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council (Khasi Social Custom of Lineage) (Second Amendment) Bills, 2018 which is an amendment of the Khasi Social Custom lineage Act passed by the KHADC denies a woman who marries a non Khasi-Pnar and her offspring the right to be a Khasi.

The Bill which was hurriedly passed and sent to the governor for assent had to be recalled and passed again in the Council. But the pertinent question is its implementation because it is of course easy to make law,s but difficult to implement and this particular Bill will meet the same fate if at all it is enacted.

This year the State also witnessed interesting twist and turns in its politics. The much hyped story of a man whom the Congress had allegedly dumped into the gutter, was retrieved by the NPP. DD Lapang who had decided not to contest the last election, felt humiliated about the way the Congress treated him and joined the NPP irrespective of the fact that age is catching up with him. Lapang no doubt is a fighter difficult to beat, but the one thing that he will not be able to beat, is time. However he may wish to win over it, his spirit will very soon have to bow down to the dictates of time.

The most interesting of all the political developments in the state, is the story of P.N. Syiem. The Congress leader who earlier quit the party started his own party just before the election and contested the election on the new People's Democratic Front (PDF) ticket but lost his seat. But in politics nine months is a long time; a lot of things can happen within that short span of time. And before the party could even celebrate its first anniversary, the President and the founder of the party quit the party he founded. On a lighter note, some Facebooker suggested that if 'PDF' is not working with PN Syiem, then he should try the MPEG and JPEG format.

Then came the dastardly attack on the two women activists by a group of 30 to 40 people led by leaders of political parties became a cause for concern. The statement of the State NPP President that the Party would take action against the alleged culprit only if the absconding politician is found guilty, is nothing but patronizing crime. WR Kharlukhi must have forgotten the saying in Khasi 'U nongtuh u phet khlem don ba beh.'

Last but not the least we unfortunately close this year on a sad note. The unfortunate incident at Ksan in the Lyteiñ area under Saipung Block of East Jaiñtia hills District in which an unknown number of people were trapped inside the coal mine caused by the water from river Lyteiñ which flooded the mine, is a sad commentary on the dangers of rat hole mining. This is a major accident waiting to happen. God only knows how many incidents of mine collapse or death of miners due to falling from the more than 200 feet ladder or the case of a miner crushed to death because a steel cart use to lift coal from the depth of the pit to the ground fell on him. Many of these cases were not reported.

If readers of my column would recall, after the NGT ordered the ban on rat hole mining and transportation of coal from Meghalaya, the government came up with an argument that mining in Meghalaya is no longer done vide the rat hole system, which prompted me to counter it by writing an article on the following Monday with a title, 'A hole by any name still smells a rat.' The box cutting method is equally or even more dangerous than the rat hole mining and the incident only proves this point.

And like a bolt from the blue Shillong MP Vincent Pala instead of pleading in the August House for the early rescue of the trapped miners and their families, instead argued that the accident is the reason that the government should allow mining to continue without regulations. This is like suggesting that after a major road accident on the highway, the government should instead stop regulating traffic and allow the drivers to drive on their own freewill. Whereas any sane person would understand that we need to make rules and regulations to prevent such incidents from recurring.

It must therefore dawn on the Congress, the NPP and all the regional parties that the only way is to come up with a Mining Policy which will regulate all mining activities. The Government needs to come up with a mechanism which minimises damage to the environment and also ensures the safety of those who are engaged in the activity."

Here's what to expect in key areas that touch your life. Learning beyond the four walls

Out of class learning is expected to be a key part of the Delhi government's education push in the coming year.

In Delhi government schools, which largely cater to children from economically disadvantaged families, ensuring attendance and establishing a classroom connect with students has been a struggle.

The coming year will see the flagship 'Happiness Curriculum' project completing one year, and implementation of the new 'Entrepreneurship Curriculum' for students in classes IX to XII.

Through storytelling, 'mindfulness' classes and interactive activities, 'happiness classes' for students of nursery to Class VIII have tried to help students ""get in touch with their emotions"". The objective of the 'entrepreneurship classes', an official said, will be to develop an ""entrepreneurial mindset"" in older children to help them re-orient their goals -- from simply seeking jobs towards innovation.

Advertising

Shailendra Sharma, principal advisor to the Delhi government, said these curricular interventions are laying the ground for changing the education discourse in classrooms. ""The whole point of happiness classes is to reorient relationships between teachers, students and parents. Students are getting the opportunity to reflect on their thoughts and express themselves without fear of judgement, while teachers can experience their relationship with students beyond just teaching. This is setting the ground for the larger goal of education beyond knowledge transmission.""

On the 'entrepreneurship curriculum', he said, ""Hopefully, this will also help take the discourse to the next level, in terms of what students feel like they're ready for after stepping out of school and what roles they see for themselves in the public arena.""

Education, many believe, is also tied closely to AAP's political fortunes. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has often spoken about education reforms in Delhi during his rallies outside the state; AAP leader Atishi, best known for her work in the field of education, has been made a Lok Sabha candidate; and AAP has frequently harnessed the 'happiness curriculum' for international recognition -- most recently during an education conference in Austria in December.

Even though heads of schools have given positive feedback on happiness classes in review meetings -- such as a greater sense of belonging and an increase in attendance -- some have expressed concern that the flurry of new interventions take away time, effort and focus from the core need to deliver examination results.

This year, several schools delivered zero pass percentages in the internal examinations. The ability to match these interventions with results will be tested in 2019, particularly with children in board examination classes being brought under their ambit.

Move to check overpricing by hospitals

The Delhi government is set to roll out guidelines to regulate private hospitals and nursing homes. Once implemented, the policy is expected to be a landmark decision for Delhi residents who have often complained of overpricing by various private hospitals.

Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain told The Indian Express that the government will implement the guidelines by early 2019. The advisory was framed after the AAP government formed a nine-member committee, headed by the then Director-General of Health Services Kirti Bhushan, to monitor functioning of private hospitals.

The aim is to ensure rates of surgery packages are ""transparent, without hidden charges"", and hospitals disclose whether they cover any complications during the procedure.

The draft advisory states that private hospitals can charge patients for medicines at the MRP mentioned in the National List of Essential Medicines, 2015, as their prices have already been capped. The policy also prohibits private hospitals and nursing homes from refusing to hand over bodies over pending bills.

""The department is finalising work on the committee report and will release it soon. The guidelines will change the entire scenario of the medical profession,"" said a senior health department official.

In 2019, Delhi will also witness implementation of the Centre's ambitious Ayushman Bharat scheme, which has run into some turbulence in the capital over the name of the scheme. At the moment, both sides are in a deadlock.

It has so far been implemented in four government hospitals -- All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ram Manohar Lohia, Safdarjung Hospital and Lady Hardinge Medical College -- as well as a few private hospitals. The National Health Agency has asked private hospitals in the capital to join the insurance scheme, and 2019 will tell how many follow through.

AAP and Cong: Will they, won't they?

Wild swings in vote shares of the three big political players, AAP, BJP and Congress, which have come to characterise the city's politics since 2014, will largely determine the churning that lies ahead.

For the ruling AAP, doing well in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls is imperative for its ambition to go national. It has received jolts in the recent past owing to successive drubbings in state assembly polls, as seen recently in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.

The AAP's political fortunes appear to be tied closely with that of the Congress, with the two parties competing for acceptance among the same sections -- from residents of unauthorised colonies to Purvanchalis -- while the BJP continues to draw support from traders and the upper-middle class.

This is where coalition talks come in: Despite their apparent mutual dislike, there has been no outright rejection from the AAP and the Congress that they are in talks to arrive at an ""understanding"" so that the BJP does not romp home once again by taking advantage of the possible vote cutting.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has so far shied away from giving a straight answer -- whenever asked by reporters, he has maintained: ""We will let you know."" He also insists that the AAP will do ""all that is necessary"" to keep the BJP out of power.

Behind the ambiguous statements are hard facts: In 2015, the AAP won with a 54.3% vote share due to the massive dip in the Congress's vote share, which was down to 9.8%. However, in last year's municipal polls, Congress showed signs of revival as it increased its share to 21.09%, while AAP's came down to 26.23%.

On the other hand, the BJP's vote share has remained more or less constant -- 33.07% in the 2015 Assembly polls and 36.23% in the 2017 MCD polls. Only in 2014 had the BJP notched up an impressive share of 44.81%, on the back of a country-wide Modi wave that swept the party to power.

While back-channel talks may or may not yield results, the AAP has been critical of the Congress in public. At rally after rally, Kejriwal tried to drive home the point that voting for the Congress will end up strengthening the BJP. Addressing one such rally in August, he had said that the Delhi Congress has been reduced to a ""vote cutter for the AAP"".

Leaders in the AAP also point to the fact that Delhi will go to Assembly polls in less than a year after the Lok Sabha elections, and any coalition with the Congress in 2019 may end up harming AAP's prospects in 2020.

""What happens in the Lok Sabha elections will also have a bearing on the Assembly polls. Some leaders in AAP are looking at an alliance because arithmetic says both parties together will be able to keep the BJP out of power. But the implications have to be seen in context of the Assembly polls. Will AAP want to align with the very party whose vote bank shifted to it en masse in 2015?"" said a former party leader.

The Delhi Congress, still smarting from the 2015 drubbing, currently under the leadership of Ajay Maken, disapproves of all coalition talks. It has maintained that the AAP is a ""B-team"" of the BJP and that the Kejriwal-led party is ""desperate to stitch an alliance for its own survival"".

Eight years on, 1,500 buses may roll out

For a city that has been waiting for new buses to join its fleet since 2011, the coming year is going to be a crucial one. At least 500 standard-floor buses, with hydraulic lifts to make them accessible to the differently abled, have already got a go-ahead from courts.

Delhi Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot said 1,000 electric buses will also join the close to 6,000 buses on Delhi roads by June. ""The Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System is preparing a feasibility report, after which tenders will be floated,"" he said.

If all goes according to plan, Delhi will become the first Indian city to have such a large electric bus fleet. This will also be key to Delhi's fight against pollution -- according to recent studies by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and TERI, vehicular pollution contributes to over 35% of particulate matter in the city.

With construction of Metro Phase IV getting the green signal, the other gap that remains is providing last-mile connectivity.

Recently, the Delhi Metro tied up with private app-based cab aggregators to fill this gap. However, in an ever-expanding city, buses and a regulated e-rickshaw service are being seen as the only way to make sure people are incentivised to leave their personal vehicles at home and switch to greener modes of travel.

1.4 lakh cameras on streets, 1 lakh in schools

Education and health will be the focus of the Public Works Department (PWD) in 2019. According to a senior PWD official, ""by the end of 2019, the aim is to construct 12,000 additional classrooms in Delhi government schools"".

The department will also begin work on the hotly debated plan to install CCTV cameras inside schools. ""Over 1 lakh cameras will be put inside 726 schools. The project cost has been estimated at Rs 600 crore so far,"" said Sanjeev Rastogi, PWD PRO.

Cameras are also supposed to be installed in public places, such as markets, across the capital. ""The plan is to install 1.4 lakh cameras across the city; the allocated budget is Rs 350 crore,"" Rastogi said.

Also on the agenda is remodelling seven of the 17 government hospitals, and converting 94 dispensaries into polyclinics.

On the traffic front, PWD aims to clear congestion at Shastri Park and Seelampur by building a flyover. ""It's a two-year project to help manage traffic from Shahdara to Kashmere Gate,"" said Rastogi.

Staring at a financial crisis of Rs 3,000 crore, the North and East civic bodies have not undertaken any big projects for 2019, and will instead focus on completing pending projects.

The North Corporation wants to finish multi-level parking projects at Rani Bagh, Shiva Market, Shastri Park, Idgah and Gandhi Maidan to create parking space for 5,000 vehicles.

The East MCD is focusing on Krishna Nagar, Preet Vihar, Geeta Colony, Babarpur and Anand Nagri; and the South MCD on New Friends Colony, Rajouri Garden, Defence Colony and Hauz Khas.

India holds an advantageous position on the global map. Not only does it enjoy a favourable demographic dividend with the largest population in the age group of 15-24 years, but it was also ranked 27th out of 80 countries on the global English Proficiency Index 2017. This substantial English-speaking population makes India an attractive market for new, advanced educational products. The country already holds a prestigious rank in the quality of higher education in the world. However, there is still a long way to go, particularly if we look at education delivery in schools, where institutions are only beginning to accept and adopt blended learning.

The year 2018 witnessed rising digital influence in education. After the US, India emerged as the second-largest market for e-learning. The market size is projected to touch $1.96 billion, buoyed by 9.5 million users by 2021. The expanding mobile and data network is playing a major role in the growth of distance education, focused on training and skill development. Edtech and blended digital learning are transforming both higher and K12 sector.

This implies that 2019 will witness an accelerated shift towards blended concept-based learning -- moving away from the traditional rote learning. More emphasis would be on the application of knowledge and the development of core skills, to prepare students for eventually joining the workforce. This goes beyond textbooks and involves group discussions, problem-solving and research-based assignments. Without exhaustive libraries in all schools, online learning tools and resources will be the need of the hour. Some proponents contest that given the future favouring the tech-savvy, schoolchildren should be introduced to digital media at an early age.

The recent Union government directive to reduce homework for school students and the weight of school bags are some steps in this direction. However, an effective solution that will ensure to also deliver these objectives would be to introduce digital curriculum and content in schools. A few state governments have gone a step further and launched online educational resources (OER) on portals with thousands of web resources.

The allocation for school education under Union Budget 2018-19 increased by 14% and focused on strengthening existing initiatives and refining quality. This allocation is expected to rise year-on-year, and it is estimated India's higher education sector will emerge as world's single-largest provider of global talent by 2030, with one in four graduates from India.

Thus, with renewed focus on quality education, with technology as the pivot, the education sector in India is set to make several major positive changes in the years to come. In addition, the rise in digital technologies will bring new innovations, and reduce gaps in delivery of education. As the leading educator George Couros said, ""Technology will never replace great teachers, but technology in the hands of a great teacher can be transformational."""

The present school education system should be completely revamped, he said. Naidu, who was speaking at the annual day function of Jubilee Hills Public School here, said the children must ask questions and seek answers.

Such questioning should become an essential characteristic of a student's education, he said.

""The school curriculum should be oriented to make students think rationally, independently and express cogently,"" he said.

Highlighting the great Indian tradition of 'Guru Shishya Parampara,' he said teachers and

students used to live together and engage in a constant dialogue.

Naidu stressed on technology and tradition going together.

He suggested that only 50% of the time should be spent in class rooms while remaining 50% to be spent outside.

Noting that lifestyle changes were leading to a number of diseases, he said Indian food is time-tested and its Indianness should be preserved.

""Instant food means constant disease,"" the Vice President said.

He said ""People who have ruled us (the British), ruined us, looted us, cheated us, cheated our minds also."" This has resulted in an inferiority complex in the country that those things English are great and the things Indian are inferior, Naidu said.

He also said no government could provide jobs to everybody.

Replying to queries from students, he said farmers in the country were in distress not because of any particular government or any party, but ""somehow our policy from the beginning, the planning commission those days, the parliament, the press and political parties have not given adequate importance to agriculture and rural development.""

The government approach needs to be restructured with emphasis on rural roads, connectivity, electricity, water supply, linking of rivers, construction of godowns and cold storage units, he said.

The government's E-NAM initiative would also help farmers, he said.

He termed loan waiver as a temporary solution and said the country must find out ways and means of structural changes.

Observing that there was a lot of competition in the era of globalisation, with WTO rules in force, he said the Indian manufacturing sector is not able to withstand competition effectively for a variety of reasons.

Many were not able to invest and take up manufacturing as wealth was concentrated in the hands of a few, the Vice President said.

The priority of the governments at the Centre and States should be to focus more on manufacturing, he added."

State governments have increased their budgets for school education in the past three years, but the allotment of funds has not been enough to attract permanent qualified teaching staff to government schools, finds a recent study conducted across six States.

The report, prepared jointly by Child Rights and You (CRY) and the Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability (CBGA), examines budgeting for school education in six States -- West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra -- during the 14th Finance Commission recommendation period, which started in April 2015.

The study finds that there has been an overall increase in revenue with the States following the 14th Finance Commission recommendations. This was a result of an increase in the share of the States in the divisible pool of Central taxes from 32% to 42%. At the same time, a reduction in the Union government's contribution to the States for Central schemes in social sectors forced the States to improve their tax revenue collection. The study analyses whether the availability of additional funds translated into prioritising of school education in these six States.

Between 2015-16 and 2017-18, there was a net decline in the share of school education budget in the total State Budget for three of the six States, according to the detailed demand for Grants and State Budget documents. Bihar saw a dip of 3.1%, Maharashtra a drop of 1% and West Bengal 0.9%. On the other hand, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh saw an increase in the size of school education budget by 0.4%, 2.6% and 3.2%, respectively.

The report examines whether the increase in the size of school education budget was more than the rise in size of the total budget, indicating a higher priority for the sector. It concluded that between 2014-15 and 2017-18, Uttar Pradesh saw a 98.8% increase in budget for schools, whereas its total budget increased by 63.3%. West Bengal's budget for school education increased by 49.4% while its total budget increased by 48.2% and in Tamil Nadu, the former increased by 38.7% but the total budget increased by 38.5%, indicating that school education was a priority for these three States.

At the same time, all the six States showed an increase in the magnitude of per-child and per-student spending for education between 2014-15 and 2016-17.

Despite a varying level of commitment towards school education across the six States, all of them struggle with a shortage of teachers. The report cites data from the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development to show that as on March 2017, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have from 19% to 34% of total teacher positions at the elementary level vacant. Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu were relatively better with 5.9% and 2.6% posts unfilled.

Data from the District Information System for Education show that at the upper primary level, there is a severe paucity of subject-specific teachers required under the Right to Education Act -- 77% upper primary schools in Maharashtra, 46% in Uttar Pradesh, 40% in West Bengal and 37% in Bihar do not have subject teachers.

More than one lakh schools in India are run with only one teacher and all the six States surveyed have shown the number of such schools on the rise. The shortage of teachers is more acute at the secondary level -- Bihar has 20,494 teaching posts vacant, Chhattisgarh 8,278 and Uttar Pradesh 12,008.

The figures don't entirely capture the severity of the shortfall as they do not reflect the shortage of subject teachers."

Suneetha and her classmates at Government Higher Primary School at Madrahalli in T. Narsipur taluk of Mysuru district have been reciting English rhymes in the last fortnight as the day to present their newly acquired English talent is fast approaching.

The school in the tiny village has around 101 students and each one has to speak English with their teachers, friends, and students throughout the day on January 1, 2019. While some are memorising simple rhymes, others are practising dance to Shakira's popular number 'Waka waka' (This Time For Africa).

This is a part of the 'English Empowerment Programme Fest' (EEPF) designed to improve knowledge of English among the students of government schools, said S. Mamatha, Deputy Director of Public Instruction, Mysuru district.

On New Year's day, the fest will be conducted in each of the 339 schools in the taluk, entirely in English -- from the prayer and dance, and action songs to the vote of thanks.

The EEPF is an ambitious project of the Education Department and it is being implemented on a pilot basis in all government schools in T. Narsipur taluk.

There are 26,000 students in the 339 government schools in the taluk. ""They are mainly from rural areas and they need a boost to improve their English. Hence, the department has selected T. Narsipur for the EEPF,"" Ms. Mamatha told The Hindu.

S. Swamy, Block Education Officer, said, ""We have already trained the teachers and cluster officer, and conducted meetings with the various teachers' associations. The motive behind the EEPF is to build confidence among the students to communicate in English.""

Though there is no official communication, the programme is being seen as a precursor to the State government's plan to introduce English medium in 1,000 government primary schools across the State.

The Education Department is thinking of extending the 'T. Narsipur model' across the State by training teachers through the Department of State Educational Research and Training (DSERT) and the District Institutes of Education and Training (DIET), another senior officer said."

However, experts feel that it would be a tough for the government to keep all the promises with the state reeling under a debt of Rs 1.87 lakh crore.

The major promises of the government are to generate employment, permanent jobs to contractual employees, opening of Gaushala, making the state drugs free, unearthed corruption cases, cut the electricity bill to half, increasing old age pension, specially abled pension from Rs 500 per month to Rs 1000 per month and others.

Higher education and sports minister Jeetu Patwari said, ""We have to fulfill all the promises in 100 days.

Meanwhile, finance minister Tarun Bhanot said former BJP-led state government handed over empty coffers to them and they would inform common people of MP about it. Experts feel that the government would release the order as it did in loan waiver scheme for farmers but taking decisions on all its promises will be a tough challenge for the government.

""Citing financial crises a reason, this 100 days plan will focus more on populist measures like they created spiritual department to woo a section of people without spending any money now to make its road easy for Lok Sabha election., ""said Professor Zamirruddin.

The CM singed the loan waiver order but still, it is not clear how it will happen. Similarly, the government might release the order of regularisation of contractual employee or providing benefit to unemployed educated youth but the major question would be when it comes to reality.

The proposal to ""voluntarily"" adopt a bovine was mooted at the meeting of district police officials by Aligarh senior superintendent of police AK Sahni. Forty-one police personnel, who attended the meeting, offered to adopt one stray bovine each. These included four additional SPs, nine circle officers and 27 police station incharges, besides the SSP himself. The bovines will be adopted from January 1.

Talking to TOI, SSP AK Sahni said that the purpose of the initiative is to send a message among the residents that those who can easily afford maintenance of a stray animal should do it in order to help the society at large.

""Every adverse law and order situation is to be faced by us, so we should be the ones taking the initiative in resolving the problems that ail the society,"" Sahni said, adding that this arrangement will continue till all the cow shelters, which are being constructed by the government, become operational.

Sahni, however, added that he will keep the cattle forever.

Superintendent of police (city) Ashutosh Dwivedi said the initiative should also motivate people not to abandon their unproductive animals as they end up destroying standing crops in the fields besides becoming a nuisance in the streets.

Dwivedi said he had no space in his house to keep the bovine, but he volunteered to bear the entire expense of the animal's upkeep.

Meanwhile, Aligarh district magistrate CB Singh has also planned to call a meeting and urge all the administrative staff, around 15,000 of them, to voluntarily adopt a stray bovine each. He said, ""This is a good step in terms of contributing for a social cause.""

Protests against the stray cattle menace have been happening in Aligarh for the past week.

On Wednesday, students and teachers of around a dozen government primary and upper primary schools in Aligarh were forced to stay out of their classrooms on Wednesday as local residents in Iglas area herded stray cows and bulls inside the school compounds. Later, the schools were closed by the administration and the children went back to their homes.

Angered by stray cattle roaming around in their villages and damaging crops, residents of Mohakampur in Iglas, Kaser Gangiri in Atrauli and a few other blocks of the district locked up around 800 animals in schools. Stray animals were even locked up inside a primary health centre."

Ahead of the elections, politicians were actively engaged in swapping party allegiance. The most-telling of such political crossover was Neiphiu Rio's leaving of the NPF, only to return to power AS the chief minister once again with his newly formed NDPP.

On the political front, this year also saw the resurrection of BJP in the state with the party winning 12 seats to cement its influential position in the ruling collation of People's Democratic Alliance. An ugly exchange of verbal toxicity between the BJP and its one-time ally NPF provided another source of headlining news items to the local newspapers prior to the elections.

'Naga Day' celebrates peoplehood

Calls for 'healing of wounds' across the Naga spectrum, and reaffirmations that Nagas are one regardless of where they were, resonated across Khouchiezie ground in Kohima on Jan. 10 as the first 'Naga Day' was observed in the capital town.

The event commemorated the day in 1929 when the Naga Club submitted the historic Naga Hills memorandum to the then British Statutory Commission headed by Sir John Allsebrook Simon. The representation sought safeguard of the rights of the Naga people. The memorandum is considered to be the first written record that establishes the Naga people a singular socio-political entity. The event was organised by the Forum for Naga Reconciliation.

Health is wealth

July saw safety checks initiated by the Dimapur Municipal Council (DMC) on formalin-laced fish, and Nagaland Food Safety Cell training guns on bakeries and carbide-laced fruits. The DMC team inspected the fish markets in Dimapur and collected samples for testing. Consequently, fish laced with formalin were banned in Nagaland.

The state Food Safety authority also destroyed over 5000 kg of adulterated 'fresh' fruits, which were seized after testing positive for a carcinogenic artificial ripening chemical agent. The disposed fruits included mango, pomegranate, watermelon and tomato. Mangoes comprised the bulk of the impounded items weighing in at around 5000 kg.

Monsoon havoc and public transport

The monsoon havoc began on the latter part of July that continued for whole of August during which Nagaland suffered loss of lives, properties, and displacement of families. Kohima and Kiphire suffered the most even as road leading to Kiphire was cut-off from the rest of Nagaland. The central government had to intervene even as the Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio, and governor PB Acharya appealed to the centre for assistance.

The vacancies will be filled at the district-level by a three-member committee, involving the District Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Officer, a representative from School Education Department, and a Headmaster from one of the ADTW schools. The selection procedure would involve a written test, an interview and teaching demonstration in a classroom.

The total vacancies include 175 Secondary Grade teachers, 193 B.T. Assistants, and 108 Post Graduate Assistants, who will be recruited for a monthly salary of ₹8,000, ₹9,000 and ₹10,000 respectively.

The GO said that priority must be given to eligible Scheduled Caste (SC) or Scheduled Tribe (ST) candidates belonging to the village where the particular school having vacancy is located. The teachers, who will be recruited as per the Tamil Nadu Government Servants (Conditions of Services) Act of 2016, cannot claim permanent employment or remuneration on a par with government employees, the GO said.

The GO has, however, attracted opposition from section of activists. S. Karuppiah, State general secretary, Dalit Liberation Movement - TN, questioned the rationale behind recruiting teachers on a temporary basis through a separate selection process when thousands of candidates, who have cleared Teachers Eligibility Test (TET) were awaiting jobs. Stating that such a process will only pave way for corruption and other irregularities in the recruitment, he urged the ADTW department to give up this recruitment process.

""If the government is recruiting teachers on a paltry salary of ₹ 8,000 to ₹ 9,000 on a temporary basis, what quality can be expected in the ADTW schools that are already in a bad shape,"" he asked."

A department official said on Sunday,

The suspension was withdrawn on Thursday and Mondal was given posting at Bikash Bhavan, the headquarters of the School Education Department here.

Mondal had been suspended after the deaths of Tapas Barman and Rajesh Sarkar, two former students of the high school, during the clash over appointment of two teachers of Urdu and Sanskrit, which was resented by students of the school as they wanted English teachers.

At a press meet after the incident, Education Minister Partha Chatterjee had said the DI was being suspended with immediate effect as he failed to understand the gravity of the situation beforehand and could not communicate to the higher authorities about the urgency in recruitment of English teachers in the school.

Mondal had, however, pleaded innocence saying the appointment of teachers was done by the school education department and not him.

The official said Mondal had replied to the showcause notice issued to him after suspension and after considering all factors, the suspension was withdrawn.

He will join the new office in January.

A consultation on the Act organised by Population First, in coordination with Bhumika Women's Collective on Saturday, threw up many instances of sexual harassment, which remained hidden even during the storm kicked up recently by the online 'Me Too Movement'.

Social activist Devi recalled an instance where a university teacher was accused by 14 of his wards of sexually harassing them. Initially approaching a well-known dalit leader for redress, the women, majority of them dalit, were disappointed with his response. Later, they sought constitution of Internal Complaints Committee, which was complied with.

""But the ICC report merely confirmed the allegations, without recommending action. We lodged a police complaint, but found no support there either. Meanwhile, caste groups have begun exerting pressure for withdrawal of case,"" Devi narrated.

Action against teachers sexually assaulting minor children under their care was even rarer. Unions of myriad hues come together to support the perpetrator, making justice impossible, she says.

Government offices were no better, said activists who attended the consultation, recalling instances of sexual harassment in Irrigation and other departments, where justice was hard to find for the victim.

While such was the state of affairs for employees, the plight of unorganised workers was even more pathetic. Local Complaints Committees, mandated by the Act for them, have not been formed in many districts, and even where they are formed, there is little awareness about the same, says K. Satyavathi, Chief Functionary of Bhumika.

""LCCs should be formed at the district level by the District Collectors. Nodal officers should be appointed at village/mandal level. But there is little awareness about the same among officials, even less among workers,"" says Ms. Satyavathi.

According to a representation submitted by the forum, members stated that although the case was transferred to the CBCID in 2013, action against the teachers is still pending. While the CID had sought clarification from the University Grants Commission to ascertain competence of certificates submitted by the teachers, officials from the forum have termed it a ""clear case of cheating and forgery.""

""The persons involved should have been suspended and criminal prosecution launched but no such action was initiated. After 10 years of the commission of offence, the director of school education says that the reports from the DEO (district education officer) are awaited an the CID says that they are awaiting clarification from UGC,"" explained the forum in it's representation.

The forum suspects that the school education department has not initiated any action against the teachers as it is under pressure from various unions.

With no action taken against the teachers, officials suspect that many of them may still be in-service. ""While many of them who obtained such bogus certificates for promotions may have retired in the last 10 years. However, those who procured such fake certificates to secure jobs in government schools may still be working. It is a worrying factor as the quality of teaching that they impart may be poor,"" said M Padmanabh Reddy, secretary of the forum.

An RTI appeal by a citybased civil society had revealed that of the 878 teachers and headmasters, working in government schools across the state, highest number of teachers i.e. 345 with fake degrees hail from Medak. In some cases, the teachers even produced certificates of nonexistent courses from distance universities.

Officials said that most certificates submitted by the teachers were of bachelor of education and master of arts (English literature) and forged by unscrupulous elements. Some teachers even got away with forging certificates of different Vidhyapeeths that are not competent to issue certificates."

Pointing out the flaws in the ongoing investigation, Reddy said that the CID, since 2013, is yet to initiate any action due to lack of clarification from the UGC on the issue.

Mrinal Sen, who passed into the ages on December 30 in coversation with Shoma A Chatterji.

The 'accident,' as Mrinal Sen likes to call it, happened when he was in college.

A voracious reader, Sen would regularly frequent The Imperial Library, now called the National Library, in Calcutta.

He read everything from Marx to Nietzche, from Shakespeare to the Shahnama.

One day, as he relaxed with cards in the catalogue room, he chanced upon Rudolf Arnheim's historic book, Film.

He found the book riveting and even charismatic, leading him on to read everything and anything on cinema.

Along the same time, he wearied of the crop of Indian and American films he began to see.

The love for books on cinema which inspired in him the love for good cinema, juxtaposed against the real-life experience of watching films he did not quite care for, egged Mrinal Sen on to write on the subject, and then involve himself more directly by directing a film himself.

The film was called Raat Bhor (1956).

Few Indian film-makers can boast of not less than six to seven books written on him in two different languages. Mrinal Sen is one of them, while the other two are Satyajit Ray and Ritwik Ghatak

Interestingly, these three film-makers -- who are among the greatest India has ever produced -- have several things in common.

They come from the same backdrop (East Bengal), were born around the same time (the early 1920s), and had the same interests -- that of creating new spaces and worlds through the art, craft and language of cinema.

While Ray and Ghatak are no more, Sen lives on.

He was the lone survivor of the triumvirate of Bengali cinema, the three who, through their films, transcended boundaries of culture and geography and language, to place Indian cinema on the international map.

IMAGE: Mrinal Sen. Photograph: Kind courtesy mrinalsen.org

Sen picked awards left, right and centre.

They didn't matter to him anymore.

Most of his archival clippings, posters, press coverages and photographs are in France which bestowed on him the honour of Commander de L'orde des Arts et des Letters and also held a retrospective of his films, a rare honour for an Indian film-maker.

The USSR gave him the Soviet Land Nehru Award and he has won numerous awards at international film festivals like Cannes, Berlin, Moscow, Karlovy Vary, Chicago, Montreal and Carthage.

The Indian government awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1980 while the West Bengal government gave him the Satyajit Ray Memorial Award in 1994.

At the National Film Awards, his films won four Golden Lotuses over the years while he himself has bagged four Silver Lotuses as Best Director.

He represented India at the UNESCO Commission to celebrate the centenary of cinema and was the president of the International Federation of Film Societies.

He was nominated to the Rajya Sabha and grandly felicitated on his 75th birthday by the West Bengal government with a retrospective of his films and a seminar at Nandan, the city's premiere cultural complex.

The proceedings of the seminar were brought out in the form of yet another book on this film-maker and on his films.

Born in Faridpur district (now in Bangladesh), Sen was sent to Calcutta to do his graduation in 1940.

He reminisces, ""As soon as I came to the big city, I was seized with a kind of fear. Confronted by a crowd, a huge crowd, I felt lost. I felt I was standing alone in the crowd -- an anonymous, self-absorbed, indifferent swarm of crowd, even menacing and monstrous. Loved by my parents and liked by my smalltown teachers, I was now suddenly reduced to anonymity, suffering acutely from a depressing sense of emptiness. Till things proved different, I remained an outsider.""

Asked to comment on his films in retrospect, Sen says, ""I wish I could start from scratch. I have done good, bad and indifferent films.""

""I wish I could erase it all and start afresh like the professor in Ek Din Achanak who walked out on his family on a rainy day and never came back.""

""One of the characters in the film says, 'The saddest thing with life is that you live only one life'.""

IMAGE: Mrinal Sen with his contemporary Satyajit Ray. Photograph: Kind courtesy mrinalsen.org

""However famous you are, you are aware of your mediocrity in certain aspects. When you realise that you face a crisis that is almost insurmountable.""

""Though I have an enviable position in society as a maker of good, bad and indifferent films, I cannot escape this feeling of mediocrity within. Perhaps this happens because we are too immersed in our own selves,"" he sums up.

Where has all the anger gone that formed part of his persona and his films of the 1960s and 1970s?

""I have realised through my own life that, with age and experience, I grow more careful, if not wiser. They say I have toned down with age, but this is not true.""

""How do you expect me to tone down my anger when the most prominent culture in India today is the culture of corruption, in every sphere of life?"" he asks.

Sen himself has the answer.

""The time has changed. The wind has shifted,"" he says.

""It is no wonder then that the quality of anger you seem to be hinting at has also gone with the time and the wind.""

""Gone are the desperate days when we thought that a kind of revolution was brewing on all fronts. Hence the militancy all around -- in me as well.""

He analyses it well.

IMAGE: Mrinal Sen with Suchitra Mitra, singer and composer. Photograph: Kind courtesy mrinalsen.org

""Life is two steps forward and one step backward,"" says Sen, commenting on the militant movement of the 1960s and 1970s in West Bengal.

""We believed in certain things and then came the realisation that we had made a mistake.

But my anger did not evaporate. It was fermenting within, it is fermenting even now, even at my age.""

Through each film that he directed, Sen always managed to disturb his audience and stir them into bouts of investigation.

He experimented with the non-narrative form of film-making through two films, Chorus and Calcutta 71.

But they left the audience cold.

Perhaps they were conditioned to his angst of anger unfolded through a story, or an incident, or a character, such as Ek Din Achanak (based on a novel), Ekdin Pratidin (based on an incident) and Bhuvan Shome (based on two characters), even Khandhar (based on a setting) which often mixed and blended to produce a different, cohesive whole, as seen in Antareen.

He goes on. ""I wish the audience and the critics would not sit on judgement on my films by their exterior look alone. True, I no longer shout these days.""

""But anger, if not in its elemental form, is there, coupled with an inner strength -- all hidden behind the surface despair,"" he says.

Which, however, has been repeatedly belied in his last films, from Genesis through Maha Prithibi to Antareen.

Over the years, consciously or not-so-consciously, Sen acquired the physical manifestations of the public image of an intellectual often splashed across the media.

Much like M F Husain's beard, Sen sported his sideburns and always wore spotlessly white churidar kurtas even at home.

His spectacles were angular and black, making one wonder if he ever changed them since his Mrigaya days.

But they are a poor apology for those bright bright eyes that now seem to have whitish edges round the pupils.

He wears ordinary chappals for footwear and, thanks to a serious gall bladder operation a few years ago which took him to the edge of death, Sen replaced his chain-smoking with the ultimate insignia of the intellectual, the pipe.

""I am fortunate to have been able to pass through the turbulent phases of Indian and world history, the second Great World War, the Partition of India, Independence, Mahatma Gandhi's assassination, the forming of the Indian Republic, the evolution and growth of the Nehru clan... and technically too, the evolution of sound and light technology, much more than an average man with an average lifespan can dream of experiencing,"" he states.

Some of these events, he adds, ""threw me asunder while some others put me back to better shape. There was no wall around me.""

""I enjoyed ideal freedom which helped me to take flights into fantasy. I began to dream.""

""I really believe that in the present consumerist culture, people have stopped dreaming.""

""They no longer have the kind of dreams we had.""

Sen believes that ""anything that breathes is life,"" admitting that he is a part of living history.

""But I must also say that I am not a part of history. I do not always care for history because I live in the instant present, at times, quite conveniently.""

""I am a part of history because I have lived long. That is all.""

He confesses quite openly that though he does not dislike the idea of seniority, he hates to be treated as if he were an ancient man.

He hates to talk about Raat Bhor (1956), his first film, because ""it was a big disaster. Having made it I not only felt terrible, I felt humiliated.""

His second film was Neel Akasher Nichey (Under the Blue Sky).

Though it did have a certain amount of popular appeal because of an international backdrop and lovely music, with songs rendered by Hemant Kumar, Sen himself feels ""it was much less than good. It was over sentimental, technically poor and visually unsatisfying.""

""ut one thing about the film I still find relevant is its political thesis: The struggle for national independence is inseparably linked to the liberal world's crusade against fascism and imperialism. That is perhaps why Nehru and others liked the film.""

He says, ""Someone once asked me whether my films are autobiographical.

""Physically, they may not bear any semblance of my life.""

""But the very experience of filmmaking is an exploration and an extension of my intellectual and my emotional self.""

""In Kharij for instance, no servant actually died in our house. But the film was a strong comment I made on the society I belong to and therefore, on myself.""

""It is a part of me, a part of my wife, Geeta, a part of the reality where middle-class urban families treat their servants in ways they don't even realise are inhuman and cruel.""

""Till before Ekdin Pratidin, I was fighting the enemy outside, through my films.""

""I was pointing a finger at the enemy around us. But from Ekdin Pratidin, I began a journey of soul-searching. The process of fighting the enemy within began from there.""

Provision of '250 crore under the scheme 'Farmer's Welfare' in 2018-19 budget and savings from other schemes would not be adequate to meet the requirement for the implementation of KALIA, Padhi said and added that there would be need for sanction of '1000 crore from the contingency fund to meet the emergent expenditure.

The KALIA scheme amounting to '10,180 crore over a period of three years comprises five interventions to ensure agricultural growth and inclusive development. The five areas of interventions are support to cultivators for farming, livelihood support for landless cultivator households, financial assistance to vulnerable agricultural households and landless labourers, life insurance cover and interest free crop loan upto '50,000.

On December 25, Maharashtra's education department formally launched the MIEB to bring international quality education in state schools. It was also announced that government schools that will be a part of the programme would be named 'Bharatratna Atal Bihari International School.'

The education department has received applications from 455 schools to be a part of the first batch of 100 schools that would have the MIEB curriculum in Marathi and has now started scanning the applications. Francis Joseph, head of MIEB's development and strategy, said that school teachers who are well trained and ready for upgrading their skills would have higher chances of getting selected.

""We are not looking merely at the school infrastructure or the facilities provided in schools. Schools that have a dynamic leadership and teaching staff who are ready to learn something new will be preferred. They should also have the safety of students as their main priority,"" he added.

Schools that have applied for the board's affiliation had to go through a rigorous application process. ""They had to mention all details -- including no-objection certificates from their respective managements, school heads and information about their teachers and infrastructure,"" Joseph said. ""We want all schools to have a wifi connection and to have a safe and child-friendly infrastructure as it is the need of the hour.""

While the department had earlier decided to allow only government schools to be a part of the drive, state education minister Vinod Tawde recently announced that 25 private schools, 25 aided schools and 50 government schools would be a part of the programme.

Members MIEB's governing board said private schools would be scrutinised further because they need to have the right infrastructure in place.

At an interactive session organised by Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (KSCPCR), activists said their visits to multiple schools revealed that teachers, who are among the first to get clues about girls being pushed into marriage, are not doing the needful to prevent it.

Representatives from NGOs said several teachers were not marking girls present or absent in the attendance registry o reduce their own work of following up on girls who keep missing school.

""The y are using dots against their names instead of saying whether they are present or absent. Teachers don't want to pursue the matter with higher authorities, write letters or even alert the child welfare committee,"" an activist said.

The Rajasthan cabinet further resolved to form an inter-departmental committee for short-term farm loan waiver and authorized the CM to nominate members for this committee.

This committee would formulate the criteria and eligibility for waiving off loans from the cooperative banks, nationalized banks, regional rural banks and the land development banks.

He told PTI that although in 1993, Delhi got a legislative assembly, 2018 saw ""another milestone"" in terms of governance and democracy.

Also, 2018 saw less of rabble-rousing between the AAP government and the Lt Governor's office as compared to the past after the July 4 Supreme Court order.

The apex court had ruled that the lieutenant governor of Delhi is bound by the ""aid and advice"" of the Delhi government. Earlier, both the AAP government and the LG had been on loggerhead over administrative issues.

""In 1993, Delhi got the power to elect government, but Delhi's democratically-elected government got full power to work in 2018 after the SC verdict.

""It was a major breakthrough to strengthen democracy... 2018 will be remembered as a 'landmark year' in the history of Delhi,"" Sisodia said.

2018 also saw passing of several ambitious projects of the AAP government, including doorstep delivery of ration, installation of CCTVs across the city among others.

However, the deputy chief minister rued that as services do not come under the Delhi government, the AAP dispensation cannot create new posts.

A two-judge bench of the Supreme Court reserved its order on services and other issues and an order in this regard can come anytime.

""As the Delhi government does not have power of services, we cannot create new posts. We can open news schools, but when it comes to hiring teachers, it will be done by the LG. We can open new hospitals, but hiring of doctors will be executed by the lieutenant governor,"" he said.

Sisodia hoped that in 2019, services will come under the Delhi government.

In 2019, the Aam Aadmi Party government plans to conclude its ongoing or pending projects such as free Wi-Fi, setting up of 1,000 mohalla clinics and doorstep delivery of ration among others.

Giving details about the government's upcoming projects, Sisodia said that the AAP dispensation will start entrepreneurship curriculum for students of class 9 to 12 for 2019, a move aimed at giving an opportunity to youths to become job providers instead of job seekers.

Also, the government will open teacher-training university and sports university in 2019, he said, adding that the process of executing these projects is in the final stage.

According to Sisodia, the proposed teachers' university is aimed at giving quality training to teachers. Sports university will offer various curriculum to youths, intended to encourage youths towards sports.

Another project which will be executed in 2019 is free Wi-Fi. The government is considering two-three modules to provide free-Wi-Fi, a pre-poll promise of the Aam Aadmi Party.

""We are currently considering two-three modules. The Delhi government is on it. Technologies with regard to Wi-Fi are getting changed day-by-day. I can say that in 2019, Delhi will get free Wi-Fi,"" Sisodia said.

Talking about AAP government's doorstep delivery of services, Sisodia said that as of now, 40 services, including driving licence, certificates of birth, death, income and marriage, are being provided to Delhiites at their doorstep.

""We will start providing a total of 100 government services by the end of current financial year,"" he said.

Looking back at 2018, the tussle between the AAP government and former chief secretary Anshu Prakash was a major issue.

In February, Prakash had alleged assault by some AAP legislators in front of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Sisodia at the CM's residence.

The incident triggered a political storm, with the BJP and the Congress seeking to attack the AAP which vehemently rejected Prakash's allegations.

Following the alleged assault, IAS and DANICS officers boycotted attending meetings with cabinet ministers, including the chief minister, to register their protest demanding an apology over the issue.

In June, Kejriwal, Sisodia and cabinet ministers Gopal Rai and Satyendar Jain staged a sit-in at the LG's office, demanding that the lieutenant governor direct IAS officers to end their ""strike"" and order action against those who had struck work for ""four months"".

The ministers had also demanded the LG's approval for the doorstep delivery of rations. Following the sit-in, Lt Governor Anil Baijal started working from home."

Some teachers have opposed this decision and have informed the education ministry to refine the current state of government-aided schools, instead of focussing on starting new ones.

The current state of government-aided schools is shoddy,"" averred teachers and principals alike. Various school principals have revealed that for several months, the government has stopped providing adequate funds, leading to a financial crisis. Maintenance charges, bills, basic supply lines and even salary payments have not been facilitated by the state.

More importantly, the syllabus and curriculum has not been revised for years, according to teachers. It is the same old pattern of teaching and rote learning, teachers lament. Sukhmani Pandey, a teacher said, ""The lessons, poems and chapters have been based on the same pattern for years. There is no addition of new technologies, experimental learning, personality skills, life lessons or practical concepts.""

Creative and interactive teaching-learning concepts are absent, as state-board curriculum is based on book learning and classroom lessons. Jasmeet Barbara, a teacher said, ""For want of a practical approach, we have to stick to textbooks for lessons, there is no way to explain concepts to students through life models. This makes learning boring for students, as their attention span is minimum and there is no creative input at all.""

Outdoor education, practical focus and interactive lessons will improve the standards of state board curriculum. Shabnam Quesreshi, a senior teacher said, ""If we add few elements like interactive and fun learning, outside classroom teaching and practical application of theories, then we can match the style of international curriculum.

A confident Markanday Ahuja, the vice-chancellor, believes he can grow GU to the point where it is capable of competing with Delhi University, come the end of 2019. GU also realises its competition is as much with private institutes as it is with state universities, and there are plans, in the coming year, for the university to be run under a public-private partnership (PPP).

Indeed, Ahuja has already put forward a proposal for the same before the government. As part of the partnership, GU will invite private players to take charge of its courses, but under the university's supervision. ""They will have to reserve 50% of seats for us and the rest will be given to those students who are ready to pay higher fees,"" the V-C explained. ""Private partners can use the government infrastructure and have their faculty and own curriculum,"" he added.

Kankrola, incidentally, falls in Badshahpur, the constituency of MLA Rao Narbir Singh. Narbir, the Haryana public works department (PWD) minister, has been pushing for an educational facility in the village. After pursuing the matter with the state government, it was announced in April, by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, that a varsity would be set up here and in the neighbouring village of Bhangrola. Construction work for the same will begin in January.

Ahuja expects one portion of the building to be ready by the end of August. ""I go by realistic goals. Also, I know what I'm talking about,"" he told TOI. ""GU will have one functional building - one academic block will start from this building itself in the first week of January, (and) the administrative block in the second week of January. Construction work will be complete for one building, and I'm hopeful that in the coming three years the university will be fully functional in Kankrola.""

GU, then, will be run simultaneously from two campuses, the main one located in Rao Tularam College of Science and Commerce, in Sector 51 (the university's own campus, in Sector 85, will be ready only in 2021). ""Practically, we will not be able to have all the facilities in Kankrola in 2019 but we will start our operations there. Also, we will admit a new batch of students in Kankrola, and similarly the students who have enrolled in GU in Sector 51 can continue their studies and finish their courses at this campus,"" explained Ahuja.

The university's administrative wing, he revealed, is seeking to double the number of courses from the current five, and is anticipating almost doubling its student strength from 630 to 1,200 - all in 2019. An upcoming meeting of the academic council will decide on the new courses, Ahuja informed. Further, and in a sign of its ambition to look beyond Haryana and India, GU will be signing two MoUs with international universities from the US and the UK.

The university's authorities are now waiting for the Supreme Court to give them clearance to appoint new teachers - at present GU's teachers are on deputation from other institutes. ""If the SC gives a go-ahead, I expect a bigger budget for GU from the state government. And, there are many colleges which will be affiliated to this university,"" Ahuja added.

Besides, the V-C went on to say, Haryana Vishwakarma Skill University (HVSU) is using GU's campus as a centre for exams. ""See, HVSU is two years old and still they are using our campus for examination. So, I feel we are definitely better placed,"" he concluded."

The draft Bill has provisions for four autonomous boards. The Board of Ayurveda and Unani and the Board of Unaini, Siddha and Sowarigpa will be responsible for education in these fields. The Board of Assessment and Rating will oversee the process of granting permissions to educational institutions, and the Board of Ethics and Registration of Practitioners will serve as a database and monitor ethical matters.

The bill also suggests a common entrance exam and an exit exam, which all graduates will have to clear to receive practising license. It also recommends the introduction of a teacher's eligibility test to determine the ""standard of teachers"" before appointment and promotions.

The Centre said the proposed law seeks to reform the Indian medicine sector and streamline it like the allopathy system of medicine. The bill will ""promote availability of affordable healthcare services in all parts of the country"", the government added.

Health Minister JP Nadda had tabled the bill in Parliament in December 2017. It proposes allowing practitioners of alternative medicines such as homoeopathy and ayurveda to practise modern medicine after attending a short-term ""bridge course"".

The professors said that it is an injustice to them as the difference in pay scale between the two commissions is around Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000.

Moreover, even though they are ad hoc (temporary basis) professors, the workload is equal to that of permanent staff and only the pay scale and additional security differs.

""This is victimisation of our professors. Just because we are on a temporary basis, does not give them (the university) the liberty to exploit us in anyway,"" said a professor on the condition of anonymity.

Meanwhile, another professor, who is serving as an assistant professor at a Churchgate-based college, said, ""Currently, I am being paid around Rs 45,000 while as per the state's clause of the sixth pay commission I should be getting more than Rs 62,000. Adding to this, there is no security provision for us either from the university or college.""

Recently, the state government approved the seventh pay commission where the salaries and related allowances of state staffers including teachers and professors were cleared.

The state government had earmarked a sum of Rs 10,000 crore in the state budget for 2018-2019 to revise the pay scales of the employees.

""While we should be getting salaries now as per the seventh pay commission, we are still stuck with salaries as per the fifth pay commission. We have a family but more importantly, we have self-respect. When I contact my friends from other universities in other parts of the state, they are all getting salaries higher than what we have been getting till now,"" said another professor.

A good number of ad hoc professors are in every department and sub-campus of the university.

""The only drawback apart from the personal problems we face is the lack of motivation we professors struggle with on a daily basis.

""Yeh parampara BJP govenrment ne daali thee, hamaree sarkar bhee 6 mahinon ke faisolon kee samkeesha karegee. [The BJP started this tradition. So our government will also review the decisions taken int eh last six months],"" he said.

The previous BJP regime had started the scheme of distributing smartphones under Bhamashah Digital Parivar Yojana among others in the last months of its tenure.

On Saturday, the freshly inducted cabinet also decided to set up an interdepartmental committee to scutinise short-term farm loan waiver announced in the state. It will decide the eligibility and criteria for loan waiver from cooperative, nationalised, regional, rural and land development banks. The Chief Minister has been authorised by the Cabinet to nominate the panel members.

On December 19, the Rajasthan government had declared loan waiver for farmers which will cost Rs 18,000 crore to the state exchequer.

In another major decision, the government also decided to reopen the Haridev Joshi journalism institute and Dr Ambedkar law university, which the Raje government had shut down in its review of the decisions of the previous Gehlot government.

In two landmark reversals, the government decided to scrap the minimum educational qualification criterion to contest local body elections, and do away with direct elections for the post of mayor and heads of local bodies.

In other decisions, the state government increased senior citizens' pension by Rs 250 a month. Now, those who were getting Rs 500 per month will get Rs 750, while those getting Rs 750 will get Rs 1,000.

Exposing the skeletons in the Science closet

Angela Saini, 38, Science writer

For nearly 300 years, the only female presence at the Royal Society of London was a skeleton preserved in the society's anatomical collection. This is one of the many skeletons lurking in the closet of science that leap at you from the book 'Inferior: How Science Got Women Wrong'. Beyond its pink cover, the book is a careful 224-page take-down of gender stereotypes in science by British science writer Angela Saini, who grew up playing with Lego in a Punjabi household and was the only girl in her math class in school. Saini tells you how many evolved minds of the Victorian era such as Charles Darwin believed women were intellectually inferior to men. Over time, she says, such dangerous biases mated with cultural factors to cheat women out of careers in science.

""Oxford didn't even award degrees to women until 1945,"" says Saini, an award-winning science journalist and one of the many prominent voices against sexism in science. ""A lot of men in science are still very sexist,"" says Saini, recalling the gasps in the audience when a senior biologist in Cambridge introduced her with: ""It is unusual for a woman to be good at math"".

Acutely aware of gender stereotypes in daily conversations with her son, Saini, who is tired of the media's image of a scientist as a man in a lab coat and glasses, makes it a point to use the pronouns 'she' or 'her' while referring to doctors. Her next book investigates how science created the idea of race. ""Every assertion about racial difference crumbles so much more easily than I thought it would. It's like poking dead leaves with a stick,"" she tweeted. - Sharmila Ganesan-Ram

These nuns broke their vows to call for justice

Sister Anupama, 30, and four other nuns

It's not easy for nuns to decided to break the silence and their vow of obedience but when there was no action against Bishop Franco Mulakkal of the Jalandhar diocese three months after a nun from their convent in Kerala accused him of rape, they couldn't hold back. Sister Anupama and four others staged a 14-day public protest on September 8, a move that divided the Christian community. ""We waited months before going public. The church forced us into the streets,"" says Sr Anupama.

The sisters believe they will get justice though they have been ostracised within the congregation. ""We saw how Franco was welcomed in Jalandhar after he got bail. We have not been treated well by the Church before and after the protest,"" she says. At first, the Church and the authorities refused to acknowledge the survivor's complaint, but after two weeks of public protests Franco was arrested.

The nuns now live in the convent with the survivor but no one talks to them. ""We used to work as teachers but now we have to stick to the convent. We get an allowance of Rs 500 a month from the congregation. We stood for justice and there are no regrets,"" says Sr Anupama.

The other nuns from the Missionaries of Jesus congregation who participated in the protest are Sr Alphy, Sr Neena Rose, Sr Ancitta and Sr Josephine. Sr Teena and Sr Annie Jaise from other congregations came to support them on the first day, after which more nuns and priests joined them. -Disney Tom

Making the Indian Railways more disabled-friendly

Virali Modi, 27, Disability rights activist

In 2008, Virali Modi, who uses a wheelchair, was molested by two porters at a Mumbai railway station as they carried her onto the train. ""When we got inside the compartment, the man holding my upper body wrapped his arms around my chest and started touching and groping me,"" recalls Modi, adding that there was ""pin drop silence"" from fellow commuters, who witnessed the abuse. ""I didn't say anything because I was scared they would drop me on the floor,"" she adds.

Modi, who lives between Mumbai and Kansas City, was so worried about being ""slut shamed"" that she endured the same abuse on two other occasions without raising her voice. However, these incidents impressed on her the need for railway stations to be made more accessible. So, in 2017, she started #MyTrainToo, an online petition, which has garnered over 2,33,000 signatures to date. Her campaign caught the attention of a railway official in Kerala, who embraced the cause. Currently, six stations in Kerala have been fitted with portable ramps and narrow, aisle-size wheelchairs.

Modi, 27, became paralysed in 2006 in the US after numerous lumbar punctures were performed in an effort to diagnose what she believes was a bout of malaria. After waking up from a 23-day coma to find herself paralysed from the neck down, Modi spiralled into depression, even attempting suicide twice, because she was shunned by friends and family. ""My distant relatives discouraged their children from hanging out with me by saying, 'Don't hang out with Virali or you will also become disabled,'"" she recalls. ""So, I have faced that 'contagious wali' mindset.""

Modi, who was runner up in a Ms. Wheelchair pageant, would like to pursue a career as a model and actress but has found it difficult to break into the field because of her disability. So for now, she is focusing on the campaign #RampMyRestaurant, which aims to make eateries more accessible. ""I hope to create more awareness and acceptance,"" says Modi. ""I want visibility for those with disabilities in mainstream media, social and corporate spaces."" - Nergish Sunavala

She lost husband, kids, but proved the naked video was fake

Shobha Saju, 36, Cyber crime warrior

Two years ago, entrepreneur Shobha Saju didn't know too much about the IT Act. Today, she knows its ins and outs, as well as details about cyber crime and forensic technology. In mid-2016, a man who worked in her husband's office posted videos and images of a naked woman on the official WhatsApp group and alleged that the woman was Shobha. She's spent the last three years trying to prove that the video clips, which did the rounds on social media, were fake and didn't feature her.

Her husband wouldn't believe her, and forced her out of the house. He filed for divorce and got custody of their children. But Shobha was undeterred in her fight for the truth, first approaching the local police and then the state police six months ago.

""I don't want sympathy. I just want justice,"" says the resident of Thodupuha in Kerala's Idukki district. In November this year, Kerala police's forensic report confirmed that the videos and images were manipulated.

""It has been a struggle, but I did not lose hope. I have been living alone since the incident happened. Now, I can proudly say that I defended my dignity,"" she says.

Shobha will continue to fight to bring the perpetrators to justice as police are yet to find the source of the photos. ""I want to know who did this to me and why. My fight will not be over until the perpetrators are brought before the law,"" she says. -Anantha K

Shutting down the breastfeeding shamers

Adhunika Prakash, 34, Mom-activist

Breastfeeding in public isn't easy: new moms often have to endure stares and comments. In November, a Kolkata mother was chided by mall staff when she complained about the lack of a baby-care room. ""They told her it should be done at home,"" says an angry Adhunika Prakash, who is on a crusade to change this mindset. The 34-year-old mother of two, who already runs Breastfeeding Support for Indian Mothers (BSIM), a Facebook group with 88,000 members, has also launched the #FreedomToNurse campaign. The objective of #FreedomToNurse is not just to get malls and airports to open nursing rooms. ""There is no need for dedicated spaces for breastfeeding. We want to give nursing moms a normal life where they can go anywhere without worrying about how to feed their baby,"" says Prakash.

It's not easy managing motherhood and activism, admits the busy mother of a 3 and 6-year-old, who often has to work late at night but it's a cause she believes in. On December 2, she helped organise events in malls Bengaluru, Delhi and Coimbatore where mothers gathered to nurse their babies in an effort to combat shaming. - Shobita Dhar

Long fight brings cold comfort

Nirpreet Kaur, 50, Prosecution witness in 1984 Sikh killing case

Daddy daudo! Run. That's the last thing Nirpreet Kaur said, or rather screamed out, to her father 34 years ago before she saw a mob close in on him. Kaur was 16 then, and watched as her father Nirmal Singh was tied down, beaten and set afire outside their Raj Nagar home in south west Delhi on the night of October 31-November 1, 1984.

This year, Kaur, now 50, gave testimony that was crucial to the conviction of former Congress MP Sajjan Kumar in the 1984 mass killing of Sikhs. ""He hid in a nallah (drain) though he was badly beaten and partially burnt. But someone saw him and told the mob he was still alive. They poured kerosene over him and watched him burn,"" she recalls. The rest of the family spent the next three days hiding and trying to escape murderous crowds across the city.

As their world burned down around them, her mother boiled a lizard in milk to poison herself, Kaur and her two sons. They'd lost the patriarch of their close-knit family that prayed together, their home, their thriving transport business. ""But she caved in at the last minute,"" says Kaur. ""That's when I told her, 'I will fight till the end',"" she says.

And it was a fight that came at quite a cost. Her determination to get justice never wavered, not even after she was imprisoned under TADA for 11 years on allegations of being a Khalistan sympathiser. ""I had almost given up hope when CBI stepped in and I appeared as a witness before the Nanavati Commission,"" she says. Despite the years of fighting, anger and bitterness, Kaur can still recall her father's voice, calling her 'Nippu', which has kept her going. ""I was his favourite,"" she says.

Pursuing cases meant she has had to sell or mortgage most of her belongings, including her home. Sajjan Kumar's conviction after 34 years is cold comfort. ""Is this justice? He has lived his life and even now he has been given time to surrender. Look at us. My biggest regret is that I have not been able to be a mother to my children,"" she says. - Himanshi Dhawan

Thanks to her, women can now sit down on the job

P Viji, 50, Founder, Labour Union activist

It's been four years since P Viji held a chair and led a protest on Kozhikode's central SM Street, demanding the right to sit and take toilet breaks for women employees of the ritzy retail showrooms on the stretch. This year, in July, the Kerala government finally amended its Shops And Commercial Establishments Act to guarantee a comfortable working environment for women. It's also the year she made it to BBC's annual list of 100 inspiring and influential women from around the world.

Viji, now 50, has seen the harsh face of domestic violence at close quarters. ""I saw women work all day as hard, if not harder, than the men yet they'd face abuse. After sunset, you'd hear the cries of women from all the homes. They never got a break,"" she says.

When she was 20, she joined NGO Anweshi which changed the course of her life. With Anweshi's founder K Ajitha, Viji learnt how to speak up. She started by tackling domestic abuse in her community. In 2009, she formed the non-profit, Penkoottu (women's collective) to fight for the rights of labourers and informal workers. Then came a women-led union which raised crucial issues like toilet breaks and chairs for women in the unorganised sector, a place where traditional unions had failed to go. ""I feel a shift in the attitude of employers towards women. We instilled a sense of dignity and confidence in women workers,"" she says. - Sreedevi C

Being a man - and a woman

Durga Gawde, 25, gender-fluid artist

The first time Durga Gawde thought about gender was the second day of kindergarten. ""In playschool, we had one bathroom. In kindergarten, there was one for boys, another for girls. Boys wore comfy shorts, girls frilly pinafores. I wondered why,"" says Gawde.

The 25-year-old artist, educator and drag performer from Mumbai identifies as a non-binary gender-fluid person, and uses the pronouns they/them/their rather than 'he' or 'she'. ""Sometimes I am more female, sometimes more male, sometime both and sometimes neither,"" says Gawde. Over the past year-and-a-half, Gawde has been raising awareness about gender fluidity through autobiographical videos and performances, and her Instagram account @durgagawdestudio. In June, Gawde performed as Shakti, India's first drag king.

The internal struggle over discomfort with the body gave Gawde suicidal thoughts during her teens. ""After I hit puberty, I couldn't recognise myself in the mirror. All the thoughts I had about who I am conflicted with what society told me,"" Gawde says. ""Gender identity has got nothing to do with your biology; it is psychological. It has everything to do with how you see yourself.""

After enrolling at Rhode Island School of Design in the US, Gawde began exploring identity and gender dysphoria, the condition of feeling that one's biological sex does not align with gender identity. ""When I came back to India, I started paying attention to how my brain functioned differently when I felt more masculine or feminine, and saw clear patterns,"" Gawde says. ""The minute I reclaimed my body and started expressing myself, I had a better headspace.""

Gawde's parents understood their child's way of being in 2017, and Gawde began speaking publicly about gender dysphoria and fluidity. ""They were the toughest months of my life because I was creating awareness publicly and within my own family,"" Gawde says.

Gawde's role model is Australian model and actor Ruby Rose. ""Growing up in India, there was almost no representation for gender-fluid or gay people,"" Gawde says. ""The only way I can bring about a change is by being the kind of person that I needed when I was a child."" - Sonam Joshi

Bringing your father to justice

Kausalya Sankar, 21, Anti-caste crusader

Born into the OBC community of thevars, Kausalya fell in love with Sankar, a dalit who hailed from Kumaralingam village in Udumalpet, Tamil Nadu. The couple got married on July 12, 2015, but their joy was shortlived. Sankar was hacked to death on March 12, 2016, in front of her eyes. Kausalya suffered severe injuries during the attack but, after she recovered, she testified against her own father, resulting in his conviction for the horrific crime. ""I objected to the bail petition of my parents 58 times,"" says Kausalya, ""to fight against caste killings and crimes"".

Today, Kausalya, who has established Sankar Social Justice Trust, fights caste crimes, often meeting other survivors. Earlier this year, Kausalya travelled to Hyderabad to meet Amrutha. Belonging to a wealthy, upper caste family, Amrutha married a man from the SC community, Pranay Perumalla, in April 2016. On September 14 this year, Pranay was murdered in front of his wife. ""The names are different but the crime is the same. They have all suffered like me. So I share my experience and tell them that they have to stand up and fight,"" says Kausalya, who recently remarried. -Priya M Menon"

Pandya, who is a known structural engineering expert of Gujarat, was denied promotion since 2014 by a group that has been enjoying a brute majority in the syndicate body.

The syndicate body accepted the report of the committee of former vice-chancellor of Gujarat University professor M N Patel and resolved to promote Pandya as a professor under the career advancement scheme. The probe committee was constituted by the state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama in December 2016. Pandya's promotion will be effective from December 2010.

It was in 2011 that Pandya had cleared the interview for his promotion and the committee had recommended that he be promoted. But the selection committee's report was tabled in the syndicate meeting only in September 2014, but later withdrawn under pressure from the majority group. It was claimed that the promotion was denied on the grounds that Pandya did not fulfill the requirements laid down by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE).

On the basis of series of representations made by Pandya including that to Gujarat governor O P Kohli and a series of ministers, the state education department had written several letters asking the university to rethink the decision. But as the university blatantly ignored directives of the state government, a group of BJP MLAs - Yogesh Patel, Jitendra Sukhadiya and Ketan Inamdar - started rallying behind Pandya and had even decided to join dharna program outside MSU head office in December 2016.

High drama was witnessed on Saturday too before the syndicate meeting commenced as the three BJP MLAs reached the university head office demanding that the issue be resolved today. The MLAs were of the opinion that if a state government's probe committee had submitted its report long back then why the university was not acting on it.

It was then that Chudasama himself appointed a probe committee headed by Patel. The committee had submitted its report in January 2017, but it was not placed before the syndicate until on Saturday.

""This is a sensitive syndicate body and I am thankful to them for resolving my long-pending grievance,"" Pandya told TOI."
"107","1029111066","2018-12-29","http://www.theshillongtimes.com/2018/12/30/breaking-the-deadlock/","Breaking the deadlock","theshillongtimes.com",FALSE,"While on my way to explore one of the wettest regions on Earth, I had an experience that took my understanding for a toss. The educational landscape in the hilly terrain looked challenging, obviously. On my visit to a government-aided school in Mawsynram, I encountered living example of the fact that 'If you believe, you can bring about change'. Despite the odds that the terrain brings with it, students and teachers are thriving by marching ahead to make transformations in the teaching-learning process.

Intrigued by the cultural processes and atmosphere of teaching-learning in the school, I wondered what makes this school advance with true spirit of the National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, when the rest of the country is grappling with the meaning and implementation of the NCF. To serve my curiosity better, I asked the teachers and the head teacher to help me understand how they are bringing about change in the culture of learning, constructing knowledge, developing professional teachers and creating an atmosphere of inclusive learning.

In response to my questions, I was told that intervention by the Asian Development Bank and the Government of Meghalaya to improve quality of education has been instrumental to this change. Implementing organisation, IPE Global Ltd, has designed and developed Teachers' Professional Development Programme, which was the medium through which teachers were trained for developing critical competencies which have consequences on learning and quality of education. The combination of institutional synergies has induced change that will revolutionise landscape of school education.

At Mawsynram Higher Secondary School, one of the oldest schools, unfolds the story of reviving quality of education by means of redefining pathways to traverse and achieve what actually learning must look like! As reported by a schoolteacher, children travel from distant places, traversing terrains and the weather to come to this school to pursue education. On being asked about the role of schooling, it is worthy to know that teachers talk about the conduciveness of school and classrooms to foster learning which is the basis of positive student engagement in the lessons.

Teachers' concerns before the intervention seemed to be limited around low quality, low learning outcomes and poor performance. This was a deadlock, which seemed to be unbreakable besides commitment, subject expertise and hard work. Lacking in training, teachers struggled hard to remain motivated and confident to bring about change in learning levels of students. The Professional Development Programme has helped teachers to unearth their potentials by well contextualised approach to training and handholding in the form of 'on-the-job training'.

The teachers now have clear understanding of student-centered learning; their implementation of culturally responsive teaching-learning methods, collaborated learning, efficient instruction and assessment strategies have propelled the culture of inclusive quality education. This is further strengthened by means of continuous professional development; teachers are involved extensively in practices such as drafting integrated lesson plans and addressing issues concerning students' learning by forming professional learning communities or communities of learning as they call it. In the whole process of the transformational change, ICT has been seamlessly intertwined.

The foremost challenge to the transformational process is to ensure sustainability. The potential sustainability of this intervention looks positive; attitudinal change, handholding support and cultural shift in the professional development are in place.

However, for the process to continue and flourish, it is important that the school gets regular support, mentoring and handholding to advance to the fullest.

""We have certainly come a long way,"" vice-chancellor Markanday Ahuja says.

Back in March, Ahuja, then newly appointed as V-C, was finding it tough to manage, forced as he was to borrow chairs from Rao Tularam College of Science and Commerce. GU continues to function from this Sector 51 campus but at least, now, there's a full administrative block, more than 10 classrooms and a library to cater to its first batch of students. The V-C has his own air-conditioned cabin too.

GU, which received a sanction of Rs 20 crore in 2018 as initial funding, presently has 630 students. Still, assessing the success of a university which is not even six months old is an exercise both unreasonable and futile.

Professor Tankeshwar Kumar, vice-chancellor of Guru Jambheshwar University (Hisar), believes GU needs at least five years before it can be compared with any other state university. ""The infrastructure should be on a par with the best universities in the country,"" says Kumar. ""It has received the required grant but it needs to hire the right faculty, and not just any other staff, to attract students.""

Most importantly, the syllabus needs to be tailored for the times, so that graduates can leave GU with some assurance of a stable career ahead of them. ""We need to note that what they are teaching is on a par with other universities in the state. Only if lecturers hired by them are good will they pose a challenge to others,"" says Rajbir Singh, deputy registrar at Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak. The aim is not to start another institute of higher education but to provide a quality centre of learning where young men and women line up to enrol every year, a place that prepares them for an often-uncertain job market, he adds.

Quality, not quantity, should be the priority, agrees Dr (professor) R B Solanki, vice-chancellor, Chaudhary Ranbir Singh University (Jind). ""Next year, students will only come to GU if this institute delivers on its promises and gives what it said in its prospectus,"" Solanki says.

Besides providing a grant, the Haryana government has helped recruit 28 teachers to GU. Ahuja is happy with what he has been able to achieve this year, and has his sights set on 2019. ""We have recently signed an MoU with Medhavi College, Nepal, which will facilitate educational, scientific, cultural and academic exchanges between our institutions. We are moving in the right direction,"" he says.

With GU's own campus in Sector 85 still under construction, it will take another three years, and around Rs 700 crore, for it to become fully functional. Ahuja, who presided over the expansion of Baba Mastnath University in Rohtak, wants to set the bar high for GU. ""I want to work hard and make people work hard in the same way I converted Baba Mastnath - which began with only one course (ayurveda) - from one room in 1989 to a leading university today.""

But besides building physical space, another test is to build character in students, something Ahuja feels is lacking in today's generation. ""I'll make sure GU offers at least one optional paper on character building."" That, though, is for the future. The next target is to conduct examinations fairly and competently, in April, and, then, to get ready for the second year.

But for Gurgaon University to find its own niche, it will have to do things its own way. Shyam Menon, founding vice-chancellor of Ambedkar University, Delhi, says every institution must have its own benchmark of success. ""The university should be very rooted in the environment where it is located,"" Menon had told TOI in a conversation earlier in 2018, adding, ""We can build buildings but we won't be able to breathe life into a university unless we assemble competent and dedicated faculty."""

Gurgaon University (GU) is likely to be run under a public-private partnership (PPP) in the coming year. Markanday Ahuja, the vice-chancellor, has already put forward a proposal for the same before the government.

As part of the partnership, GU will invite private players to take charge of its courses, but under the university's supervision. ""They will have to reserve 50% of seats for us and the rest will be given to those students who are ready to pay higher fees,"" the V-C explained.

""Private partners can use the government infrastructure and have their faculty and own curriculum,"" he added.

It's not yet a year old but GU is already thinking big for 2019, with plans to double its student intake and, also, to build a campus in Kankrola. Ahuja believes he can grow GU to the point where it is capable of competing with Delhi University, come the end of 2019.

Kankrola, incidentally, falls in Badshahpur, the constituency of MLA Rao Narbir Singh. Narbir, the Haryana public works department (PWD) minister, has been pushing for an educational facility in the village. After pursuing the matter with the state government, it was announced in April, by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, that a varsity would be set up here and in the neighbouring village of Bhangrola. Construction work for the same will begin in January.

Ahuja expects one portion of the building to be ready by the end of August. ""I go by realistic goals. Also, I know what I'm talking about,"" he told TOI. ""GU will have one functional building -- one academic block will start from this building itself in the first week of January, (and) the administrative block in the second week of January. Construction work will be complete for one building, and I'm hopeful that in the coming three years the university will be fully functional in Kankrola.""

GU, then, will be run simultaneously from two campuses, the main one located in Rao Tularam College of Science and Commerce, in Sector 51 (the university's own campus, in Sector 85, will be ready only in 2021). ""Practically, we will not be able to have all the facilities in Kankrola in 2019 but we will start our operations there. Also, we will admit a new batch of students in Kankrola, and the students who have enrolled in GU in Sector 51 can continue their studies and finish their courses at this campus,"" explained Ahuja.

The university's administrative wing, he revealed, is seeking to double the number of courses from the current five, and is anticipating almost doubling its student strength from 630 to 1,200 - all in 2019.

Further, and in a sign of its ambition to look beyond Haryana and India, GU will be signing two MoUs with international universities from the US and the UK.

The university's authorities are now waiting for the Supreme Court to give them clearance to appoint new teachers -- at present GU's teachers are on deputation from other institutes. ""If the SC gives a go-ahead, I expect a bigger budget for GU from the state government. And, there are many colleges which will be affiliated to this university,"" Ahuja added.

Besides, the V-C went on to say, Haryana Vishwakarma Skill University (HVSU) is using GU's campus as a centre for exams. ""See, HVSU is two years old and still they are using our campus for examination. So, I feel we are definitely better placed,"" he concluded."

Bharathidasan University on Saturday decided to wait for a new Government Order on the retirement age of principals in self-financing colleges, after contrasting views were expressed by the Senate members on raising the limit to 65 years from 62 at present.

During the Senate meeting, a section of members citing the Government Order 325, dated August 18, 2003, sought adherence to the State Government's emphasis on 62 years, while some others advocated compliance with the latest UGC regulations, citing the increase effected in retirement age of principals of affiliated colleges in Anna University to 65 years.

Apprehensions were expressed by members espousing the cause of teachers in self-financing colleges that appointment of retirees from government and aided colleges as principals in their institutions and letting them hold the post till 65 years was tantamount to curtailing the career progress of faculties who had put in decades of service.

The counter given by those favouring 65 years as retirement age was that Bharathidasan University had secured the consent of the University Grants Commission to that effect during 2005 and the decision had been adopted in the Syndicate.

Vice-Chancellor P.

The central agency registered two separate First Information Reports (FIRs) -- one against unknown persons for the rape and murder of the 19-year-old girl and another against three employees of a Vijayawada court for destroying the evidence. While the Hyderabad branch of the CBI registered the FIR relating to the main case, the second FIR about destruction of evidence was registered in Visakhapatnam. Both the cases were booked on Thursday.

The Hyderabad High Court in November had ordered the CBI probe into the case and had also asked the agency to probe destruction of evidence in the Vijayawada Mahila Court. The victim, a B.Pharmacy student, was raped and murdered on the intervening night of December 26 and December 27, 2007. Her body was found in a pool of blood in the bathroom at Sri Durga Ladies Hostel.

In 2008, police claimed that one Satyam Babu, arrested in a cell phone robbery case, confessed to the murder. The victim's parents, both teachers, had alleged that the police pinned the crime on Satyam Babu to misdirect the investigation as a relative of a powerful politician was involved in the crime.

The Mahila Court in Vijayawada, on September 10, 2010, convicted and sentenced Satyam Babu to life imprisonment. In 2017, the Hyderabad High Court acquitted Satyam Babu. Subsequently the State government constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to conduct a fresh probe.

The High Court, which was supervising the probe by the SIT, found that the evidence in the case was destroyed in the Mahila Court in 2014 even though the appeal against the conviction of Satyam Babu was pending in the High Court. Taking serious note of this, the High Court reached the conclusion that only a probe by an independent agency could bring out the truth.

The rebel withdrawal from the port, which is the point of entry for food aid to some 14 million Yemenis UN agencies say are on the brink of famine, is a key part of a ceasefire that went into effect on December 18.

Pro-government forces are also supposed to pull back from parts of the city they recaptured in an offensive they launched with the backing of a Saudi-led coalition on June 13.

The UN Security Council last week unanimously approved a resolution authorising the deployment of observers to oversee a hard-won truce for Hodeida that was agreed by the Saudi-backed government and the rebels in Sweden this month.

Retired Dutch general Patrick Cammaert is heading a joint truce monitoring committee, which includes both government and rebel representatives, and chaired its first meeting this week.

The UN-led panel addressed ""the first phase of the implementation of the agreement... based on ceasefire, confidence building measures to deliver humanitarian assistance and redeployment"", a UN statement said.

It added that the panel would convene again on January 1 to discuss ""detailed plans for full redeployment"".

The UN also said that a humanitarian convoy was expected later Saturday to leave Hodeida port and travel along the main road that links it to the rebel-held capital Sanaa.

Its destination was not immediately clear.

""As a confidence building measure, the parties have agreed to begin opening blocked humanitarian corridors, starting with the Hodeida-Sanaa road, followed by other routes, in a phased manner,"" said the statement.

The truce has remained shaky, with the two sides accusing each other of violations.

A resident reached by telephone on Saturday told AFP pro-government and rebel forces had exchanged fire briefly overnight.

The resident added that coalition jets were heard overhead on Saturday morning.

In addition to the withdrawal of fighters from Hodeida, the agreement included a planned prisoner swap involving some 15,000 detainees.

A ""mutual understanding"" was also reached to facilitate aid deliveries to Yemen's third city Taiz -- under the control of loyalists but besieged by rebels.

The two sides have agreed to meet again in late January for more talks to define the framework for negotiations on a comprehensive peace settlement.

The war between the Shiite Huthi rebels and troops loyal to President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi escalated in March 2015, when he fled into Saudi exile and the Saudi-led coalition intervened.

Since then, the war has killed some 10,000 people, according to the World Health Organisation, although human rights groups say the real death toll could be five times as high.

More than 22 million people -- three quarters of the population -- now depend on humanitarian assistance to survive.

Yemenis struggling to survive such conditions are also confronted with a collapsed economy, leaving civil servants and teachers without pay for months.

On Thursday, Hadi instructed the government to pay the salaries of civil servants in the rebel-held city of Hodeida starting this month, a move that was welcomed by the UN.

""President Hadi's decision is an important step towards improving the economic situation, and alleviating the humanitarian suffering of the Yemeni people,"" the office of the UN special envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths tweeted.

The central agency registered two separate First Information Reports (FIRs) -- one against unknown persons for the rape and murder of the 19-year-old girl and another against three employees of a Vijayawada court for destroying the evidence.

While the Hyderabad branch of the CBI has registered the FIR relating to the main case, the second FIR about destruction of evidence was registered in Visakhapatnam. Both the cases were booked on Thursday.

The Hyderabad High Court in November had ordered the CBI probe into the case and had also asked the agency to probe destruction of evidence in the Vijayawada Mahila Court.

The victim, a B.Pharmacy student, was raped and murdered on the intervening night of December 26 and December 27, 2007. Her body was found in a pool of blood in the bathroom at Sri Durga Ladies Hostel.

In 2008, police claimed that one Satyam Babu, arrested in a cell phone robbery case, confessed to the murder.

The victim's parents, both teachers, had alleged that the police pinned the crime on Satyam Babu to misdirect the investigation as a relative of a powerful politician was involved in the crime.

The Mahila Court in Vijayawada, on September 10, 2010, convicted and sentenced Satyam Babu to life imprisonment.

In 2017, the Hyderabad High Court acquitted Satyam Babu. Subsequently the state government constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to conduct a fresh probe.

The High Court, which was supervising the probe by the SIT, found that the evidence in the case was destroyed in the Mahila Court in 2014 even though the appeal against the conviction of Satyam Babu was pending in the High Court. Taking serious note of this, the High Court reached the conclusion that only a probe by an independent agency could bring out the truth.

The CBI booked T. Kumari, Y. Subba Reddy and P. Venkata Kumar, all employees of Mahila Court, Vijayawada. According to the investigation agency, the accused disposed off and destroyed Material Objects (MOs) under a criminal conspiracy.

The High Court in its November 29 order observed that destruction of MOs was shocking to the judicial conscience. While noting that certain DNA test results were also used as part of evidence by the trial court, it voiced the suspicion of attempts having been made in the trial court to destroy evidence.

Bengaluru's aesthetic beauty has been restored, city roads are free from potholes, and cleanliness has improved -- all thanks to the Karnataka High Court, which woke up BBMP from slumber. Acting on a batch of PILs, a division bench headed by Chief Justice Dinesh Maheshwari directed BBMP to preserve the city's visual appeal by removing illegal hoardings, flexes and banners. Due to this, new bye-laws are being evolved to regulate hoardings. BBMP officials even registered an FIR against Minister D K Shivakumar for not removing an unauthorised ad, despite being given time. Citizens also got relief from pothole-riddled roads and garbage piles in public areas. The court availed the assistance of Army engineers to check the quality of work done by BBMP.

Nanditha (11) gets the undivided attention of her teacher every day. The resident of Obenahalli in Kolar is the sole student in the Government Primary School. The school, which was shut down at the start of the year 2016-17 after most students left it for private institutions, was reopened on the insistence of Nanditha, her parents and well-wishers.

Namma Thambis: Green warriors of Ulsoor Lake

On October 10 this year, over 1,000 Thambis of the Madras Sappers waded into the waters of Bengaluru's Ulsoor lake and fought a war against an invasion, and won it. The battle was against water hyacinth, a weed. Ulsoor lake, situated in the heart of the IT City,is also used by the Sappers for training. Tired of seeing their lifeline being suffocated owing to pollution, the Sappers took matter into their own hands. The soldiers,on boats, pulled out the waste using their bare hands. They also removed plastic waste, household rubbish and other garbage. At the end of the day, the Army also issued a wake-up call in their signature fashion, blunt and to the point: ""People should understand that it is not the business of the Army to become garbage cleaners.""

Ananya:Hero in the hills

Ananya Vasudev RM saved 15 families of Karike village in Kodagu district during this year's floods and subsequent landslides. Ananya Vasudev,an assistant lecturer of Geology at the National Institute of Technology, received a WhatsApp video from a friend which showed loud sound emanating from the ground. Ananya Vasudev asked his friend to send another video. After seeing the fresh video, he was sure the sound was due to soil piping and the area could see a landslide. Soil piping is a formation of voids within soil which causes internal erosion and seepage. He immediately spoke to Kodagu Deputy Commissioner Sreevidya who sent a team to the village and evacuated the families. As predicted by Ananya, the area saw a huge landslide a few hours later.

S B Vastradmath: Speedy justice his goal

Chitradurga district court judge S B Vastradmath has done his bit to ensure that the public reposes its faith in the judiciary by delivery of quick judgments. Recently, he was in new for sentencing a man who killed his wife to life imprisonment within 13 days of the crime. He pronounced another judgment within 11 days of the crime. In September, the judge delivered 153 judgments in 22 days without taking a day's leave. He has broken his own record of achieving 70 points in a single calender month, which was earlier set by him during his tenure as the Civil Judge (Jr division) at Molakalmuru. In the system to evaluate judges, a point is awarded for each judgment where the maximum is 70 points irrespective of the number of cases. Vastramath says awarding death penalty to 3 men accused of rape and torture of a woman in Kolar was his most memorable judgment.

In absence of claims, he gets the paperwork done, after which he takes the unclaimed bodies to the graveyard and performs the last rites as per their religion.

Krishna Byregowda:Crusade against plastic

At a time when plastic water bottles were the norm in government offices, Rural Development Minister Krishna Byregowda decided to do away with them at his offices and meetings. He replaced the plastic bottles with glass tumblers and reusable water bottles. Byregowda even carries a personal water bottle to the Assembly and Council to avoid using plastic or paper cups. Each person who visits the minister's office is served water in a glass tumbler, unlike the popular practice in most government offices where water is given in plastic or paper cups. Such was the impact of his approach to the matter that the CM asked officials to refrain from distributing water in plastic bottles at all government events.

Randeep D: Official in public demand

That good work seldom goes unnoticed was proved in the case of IAS officer Randeep D, who was brought back as the Additional Commissioner of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) owing to public pressure after being shunted from the position. Randeep was transferred by an order signed by Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy as the Commissioner of Social Welfare Department. However, he had earned the confidence of waste management activists for his attempts to reform the ill-managed system in the city. Randeep was credited with setting up the Solid Waste Management control room, bringing proposals of GPS tracking of auto-tippers and compactors, and updating the microplan. Activists pointed out his role in implementation of standard operating with regarding BBMP's Animal Husbandry Department. This led citizens to launch an online campaign to demand his reinstatement. After the campaign got the support of about 1,000 people, Kumaraswamy had to take a relook at his decision.

Kempaiah had decided to visit the school to see the conditions for himself after he received several complaints from parents about the unhygienic conditions in the classrooms and toilet. While checking the toilets, when he saw it blocked, he got to his knees and started cleaning it with a brush. He had expressed to TNIE that it was unfortunate that the teachers and anganwadi workers had not kept the school clean. The girls in the school were forced to walk to their homes in the village for toilet breaks during class hours.

Inscription Stones of Bangalore: Documenting city's history

A civic activism project, ""Inscription Stones of Bangalore"" aims at creating awareness about and protecting ancient stone inscriptions (shila shaasanas) found in the Bengaluru region. The group has discovered several new inscription stones and restored the neglected ones by relocating them to a respectful place. They have educated citizens through postcards, public talks, school visits, poster presentations and other group- funding initiatives. With the help of latest technology, they have created 3D models of critically-endangered stone inscriptions. This project follows in the footsteps of B L Rice, who between 1894 and 1905, documented the stones in his 12-volume book, Epigraphia Carnatica. The project also acts as a platform for interested Bengaluru residents to work towards conservation of these ancient stones, which speak a lot about the Garden City's rich cultural past."

The measures are among a series of fresh initiative announced by Amarinder to take his government's fight against drugs to the next level, after a meeting to review the functioning of the Special Task Force (STF) set up to wipe out the menace of drugs from the state.

Officials posted in the respective police stations from whose jurisdiction drug seizures are made will now be held directly accountable, Amarinder further announced at the meeting, which saw a series of directives being issued to strengthen the government's efforts to combat the menace and to facilitate de-addiction and rehabilitation on a bigger scale.

The proposed Advisory Board will be constituted under Prevention of Illicit Traffic (PIT) in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act with the aim of allowing detention of drug smugglers without trial for a year as well as attachment of properties of proclaimed offenders under the said Act. The

Chief Minister has asked Additional Chief Secretary Home Nirmal Singh Kalsi to work out the modalities in this regard, according to the official spokesperson.

The Additional Chief Secretary Home has also been asked to convene coordination meetings with all central and neighbouring states' enforcement agencies to effectively check cross-border smuggling of drugs into Punjab.

Stressing the need to centralise and integrate the various functions involved in promoting de-addiction in the state, he said the Drug Division in the Health Department will oversee the opening of new drug centres, issuance of licences to private de-addiction centres and distribution of the necessary drugs in

government hospitals. The Division will be headed by a Secretary.

Amarinder has further asked Additional Chief Secretary Health Satish Chandra to simplify the licensing procedure for private de-addiction centers to strengthen the framework for weaning youth away from

drugs.

STF Chief Mohammad Mustafa informed the meeting that the STF, District Police and the State Special Operation Cell (SSOC) had successfully ensured strict enforcement, resulting in the arrest of 13756

The teachers at the IITs and other institutes across the country have been served with notices by the income tax department asking them to pay a levy for accommodation on campus.

Both government and non-government employees have to pay tax on prerequisite value when the employer provides accommodation. For non-government employees, the pre-requisite value is 15 per cent of the salary + 30 per cent tax.

Confirming the same, professor Errol D'Souza, Director, IIMA, said, ""Our issue is that everyone here has equal housing. Two people living in similar houses and paying different rent is not equal to the law. This will force faculty to stay outside the campus as the cost of staying on campus will be very high. This will impact educational outcomes as we have classes even at 8.00 pm and also hold surprise quizzes.""

""IIMA follows a gurukul system where everyone lives on the campus. If that goes away, we might not be producing industry ready students. One of the best advantages of our students is that they can be called in at any time. We believe it is bad in law as it does not treat equals equally. We have represented to the Ministry of Finance expressing our concerns over this and I must say the secretary has been very supportive,"" he added.

Citing an example of an IIT professor based in Delhi, he said, ""Fortunately or unfortunately, a professor in Delhi, doing consultancy, was asked to pay more than his salary. He eventually made a representation and now the authorities are looking into the situation more seriously.

A faculty member, requesting anonymity, said, ""We are a public institution and we were given housing as a perk. We never got an HRA and were paying the license fee for the housing. The new formula, if implemented, will compel us to move out of campus, which will impact education. Many a time, the faculty and students discuss projects at night after classes, which is only possible because we all live together on the campus.""

Another faculty member said, ""This is a stupid policy. While it will not impact faculty in cities like Mumbai where the cost of living outside the campus would be high, in small towns or a city like Ahmedabad, cost of living on campus would increase so much that a faculty would prefer to live outside the campus. This policy will discourage residential campuses in small cities.""

Unfortunately, IISC and IIM-Bangalore have agreed to pay. IIM-Calcutta went for advanced ruling and is not supposed to pay."

(HT File)

With some school headmasters (HMs) dragging their feet over paying penalties for allegedly inflating attendance of students, the Bihar government has finally decided to recover fines by deducting the amount from their salary.

The HMs allegedly spiked attendance of students to claim more funds under the mid-day meal(MDM) programme.

Though the government received reports of irregularities long ago and imposed financial penalty on HMs, the fines could not be fully recovered. Many of the HMs moved court for relief citing their unwanted involvement in non-academic work, while others were just indifferent.

The government has ordered the recovery of a Rs8.68-crore penalty from HMs. Of which, Rs 4.21-crore (48%) has been recovered. More than 1,000 HMs have allegedly fudged the data since 2013, when the idea of penalty was first mooted by the state education department.

RK Mahajan, principal secretary of the department of education, recently directed all district programme officers (DPOs) to deduct the penalty amount from headmasters' salary in five instalments over as many months.

""The DPOs must ensure a monthly deduction from all those who have not deposited the penalty amount within a month of the receipt of the letter, except those who have got stay from the court,"" stated a letter by Mahajan.

""During inspections, the attendance of that particular day in the school and the average of the previous week is matched. If the deviation is within 10%, there is no issue. However, if the deviation is above 10%, a penalty equivalent to the amount given in the last three months is imposed on the headmaster,"" said Vinod Kumar Singh, director of the mid-day meal programme, .

Another official said that in several cases, the accused HMs with the help of their association approached the Patna high court or the Lokayukta, claiming that they were overburdened with non-academic work like management of MDM. The court has also asked the government to find an alternative to free teachers from MDM responsibilities.

Though the Bihar government tried to hand over MDM to NGOs or self-help groups (SHGs) and also ran pilot projects, a viable alternative has not been found because of the scale of the programme. In Bihar, despite a drop in enrolment numbers, 1.20 crore students from Class 1 to Class 8 are estimated to avail MDM daily.

In a Niti Ayog meeting a few months ago, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar advocated the direct benefit transfer for the centre's flagship MDM programme to plug leakages. ""Cooking in schools has a direct bearing on education. Instead of centres of learning, schools are viewed as centres of food. Poor quality and unhygienic conditions often lead to unpleasant incidents,"" he had said.

However, to achieve this, the Centre would have to change the policy at the national level, which seems unlikely. Bihar, on its part, has been seriously mulling the option of handing over MDM to women SHGs, which are 8 lakh in the state, the highest in the country. A pilot project has been launched in one block each of Jehanabad and Muzaffarpur to assess the feasibility."

After the meeting, a government letter was issued which affirmed that the government requires needs Rs 14,000 crore for the implementation to the salary hike and another Rs 38,655 crore to pay the unpaid amount of last three years.

As this move is challenging for the government but is equally good for the previous and present workers. It is tricky for the government as the hike will be implemented when the state government is battling to gather sources to generate profits. The government is also stumbling beneath arrears of Rs 4.3 Lakh Crore.

Other than the state government workers, teachers from independent schools and Zilla Parishad

Apart from the state government employees, teachers from unaided schools and Zilla Parishad establishments will also obtain the advantage of the salary hike.

Sudhir Mungantiwar (Finance Minister) projected the quantity of beneficiaries at 20.50 lakh.

The administration has put a ceiling on payment of the outstanding amount. Sudhir claimed that the people will get unpaid amount for the time of 3 years in five equivalent installments.

He said, ""The amount of the arrears will be directly credited in the employees' General Provident Fund (GPF) account.""

He also told that the new pay commission will provide a Group 'D' employee with Rs 15,000 basic salary per month while employees of Group 'C' will get Rs 18,000 basic salary per month.

He also explained that the pensioners will also get hike in their pensions according to their age category. People or pensioners who are in the age of 80 to 85 will get hike of 10 per cent in their pension. Pensioners those are 85 to 90 will get 15 per cent of hike in their pensions. People in the age of 90 to 95 will get 20 per cent hike of their pension and those who are above 100 will get straight away 50 per cent of hike in their pension. Looking into the data, there are almost 360 people who will get benefit of the 7 Pay Commission in the age of 100 years and above."

In the aftermath of the assembly results, the capital is abuzz with the Will-Modi-Return? chatter. During my brief stay I found that at one level disenchantment had truly set in and the man on the street was ready to bid adieu to the present dispensation. The Modi government had failed on several counts.

A Calcuttan, I thoroughly enjoyed this conversation with anyone who crossed my path in Delhi. So as I get into my Uber on a cold December morning, I find the guy at the wheel is a complete political animal and a staunch Modi supporter.

""Yes Modiji has made mistakes I am aware,"" he says, ""But who else is there? Demonetisation was a disaster. GST badly handled. But Madam, who else is there?""

""Can the Opposition put up a united front? Will the Congress get the numbers? What will the Mulayam Singh Yadavs and Mamata Banerjees do? I will vote for Modiji.""

""What about the institutions that are being destroyed?"" I ask.

""What is he doing to the RBI?""

""Modiji is good. It is his team that is to blame,"" he insists.

I am not a Modi fan so after a point I just listen. He continues his animated soliloquy.

Suddenly, he surprises me.

""Madam, do you know there is one person in this country who can actually give Modiji a fight.""

""And who is that?"" I ask.

""She is a mirror image of Indira Gandhi. mAnd do you know she has the same voice too.""

This one is an unusual Modi fan. ""If she appears on the scene, she definitely has my vote.""

I am speechless. This diehard Modi supporter's blatant adoration surprises me. Though just a few days ago, I too was part of an enthralled audience at a private event in Kolkata.

While we drive to my destination I relive the fascinating insight into the mind of the elusive Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.

Political dynasty was not about entitlement and legacy. ""I think the idea of dynasty arises because generations of us have been in politics but it was not instilled in us,"" Priyanka explains.

To the outside world political dynasty reeked of privileges but to a young child who had seen her grandmother Indira Gandhi's political and private life merge into one, it was not a legacy of privileges, but a supreme sense of duty and service. A legacy of greater responsibility.

She had seen her grandmother's physical courage, her inherent strength, her femininity and her gentleness as a grandmother. She had a great sense of humour too.

""It is strange my mother, Sonia Gandhi, being Italian, is more submissive and quiet compared to my grandma who was a very strong lady. She was a very powerful example in front of us.""

As Priyanka matured, her physical resemblance to her grandmother became more obvious, prompting people to draw parallels.

""It was not a quality, just the fact we looked similar. She was bossing people. I wanted to boss over kids,"" she adds with humour.

IMAGE: The resemblence between grandmother Indira Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi. Photograph: Kind courtesy twitter _PriyankaG

Memories of that fateful morning when her grandmother was assassinated are etched forever. She had borrowed a jhola from her grandmother for a drama competition and left for school. Her mother was alone at home, while her father was in West Bengal.

It was six days after Diwali and the sound of gunshots had stunned her mother who stepped outside and found the then prime minister lying on the path between the house and the office. She breathed her last before she could reach the hospital.

""We could not fathom that she was killed. She was larger than life. It was while watching television that we realised my father had been made prime minister. I remember saying they've made a mistake. See what they have written below papa's name.""

Life changed drastically. They now lived under the shadow of threat.

She and her brother were home schooled. For a young girl it was an excruciatingly boring schedule. They barely went out.

Once a week they were permitted to visit a friend's home.

When she entered college, she was initially terrified as seniors ""were waiting to catch Rajiv Gandhi's daughter"".

""While I was comfortable at a table with heads of State, I had never interacted with people my age,"" she points out.

At heart she was a simple girl who just wanted to have a normal existence. She handled it with aplomb and grace and after a couple of months, college turned into the nicest experience of her life.

She had seen her father Rajiv Gandhi live a private life as a pilot with his shy Italian wife. As a youngster, she had watched her parents's internal struggle to enter a world so different from their own.

A series of events pushed him into the world of politics.

""He was not perpetuating a dynasty. It was a sense of duty, a greater mission, a calling. That's how I understood politics. It was a different patriotism from the one we see today,"" she explains.

1991 brought greater trauma for the Gandhi family. Her father's assassination brought her world crumbling down.

""He was my best friend, the stabilising force in my life. He was strong, gentle, kind and I could rely on him 100%. Each time he left home I felt he was not coming back. We had psychologically lived with his loss,"" Priyanka reveals.

When it finally happened, the family was devastated.

Engulfed in pain, she viewed the whole world through that angst.

Her anchor had gone. She saw the family as victims of a ghastly event.

She spent many years doing Vipassana and meditation.

In 1998, the Congress asked her mother to campaign. ""We had a family discussion. We explained to our mother that you will be used, you will be discarded once you are done with the campaign. A few days later I got a call from my mother. She said, 'I have decided to campaign'.""

""We were stunned. Why was she doing this? She said she couldn't face our father's photograph.""

Her mother dropped her low-key profile and took on the task of memorising her speech for the Ramlila Ground, ""There were a lakh-and-a-half people. Her hands were shaking. 'I can't, I can't,' she kept saying. We told her it was too late, she had made this choice.""

""Gradually, we saw her transformation. It was her courage, her sense of duty. She went beyond the interests of the self towards a greater calling.""

It was in 2008 that Priyanka found the courage to acquaint herself with one of her father's assassins at the Vellore Central Jail.

Nalini Sriharan, who was married to Murugan who made the bomb, was also sentenced to death. She found herself forgiving those who had brutally brought his life to an abrupt end. They had a cause they believed in, they committed this horrific act for this cause.

Reminiscing about her meeting with Nalini, Priyanka points out, ""I went to forgive her. The minute she started speaking, I realised I was so wrong. She had been a victim too. I was 19, she was 23. She was one of 9 children with an alcoholic father and a mother who struggled to send them to school.""

""She had fallen in love with a maths teacher and was pregnant with his child. I thought I was the victim, but when I met her, I realised how her life had been destroyed. I saw another human being suffering.""

""I was better, I thought. I was going to forgive her. I was the victim. But that single experience altered my way of looking at things. We are all victims.""

""We just have to move from judgement to empathy. Victimhood has now become a political tool. Every time we suffer we think it is because of others, which is just not true.""

IMAGE: Priyanka Gandhi meets citizens in Rae Bareli, her mother's Lok Sabha constituency. Photograph: Sandeep Pal

A fundamental lesson Priyanka learnt early was the fact that power did not come from within. Power is given to you by the people you work for. Tomorrow if the people don't want you, you will have no relevance.

She said she had a problem with the way politicians talk down to people.

""The way we were brought up, if our parents saw us being delusional even for a second it would have been difficult for us.""

""People tell me, 'Your children are very humble'. I tell them what is there not to be humble about. And how could I be consumed by a delusion of power? I had seen so much trauma, loss and violence associated with power. These were my set of problems. Others have worse.""

Like any other mother she has enjoyed the role and faced the same issues.

Children will constantly challenge you. You may want them to be a particular way, but they will be their own person.

Her 18-year-old son Rehan and her 16-year-old daughter Miraya now teach her. ""Our children are our best teachers. They are sharp. I keep quiet, they lecture me. They straighten you.""

""The other day I was going to Lodi Gardens for a walk. I was putting on lipstick. My daughter asked me why I was doing that. I told her someone might ask for a selfie with me. 'Why? Why would someone take a selfie with you?'"" she recalls.

""Children are creatures of their own. They should never have a legacy other than the legacy of being a good human being.""

""I have faith in the people. They will vote out of a sense of survival. Our democracy has to be kept alive. Democracy means bringing people together, hearing every voice. As a people we love to complain. You cannot take away our right.""

When asked about the Emergency her grandmother had imposed, she replies, ""I was a child at that time. But then it was grandma who called elections and lost, so she realised it was a wrong decision.""

For a firm believer in democracy, was she not being autocratic by not giving into her party's request for her to step into public life?

With an endearing smile she says, ""I am 46 years old, I still have time. For now I have made a conscious call to not get too involved with politics, but just be there for my brother and mother."""

The junior college teachers during the protest will raise issues like pending approvals of recruited teachers, delay in salaries and temporary appointments on some of the most crucial posts in the education department. The teachers will also demand the appointment of a permanent deputy director for Mumbai region.

SL Dixit, vice president, MJCTU told the leading daily, ""We are going to demand the removal of the state education minister Vinod Tawde because he has failed to resolve our long pending issues. Many teachers are awaiting their salaries even after getting approvals from the state education department.""

On the lines of Anand Kumar's concept of 'Super 30' that imparts training to underprivileged students to crack IIT JEE, the Rajkiya Jubilee Inter College in Lucknow has proposed to start 'Special 50' wherein selected 50 students from across the state will be picked and especially designated teachers will teach them separately and prepare them to crack engineering and medical entrance examination.

District inspector of schools, Mukesh Kumar Singh had mooted this proposal to deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma recently. Singh said, ""On the basis of UP Board high school examination results, best 50 students will be identified. The Rajkiya Jubilee Inter College has best teachers who can work with these students and prepare them for the next level to crack the competition.""

He said, ""The school has hostel facility, best of the laboratories, good infrastructure, lush green outfield where they can play sports and good library. To sum up things, Rajkiya Jubilee Inter College in Lucknow has everything which an ideal school should have. So we are working in that direction to make this school a brand and the model can be replicated in other 74 districts across the state.""

On Wednesday, while inaugurating the first alumni meet of the school, Dinesh Sharma had said Rajkiya Jubilee Inter College will be developed into a model college and more experienced and trained teachers will be recruited. He had said that the state government wants educational institutions to impart vocational training so that students may become skilled as well.

Lucknow DIoS said if poor students of Super 30 can crack the toughest examination then why can't students from UP's government schools? ""There is no dearth of talent in our government school students; all they need is direction from teachers who can shape their future. I'm sure the state government will give its consent,"" Singh said.

According to DIoS once students from government schools will start cracking competitions, parents will be motivated to send their children to government schools instead of private schools where they charge hefty fees. DIoS is hopeful that a large number of poor students will be benefitted from this initiative."

On 28 December, Jantar Mantar in Delhi witnessed transgender activists from across the country observe a 'National Day of Rage.' Their demand being that this bill not be introduced in the Rajya Sabha and instead be referred to a Select Committee in the Upper House. Despite its name, the bill does not protect but actually violates the rights of the transgender community, they say.

According to the proposed law, transgender people would be 'inspected' to confirm that they are indeed transgender. It also makes gender affirmation surgery or sex reassignment surgery compulsory for those who identify as transgender. Begging would be criminalised although no reservations are provided in work and education for transgender people. Moreover, if transgender people are disowned by their families, they would be sent to rehab.

""We are here because of the recently passed (in Lok Sabha) Transgender Persons Bill, 2018, which is extremely bad. The government is trying to show that they are protecting us. But in the name of protection, they are trying to abolish us and again criminalise us. So, we will never let this become law. We know how to fight till the end.""Raina Roy, a transgender activist and one of founders of Amra Odbhuth, a queer cafe in Kolkata

""The Bill is very discriminatory and is criminalising different portions of the community. So, we are demanding civil rights from the government rather than criminalising traditions of the hijra gharana.""Aparna Banerjee, Hijra activist, West Bengal Transgender Development Association

""I identify as queer, both the noun and the adjective. I'm here to stop the Transgender Persons Bill, 2018. You know, the transgender people have played a huge role in the anti-Section 377 movement. And this bill is also about self-determining my gender which means it's for me. So, I am here in solidarity.""Debolina Dey

""As a cisgender man, people like me should really be the first to show up at a protest like this but should also be the people to shut up and listen because this is a space for us to learn, to support protests by other communities. Because it all comes back to everybody. All the rights violations, that we're seeing, are connected. That's an important thing to recognise.""Manav

""Basically, everyone is being denied the right to self-determination. It is not just about the transgender community. When the government decides who can speak as what and who will be counted not in their language as what they are, then it's a violation of all of us. This government has been doing that for various people. With the transgender community, they are basically saying that a group of experts, precisely the people who violate us in the most intimate ways - counselors, doctors, etc - will decide who is trans and who is not. It's a basic attack on democracy, fundamentally.""Vikramaditya, Independent researcher on gender and sexuality

""My personal experiences don't really count much because I am a very privileged person. I'm here because you enter a race and you're already told that you're going to come 'third' - transgender people are born and live their entire lives knowing that is their position in the course of things. That is why I think everyone is here, because my community is always 'third'.""Subham, Visual artist and graphic designer

""It's a very, very draconian bill that basically ignores all the suggestions and work done by the transgender community over the past three years on this bill. All of those suggestions were replaced by something the Lok Sabha came up with on its own and passed the bill in a very big hurry. And those provisions of the bill that are supposedly for the protection of transgender people's rights, actually violate a lot of our rights.""Rushaan Kumar, Assistant professor of Feminist and Gender Studies at Colorado College

""We do not like this bill. Our own rights are being snatched away by these people. This bill has to be removed. Please withdraw the bill! Stop Transgender Persons Bill!""Hemba, President, Empowering Trans Ability, Manipur

""We want Tiruchi Siva's bill. We want the NALSA judgment. We want what the Supreme Court said. Now, we are fighting to stop this bill. We do not want a screening committee. My life started after I left my family, so why is this bill against that? Why can't we beg? Why is it invading our sexuality and our bodies? This bill needs to be scrapped.""Kiran Naik, a transgender, disability and Adivasi activist from Karnataka and Telangana

""According to this bill, transgender people cannot identify themselves as transgender men or women. They must go to a doctor or psychiatrist who will remove their clothes completely and identify them as just transgender - not man or woman. Then they must undergo Sex Reassignment Surgery (SRS) after which they can identify as a man or a woman. This surgery would cost about ten lakhs. Now they are banning transgender people from begging without providing the right employment. Who wants to beg if there are alternatives?"" Nasreen Banu

""There are 'n' number of engineers and degree holders among transgender people but they are still begging. They can have ID with their correct gender. But they cannot change the gender on their school or college certificates easily. Their teachers and lecturers will ask them thousands of questions. They will not help out. So they can't find employment.""Nasreen Banu

""I was pursuing my BEd in Special Education in a college in Chennai. My lecturers forced me to discontinue my education just because I am the wife of a transgender man. My life has been spoiled. Even as a cisgender woman married to a transgender man, I am facing all of this. So, think what trans people are facing.""Nasreen Banu

""The government cannot be against the politics of minorities. If it is so, I take objection to that. Let's please talk about inclusive politics of the nation which is what the Indian democracy stood for. Transgender people matter in society and our lives also matter so much. The bill must be deferred to the Select Committee, which should function in a democratic way. If not, I reject the bill.""Dr Akkai Padmashali, Founder, Ondede organisation.

""Even without the screening committee, already we have to take off our clothes when we go to see a doctor to take hormones. We ask our doctors the same question, why are you making me take off my clothes? Why should only our identity be tested? Cisgender people's identity should be too. After this bill, Modiji should also be checked to ensure if he is 'definitely a man' or 'definitely a woman'.""Christy Raj, Media Out

""It feels like this bill is being used to make up for Sec 377. On one hand, you have given us freedom. On the other hand, you are trapping us. So, you want to kill us before you leave. Even banning begging - whom will it affect? Demonetisation, GST - they are all affecting the working class. Will banning begging affect the upper classes?""Christy Raj

""We opposed the bill from the beginning and submitted suggestions and demands to the BJP government. We met Standing Committee MPs. Standing Committee also gave their recommendations. This government declined all recommendations. This shows that the BJP government constantly oppresses minority groups such as trans, Dalit, Adivasi, Muslim. Please then openly say you do not want us to live in this country. Announce us as refugees.""Grace Banu, Founder and Director, Trans Rights Now Collective and India's first transgender engineer

Bharathidasan University has issued orders for replacement of principals in six out of 10 constituent colleges.

In the remaining four colleges at Orthanad, Vedaranyam, Nagapattinam and Lalgudi, the university has already seen through the takeover of the administration by its permanent staff.

For the colleges in Aranthangi, Thiruthuraipoondi, Navalurkuttapattu, Nannilam, Veppur and Perambalur manned by guest faculty, the university will be deputing its regular staff for holding the post of Principal for the time being, it is learnt.

The existing principals in the six constituent colleges have been asked to hand over charge to the new appointees on January 7, 2019, official sources said.

A decision to this effect was taken at the meeting of the Syndicate Sub-Committee taking note of the age factor. As per existing rules, the age of principals in the constituent colleges must not exceed 62 years.

Incidentally, by appointing new principals who are its regular staff, the university is spared of the monthly salary expenditure of ₹ 40,000 for each of the 10 principals The monthly salary which was initially fixed at ₹ 25,000 for retired faculties of the university deputed to the constituent colleges was increased a few years back. Subsequently, retired principals and teachers of government colleges were appointed as principals of the constituent colleges.

The university was under compulsion to cut down costs since it could levy only the fee levied in government colleges, in the wake of the decision of the government to take over the constituent colleges and convert them into government arts and science colleges. However, since the government is yet to issue an order for the formal takeover, the constituent colleges continue to be under the administrative control of the university.

Of all the State universities in Tamil Nadu, BDU accounts for the highest number of constituent colleges."

Following the mode of campaigns run by privately-managed educational institutions, government schools across the state have started a massive advertising campaign ahead of commencement of the new academic session on January 1, featuring achievements and facilities of the schools.

Sources in the education department said the state government's recent decision to provide annual administrative grants to schools on the basis of enrolled positions has added an impetus to this campaign.

Banners portraying facilities and accomplishments at entrances of schools has become a common sight. Some school authorities have also launched a social media campaign, named Utsav Vidyarambha, an annual enrolment drive conducted every year with the help of local community and students, to enhance enrolment in schools.

""From this year, the publicity campaign for Utsav Vidyarambha has been launched on a massive scale. The prime thrust is to change the prevailing notion of most guardians that the quality of education in the state-government schools are not at par with private schools. Let's spread the message that trained and qualified teachers are imparting education in government-run schools and the admissions as well as other facilities are totally free for the newly enrolled kids at the primary level,"" a senior official of the education department told TOI on Friday.

Checking the decrease in enrolment, something which was detected as a major worry in Gunotsav, is the primary agenda behind launching such a publicity campaign, he added.

As per the new guidelines, schools with enrolment of 60 or below will not get any financial support, schools having enrolment of 61 to 400 will get financial support of Rs 20,000, schools having enrolment of 401 to 600 will get financial support of Rs 25,000 and schools having enrolment of more than 600 will get financial support of Rs 35,000."

She portrayed a woman whose passion is teaching but suffers from Tourette Syndrome. The project was also her comeback to showbiz post the birth of her daughter, Adira. The tale of the teacher's bond with a bunch of lesser-privileged students struck a chord with the audience, not just in India but also in China. Rani will soon be seen on the big screen again as Shivani Shivaji Roy in Mardaani 2. We met the actress recently to talk about the year that was and her choice of roles. Excerpts from the chat...

Both the films spoke about powerful women in different walks of life. Mardaani is a female police officer tackling flesh trade and child trafficking, which are extremely important and grave issues in our country as well as the world. I remember many parents telling me that they didn't want to watch the film as they'd feel uncomfortable, or that they didn't want their children to watch it. I told them that, on the contrary, the movie was for them and their children. It helps society become aware that this is not happening in a faraway land, but right in our neighbourhood. We can't view the world with rose-tinted glasses. I wanted to be a part of such a story, that too, told from the point of view of a female police officer. Hichki was about a teacher with Tourette, who is asked to tutor a bunch of underprivileged children. In a strange way, both of them are in the same boat. Together, they learn that you can turn your weakness into strength.

They are based on subjects that are relevant -- child trafficking and issues with the education system. They also pointed to the fact that people judge you for your outer appearance instead of your merit. When you see a woman in a cop's uniform, you may wonder whether she will be able to protect you. But that shouldn't be the case because an officer is that, irrespective of the gender. Similarly, a teacher's Tourette Syndrome doesn't mean she won't be good at her job. There were so many layers to these characters.

I think, when people look back at these films, they will realise how important they were. When a movie releases in the midst of what you are living in, you may not realise its importance at that point in time but you will, five years down the line. It will impact change in the society and the thought process. It takes time for an actual change to come about in a society, but these films will help kick-start that process.

I have always believed that content is king. Whenever a story tugs at your heartstrings and has an emotional connect, it will find an audience. Now, how big a viewership it will get is when you need to look at the box office. Even if it's a moderate hit, you know that it has been liked. For me, the learning has been to always listen to your gut and instinct because when I signed both these movies, I didn't expect them to become the hits that they did. But I believed in the stories. I knew that I wanted these stories to be told because these subjects were relevant. It was about believing in myself and the stories. I also realised that if there is a producer willing to make a film like this, then as an actor, I have to back it too. Whether or not it does well, the intention is right. And when the film succeeds, that's a bonus because what you had set out to achieve, you have managed to meet it.

With Hichki, there were many more question marks because I was married, a mother. So, would the audience want to see me? That myth was broken and I realised a lot of people wanted to see me (smiles), so that was great. I can be part of the cinema and the stories I want to tell. At the same time, I love entertaining films, so whenever I do a film with a message, it is necessary to make them entertaining as well. Nobody wants to hear a lecture that's boring. I want to be part of films that can strike a balance between both these aspects. When I know that there's an audience who wants to see me, I can dabble in various genres. It gives me happiness to know that the viewer doesn't shut you out because you are married or have kids. They do that when you don't make good films, it's as simple as that.

I think there are some similarities between our cultures, backgrounds and family values. Perhaps, Hichki worked so well over there because they related to the teacher-student relationship. It's the victory of the script and content. The Chinese government really loved the movie and agreed to release it there. I remember being in a room full of Chinese audience watching a Hindi movie, clapping and crying. That was a surreal feeling. Then to meet professors from the university and for them to say they wanted to be like Naina... it was something else. Even when we had a screening in Mumbai for 300 teachers across Maharashtra, they and the principals got emotional. Many of them said Naina has become an inspiration to them. And I got to hear the same thing in China. That was amazing.

I can't really say that because I never faced that problem. In fact, I've always got meaty roles, right from Raja Ki Aayegi Baarat to Yuva or Black and Bunty Aur Babli. They were equal to the men or even more, but never less. As an actor, it's our responsibility to choose the right characters. It doesn't matter if it's like the one I did in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (Tina's part) but it has to be impactful. Length of a role is never the issue, the substance is what matters. Actors shouldn't confuse a bigger role with an important one. You could have a small part in the film, but it should leave an impact rather than being in the entire film and not making one. I have always wanted to do films that talk about the modern Indian woman. My roles have always depicted her. So, there's always a direct connect.

I don't really make any resolutions. Every new project that I sign becomes my resolution. I know that for this project, I need to achieve a set of goals. For Hichki, I needed to look like I did pre-motherhood. I wanted to get back in shape so that I would look the part. Now, I need to look like a cop for Mardaani 2, so my entire process will be dictated by that. Also, for me, it's very important that each day I spend with my daughter is special. So, to maintain a balance between my work and personal life is my resolution every year (laughs)."

In July, the appointment of academic staff in HEIs was put on hold by the University Grants Commission (UGC) till the Supreme Court issued its verdict on the special leave petition filed by the HRD Ministry against a court order curtailing reservation for SC/ST and OBCs.

The UGC had announced in March that an individual department should be considered as the base unit to calculate the number of teaching posts to be reserved for Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) candidates following an order by the Allahabad High Court in April last year.

Higher education has not seen such crisis in India as before, Sitaram Yechury, leader of CPI(M), said at a press conference organised by the Delhi University Teachers' Association (DUTA).

""Assault on higher education is connected to the ideological project that is being pursued by this government under the direction of the RSS.

""The whole effort is to convert the study of Indian history into the study of Hindu mythology. If you want to assert Hindu mythology as the only history of India then the inherent would be caste biased,"" Yechury added.

When the roster issue had come up, we all protested in Parliament, he said, adding five of the central universities where the advertisements were issued, there were not even a single position for SC, ST and OBCs.

""We raised the issue and the minister concerned assured that there will be an ordinance to overcome the Supreme Court direction. They have issued a notification suspending any recruitment till the issue is resolved. Now they have withdrawn the suspension and if recruitments begin now, a large number of deserving SC/ST will not fight,"" Yechury said.

Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Jha said he has asked for a short duration discussion in Parliament on the roster issue.

""The education policies implemented under the Modi government are geared towards pushing the marginalised section outside the ambit of higher education.

""Commercialisation of public funded higher education is yet another way to deny education and jobs to Dalit-Bahujan samaj. We have asked for a short duration discussion on the roster,"" he said.

Congress leader Rajeev Gowda accused the central government of destroying the democratic and constitutional values in the country and dividing the country for ""petty political gains"".

""We urge the government to bring in an ordinance (roster issue) immediately after the session finishes or bring a bill within the next eight days,"" he said.

The BJP government has failed the people of India on the issue of reservation in teaching positions, Binoy Viswam, member of Rajya Sabha, said.

Udit Raj, Lok Sabha MP, expressed support to the DUTA and raised the issue of discontinuation of the Rajiv Gandhi fellowship to SC/ST by the government and demanded reservation in judiciary.

There should be a nationwide movement on this issue as the government's inaction on the matter was intentional, alleged Sharad Yadav of Loktantrik Janata Dal."

Kovind also told the gathering about his interaction with the President of Cuba on the topic of Yoga.

""Cuba is a Communist country and people in Communist countries do not see Yoga favourably. However, the (Cuban) President and the the First Lady told me how both had become staunch followers of Yoga and were practising it diligently,"" Kovind said.

Among those present for Friday's event were Maharashtra GovernorC Vidyasagar Rao,state Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, Union AYUSH Minister Shripad Naik and spiritual leader Swami Chidanand.

Addressing the gathering, Fadnavis lauded the institute for playing an outstanding role in spreading Yoga, adding that the ancient practice had the power to erase differences between individuals and nature as well as fight problems caused by modern day lifestyle.

He also sought advice from the institute on how his government could popularise Yoga among all sections of society.

The institute's director, Dr Hansa J Yogendra, said it would continue its efforts to popularise Yoga across every section of society.

Earlier, the senior teachers had submitted a memorandum to former VCs to extend their retirement age from 60 to 65. Sources, however, indicated the varsity would fix the retirement age at 60. A university order, sent to 29 UIT centres in the state earlier this year, specified that engagement of staff on contract basis is not permitted after the age of 60 years and hence asked principals of UIT centres not to forward the engagement requests of staff above the age of 60. The rule also applies to those who are completing the age of 60 during the contract ending period in March 2019. The order has many senuior teachers worried.

""Since we have no pension, we will be left high and dry without any income after retirement. However, if the university proceeds with that action, we have only one demand. UIT principals' retirement age is 65. So we request the university to hike the age limit to 65 for all teaching staff,"" said Sreekumar (name changed), a senior teaching staff.

At present, the UITs have both contract and guest lecturers in service. The principals of the centres are the retired professors from government educational institution. Of 29 centres, many teaching staffs fear they might lose the job if the university failed to extend the retirement day.

According to M Lenil Lal, former University Syndicate member, there were differences of opinion in the former syndicate over raising the retirement age of senior staffs of UITs and a final call on this would be made in January. ""We did discuss this issue in many syndicate meetings. But there was no consensus. Some members wanted to raise the age of teaching staff while some wanted to appoint young teachers to give them the opportunity. So we have not decided yet on this and our priority would be to raise this issue in the first syndicate meeting to be held in January. We hope that the issue gets resolved in January itself,"" he said.

Most of the teachers in UITs are highly qualified and took up their job in the hope that sooner or later their service would be regularised. Meanwhile, University of Kerala vice-chancellor V P Mahadevan Pillai told Express the matter has not been brought to his attention. ""I am unaware of this issue as it has not been brought to my attention. So I am not authorised to comment now,"" said Pillai.

Then he threatened them with expulsion, a criminal probe and being blacklisted from all Russian universities.

Their crime? Setting up an independent student union.

But Shaidurov and Dautov, children of the social media era, did not take the threats lying down. Instead, they went public about their altercation with the principal last month. The student union's ranks swelled and education authorities in St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city, came out in support of the teenagers, not the principal.

Many other young Russians have had their first taste of political activism in street protests against corruption and the banning of rap music, protesting the authoritarian status quo that their parents have unhappily gotten used to.

Russian teenagers putting up a social media fight against the rigid, Soviet-like attitudes of some teachers was one of Russia's political highlights of the year.

Shaidurov and Dautov came up with the idea after reading about Vladimir Lenin, Karl Marx and the U.S. trade union movement. They realised that their own problems strict and unnecessary testing, dress code restrictions had resonated elsewhere and would make a rallying cause for a student union.

""At first, everyone was laughing at Leonid and me, because it was just the two of us,"" says Dautov, who wears multiple rings and a ""Revolutionary Workers Party"" badge on his scarf.

Two separate groups of the new student union held their first meetings in mid-November at a soccer field near the sprawling concrete school.

Shaidurov, who led both meetings, was summoned to the principal and told he had organized an ""unsanctioned rally"" that would be investigated by prosecutors. His and Dautov's parents were later hauled over the coals.

Later on, police officers visited the school to conduct ""a preventive discussion"" to warn the students about the dangers of staging unsanctioned rallies and extremism, a widely defined term that Russian authorities have used to go after dissenters of all stripes.

At the next parent-teacher meeting, parents were told that their children had joined an ""extremist organization"" and would be blacklisted from entering college, according to Shaidurov's mother, Yelena, who teaches history at the school.

She mounted a social media campaign. Prosecutors went to check the school and found that the girl's rights were violated.

Later, the Perm education department banned schools from strict dress code rules.

In Komsomolsk-on-Amur in Russia's Far East, a teacher has been suspended after a video of her pushing a teenager onto the ground and spanking him was posted online. Investigators have opened a criminal case.

Alexander Kondrashev, a teacher from St. Petersburg who belongs to an independent teachers' union, says the power dynamics between Putin-era teenagers and predominantly Soviet-educated teachers is starkly different from a generation earlier.

""It's much harder for a teacher to control the situation with children these days,"" he said. ""First, children have a clearer idea of their rights and they are ready to stand up for them. And second, audio and video recordings have given them a significant information clout.""

""It's weird, because you can be sent to prison and contract TB at 14, but you can drink and smoke and express yourself fully only when you're 18,"" Dautov says.

The system that Shaidurov and Dautov have been fighting against replicates the Russian government power structure in miniature.

The principal is answerable only to superiors in the education ministry while the students do not have much say in decision-making at school. Shaidurov and Dautov's school has its own student body but it works hand in hand with the administration and lacks any powers.

""We even have a newspaper and a YouTube channel allegedly for students which is dead and no one watches it,"" Dautov says, scoffing at the fact that instead of discussing real issues that students face, from high workloads to image pressures, the existing body debates ""what kind of Christmas tree to put up.

Within minutes, they were hooked to the story of a young boy climbing up, and learning how to come down. They slowly stitched together the simple words, read them aloud and figured out the rest from Deval Maniar's large illustrations.

The story had appeared on a split screen -- the Bengali version, their mother tongue, on one side, and English and Hindi on the other. The exercise was meant to prune their mother tongue skills and familiarise the Std 1 students with English. ""Most of the students are first- and second-generation learners,"" says Dam. ""It is difficult to get them to speak in English. They understand the language, but lack the confidence to converse in it.""

Dam, along with many other teachers, is trying to engage children with languages through stories. His aide in this exercise is StoryWeaver, an online repository of stories for children. Started in 2015 by Pratham Books, a not-for-profit publisher of children's books, StoryWeaver is not just a virtual library but is also viewed differently by diverse groups.

If Dam sees it as a teaching tool that opens up story chests for his students, Chetan Acharya, president of the Konkani Bhasha Mandal (KBM), looks at it as a medium to save small languages. To artist and traveller Sarayu Kamat, StoryWeaver books are the way to connect with a community. For language-based organisations and translation practitioners, it is a vast pool of resources.

It offers over 10,000 stories for children in 124 languages, including Bhoti (spoken in Ladakh), Kumaoni (in Uttarakhand), Santali (in eastern India) and Gondi (in south-central India) and foreign languages such as Kurdish, Afrikaans and Haitian Creole. The content on the website is available on open licence, making it free for anyone to translate it into any language. For instance, I Can Climb is available in 60 versions and 47 languages including Thai, Vietnamese, Khmer, Sinhala and Norwegian. Dam himself has translated over 25 stories on the platform -- from English and Hindi to Bengali and vice versa.

""The purpose of StoryWeaver is to create a reading ecosystem, driven by the ideas of inclusion and collaboration,"" says Himanshu Giri, CEO Pratham Books. Anyone can access the site or use the content for free. Translators, publishers and other organisations who make content available on StoryWeaver do so without charging a fee.

Free access separates StoryWeaver from the rest. Giri admits keeping the medium open-source is complicated when there are authors, illustrations and publishers on board. ""Asking any established author or illustrator to give away rights is tough. I call myself the copyleft model,"" quips Giri. Yet, StoryWeaver has managed to do so. On the upside, the platform offers authors and illustrators a reach that copyrighted material often does not have.

Bengaluru-based Pratham Books got a hint of the unprecedented reach of online stories when it put up material on open licence in 2009. It uploaded some 20 titles on a CC (creative commons) licence platform, on which a work can be freely shared, translated, altered and so on. ""Over a year, 20 became 100 with derivatives in multiple languages. Our books were being used to teach English in Tokyo, they were being translated online into Hebrew and Zulu,"" says Giri.

StoryWeaver thrives on collaboration, and has managed to create a larger community bound by stories. ""Some partnerships have evolved organically. Someone interested in translating a story into his/her mother tongue would approach us,"" says Giri. On the other hand, the platform has generated interest among diverse advocacy groups working in education, literacy and health, spurring partnerships and generating stories in local languages. The focus in StoryWeaver is on underserved, local languages. ""At the time of Independence we had over 2,600 languages, we are left with 700 now,"" points out Giri.

The platform attempts to push back at least a few languages from the brink of disappearance through local interventions. ""Technology will not help us scale unless people help us. Language is such a thing that needs human involvement,"" he adds.

Others -- such as governments and organisations -- are sitting up and taking note of StoryWeaver. The Arunachal Pradesh government has asked Pratham Books to establish libraries in government schools. ""Around 400 classrooms are digitally equipped,"" says Giri. CGnet Swara, the online voice portal that allows people in the central tribal belt to report local news, partnered with the platform to translate stories into Gondi. The website has over 250 stories in the language now.

Purvi Shah, Head, Digital Initiatives, Pratham Books, says the call to preserve a local language through stories often comes from the community. Suchana, an organisation working on child welfare and literacy in West Bengal, partnered with StoryWeaver to translate stories into Santali and Kora, another indigenous community language spoken in the region. ""Suchana evangelised the idea of translating from Bengali into these languages; now we have over 84 resources in Santali and Kora on the platform,"" says Shah.

As the partnership between Suchana and StoryWeaver has grown, so has the link of Santal and Kora communities with their stories. Since readers were often in remote areas, translated stories were downloaded in PDF format, saved on devices and taken to the grassroots. To make it effective in areas without internet access, the platform allows stories to be saved offline. ""Suchana has raised funds to print these stories into books,"" Shah says. It is making the stories accessible to Bengali-speaking teachers so that they can, in turn, spread the Santali books within the Santal communities and widen the reader base, she adds.

Shah calls it the ""ripple effect"", where a child warms up to the idea of reading, slowly sheds the fear of words and graduates to reading more. ""The goal is to create a large repository of mother tongue resources and instil in children the joy of reading in their language. That is why we never digress from stories,"" adds Shah.

The KBM's association with StoryWeaver is over two years old and has resulted in nearly 120 stories being translated into Konkani. ""Children should get a chance to read and think in their mother tongue. This is a small effort to save a language,"" says Acharya of KBM. Konkani, among the 22 languages that are a part of Schedule Eight of the Constitution and written in five different scripts, was waiting for a boost that would connect it with the young.

""Stories are one way of doing it,"" Acharya says. At the primary and secondary school run by the KBM in Madgaon, students were trained to browse and read on StoryWeaver. The mandal also conducted a workshop for schoolteachers, training them to use the platform and even try their hand at translation. Pratham Books and KBM together printed 50 translated titles. ""We made 500 copies of each book, and distributed them for free in 250 schools,"" Acharya adds.

StoryWeaver has also forayed into languages that barely have a history of children's literature. Earlier this year, it held a hackathon in Haryana by bringing together schoolteachers from 20 government schools to translate children's stories into Haryanvi, a language that closely resembles Hindi but does not boast a strong literary tradition. ""It is a deep-rooted oral language, and yet the schoolteachers who came for the hackathon did not remember reading a Haryanvi story growing up,"" says Amna Singh, associate language editor at Pratham Books. When a language begins to fade out of official use, it's considered an early marker of a bleak future. ""Documenting it is the best way to keep a language alive,"" Singh says.

At the two-day event, teachers were trained on the nuances of translating for children. They translated 74 stories from Hindi to Haryanvi, peer-reviewed and polished each other's work, and enhanced the StoryWeaver pool. The experience emboldened the team to conduct a second hackathon in Kolkata, this time bringing together language experts, students of literature and schoolteachers. The exercise had participants splitting their hair on how to aptly translate ""You are being silly, Mr Brown"" into Bengali.

""They animatedly discussed the most suitable translation for 'silly',"" Singh recalls.

Participants with different skill sets made the exercise vibrant. ""The schoolteachers were game changers. They were the closest to the children and would not allow a story to be sanitised,"" she adds. The teachers argued that if a story was cleansed to speak a language the children were unfamiliar with, it would never lure them to the classroom.

Collaborations at StoryWeaver have often extended into foreign shores and the Philippines-based QwertyWorks, a professional translation group, is one such international ally. ""We uploaded our very first book from StoryWeaver in April this year,"" says Jake Irwin Estrada, founder and CEO. In a matter of months, the group translated 67 books from the platform -- 23 were translated into Tagalog and 44 into Cebuano -- two languages spoken in the Philippines. ""We are currently working on translating more books into secondary Philippine languages such as Hiligaynon, Ilokano, Bikolano, and Tausug and Maranao,"" adds Estrada.

While most stories remain online, Estrada keeps a limited number of printed books to be distributed among children who attend public day-care centres near his office in Manila. ""Some of these children don't have enough money to buy food for school, let alone books,"" says Estrada. The children, he says, are shocked when they receive books in their native language, and are allowed to take them home. ""They end up receiving from us the first book that they will ever own,"" he adds.

StoryWeaver boasts a handful of ""champions"" -- people who have translated hundreds of stories into a particular language for free. And then there are those like Sarayu Kamat who have taken the stories into the community. On a recent trip to Bastar, she took with her 200 stories in Gondi, each of them printed in colour on A4 sheets and spiral bound into small books. ""We visited several houses in Kanker and distributed the books. We also donated some to the local school library,"" Kamat says. She shares pictures of young Manisha, who belongs to the Muria tribe in Chhattisgarh, enjoying the Gondi book Kamat had gifted her.

As the portal scales new milestones such as breaching the 10,000-story mark, Giri wants the community to own it: ""We want people to run it. We want publishers to join this."" Even if for-profit publishers would share their backlist (older books from a publisher) on StoryWeaver, he says, it would go a long way.

""The goal next year is to get a few known children's publishers from India on board,"" he says. ""If people own it, they will value it more."""

Speaking about the process of importing books, education minister Nath praised Government of Assam for their role in facilitating speedy transportation. ""We are taking all required steps to ensure students to get the books prior commencement of the new academic year, "" Nath said.

The cabinet has also passed an ordinance to constitute higher education council as per Ministry of Human Resources (MHRD) rules of 2013. The ordinance would be placed before the state assembly in next session.

Earlier in October, Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb said that school textbooks and syllabus in the state taught about former USSR president Joseph Stalin and Vladimir Ilych Lenin but no Indian leaders. He added that new syllabus would be introduced to students shortly."

For many devout Sikhs, the defining moment of 2018 was the groundbreaking ceremony of the Kartarpur corridor, which will finally provide access to a revered shrine across the border in Pakistan. But others were riveted to the sideshow as Kartarpur Sahib brought the simmering tension between Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and his flamboyant minister Navjot Singh Sidhu out in the open. The year will also be remembered for a blurry video of a horrific accident on Dussehra.

As Ravana went up in flames, people watching the spectacle from elevated tracks are mowed down by a train. About 60 are killed. The state's Congress government sparred with opposition Shiromani Akali Dal over desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib in 2015, and also over ""inaccuracies"" in school history books. The Aam Aadmi Party and SAD faced revolts within their ranks. Two grenade attacks triggered fears over revival of militancy. The Kartarpur corridor drama began with a hug. Cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Sidhu came in for much flak after he embraced Pakistan Army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa at the swearing-in of Imran Khan as that country's new prime minister. Even CM Amarinder Singh disapproved.

Sidhu defended the hug in Islamabad, saying he got emotional after Bajwa told him about plans to open a corridor from Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur to Kartarpur Sahib, the shrine in Pakistan which marks the location where Sikhism's founder Guru Nanak Dev spent the last 18 years of his life. A few weeks later, Amarinder Singh, a former Army officer, declined the Pakistani invitation to attend the groundbreaking ceremony.

But ignoring his CM's advice, Sidhu went ahead. The Amritsar train tragedy provided opposition parties the ammunition to target the Sidhus. A magisterial probe later blamed the gateman at a railway crossing and organisers of the Dussehra event, giving a clean chit to the minister's politician-wife Navjot Kaur Sidhu, who was the chief guest. Earlier in the year, 28 men who had left for greener pastures abroad, returned home in caskets, their bodies exhumed from a mass grave in war-hit. Ten more, abducted and killed by the IS, were from other states.

Two grenade blasts, one at the Nirankari Bhawan in Amritsar that killed two people and another at Maqsudan police station in Jalandhar, triggered concern among the security forces that ISI-inspired terrorists were trying to foment trouble in the state. In August, a report by the Justice Ranjit Singh Commission into the desecration of religious texts in 2015, when the SAD-BJP combine was in power, came as a big setback for the Akalis at a time they were trying to resurrect themselves after the assembly election defeat.

The report not only blamed the police for using ""unprovoked"" force on protesters at Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan in Faridkot but also said the then chief minister Parkash Singh Badal was ""aware"" of the proposed police action. The protests had erupted in 2015 after pages from the holy book were reportedly found torn and scattered. As the clamour for action against the Badals picked up, the opposition SAD suffered another blow. Senior leader Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa quit party posts. The Taksalis (or the old guard) like Ranjit Singh Brahmpura, Rattan Singh Ajnala and Sewa Singh Sekhwan also revolted against the leadership of the Badals. Pushed to the corner on the ""sacrilege"" issue, the entire Akali leadership made a surprise move in December.

It decided to seek atonement from the Akal Takht, the supreme temporal seat of the Sikhs, for unspecified ""mistakes"" committed ""inadvertently"" in the past. The main opposition Aam Aadmi Party also faced a revolt following the unceremonious ousting of Sukhpal Singh Khaira from the post of the Leader of Opposition in Punjab Assembly. Rebels MLAs held their own public meetings, virtually daring the party to take action against them. There were some tough times for the ruling Congress as well. A consistent opposition attack forced the resignation of minister Rana Gurjit Singh, accused of illegally bagging sand-mining contracts.

As nine new cabinet ministers were inducted in the Amarinder Singh government in April, some Congress MLAs, including Surjit Singh Dhiman and Sangat Singh Gilzian, quit their party positions, upset over being ""overlooked"". A rift in the top brass of Punjab Police too came out in the open. A DGP-rank officer, Siddharth Chattopadhyaya, accused Punjab DGP Suresh Arora and another senior officer of trying to scuttle a probe into an SSP's alleged role in a drug trafficking case. Also in 2018, school teachers went on strike over pay cuts.

Dead fish floated on the Beas after spillage of molasses from a factory, triggering environmental concerns. The SAD objected to how Sikh history is taught in Punjab schools. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Amritsar, underscoring the importance of the Punjabi diaspora."

On his 86 birth anniversary, ThePrint looks back at the story of how Ambani surpassed every established name in the business community in a matter of three decades.

Dhirajlal Hirachand Ambani was born on 28 December 1932 in Junagarh, modern-day Gujarat, to school teachers Jamnaben (known to be a thrifty homemaker) and Hirachand Govardhandas Ambani. A fierce independence activist in school, he was inspired by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.

Ambani wanted to go to college, but owing to his father's ill-health, he was compelled to get a job in Aden, a former British colony on the Arabian peninsula, now the temporary capital of Yemen. He worked as a clerk at A. Besse & Co, and learnt the ropes of business.

He came back to India in 1954 after five years in Aden, as a promoter for A. Besse & Co.'s shell refinery. Having married Kokilaben, he then decided to try his hand at trading. Although Ambani was tempted to set up shop in London, he finally decided to establish a business in what was then Bombay.

With the little money he had, Ambani decided to venture into spice trading, and soon, the orders began flowing in from Yemen. He then expanded the trade to include other commodities, including manure-mixed topsoil for a sheikh's lawn.

""We made big money from that order, real big money,"" Ámbani was quoted as saying.

After Partition, the textile industry in India had come to a standstill, as the major cotton producing regions were in Pakistan while the cotton mills were in Bombay.

While Ambani was exporting spices to Yemen, he gained an export replenishment licence, which he then used to import polyester yarn into India due to the dearth of fabric in India. At first, he sold the imported polyester yarn in Bombay markets at premiums ranging up to 300 per cent. He then realised that there was more profit in selling value-added nylon textiles.

Ambani decided to set up a fabrics business with his second cousin, Champaklal Damani, who lived in Turkey and imported the polyester yarn to Yemen. This is how Reliance was born in 1966. However, they soon parted ways due to ideological differences.

Reliance started producing nylon fabrics under the 'Vimal' name, which soon became one of the highest-selling fabric brands in the country. Reliance also received the award of excellence from the World Bank.

By 1977, when Reliance went public, it had more than 58,000 investors. Ambani expanded the business by stepping into telecommunications, information technology, energy, power, retail, textiles, infrastructure services, capital markets and logistics.

But it wasn't just his knack for business that brought Ambani -- he had charm and people skills too. It was said that Ambani always knew whom to contact to get the deed done, and had even explained his business ideas to then-PM Indira Gandhi at a party once. He was also known to ""curry favours"" from influential politicians.

Ambani's rise to success was as controversial as it was fascinating. He received his fair share of criticism for building an empire based on favours from the higher-ups in government.

There was also a polyester turf war between Ambani and Nusli Wadia, the head of Bombay Dyeing Company in the 1980s. In an interview with Firstpost, Wadia stated that Ambani's ""manipulation of policies"" was the reason for his company's defeat.

Sometimes, the voices that have tried to accuse Ambani of extracting political favours have been hushed in India. An example of this was the biography titled The Polyester Prince by author Hamish McDonald, which did not show the Ambanis in a favourable light. It was banned in 1998 under Section 297A of the Indian Penal Code, calling it a threat to civil order.

Ambani suffered a stroke in 1986, after which he began handing over the day-to-day control of Reliance to sons Mukesh and Anil.

He had another major stroke in 2002, which led to his demise on 24 June. The Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government released a postage stamp in his honour on what would have been his 70 birthday, 28 December 2002.

In 2016, the Narendra Modi-led NDA government conferred the Padma Vibhushan on him posthumously.

However, as time goes on, Ambani's legacy continues to carry on in the way Reliance Industries continues to grow. Even the glitz of granddaughter Isha Ambani's recent wedding owes itself to the empire that the school teachers' son from Junagarh created."

For many devout Sikhs, the defining moment of 2018 was the groundbreaking ceremony of the Kartarpur corridor, which will finally provide access to a revered shrine across the border in Pakistan.

But others were riveted to the sideshow as Kartarpur Sahib brought the simmering tension between Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and his flamboyant minister Navjot Singh Sidhu out in the open.

The year will also be remembered for a blurry video of a horrific accident on Dussehra. As Ravana went up in flames, people watching the spectacle from elevated tracks are mowed down by a train. About 60 are killed.

The state's Congress government sparred with opposition Shiromani Akali Dal over desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib in 2015, and also over inaccuracies in school history books. The Aam Aadmi Party and SAD faced revolts within their ranks. Two grenade attacks triggered fears over revival of militancy.

The Kartarpur corridor drama began with a hug. Cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Sidhu came in for much flak after he embraced Pakistan Army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa at the swearing-in of Imran Khan as that country's new prime minister. Even CM Amarinder Singh disapproved.

Sidhu defended the hug in Islamabad, saying he got emotional after Bajwa told him about plans to open a corridor from Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur to Kartarpur Sahib, the shrine in Pakistan which marks the location where Sikhism's founder Guru Nanak Dev spent the last 18 years of his life.

A few weeks later, Amarinder Singh, a former Army officer, declined the Pakistani invitation to attend the groundbreaking ceremony. But ignoring his CM's advice, Sidhu went ahead.

The Amritsar train tragedy provided opposition parties the ammunition to target the Sidhus. A magisterial probe later blamed the gateman at a railway crossing and organisers of the Dussehra event, giving a clean chit to the minister's politician-wife Navjot Kaur Sidhu, who was the chief guest.

Earlier in the year, 28 men who had left for greener pastures abroad, returned home in caskets, their bodies exhumed from a mass grave in war-hit. Ten more, abducted and killed by the IS, were from other states.

Two grenade blasts, one at the Nirankari Bhawan in Amritsar that killed two people and another at Maqsudan police station in Jalandhar, triggered concern among the security forces that ISI-inspired terrorists were trying to foment trouble in the state.

In August, a report by the Justice Ranjit Singh Commission into the desecration of religious texts in 2015, when the SAD-BJP combine was in power, came as a big setback for the Akalis at a time they were trying to resurrect themselves after the assembly election defeat.

The report not only blamed the police for using unprovoked force on protesters at Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan in Faridkot but also said the then chief minister Parkash Singh Badal was aware of the proposed police action.

The protests had erupted in 2015 after pages from the holy book were reportedly found torn and scattered.

As the clamour for action against the Badals picked up, the opposition SAD suffered another blow. Senior leader Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa quit party posts.

The Taksalis (or the old guard) like Ranjit Singh Brahmpura, Rattan Singh Ajnala and Sewa Singh Sekhwan also revolted against the leadership of the Badals. Pushed to the corner on the sacrilege issue, the entire Akali leadership made a surprise move in December.

It decided to seek atonement from the Akal Takht, the supreme temporal seat of the Sikhs, for unspecified ""mistakes"" committed ""inadvertently"" in the past.

The main opposition Aam Aadmi Party also faced a revolt following the unceremonious ousting of Sukhpal Singh Khaira from the post of the Leader of Opposition in Punjab Assembly. Rebels MLAs held their own public meetings, virtually daring the party to take action against them.

There were some tough times for the ruling Congress as well. A consistent opposition attack forced the resignation of minister Rana Gurjit Singh, accused of illegally bagging sand-mining contracts.

As nine new cabinet ministers were inducted in the Amarinder Singh government in April, some Congress MLAs, including Surjit Singh Dhiman and Sangat Singh Gilzian, quit their party positions, upset over being overlooked.

A rift in the top brass of Punjab Police too came out in the open. A DGP-rank officer, Siddharth Chattopadhyaya, accused Punjab DGP Suresh Arora and another senior officer of trying to scuttle a probe into an SSP's alleged role in a drug trafficking case.

Also in 2018, school teachers went on strike over pay cuts. Dead fish floated on the Beas after spillage of molasses from a factory, triggering environmental concerns. The SAD objected to how Sikh history is taught in Punjab schools. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Amritsar, underscoring the importance of the Punjabi diaspora.

RPN Singh, the national in-charge of Congress in Jharkhand, on Wednesday announced that the party will organise rallies across the state between January 14 and February 20 and raise the pitch against BJP-led NDA governments at the Centre and in Jharkhand.

Speaking to media persons at the party's state headquarters here, Singh said rallies have been scheduled in Chandankyari (Bokaro), Gumla, Deoghar, Palamu and Hazaribag. He stressed senior leaders from Congress's national leadership and political heavyweights from different states will be invited to address these rallies. The public engagement camapaigns come amid speculations that Congress is gearing up to contest alone in all 14 parliamentary and 80 assembly seats during next year's elections in case its proposed Mahagatbandhan (grand alliance) with JMM, JVM-P, RJD and other parties does not take off.

Singh, however, avoided questions on whether the party's national president Rahul Gandhi will attend any of these public meetings. While BJP national president Amit Shah has frequented Jharkhand since the saffron party took over the reigns at the Centre in 2014, Gandhi has not visited the state since campaigning for the Lok Sabha polls ended.

Congress functionaries in Jharkhand, cutting across its rank and file, have been stressing that Gandhi's appearance at a public rally can add steam into the party's state unit in its preparations for 2019 polls.

Singh announced that Congress will ramp up issues of para-teachers, hunger deaths, mob-lynching, unemployment, rising number of crimes against women, corruption, ill-effects of demonetization and GST and government's efforts to bring in laws that will pave way for acquisition of tribal land. Upping the ante against Das government on the eve of its fourth anniversary in office, Singh said: ""We will bring out a document compiling the lies the BJP told the people in their election manifesto. For instance, the BJP had claimed that all households in Jharkhand will have round the clock electricity. Has the promise been fulfilled? No. There are many such false promises.""

Amid growing speculations on the future of the proposed Mahagatbandhan, Singh said Congress will sit down with all like minded parties and finalize seat sharing agreements after Makar Sankranti (January 15)."

Consider his latest order that in case of encroachers on grazing land, the encroachments be removed immediately and strict action initiated against the accused. As Adityanath continued to drive his administration hard on ill-conceived cow schemes, irate farmers in Aligarh locked up stray cows inside classrooms while schoolchildren and teachers were left in the lurch.

In truth, the scale of the problem unleashed by Hindutva-inspired curbs on cattle trade is unmanageable. A 2012 livestock census found 3.9 crore cows in UP. Six years later, imagine many of these cows past their productive age roaming the countryside and cities in search of food. No government is in a position to earmark shelters or grazing lands for such a huge population. Adityanath's desperate search for cow welfare solutions is bound to fail and he must instead focus on the rising farm anger against stray cows now directed at government property like schools and hospitals. Even those encroaching grazing land deserve a better reason than stray cows to be asked to go.

Farmers have paid dearly for this proliferation of stray cows. Unable to sell unproductive cows and now struggling to fend off stray cows from fields, it has been a double whammy for them.

""Until recently, NET was mandatory only to become a teaching faculty in colleges and universities and it was to ensure that only qualified staff enter the higher educational institutions. This is the first time, UGC has mandated NET to avail scholarship, meant for minorities,"" said a 27-year-old research scholar from the city.

Candidates belonging to minority communities, including Muslim, Christian, Sikh and Buddhist, who have enrolled for full time MPhill or PhD programmes in Indian Universities, institutions and colleges with UGC NET or CIST NET could apply for the fellowship, said the UGC notification which was released recently. The last date to apply for fellowship is December 31.

The notification comes days after students criticized its initial notification which stated that only those students who had cleared NET held in December 2017 and June 2018 were eligible to apply for fellowship.

Most of the times, students especially women, come forward to do doctoral programmes mainly because of the fellowships as it would make them financially independent, the scholar said, adding that the move is going to be a big blow to students.

The students who are from economically poor background and are completely dependent on fellowships to pursue further, could no longer opt for doctoral programmes as nobody would be willing to spend a year to crack NET, she said.

Just like NEET coaching classes, NET coaching classes might also come up in the cities, he added. ""It is definitely going to be a setback for the students from marginalized section. It is not the appropriate time to mandate NET as the ministry of human resource and development (MHRD) had made PhD compulsory for the teaching faculties from 2021,"" former general secretary of the Association of University Teachers (AUT) C Pichandy said.

The year began on a positive note with the government promising to draft non-governmental organisations and corporate houses into helping upgrade facilities in its schools. It maintained the momentum with a promise to enable 381 schools with wi-fi in March.

The introduction of QR codes in textbooks under the new syllabus was a hit with students who enjoyed the freedom of learning at their own pace.

The low point was when School Education Minister K.A. Sengottaiyan announced at a meeting in December that the government was considering curtailing the syllabus as teachers were finding it difficult to complete. Incidentally, the Ministry of Human Resource Development has also suggested a reduction in the NCERT syllabus for Central Board of Secondary Education schools.

Though no final decision has been made yet, educationists wonder if all the good work done over the last two years will come undone if the State and Centre decide against the continuation of the present syllabus. It was not a great year though for higher education. Vice-chancellor appointments in State universities generated a lot of controversy with political parties venting their displeasure.

Corruption, allegations of favours to students in exchange for being pliant, searches by the Directorate of Anti-Vigilance and Corruption officials in houses and offices of V-Cs made headlines.

In February, the DVAC trapped Bharathiar University V-C A. Ganapathy, rendering the institute headless. In March, Anna University's former V-C M. Rajaram faced charges of corruption in the recruitment of teachers. The University was in the eye of the storm with several officials being accused of taking money and helping students pass exams.

In April, a scandal rocked the State with the leak of audio tapes of a college teacher urging students to do as expected by ""higher officials of the Madurai Kamaraj University"" in return for higher marks in their semester examinations, money and admission to higher-level courses in the university.

Political parties continued to target Governor-Chancellor Banwarilal Purohit and alleged that he had received favours in return for appointments. They objected to the appointment of candidates from other States as Vice-Chancellors to Dr. Ambedkar Law University and Anna University.

""Kashmiri language is dying and we are losing our identity day by day,"" shouted protestors at Press Enclave, Srinagar. Besides raising slogans like ""Kashrin Henz Pehchan, Kashir Zaban Kashir Zaban (Identity of every Kashmiri is Kashmiri langue), the protestors asked governor administration to make this language compulsory at higher secondary level in all educational institutions.

""This is not the matter of just Kashmir students, but every Kashmiri should be worried,"" said Kifayat Ahmad, who is pursing M.A in Kashmiri from Kashmir University.

He said out of more than 200 higher secondary in the Valley, Kashmiri is taught only in 25 to 30 schools, and only nine colleges out of more than 20. ""Every year 100s of students come out from university with Post graduation in Kashmiri language.

One of the protestors said that government should close down ""Kashmiri department"" if they don't want to preserve this language and introduce subjects in all the educational institutions.

The protestors lashed out at government for not creating jobs for Kashmiri teachers in Primary and Higher Secondary Schools and Colleges.

Pertinent to mention, Kashmiri language is being taught in all government schools of Kashmir division up to 9th standard and it is one of the optional subject for class 11th and 12th.

Besides, Kashmir University has a full-fledged Kashmiri department to teach students at postgraduate, doctorate and post doctorate level besides Certificate and PG Diploma.

At a cabinet meeting, presided over by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, cleared the decision to hike the salaries and related allowances, and entail an additional annual burden of Rs 14,000 crore on the exchequer.

The Maharashtra government on Thursday announced its plan to implement the salary hike for its 20 lakh employees as per the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission, a move which will cost the state exchequer a sum of Rs 52,000 crore.

The new pay scale will come into effect from January 1, 2019 and the arrears will be paid from January 1, 2016, when the commission came into existence.

The decision was taken by the state Cabinet at its weekly meeting, chaired by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis.

A government note issued after the meeting stated that the government needs Rs 14,000 crore to implement the salary hike and another Rs 38,655 crore to pay the arrears of three years.

While the move seems to be a good news for the current and the previous employees, it could be equally problematic for the government. The hike will come into force at a time when the state government is struggling to find new avenues of generating revenue. It is also reeling under a debt of Rs 4.63 lakh crore.

Apart from the state government employees, teachers from unaided schools and Zilla Parishad institutions will also get benefit of the salary hike.

Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar estimated the number of beneficiaries at 20.50 lakh.

However, the government has fixed a cap on payment of the arrears. Mungantiwar said that the employees will get arrears for the period of 36 months in five equal instalments.

""The amount of the arrears will be directly credited in the employees' General Provident Fund (GPF) account,"" he said.

He explained that with the new pay commission coming into effect, a Group 'D' employee will get Rs 15,000 basic salary per month, whereas those from Group 'C' will get Rs 18,000 per month.

The pensioners, who are in the age category of 80-85 years, will get a hike of 10 per cent in their monthly pension, those in 85-90 years of age will get 15 per cent, those in 90-95 years of age will get 20 per cent and 50 per cent hike will be given to those who are 100 and above.

There are 362 people in the state who will reap the benefits in the age category of 100 years and above.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is hopeful of getting an advantage in the election season with the implementation of the pay hike.

On the other hand, the Opposition has taken a cautious stand. Senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and former Finance Minister Ajit Pawar said that he will believe in the government only after the pay hike comes into existence.

RPN Singh, the national-in-charge of Jharkhand unit of Congress on Thursday announced that the party will organize rallies in five divisions of Jharkhand between January 14 and February 20 next year and raise the pitch against BJP led NDA governments at the Center and in Jharkhand.

Singh said the rallies have been scheduled in Chandankyari (Bokaro), Gumla, Deoghar, Palamu and Hazaribag.

In a two-storey building under a flyover in Bareilly, above namkeen shops, past a policeman posted in the stairwell, lives a 24-year-old woman with her parents, brother, two parrots and five Persian cats.

The oldest of the cats, Simba, with her furry golden coat, sauntered around the living room, while black-haired Mikey scampered. Mother and child, I asked. ""No, no, partners, just like Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas,"" the young woman giggled, her eyes sparkling, her long straight hair bouncing in a ponytail.

She might not have the international fame of film actor Chopra, who also grew up in Bareilly, but in this part of western Uttar Pradesh, everyone seems to know Nida Khan.

The young woman was catapulted to fame in 2016 when she filed a case against her husband, Sheeran Raza Khan, accusing him of beating her after she failed to meet his family's demands for dowry.

Sheeran Khan is no ordinary man: he is the scion of a powerful family of Islamic scholars who trace their lineage to Ahmed Raza Khan, the founder of the influential Barelvi school of Islam, which is followed by most Indian Muslims. They are the custodians of the Dargah-e-Ala Hazrat, the tomb of Ahmed Raza Khan. Sheeran Khan's uncle Tauqeer Raza Khan, a prominent cleric, also leads a political party called the Ittehad-e-Millat Council, and was a minister in the Samajwadi Party government.

When a rishta (marriage offer) came from the illustrious dargah family, Nida's mother was tempted. But her father, an officer in a public sector company, was clear: Nida had just passed out of St Francis High School, he wanted her to complete her graduation. Sheeran Khan's family had to wait.

The engagement took place in the summer of 2014, two months after Nida Khan finished a degree in commerce.

India had just witnessed a tumultuous election. Narendra Modi, the controversial chief minister of Gujarat led the Bharatiya Janata Party to a thumping victory. Under his watch, more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslim, had been killed in the 2002 Gujarat riots. This triggered deep anxieties among Muslims, who found their representation in the Lok Sabha plummet to an all time low.

As a woman on the path to marriage, Nida Khan was caught in her own maelstrom - she had just started to wear a burqa. All she remembers of the election is that she cast her vote for the first time. She voted in favour of the Congress candidate, not as a rejection of Modi, but because she was impressed with the strength of Indira Gandhi, India's only woman prime minister.

""I too was a leader in school,"" Khan said. ""First, as class monitor, then as school prefect.""

But when it came to marriage, Nida Khan followed tradition. In February 2015, when her nikah was solemnised to Sheeran Khan, she had not even seen his photograph.

Months later, in July, she was back at her parents home - with injuries serious enough to have caused a miscarriage.

""Our mentality did not match,"" she explained. ""Everyone assumed he is from the dargah family, he must be a hafiz, aalim [erudite person], but it turned out he was a Class 5 passout."" She got a taste of his anger in March, when he stormed into an examination hall where she was writing her first-year masters of commerce exams. Holding her by the arm, he pulled her out - a story dramatic enough for the local newspapers to publish, but after carefully excising all the names.

Such was the power of the dargah family that when Nida Khan decided to file a police complaint in 2016, she was initially turned away. She had to seek the intervention of the courts.

Even then the police hastily filed a final report exonerating Sheeran Khan, citing lack of evidence. On his part, he claimed the marriage itself was infructuous - he had dissolved it by saying ""talaq"" three times.

At this crucial juncture, Nida Khan's crusade caught the attention of the Bharatiya Janata Party, which, by then, had decided to raise the pitch against triple talaq. Launching the party's campaign for the 2017 assembly elections, Modi spoke of saving ""Muslim sisters"" from injustice. But many in the Muslim community saw this as an encroachment in their personal laws and another act of majoritarian assertion.

Already, western Uttar Pradesh had witnessed attacks on Muslims. In September 2015, a middle-aged man, Mohammed Akhlaq, was dragged out of his house and killed by a mob which claimed that he had slaughtered a calf for meat. The murder took place just 50 km away from Ghaziabad where Modi, during the 2014 election campaign, had thundered against India's rising beef exports, deriding them as ""gulabi kranti"" or a pink revolution.

Consolidating its 2014 victory, BJP swept the Uttar Pradesh elections in March 2017. For Muslims, the political marginalisation was now complete - not a single Muslim MLA in the ruling party and a rabble-rousing Hindu monk, Adityanath, in the chief minister's seat. One of his first orders was to clamp down on unauthorised slaughterhouses and meat shops, which mostly employ Muslims. While the shops reopened after complying with the new rules, meat became a bad word, leaving people in the business vulnerable.

Mohammad Salim Qureshi ran a meat shop in the narrow lanes of the old city of Bareilly. In June 2018, he was beaten to death in his own neighbourhood, allegedly by the henchmen of the police, after he failed to pay them bribes. ""They threatened to fix my brother in a cow slaughter case,"" said his brother Nayeem Qureshi.

Scroll.in spoke to a dozen Muslims living in and around Bareilly. Surrounded by other Muslims, they said they felt secure in their neighbourhoods, but travelling outside was a source of anxiety. A young rice miller said he had stopped taking trains to Delhi and now only journeyed by car: ""Because my wife wears a hijab,"" he explained. Others spoke of avoiding meat - in school tiffins, on journeys. ""No kebabs on the train,"" said a crafts merchant.

In this worsening social climate, the BJP has found one trump card: the triple talaq crusaders among Muslim women. Ishrat Jahan, a petitioner in the Supreme Court case that led to a ban on the practice, joined the party this year in West Bengal. So did Sofia Ahmed from Kanpur, who was rewarded with a post in the Uttar Pradesh minorities commission.

But Nida Khan is yet to join.

Her story offers glimpses of the complex fabric of life in western Uttar Pradesh, which is now under strain.

Bareilly district lies in northwestern Uttar Pradesh in a region called Rohilkhand, named after the Afghan Rohillas who ruled in the 17th century. The large Muslim population here - 34.54% in Bareilly and 50.57% in neighbouring Rampur - is often the subject of the feverish imaginations of Hindutva supporters.

For all the menace attributed to them, most Muslims here barely scrape through a living. The traditional occupations they follow are in a state of decline.

""Bareilly is famous for four things,"" a young man explained, ""baans, surma, manjha, zari"" - bamboo furniture, eye kohl, kite string and embroidery work.

All of them are losing out to cheaper, factory-made versions.

In 2014, while campaigning in Bareilly, Modi invoked the special connection he shared with the city as a Gujarati who loved flying kites. ""If your kite flies high, then the manjha must be from Bareilly,"" he said, sending the audience in raptures.

Referring to the downturn caused in the industry by cheaper nylon substitutes called Chinese manjha, he promised to turn around its fortunes, in the same way that he claimed his government had done with the kite industry in Gujarat. ""Brothers and sisters, in Gujarat, the kite industry is in the hands of the poor, 90% of whom are Muslims,"" he said. ""We did research and started schemes. The industry barely touched Rs 35 crore, we took it to Rs 500 crore.""

Among the audience was Arshad Hussain, the president of the Manjha Mazdoor Kalyan Samiti, which represents 30,000 workers in Bareilly district. Impressed with Modi's speech, he voted for the BJP in 2014, he recalled with nervous laughter one morning in December, sitting in a field in impoverished Bakarganj, where hundreds of men ran around poles in luminous winter light.

To make the kite-slaying manjha, the workers must injure their hands, coating the cotton thread strung on poles with a rice paste mixed with glass. The daily wages are a pittance - just Rs 150-Rs 200.

Far from seeing a revival under Modi government, this marginal industry has been pushed further against the wall. First, demonetisation in November 2016 caused an upheaval, then seven months later, the introduction of Goods and Services Tax came as a blow.

GST, which replaced a welter of other taxes, was supposed to make things easier. But not only are the costs of filing GST returns prohibitive, navigating paper work is a steep challenge for those who lack a formal education, said Hussain. ""About 200 people run majha-making units here,"" he said. ""Only 50 have a GST registration."" Others either sell their products by borrowing GST numbers [from other units], for which they pay a commission, or they sell them cheap to whoever is willing to buy.

A sales representative of a leading yarn-making company who was visiting Hussain in Bakarganj said he saw a downturn in every industry he did business with: shoe-making, textiles, mattresses. ""Cash flow has stopped in the economy,"" he said. As firms waited for refunds, GST had locked up private funds with the government, and banks were not lending. The result was a liquidity squeeze. ""The big players are benefitting, the smaller businesses are getting wiped out,"" he said.

In Shahmat Ganj in the old city, Asad Khan, 42, who makes and sells hand-embroidered salwar kameez fabrics pointed to a pile of products lying around. ""These have come back from Punjab,"" he said. He had sold them on credit - the buyer made no upfront payment - but when they remained unsold, the buyer sent them back. ""Now the trouble is I have already paid GST on them, which I won't get back,"" Khan said. The new tax system does not account for a traditional economy based on credit and trust.

It is easy to discuss the economic crisis in these neighbourhoods. But broaching the subject of the worsening social climate and the anxiety of being Muslim is not.

""I have stopped watching TV,"" is all that Asad Khan was willing to say.

Hammad Nabi, a youth leader of the Samajwadi Party, said it was counterproductive to dwell on the fears of Muslims: it pushes them to hardline leaders like the Owaisis, he claimed. ""This government is bad not just for Muslims, we say it is bad for everyone,"" he said.

But in the villages of Bareilly, there is disquiet. Zarar Ahmed, 60, the pradhan of Jojkharpur village in Bahedi block, and the head of the association of village chiefs, alleged that Muslim-majority villages were being denied development funds under the BJP. ""They have not sanctioned a single awaas [house] in my village,"" he said, referring to the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana, which subsidises the construction of low cost houses.

In another Muslim-majority village, Rurki, in the same block, a younger pradhan, Akram Khan, 43, disagreed. ""There might be verbal discrimination,"" he said, hinting at the sparring between BJP MLAs and pradhans owing allegiance to the Samajwadi Party, ""but there is no discrimination in funds.""

In his own village, however, stands a monument to the government's malice towards Muslims.

It is a two-storey building which lies incomplete. Funded through the previous government's multisectoral development programme, the building was meant to house an industrial training institute. The programme, which was launched in 2008, aimed at building infrastructure to ""address the development deficits of minority concentration areas"". The Centre contributed 75% of the funds, while 25% came from the state.

But, since the Modi government came to power, Uttar Pradesh officials say not only has the sanction of new projects stopped, even ongoing projects have come to a standstill because central funds have dried up. All that the Modi government has done is rename the programme as the Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram.

For instance, of the Rs 3.65 crore allotted to the industrial training institute in Bahedi, Rs 2.65 was released by the previous government, all of which was spent. About 75% of the construction is complete. But the second instalment never came. Now, weeds have taken over the unfinished building.

In Bareilly district alone, as many as 24 projects are lying incomplete. The original sanction for them was Rs 52.73 crore but the delay has pushed up costs to Rs 77.56. To complete them, Uttar Pradesh would have to dip into its own funds, which, officials say, is unlikely to happen.

""Don't do anything for minorities, no issue,"" said a senior official. ""But this government wants to show it is not doing anything for them.""

Another example of Modi government's ill-will towards Muslims, said state officials, was the unprecedented delay in the salaries of teachers appointed under the madrassa modernisation scheme. Launched by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led BJP government in 2003, the scheme aimed to supplement privately funded deeni talim (religious education) with government-funded duniyawi taleem (secular education) through the appointment of maths, science and other subject teachers.

While delays occurred even under the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance, never before had the Centre completely stopped releasing salaries. ""It's been 33 months since we were paid,"" said Mohammad Shakeel, who has been in service since 2003. ""We have agitated in Jantar Mantar [in Delhi], to no avail.""

""Modi ji says he wants Muslims to have ek haath mein computer, ek haath mein Koran [a computer in one hand, Koran in the other],"" he continued. ""Computer to mila nahi, ab Koran bhi chooth jayegi."" We did not get a computer, and now we stand to lose the Koran.

Funds are not the ony instrument by which governments signal their priorities.

Months after it came to power, in August 2017, the Adityanath government ordered all districts to enforce the singing of the national anthem in madrassas on Independence Day. The proceedings were to be recorded and the footage sent to Lucknow.

The decision created palpable tension in parts of Bareilly, said an official, leading to orders being imposed under Section 144 to prohibit more than four people from assembling at a spot.

Assigned the task of enforcing the order in one madrassa, he recalled how he got around it. ""I told them I will sing, you please join only if you want to,"" he said. ""Literally, no one sang. But I had positioned the camera in a way where only I was visible. So the work was done.""

In August, Nida Khan received a call from Rekha Arya, the women and child development minister of neighbouring Uttarakhand. Arya said she wanted to discuss women's issues but Khan was smart enough to know this was a cover. In July, a cleric in Bareilly had passed a fatwa against her, which had prompted the police to assign her a full-time security detail, but it had also raised her public profile. Aware that other triple talaq crusaders had joined the BJP, she anticipated an offer from the party.

When she consulted her parents, her father said ""no netagiri"", but her mother asked her to make up her own mind. Khan reminded herself that it was only after the BJP had come to power in Uttar Pradesh that the investigation in her case had been reopened. The police had taken one year to file the chargesheet. ""There was delay, but no injustice,"" she reasoned. ""I am safe as long as the BJP is in power. If the SP comes back, I am finished.""

But driving from Bareilly to Dehradun, via Haridwar, was a challenge.

It was the season for the Kanwar Yatra, in which young male devotees of Shiva walk long distances to fetch the water of Ganga from Haridwar. The road was jammed. ""My brother told the driver, be extra careful, if you even touch the bhole people, you will get killed,"" Khan recalled. A video had surfaced, showing Kanwariyas vandalising a car in the full public view, with the police watching helplessly.

In 2012, communal clashes had erupted in Bareilly district after Kanwariyas were stopped by Muslims from playing loud music in the town of Aonla. This year, in many villages of Bareilly, Muslims complained that Kanwariyas deliberately strayed from the official routes, marched in front of mosques, resorted to provocative slogans. ""Musalman khamosh raha (Muslims stayed silent),"" said Abdul Waheed, a leader allied to the Samajwadi Party. ""We counselled them to stay silent. If you speak up, you only will get beaten up. The government is theirs.""

But Nida Khan scoffed at the simplistic binaries. ""Our people too take out jaloos [processions] which are nothing but shakti pradarshan [displays of strength],"" she noted. The competitive displays clashed in 2010, when a procession to mark the Prophet's birthday ran into a Holi celebration in Bareilly. This triggered riots that led to a month-long curfew in the city.

Voicing a commonly held belief, Nida Khan claimed the riots were not spontaneous: the clash was orchestrated. Less than a year ago, in 2009, Santosh Gangwar of the BJP, after six successive wins, was defeated by the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections. The Bahujan Samaj Party was in power in the state. Both the Samajwadi Party and the BJP were political marginalised. Nida Khan claims they got together to engineer the riots and polarise the electorate. ""Tauqeer Mian [of the dargah family] and Santosh Gangwar are after all good friends,"" she said.

This year, in the thick of speculation over whether Khan would join the BJP, local newspapers reported that Gangwar had scuttled her chances - at the behest of the dargah family. While Arya had made an offer on behalf of BJP's Uttarakhand unit, Nida Khan had turned it down, saying she would also consider an offer from the central leadership. Days later, Gangwar called her for a meeting, but nothing came of it.

Nida Khan remains ambivalent about joining the BJP.

In September, she had travelled to Lucknow to collect an award. Adityanath was the chief guest at the event. On stage, the moderator asked him about the mob lynchings in the state - as recently as June, a Muslim man had been killed over cow slaughter rumours in Hapur.

Khan recalled his answer: ""Mob lynching? No, that's not taking place in UP"".

""I was like how much is he lying,"" she said. ""But the anchor did not even cross-question him.""

In the Bareilly college, where Nida Khan studied, colonial-era red brick buildings are set against green expansive lawns. Like many campuses, in recent years, it has seen a rise of the Hindutva student organisation, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad. In October, a bus carrying Urdu books sponsored by the National Council For Promotion of Urdu Language, an autonomous body under the Ministry of Human Resource Development, had to be sent back after ABVP objected, shouting slogans against it.

Even without paying much attention to politics, two young women in the second-year BSc course had concluded that Modi government was anti-Muslim. ""Everything is being renamed,"" said Rashmi Singh, 19. Her friend, Alqama Zaidi, 17, chipped in: ""Did you see the WhatsApp joke about Hajmola?"" - referring to a brand of candy. ""The government has renamed it, because it has Haj and Moula. Its new name is Deen Dayal Upadhyay."""

The recent right-wing attacks on premier institutions of learning in social sciences and humanities in the country has generated a sense of deep insecurity among the community of researchers and intellectuals there, and also among the networks of alumni of these institutions throughout the country. Clearly, what is at stake in these attacks is not, as right-wing ideologues project it, a curtailing of the powers of influential left-wingers who have hitherto enjoyed some control over these spaces. Rather, the right-wing agenda pertains to the very silencing of the demand for freedom of thought and intellectual exploration in academic spaces.

Nearly hegemonic outside the academy through near-total control of the corporatised mass media, the Hindutva right wing sought to claim academic spaces and convert them into machines that will bolster that hegemony. Given that the results from attacks continuing from last year are not as promising as they seemed initially, the attention seems to be now on eroding these institutions by interfering in admissions, diversity policies, rules of functioning, and so on, even as canard upon canard about these institutions continues to be manufactured by the media.

Yet, as a scholar who has spent just two years of her student life here, and has been located far away from these spaces, I end up wanting to think more closely on what exactly we, on the left of public opinion and politics, have lost in these attacks.

I am not entirely comfortable with the claim that we have lost academic freedoms, because from where I am talking, there was hardly any such thing as that. In fact, one is saddened so much by these attacks on JNU mainly because that was the place where one caught a glimmer, albeit a slight one, of the possibility of academic freedom which would allow one to reflect on different perspectives without being bullied.

I admit that this was possible only by taking a critical stance within this relatively more liberal space: one had to resist the prescriptions of the official intellectuals of the student organisations one felt close to, and risk being slut-shamed and isolated all the time. In hindsight, that looks like a small price to pay as against the enormous costs of insisting on intellectual freedom - the loss of the freedom to critique established ways, and to explore other lifestyles, which is being inflicted on students and teachers of the JNU now.

I mean, students who resisted the pressure to conform to what was projected as politically correct by the university authorities, and also by the dominant student organisations, often at considerable personal costs. At the JNU, this is indeed a very prominent part of the university's history: collective interventions by students to change broader policies affecting them, legal interventions against various aspects of policy and administrative decisions, the defence of the student union autonomy, and so on.

Then there are the many undocumented everyday struggles against pressures from powerful academics and student organisations by both individuals and collectives of marginalised social groups and viewpoints. While the recent history of the university might reveal a distinct fall in the intensity of such resistance and active intervention, the spirited resistance it put up was clearly related to the strength of the legacy of demanding and fighting for academic freedoms from below.

I cannot stress the significance of this more, writing as I am from an academic institution where a liberal academic culture was shaped from above; no doubt, a unique instance in the country. This is at the Centre for Development Studies (CDS), in Kerala, which was created and guided by one of the greatest of India's Nehruvian liberals, the economist K.N. Raj. Founded in the early 1970s, CDS espoused fearless exploration of research questions, pluralism in perspectives (in letter, initially at least), and unquestionable personal freedoms.

Yet, this was largely from above - and the relative lack of the demand for fuller academic freedoms from below was evident in the way in which liberal academic culture here stayed largely static and even stagnant as the decades passed. This is not to belittle it; for it is abundantly clear that it was its very persistence that enabled the re-emergence of questions of academic freedom and struggles for it from below (in whatever limited fashion) on campus in relatively recent times.

For instance, much of what was recognised as liberal academic life on campus, clearly rested on what authorities perceived as ideal and therefore neither the patriarchal nor the caste-elite connotations of these were easily discernible. Further, it even meant the stagnation of intellectual life, and interventions from above (from the faculty) - even when they seemed far-reaching - have had relatively weaker impact on the general orientation of intellectual life here.

In other institutions of higher education in Kerala, where such liberal leadership never existed, pressure for pluralism in perspectives came from below - through the larger political movements and civil social activism - and rarely from the academic community itself. The pressure was hardly exerted directly on higher authorities, and I cannot really remember learning anything substantial in the undergraduate course I pursued here.

The syllabi and the teaching of history here in those days was out-dated by at least two decades; and in the university departments which took research seriously, doing research that questioned the certainties established by the patriarchs of both the liberal-nationalist and Marxist streams was a huge risk, at least until the end of the 1980s. It was outside these spaces - in movements and activism - that one learned to think and influence wider intellectual life, utilising one's many cultural skills, particularly bilingualism for which the academy had no use.

It is not that sedition charges were never imposed on dissenters before JNU - I myself remember how, in the 1980s, ex-Naxalites were charged with precisely sedition for raising slogans against the government in Kerala, slogans that were quite tame, really, by today's standards; how plays were banned for being blasphemous, and so on.

There was no freedom of expression on the campuses I was familiar with, either. But because we did learn early on that academic freedoms and the powers to influence wider intellectual life and public opinion did not completely coincide, and that academic freedom from above was useful but rather lifeless, we found other ways and skills that allowed us to occupy a no-person's space between academics and public discussion. A place that is unstable, under attack from both sides, and hard to occupy for sure, but one that is useful and powerful if one has the skills and the agility to stay there. Believe me, I have been living there since the past couple of decades or so.

In support of his arguments, the petitioner pointed out that the UGC notified the Career Advancement Scheme in 2006, directing that the posts of assistant librarian/college librarian and assistant director of physical education would retire at 62 instead of 60, on par with teachers. ""The state government issued an order dated June 27, 1998, accepting the resolution of the varsity that librarians working in universities and their constituent colleges (government colleges and other aided colleges) are to be treated as non-vocational staff. Following this, several universities, which had no governing statutes, continued the services of library staff on par with teachers"", the petitioner contended.

The petitioner claimed that state universities had not framed statutes, and were seeking instructions from the Education Department regarding the tenure and nature of appointment of teachers, librarians and other staff.

HC provides relief to co-op society members

Bengaluru: The Karnataka High Court on Wednesday passed an interim order allowing the members of a few cooperative societies to cast their votes in the election to be conducted for the first time after the amendment was brought to the Cooperative Societies Act in 2013. This, despite members not having attended three out of five annual general body meetings. Justice G Narendar passed this interim order after hearing petitions challenging Section 20 of the Cooperative Societies Act, which barred members from voting if they are not following the minimum requirements, including that they should participate in three out of five annual general body meetings."

Around 45 students of Wazir Ram Singh Pathania Memorial Public School were returning home when the bus skidded off road and fell into the 100-feet deep gorge near Gurchal village on the Nurpur-Chamba road, some 300 km from the state capital. All the dead students were below the age of 10. The bus driver and two teachers were also among the dead.

The UMIS will allow the universities to create a more structured organization, its transaction handling capacity and improve the system of its internal control. It would also automate the working of the university by expediting closer interaction among faculty, students, non-teaching staff, parents, alumni and the administration.

Governor-cum-chancellor Lalji Tandon has directed the vice-chancellors of all the universities in the state to complete the process of computerization and digitization as early as possible so that the UMIS may be implemented before the next academic session. The universities have already informed the chancellor that tenders for installing the necessary software had already been floated and the deals were to be finalized by January 15.

In the first phase of UMIS, the component of ""students' life cycle"" would be implemented. Under this component, such information as students' registration, admission, attendance, internal assessment and all activities related to examinations, including filling up of examination forms, payment of examination fee, fixation of examination centres, distribution of admit cards, publication of examination results, mark sheets, certificates and degrees would have to be digitized.

All the colleges and postgraduate departments of different universities would have to ensure complete digitization of pre-examination and post-examination tasks well within time with a view to maintaining the academic calendar. All this would not only provide online information to the students in a transparent manner, but also ensure complete transparency in the functioning of universities.

Similarly, under the ""human resource management"" component of UMIS, the profile of teachers and non-teaching staff, their service records regarding date of appointment, positing, promotion and retirement, would be digitized. Under the ""Payroll and Accounts Management System"" component, grants received from UGC, state government, RUSA, NBA and the utilization certificates and audit reports would have to be digitized.

The chancellor has asked the VCs to provide 'dashboard' facility under UMIS so that both the chancellor's secretariat and the state government may have direct access to all the information about the universities. The 'database ownership' would be fully under the control of the universities and this must be clearly mentioned in the MoUs to be signed between the university and the agency hired for installing UMIS.

The UMIS will be fully preserved and protected by periodical backup server, the chancellor ruled."

The 'yatra', which is to start from Kurtha in Jehanabad district, is considered to be aimed at galvanizing people of his Koeri (Kushwaha) caste, which is in OBC group and accounts for six percent of the population, and also pillorying CM Nitish Kumar on the poor education scenario in the government-run schools in the state.

""For the last one and a half years, we have been campaigning for educational reforms and chalked out 25-point demands, but CM Nitish has ignored them,"" Kushwaha said.

Kushwaha, who left NDA and joined the RJD-led Grand Alliance in Bihar through Congress-led UPA last week, alleged that the BJP's national brass (read PM Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah) were in cahoots with CM Nitish who was bent on destroying both and his own party.

Kushwaha said his 'yatra' would cover all the districts before concluding on January 30, coinciding with the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. Incidentally, both the Centre and the CM have announced yearlong celebrations of Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary next year.

Kushwaha said he would also lead an 'aakrosh march' to the Raj Bhavan here on February 3. He would also submit a memorandum to governor Lalji Tandon, giving details of the demands backed by signatures of 1 crore people. The RLSP rank and file would start collecting signatures on the issue from January 1.

The 'yatra' from Kurtha is symbolic as Jehanabad district has strong presence of Koeri caste population. The place is significant for Kushwaha as the Jehanabad parliamentary constituency is represented by Arun Kumar, who had won the seat on the RLSP ticket in 2014, but later turned a rebel. Recently, he condemned CM Nitish and the police lathicharge on the procession of Kushwahas in Patna. Arun's move was considered as trying to mend fences with Kushwaha.

Otherwise, Kushwaha also said the Nitish government's decision to merge two primary schools into one owing to the lack of teachers and to provide transport facility for the distantly located children to reach the newly merged school was both ""impractical and faulty""."

Students enrolled in government-run English medium primary schools say they do not want to switch over to Hindi as a medium when they begin lessons in upper primary school after finishing Class 5. Their demand to convert some of the upper primary schools from Hindi to English medium is growing louder with every passing day.

Kajal Kumari, a student of English medium primary school Gejha in Gautam Buddh Nagar said, ""Switching back to Hindi will not be easy. I request the authorities to please do something so that we may continue to study in English after passing Class 5. It is through a lot of hard work that we developed a comfort level in studying in English. Now, if we go back to learning lessons in Hindi, it will undo whatever we learnt over the past few years.""

In 2015, the basic education department had converted a few primary schools of Uttar Pradesh into English medium institutions. The primary school Gejha in Gautam Buddh Nagar was also made English medium at this time. It has 434 students enrolled in it and most of them do not wish to switch over to a Hindi medium school.

Officials said that after seeing the craze for English-medium schools growing in the state, the BJP government decided to convert 5,000 primary schools to English-medium ones from the April 2018 session. At present, 4,97,108 students are studying in these government-run primary schools.

""In Lucknow alone, there are 44 such schools where more than 6,200 students are enrolled,"" said Amar Kant Singh, Basic Shiksha Adhikari, Lucknow.

Hariyali Srivastava, assistant teacher at primary school Gejha, said the problem was that most students coming to government-run primary schools hailed from humble backgrounds. ""Their parents can't afford to send them to private English medium schools in Class 6, as the fee is very high,"" she said.

Corroborating what the teacher said, Kajal added, ""I want to study only in a government-run English medium school because my father (an e-rickshaw driver) can't afford to pay the fees charged by private English medium schools.""

Zainab Khatoon, another Class 5 girl of the same school, said that she wanted the state government to intervene in the matter.

Making an appeal to senior officials in the basic education department, Srivastava said, ""The students have learnt all terminology in English. Now, they will have to study in Hindi medium upper primary schools, which will be very difficult for them. Our students are asking for help. They want schools to be made English medium till Class 10.""

Chhavi Agarwal, assistant teacher of another primary school, said she teaches 280 students. ""Similar requests are pouring in from my students too.""

Lucknow BSA Amar Kant Singh agreed with the teachers and said that the demand for English medium schools after Class 5 was ""quite natural"". ""After studying in English medium institutions, students will not like to go back to Hindi medium schools,"" he said.

A senior basic education department official added that they were aware of the growing demand for government-run English medium schools and were looking into the matter."

For quite some time, the para teachers have been fighting for regularisation of their jobs and a raise in their remunerations.

Currently, they have been organising dharnas outside the homes of BJP MLAs and MPs across the state. Not only this, a few ruling party legislators also have sympathised with the agitators. Taking advantage of the NDA's discomfiture, opposition parties such as Congress and JMM have thrown their weight behind the para teachers.

On Wednesday, the second day of its winter session, the assembly saw pandaemonium over the issue of the para teachers. Amid din and chaos, the treasury bench managed to get a few bills, including the supplementary demand for grants, cleared in the House.

As soon as the House assembled in the morning, it witnessed stormy scenes. Speaker Dinesh Oraon rejected a business adjournment motion moved by the opposition. He said a debate on the para teachers could be held during 'call attention', a motion for which was moved by some of legislators. Following this, opposition members began raising slogans accusing the government of being insensitive towards the para teachers.

Congress MLA Sukhdeo Bhagat alleged that the speaker and the government made a U-turn on the assurance given to the opposition during a business advisory council (BAC) meeting earlier. ""While chairing the BAC meeting on Monday, the speaker had said a special debate will be allowed. But when the opposition moved a business adjournment motion seeking a debate, the speaker turned it down,"" he said.

Bhagat added that apart from the issue of para teachers, there are other important issues such as the merger of schools that violated the students-teacher ratio and the death of more than 13 para teachers during the course of their agitation.

Refuting the opposition's allegations, BJP legislator Anant Ojha, who had moved a call attention motion, said the opposition parties were trying to run away from the debate. ""The opposition members are shedding crocodile tears on the issue of para teachers. If they wanted, they could have taken part in a debate under any provision suggested by the chair,"" he added.

JMM MLA Kunal Shadangi accused the government of deliberately ruining the education infrastructure to give space to private parties. CPI(ML)' Rajkumar Yadav alleged that the education minister Neera Yadav is trying to fool the para teachers. ""On one hand, the government issues ultimatums to para teachers, asking them to come to talks within 48 hours. On the other hand, the government doesn't say when and where a meeting on this issue would be called. Nor does it name the person who is authorised to convene it,"" Yadav said.

Congress's Badal Patralekh raised the issue of Shivlal Soren, a para teacher who has gone missing since November 15 after he was beaten up by police. ""Police are not still ready to lodge a missing persons complaint while the teacher's family is running around to find out where he is,"" he said.

The House could not have any discussion even though it met twice before and after lunch. In between, however, the government was able to table departmental resolutions from 2015 to 2017 for food and supply under the National Food Security scheme. It was also successful in getting approval of the House for a supplementary budget of Rs 1,117 crore and two bills, which included Technical University Establishment and GST Amendment. The Factory Act Amendment Bill, 2017 and the Wage Payment Amendment Bill, 2017 were recalled.

A few ruling party MLAs urged the government to be considerate towards the para teachers' demands. Two of them -- Vikas Singh Munda and Ramchandra Sahis -- took part in the para teachers' protest and sat on a dharna near the assembly gate. They tried to stop the chief minister and a few other members of the ministry from entering the assembly house for a few minutes. The chief minister and the ministers could enter the House after the marshalls interfered. Despite all this, the government remained unmoved over the para teachers' issue inside the House.

On Monday, the first of the current session, too, the assembly witnessed a similar chaotic situation."

Eight of these colleges do not even have land allocated for building. Most of these 55 colleges function out of few rooms in government schools.

Of the 81 government colleges opened in five years, 73 were new colleges, while eight were bifurcated. The bifurcation process includes opening separate colleges for science, commerce and art streams out of existing colleges.

Admissions to these colleges have taken place and classes are going on but the buildings of 47 colleges are under construction.

Several of colleges opened in the past five years run out of classrooms borrowed from nearby government schools, including the government colleges in Sri Dungargarh and Kolayat, Bikaner district. ""Two rooms have been allocated to us in the nearby school. Since the space is less, the classes are conducted in different batches,"" said Mahendra Rajput, a first year student of Government College, Sri Dungargarh.

""We haven't had any practical classes till now but the exams are starting on January 15. We don't even know where the exams would be held. They may make some temporary arrangement on the playground,"" he added.

Nearly 200 students have been admitted to Government College Sri Dungargarh that has six teachers, said GP Singh who was appointed the officer on duty when the college was opened.

Dr Digvijay Shekhawat, assistant director, college education (Bikaner Zone), said: ""Fifteen bighas of land was allotted for the college in Sri Dungargarhbut the funds for construction of the building have not been received. We received Rs 1.5 lakh for furniture and we will procure furniture worth Rs 10 lakh soon. Several faculties have joined the college recently. The classes are running smoothly,"" said Shekhawat.

Space for several bifurcated colleges is also uncertain. While three new colleges were opened in Kota division, two of the existing colleges were bifurcated. New government colleges were opened in Antah, Itawa and Kanwas which are still running out of nearby government schools.

""The arts college bifurcated out of JDB Girls' College, Kota, is yet to get clearance from the public works department (PWD) as several trees have to be cut down and demolitions have to be carried out for the same.

Land for the commerce college which is bifurcated out of the same college was allocated near the highway, where several 100-year-old trees have to be cut for the same. Moreover, a building that dates back to the British era exists on the land. Hence, construction of a college building there may be difficult,"" said Dr. Dinesh Tiwari, assistant director, college education, (Kota Zone).

Reacting to the present condition of the colleges opened under the BJP regime, party spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said: ""The BJP government opened new colleges heeding public demand. At some places the colleges are running out of different buildings but in most of the places, the colleges have enough space. For example, Poddar school in Jaipur had huge space and a college was opened in the same campus. The BJP government did better work in the education sector in five years than the previous Congress regime.""

Satyendra Singh Raghav, spokesperson of the Congress, said: ""The BJP government kept making new announcements and schemes but did not work on the ground. They did not check the condition of the schools and colleges or the schemes on ground."""

India's top intellectuals nominate the next generation. Here is their list of some of the brightest minds on the horizon.

Intellectuals are an essential component of an open society -- they bring their unique analytical insights to not only scrutinise the society in its immediate form but also help shape the ideas and ideologies of the future. They conduct research, deploy critical thinking, reason, teach, author books, challenge dogma and equip us with cognitive tools to engage with the world we inhabit -- just for the love of knowledge, or for the greater human good.

India has a rich and ancient tradition of producing such thinkers, teachers and philosophers who have contributed to the creation of new schools of thought that have travelled and established themselves far beyond Indian shores too. They have also passed on their learnings and discoveries to successive generations to preserve, innovate upon and further.

But who are the next generation of Indian intellectuals in the modern times we inhabit? The next Ramachandra Guha, the next Arvind Panagariya, the next Ashok Gulati, the next Raghuram Rajan, the next Makarand Paranjape, or the next Shashi Tharoor?

Over the last few months, ThePrint spoke to some of the biggest names in Indian intelligentsia and asked them who, in their opinion, are the brightest minds on the horizon -- in history, economics, sociology, political studies, law, strategic affairs, philosophy, public affairs, and inter-disciplinary studies, among others.

What follows is a long and impressive list of next-gen intellectuals who have begun to make a mark and given notice of their coming brilliance. Some of the nominees were directly mentored by the veterans who named them while the others are those whose work they track closely. This is by no means an exhaustive list and will be updated when more intellectuals respond to our requests.

Here's the list, in alphabetical order of the names of the nominators:

A trained sociologist and clinical psychologist, Nandy's area of expertise is the psychology of violence, the psychology of genocide and the future of ideas.

On his choices, Nandy said: ""All three have special relevance in the 150th year of Gandhi's birth.""

But he adds: Two warnings first. I am in my 80s now; I have seen four generations pass by. Those who look young to me do not look that young to others. Also, those in their 20s and 30s have not often got the chance to find themselves and to display their talent or promise. My own first book was published when I was in my 40s.""

His picks are:

Devji is professor of Indian history at St Antony's College, Oxford. He is an expert on modern Islamic studies and ethics, and violence in a globalised world.

RTD Ramesh Gandhi has challenged the constitutional validity of section 2(12) of Karnataka Universities Act-2000, stating that it excludes librarians and library staff from the definition of teachers by treating them differentially.

Ramesh, 60, who holds a PhD in library science, is due for retirement on December 31, 2018. He has also challenged the July 19, 2016 notification issued by UoM, prescribing 60 years as the age of retirement for librarians and library staff. The superannuation age of a teacher serving in a university is 62 while for librarians, it is 60. Vinayak B, counsel for the petitioner, argued that librarians guide PhD students, akin to the job of a teacher. An amendment bill, passed by both houses of Karnataka legislature in 2017 to treat librarians on a par with teachers, is awaiting the governor's assent, he said.

Authorities would not say how many children US Customs and Border Protection is now holding. But the country is seeing a sharp rise in families with children.

The deaths of two migrant children in just over two weeks raised strong new doubts Wednesday about the ability of US border authorities to care for the thousands of minors arriving as part of a surge of families trying to enter the country.

An 8-year-old boy identified by Guatemalan officials as Felipe Gomez Alonzo died in US custody at a New Mexico hospital on Christmas Eve after suffering a cough, vomiting and fever, authorities said. The cause is under investigation, as is the death Dec. 8 of another Guatemalan child, 7-year-old Jakelin Caal.

""There is a real failure here that we all need to reckon with,"" said incoming Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat elected last month to represent El Paso in Congress. ""We need to know how many other Jakelins and Felipes there have been.""

The US government's system for detaining migrants crossing the border is severely overtaxed. Authorities would not say how many children US Customs and Border Protection is now holding. But the country is seeing a sharp rise in families with children.

Advertising

In the wake of the two deaths, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen asked the Coast Guard to study CBP's medical programs and announced that all children who enter the agency's custody will be given ""more thorough"" assessments.

Also, border authorities said that they conducted health checks in reaction to Felipe's death on nearly all children in their custody. They did not disclose the results.

Nielsen blamed ""a system that prevents parents who bring their children on a dangerous illegal journey from facing consequences for their actions."" The Trump administration contends it must detain more people to discourage other Central American families from trying to enter the country.

Felipe had been detained by US border authorities for a week and moved between facilities with his father, officials said. The last place the boy was held _ after the first of two visits to the hospital on the day he died _ was a highway checkpoint in New Mexico.

Felipe's father, Agustin Gomez, did not see any signs of illness from his son until Monday, according to Guatemalan consul Oscar Padilla, who spoke to Gomez on Wednesday. Felipe and his father had left Guatemala on Dec. 14 and were detained at the U.S-Mexico border four days later, Padilla told The Associated Press.

By its own regulations, CBP is supposed to detain people for no more than 72 hours before turning them over to other government agencies responsible for long-term detention. CBP facilities are typically spartan, with food, water and blankets but often no medical professionals, teachers or some of the other resources longer-term detention centers offer.

Similarly, Jakelin was first held with her father at a small base in rural New Mexico that did not have running water, according to Democrats who visited it after the girl's death.

Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who sits on a key subcommittee overseeing border funding, said he has pushed to fund more alternatives to detention such as ankle monitors, which he said could have been issued to Felipe's father.

He said the Trump administration has prioritized the president's border wall _ the subject of the partial government shutdown since last week _ over investing in CBP checkpoints that have long needed attention.

""They're not set up to hold people for a long time,"" Cuellar said. ""There's so much money that the wall sucks up that it's hard to address some of the other issues. I wish the administration would understand that.""

CBP said it is reviewing all available options to relieve overcrowding in the El Paso sector, where Felipe and his father were apprehended. The agency also said it has reached out to other government agencies for ""surge medical assistance.""

CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said in the agency's defense that CBP has more than 1,500 emergency medical technicians on staff and that officers are taking dozens of sick children to hospitals every day.

""This is an extraordinarily rare occurrence,"" McAleenan told ""CBS This Morning"" of the two child deaths. ""It's been more than a decade since we've had a child pass away anywhere in a CBP process, so this is just devastating for us.""

It's not uncommon for families in El Paso these days to spend more than a week in holding cells just as Felipe and his father did, said Ruben Garcia, director of El Paso's Annunciation House shelter.

Those problems predate the Trump administration. During a 2014 surge at the border, some families were put in holding cells for up to 20 days before being released, Garcia said.

Homeland Security's inspector general examined nine CBP holding facilities earlier this year. In a September report, the inspector general said that the facilities complied with CBP standards and that people had access to food and water, toilets and sinks, and hygiene items _ with ""the exception of inconsistent cleanliness of the hold rooms.""

Just three of the nine facilities had ""trained medical staff to conduct medical screening and provide basic medical care,"" the report said. And showers were available for unaccompanied children at only four facilities.

Felipe and his father were taken to two of the facilities the inspector general examined: the processing center at the Paso del Norte port of entry, then the El Paso Border Patrol station.

But just after 1 a.m. Sunday, the two were transferred 90 miles (145 kilometers) to the Border Patrol station at Alamogordo, New Mexico. CBP said it moved them ""because of capacity levels"" in El Paso. The next day, a border agent noticed Felipe was coughing and had ""glossy eyes,"" and sent him to the hospital, the CBP said.

""I can't think of any logical reason that would happen, for the most vulnerable of children to be sent to a remote area,"" Escobar said.

According to CBP statistics, border agents detained 5,283 children unaccompanied by a parent in November alone. Agents last month also apprehended 25,172 ""family units,"" or parents and children together. Both figures are highs for this year.

Children who arrive unaccompanied by a parent are supposed to go to longer-term facilities operated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. But HHS' system is also strained. The Associated Press reported this month that 14,300 children were being detained by HHS, most in facilities with more than 100 kids."

Nagpur education officials had called hundreds of excess teachers to the hall where large screens displayed vacant teaching posts one by one.

GST refund glitches, refusal of the state to refund 42 per cent share of the Central incentives pertaining to the pre-GST period, stalemate in the land acquisition for major infrastructure development projects like four-laning of the Baddi-Nalagarh highway and rail connectivity has left the investors disappointed.

The only silver-lining is that the state gets top ranking nationally in the ease of doing business initiative in the fast-moving category. Its overall ranking has improved to 16th as against 17th attained last year. No new industrial unit has been set up due to the locational disadvantage and little has been done to break the monopoly of transport unions whose freight is among the highest in the country. The Pandoga industrial area in Una district has found no takers and little could be done to revive the case of seeking environmental clearance of 515 bigha land at Dhabota in Nalagarh where new industrial area is proposed.

The much-awaited bulk drug park, announced by the Union Chemical and Fertilisers Minister in April 2016, is yet to receive funds for developing the 663.11 bigha site at Aduwal village in Nalagarh. Efforts to set up a cement plant at Churah subdivision of Chamba district have failed to yield results. The government has again announced an investor meet, albeit with a difference, where the Chief Minister is slated to lead a host of senior officials within the country and abroad to attract investment.

The Mukhya Mantri Swavlamban Yojana, which fetches 25 per cent investment subsidy with a ceiling of Rs 40 lakh in plant and machinery and an interest subsidy of 5 per cent for three years, was introduced in May to promote employment. As many as 793 proposals were forwarded to the banks but barely 36 were sanctioned and funds worth Rs 7.88 crore were disbursed which speak volumes about its lack of popularity. Limited success is received under the ambitious 'Start-Up Himachal' scheme with barely 40 start-ups having received financial assistance.

The state was,however, rated as ""Hill State leader and an aspiring leader in developing an enabling start-up ecosystem"" nationally. The 5-year Central Capital Investment Incentive for access to credit at 30 per cent for plant and machinery announced for the micro, small and medium enterprises is the lone new Central scheme which brought some cheer to the existing units.

Students without uniform, scholarship

It was a challenging year for the government in the education sector as it grappled with downtrend in enrollment and filling of vacancies while facing stiff resistance from teacher unions in its bid to bring qualitative improvement in education.

The scholarship scam of Rs 250 crore was unearthed in the Education Department and preliminary investigations revealed that the tentacles of the scam spread to other states also. The government has now handed over the investigations to the CBI. The department remained under the scanner of the High Court which monitored the measures taken by government to fill vacant posts.

The regularisation of teacher has not been done since 2008 and resentment was brewing among teachers as a large number of teachers retired without getting promotion. The government closed 100 elementary schools with less than 10 students and proposed the merger or closure of more than 400 elementary schools.

Efforts were made to get the best from teachers as annual increment of 38 PGTs were stopped for less than 25 per cent results in Class XII board examinations. To arrest the flight of students to private schools, the government introduced pre-primary (Nursery) classes in 3,391 schools on a pilot basis from the coming session and so far, 30,000 students have been registered. The enrollment in government schools has dropped by 23.7 per cent in past 10 years.

Under pressure from student unions, the government took a retrograde step to revert to annual system from semester system under RUSA while the cluster university, which was set up at Mandi, is yet to be functional.

The government failed to provide free uniforms to students of government schools from Class I to Class XII under the Atal Vardi Yojana.

The government tried to lure power producers by offering sops like deferring 12 free power royalty and other measures. Yet the exit of power producers continued as there was no takers for most of the projects in the Chandra basin in Lahaul-Spiti.

Even as there was marginal increase in revenue from power to Rs 1,100 crore as compared to Rs 950 crore last year, yet the state failed to add even a single megawatt to its existing capacity. The government tried to lure power producers by offering sops like deferring 12 free power royalty and other measures. Yet the exit of power producers continued as there was no takers for most of the projects in the Chandra basin in Lahaul-Spiti. There was complete lack of interest in the 1000 MW solar energy projects in Spiti as the HP State Transmission Corporation failed to lay the transmission line to evacuate power from the region.

The Directorate of Energy allotted just two projects - the jinxed 780 MW Jangi Thopan to the SJVNL and the 447 MW Dugar in 2018.

No effort was made to store over rain water in the monsoon on the Giri, Dharampur khud, both tributaries of the Yamuna, that goes waste every year as Shimla and Solan continue to face water shortage.

Private power producers cited high cost of power generation and lack of infrastructure like roads and transmission lines as the main reasons for not showing interest in the projects.The existing power companies had to resort to shutdown of powerhouses owing to the high level of silt. As a result, power companies and state suffered losses due to the frequent shutdown, while the consumers faced power cuts and water problems for hours during the shutdown.

Caught in debt trap

With the debt mounting to almost Rs 50,000 crore, the poor financial health of the state remained the biggest challenge before the BJP regime in its first year in office.

The absence of major revenue generation and limited Central funding under various schemes prevented the Jai Ram government from undertaking any major schemes. Most big projects and schemes are being implemented through Central funding.

Even as the Congress cried hoarse about the poor fiscal management, the BJP regime raised loans to the tune of Rs 2,500 crore against a limit of Rs 7,600 crore. The salary component of almost 2 lakh government employees is Rs 11,000 crore while the pensionary burden is to the tune of Rs 6,000 crore annually. A sum of Rs 4,300 crore will have to be paid as interest on loans during the financial year 2018-19.

The biggest area of concern is the extra spending on recruitment, besides upgrade and opening of new health and educational institutions. The only silver-lining is the hike in revenue from the power sector from Rs 750 crore in 2017-18 to Rs 10,500 crore.

The biggest challenge before the CM, who holds the Finance Department, is generating resources for which the government is eying power, tourism, industry and mining."

Faisal, Sub Inspector at Aluva East, will convey quite a lot, thanks to his prowess in drawing one minute-caricatures.

Before recruitment to the police put baton in his hands in 2014, it was pencil that the 42-year-old from Nellikkuzhi in Kothamangalam wielded; and with quite some relish.

His passion for caricatures dates back to school days when he drew caricatures of friends and even teachers for fun. That love affair got a lot more intense when he progressed to college.

""Political cartoons were my favourites and I obsessively followed cartoons in newspapers by noted cartoonists such as Kesav, Yesudas, Gafoor and Gopikrishnan,"" recollected Mr. Faisal.

He never learned the art professionally though continued drawing caricatures during his graduation days at MA College in Kothamangalam.

However, it was while doing LLB at Government Law College, Ernakulam, that he won recognition for his skill, as he landed second prize in the Mahatma Gandhi University arts fest.

And his caricatures were featured in the college magazine as well.

For someone who started with caricatures of late Congress leader K. Karunakaran and finds former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as one of the easiest subjects, the uniformed job has forced self-imposed shackles on his creativity, especially with political cartoons for obvious reasons.

Nowadays, Mr. Faisal puts his skill to use in job-related assignments, especially at awareness classes being held for students.

""Caricatures can bring about much needed relief to students from the monotony of lectures. Apart from drawing their attention, caricatures will also help drive home the message much more effectively. For instance, while explaining the legality of public drinking, a caricature on the topic can convey it with a lot more impact than unending lectures,"" said Mr. Faisal.

He has been doing that in Kannur, Thalassery and Panoor where his job had taken him over the years thus keeping his passion alive."

In the bureaucratic reshuffle that was carried out by the Ashok Gehlot government last week, were those in charge of education touched? Rajasthan has, over the last four years, become a symbol of ""New India'', both in its changes in school curriculum and in the number of lynching incidents it has seen (seven since 2015).

In May 2016, when Jawaharlal Nehru's name was dropped from Class VIII textbooks in the state, both as our first prime minister and as a prominent leader of our freedom struggle, Gehlot and Sachin Pilot were quick to lash out at Vasundhara Raje's government.

But criticising is easy. Actually undoing what you decry while in the Opposition, requires political will and hard work. Add to that the Congress' apathy towards ideological issues such as the content of school education. So, in 2004, then HRD minister, Arjun Singh, took his own sweet time to change the NCERT texts introduced by his predecessor Murli Manohar Joshi, an RSS member.

These texts taught impressionable teenagers that Muslims sided with the British and barely contributed to the freedom struggle. However, in one CBSE school in Mumbai, the history teacher actually contradicted the text to tell her students that all communities contributed to the freedom struggle. But there may not be too many such teachers in Rajasthan. A recent report in the New York Review of Books quotes a Bohra Muslim teacher in Udaipur dismissing the Mughal-era in class, going along with the new history textbook.

Advertising

Hopefully, it will not take Gehlot and Pilot that long to withdraw these texts. The inconvenience caused by changing textbooks in the middle of the academic year would be far less damaging to students than the lies they are being forced to study. Even one more term to let school children learn that Maharana Pratap defeated Akbar at Haldighati; pre-Independence Congress leaders had no connect with the people; and how Nehru was just a footnote in our history, is one term too long.

In 2004, it was at the end of the academic year that the Sonia Gandhi-led UPA defeated the Vajpayee-led NDA, presenting the ideal opportunity to change school texts. Yet, Arjun Singh used the excuse that sufficient stocks of current texts were already there, to not effect an immediate change.

The same lethargy towards righting what is obviously wrong with Rajasthan's police, was on display in l'affaire Naseeruddin Shah. The organisers of the Ajmer Lit Fest said they had alerted the police. Yet, goons could enter the venue and throw ink on the actor's picture. Instead of caving in after that and telling Shah not to come, why couldn't the organisers have delayed the proceedings till the cops removed these vandals from the venue and provided security for the rest of the day? In this Twitter age, surely the CM and deputy CM could have been alerted immediately?

We don't know the entire story. What we do know is that the Hindutva goons had their way, with the knowledge of the police. The change in regime didn't seem to matter to either them or the police. Mumbaikars are familiar with this behaviour: Whoever rules Maharashtra, no policeman touches the Thackerays. The next day, five BJP workers were arrested in Ajmer, but under preventive detention, a law normally used before someone commits a crime.

This year, Rajasthan was ranked number three by Amnesty International in their state-wise hate crime list. The lynching of dairy farmer Pehlu Khan and the hacking of Bengali labourer Muhammad Afrazul -- incidents which shook us all -- took place in Rajasthan. The police exonerated all six named by Pehlu Khan in his dying declaration, and booked his two companions for cow smuggling. Did any of this matter when the new government transferred 17 IPS officers last week, including its senior most police officer?

Two days after being appointed Deputy CM, Pilot told a news portal that the ""atmosphere of mob lynching and cow vigilantism has to be curbed immediately... (it's) important to give people a semblance of normalcy and brotherhood in society that we have always had.'' To achieve this, changing the police is important; but equally important is changing textbooks."

Later, the schools were closed by the administration and the children went back to their homes. FIRs were being registered till the time of filing of this report.

Angered by stray cattle roaming around in their villages and damaging crops, residents of Mohakampur in Iglas, Kaser Gangiri in Atrauli and a few other blocks of the district locked up around 800 animals in schools. Protests against the stray cattle menace have been happening in Aligarh for the past three days. Stray animals were even locked up inside a primary health centre.

Sonia Verma, a teacher in one of the primary schools which was closed said, ""We are facing a lot of problems as classes are being disrupted and students are feeling insecure due to the prevailing atmosphere. The school compound has also become dirty. We don't know when this issue will be resolved, but we have informed our seniors.""

An emergency meeting was called by district magistrate CB Singh, which was attended by police officers, pradhans of the villages and the education officer. The DM directed pradhans to control the situation and prevent residents from resorting to such measures. ""These incidents are unusual and seem to be politically motivated. FIRs will be lodged against people responsible for this,"" Singh added.

Following the meeting, basic shiksha adhikari (BSA) Dr Laxmikant Pandey issued a letter to all block education officers (BEO) and asked them to direct teachers of primary and upper primary schools to make video clippings of those people who herded stray cows into schools and provide the clippings to the police station concerned with a complaint.

The Supreme Court of India did what had to be done a long time ago by decriminalising section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. A vestige of India's British history, section 377 could have been used against the LGBT community since it criminalises ""unnatural"" sex. So when it was struck down, the event became a watershed moment in the queer history of India. The year 2018 was indeed special for the community. But India wasn't alone in its celebration. The year 2018 saw many such encouraging developments that boded well for the LGBTQ community.

In January 2018, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ordered that the Latin American countries make gay marriages legal. Sixteen countries Barbados, Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Surinam were directed by the court order. A seven-judge panel stated that same-sex couples should be treated without discrimination in these countries. The ruling went out to become the biggest marriage equality court order in human history.

In April 2018, the Trinidad and Tobago government decriminalised same-sex sexual activities in a landmark judgement. The verdict was passed after an LGBTQ activist Jason Jones won filed a lawsuit to repeal sections 13 and 16 under the Trinidadian Sexual Offenses Act called the ""buggery law."" Justice Devindra Rampersad who ruled in favour of the lawsuit said that the law is unconstitutional since it impedes gay men's rights to sex.

The LGBTQ community has faced a lot of antagonism from the religious conservatives. But in 2018, churches came forward in their acceptance of same-sex marriages. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria, Evangelical Church of Hesse Electorate-Waldeck, United Methodist Church and Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia allowed the blessing of same-sex marriages. The Church of Scotland also voted in favour of drafting new church law to accommodate gay marriage. LGBT Pride Month 2018: A Glossary of Terms Associated With the LGBTQ Community.

The World Health Organization make an announcement in June that it will no longer treat gender incongruence or transgenderism as a mental disorder. For the longest time, International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems considered Transgender identity as a mental problem. But as of 2018, it's no longer classified as a deviancy. Instead, it is now considered a sexual health condition, which helps healthcare systems offer healthcare needs with respect to the person's gender instead of biology.

While #MeToo is known mostly for the stories of women's abuse, some gay and lesbian personalities also came out with stories of sexual harassment. One of the most notable people who was implicated include actor Kevin Spacey. The viral hashtag #MeQueer was used by many on the social media platform to share their experiences of abuse and discrimination. Many of these were stories from the queer community, highlighting the inhuman treatment they received from parents, teachers, peers and the society at large, on account of their sexuality."

No point crying over spilt milk, but there could be some when spilt juice is involved. To avoid getting an earful from his mother over some juice he spilled, 10-year-old Arman Gupta invented the ""Mopping Machine"", a remote-controlled cleaning device for wet surfaces.

With detachable sponges, the machine can be customised for different surfaces -- the floor, under the table, and corners. The Class 5 student become the youngest innovator to showcase his creation at Somaiya Research Innovation Incubation Design Laboratory (RIIDL's) 'Maker Mela' in January this year.

India will have the world's largest rural population by 2050, and Dr Priyanjali Datta's Aaroogya is democratising preventive healthcare to combat breast cancer to the last mile. The team identifies a ""vulnerable location"" and chooses a village based on availability and access to primary healthcare facilities.

Priyanjali's team comprises doctors and volunteers who go door to door and visit every family in a village. They speak to women about the disease, teach them breast self-examination, and also clinically examine them. The bootstrapped organisation has helped 500,000 women across Delhi-NCR region, Haryana, and North Eastern states, including West Bengal.

Mohd Sujathullah, a student at Sultan Ul Uloom College of Pharmacy, distributes free food to 1,000 people every day outside Koti Maternity Hospital and Nilofer Children's Hospital, Hyderabad. Sujathullah wakes up early and leaves his house at around 7.30 am every morning for Koti Maternity Hospital where 300 poor patients have already queued up and are waiting for a meal.

Within 15 minutes, he, along with a volunteer or two, finishes distributing hot upma to them and proceeds to his next destination. At Nilofer Children's Hospital, another 700 people on an average are waiting to get their breakfast. For 485 days now, this routine has become a part of his daily schedule. Irrespective of bad weather, poor health, or other reasons, he does not fail to show up at both locations every morning.

Rohim Momin, an orphan, school dropout, and the sole breadwinner of his family, migrated to Delhi from his village in Malda, West Bengal, and joined the construction labour force. His determination to earn a better livelihood and secure his three younger sisters' future drove him to go beyond manual labour.

He sought to get skill training and refine his bricklaying capabilities and went on to represent India at the World Skills Competition in Abu Dhabi. Rohim went on to win a 'Medallion of Excellence,' and the fifth position. Through his work and training, Rohim hopes to spread the message that laborious work can help propel the country's economy forward.

In today's fast-paced, highly digitalised world, some humane ideas have ensured that stray animals - often found hurting, homeless, and overlooked - are not left behind. Let It Wag is an app that connects animal lovers and caregivers across India so that strays get the medical attention they need in real time.

""Let it Wag is like 911 for animals. The whole idea is to get all stakeholders on one platform, and simplify and improve the turnaround time for rescuing animals,"" says Yash Sheth, the 27-year-old Founder of this mobile application.

Within 100 days of its launch, Yash has started seeing the change he envisioned. With over 4,000-plus users on their Android app and through volunteers, the team has helped 215 dogs, 15 cats, 3 owls, and 12 pigeons in trouble. Two puppies have been adopted, Yash says.

Founded by 24-year-old social entrepreneur Abhishek Dubey, Muskaan Dreams is a unique education initiative that is currently operating in three cities of Madhya Pradesh - Gwalior, Bhopal, and Indore. The startup tries to solve the problem of insufficient teachers in rural government schools through e-learning (self-learning) classrooms for students.

The virtual classrooms allow students to easily learn anything related to their subjects. The social startup uses LED screens in order to ensure sustainability. Abhishek began teaching and mentoring 70 children on weekends in the orphanages of Gwalior with 20 volunteers before he founded Muskaan Dream Creative Foundation. In the last four years, Muskaan Dreams has reached out to over 5,000 students in rural India through different initiatives."

It analysed the school budget of the following states - Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.

The study pointed out that despite increased financial allocation for education under the 14th Finance Commission, there has been no proper utilisation to change the school's education spending composition. Thus, the under-spending of the money has led to poorly qualified teachers and required infrastructure. This lack of competent teachers was filled in by recruiting under-qualified and contractual teachers.

The Report of the Expert Panel was delivered to Prime Minister Turnbull on 18 May, 2018 following a two month consultation period. Upon receipt of the Report, Prime Minister Turnbull commented: ""I look forward to considering the report in detail and will consult with members of the Government before releasing it to the public and responding to its findings.""

On 12 October 2018 Fairfax Media leaked the Report.

The Government released the Report, and it's response, on 13 December 2018.

The Fairfax Media report contained 20 recommendations, however, the recommendations that garnered the most media coverage and sparked the fiercest debate are recommendations 5 and 7.

These recommendations suggest the amendment of Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) to allow religious schools to, respectively, ""discriminate in relation to the employment of staff, and the engagement of contractors"" and ""in relation to a student basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or relationship status"". However, the recommendation provides that ""the discrimination is grounded in the precepts of the religion"" and that the school policy on the issue is made publically available, provided to current and prospective employees contractors, and students. Recommendation 7, which relates to discrimination in relation to student, also states that the discrimination may take place provided that ""The school has regard to the best interests of the child as the primary consideration in its conduct.""

Academics Liam Elphick, Amy Maguire and Anja Hilkemeijer have commented that ""Much of the immediate reaction to the leaks incorrectly claimed that the recommendations would grant such a right for the first time"", which is not the case.

Currently, section 38 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) permits educational institutions established for religious purposes to ""discriminate against another person on the ground of the other person's sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital or relationship status or pregnancy in connection with..."":

However, for the discrimination to be lawful, the education institution must ""discriminate in good faith in order to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents of that religion or creed.""

Elphick, Maguire and Hilkemeijer have explained that the additional limitations contained in recommendations 5 and 7 would actually ""constrain this existing right to discriminate"".

While the right of faith-based schools to discriminate on the basis of ""sexual orientation, gender identity or relationship status"" has been enshrined in legislation for some time, the release of the recommendations by Fairfax seems to made many more people aware of the fact, and sparked debate on the legitimacy of such an anti-discrimination exemption.

The exemptions ""that enabled faith-based schools to discriminate against teachers, contractors students and so forth"" were actually introduced in 2013 by the Gillard Labor Government. The current Labor leader, Bill Shorten, has voiced support for repealing the existing exemptions, stating: ""It's time our laws reflected the values we teach our children."" The Liberal Party, on the other hand, appear to be "" split"" on their stance to the current exemptions.

In an address given following the publication of the recommendations, the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney, Dr Glenn Davies, argued for the right of ""religious organisations... to operate according to their religious ethos"", explaining that he believed that ""Anglican schools, if they are going to remain Anglican, must be able to employ staff who support the Christian values of the school"". However, he stated: ""Let's be very clear. Anglican schools in Sydney do not expel students for being gay.""

While the Expert Panel's Report, and the Government's response, were not released until 13 December 2018, in the final sitting days of Parliament in early December, the Government tabled proposed amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act that, in its view, ""would have removed discrimination against students while also protecting religious schools' ability to maintain their ethos"". However, the proposed amendments did not have the support of the Opposition, and no new legislation was enacted.

In its official reply to the Report, the Government responded to recommendations 5 and 7 as follows:

While noting and agreeing with the principle underpinning the... recommendations ..., the government is of the view that further consideration is necessary to address the complexities associated with these recommendations.

In particular, the Government:

will consult with the States and Territories on the terms of a potential reference to the ALRC [Australian Law Reform Commission] to consider [the] recommendations 1 and 5 to 8 of the Review with a view to settling upon a legislative mechanism that would, on a nationally consistent basis, achieve the twin purposes of limiting or removing altogether (if practicable) legislative exemptions to prohibitions on discrimination based on a person's identity, while also protecting the right of religious institutions to reasonably conduct themselves in a way consistent with their religious ethos.

We will keep you abreast of future developments in this area, and in particular any proposed amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act flowing from the Report."

Teachers headed for battle with 'undemocratic' VC

The administrative regime is simply following the government's policy of rampant privatisation of public resources. Such a process is anti-democratic in its imagination and punitive in approach.

Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) is now in a new phase of life. Known as 'comply or perish' to us insiders, not a day passes without the administration issuing some circular demanding ""compliance"" from the faculty or students of the university.

Since most of these demands range from the absurd to the counterproductive, like enforcing students and faculty attendance or arbitrarily rescheduling the academic calendar, most do not comply. Often the faculty, after protracted discussions in the general body meetings of the teachers association, resorts to different modes of protesting this compliance enforcement raj. These protests are then promptly followed by threats and punitive action meant to ""discipline"" the 'non-compliant' - much in the fashion of bullies and thugs. These range from petty and vindictive methods - like docking leave and not processing medical papers - to issuing legal instruments like show-cause notices.

Legal threats are usually issued to just a few, perhaps with the aim of frightening the many. More importantly, issuing more than 150 notices at any given time also exposes the well-known fact that most in the university are opposed to the administration and find laughable the constant threat of disciplinary action against those who refuse to cow down. Those not in JNU or any other university in the country do not immediately understand what is being undertaken here.

Some even wonder why the JNU faculty and students seem to continuously be in protest mode. There are two ways of responding to this. Let's begin with the counterfactual.

Why did the university not witness this kind of anti-administration protest prior to February 2016? The answer is simple: because such anti-academic and anti-university measures had never been attempted by the administration prior to 2016. The present VC and his administrative coterie are not simply undoing every functioning structure of JNU, they are vandalising the idea of the university.

Here, the second reason to understand JNU's protests becomes important. The faculty has consistently stated that the changes being made to the university's structure are not only unnecessary, but also in repeated violation of ordinances and the very Act of parliament that created it. The ongoing protests demonstrate the present administration's consummate disregard for democratic procedures and well-established conventions, which is deeply injurious to every aspect of the university.

Why are the demands - be it marking of daily attendance (soon to be biometric) or online entrance examinations, followed by threats and punishments exemplifying the worst kinds of managerial practices?

The answer, once again, is obvious. Privatising a public university requires that its very character be changed completely. JNU was created as a research university in 1970, and has always maintained a very special character. It has provided a very high standard of higher education to students from different regions of India, belonging to any social or economic strata, at minimal cost.

The decades following its creation saw at least two kinds of developments in the university. One was a very high quality of research output, both of the faculty and of young researchers. This also helped in creating many generations of teachers who are presently employed in colleges and universities in India and abroad.

The other was an organic emergence of an extraordinary university culture that synthesised the intellectual and the political - enabling students not only to find their feet as scholars, but also articulate their selfhood as citizens. Students in JNU have historically debated everything from American imperialism, the many failures of the Indian state, to what the university itself ought to be.

The ability to knit this criticality into the very fibre of the university, by creating a space for student engagement in institutional processes (through department level student-faculty committees, or students union representation in boards of study or the Academic Council meetings), is what made JNU a truly democratic university.

The new tightly-managed and privatised university will not have space for any of this. We can already get glimpses of this in numerous such universities that have mushroomed all over the country. At the outset, they have a prohibitive fee structure that will keep out hundreds of brilliant, though poor and marginalised students, for whom higher education will become unaffordable.

Even ordinary middle class families will not be able to afford such an education. Besides, many new private universities have a biometric attendance system in place; they also do not permit any of its members - faculty, students or the non-teaching staff - to form unions. Contract structures are also beginning to reflect how the private is different from the public - at its most worrying, differential pay scales are being put in place - which will eventually create salary-driven divisions between colleagues appointed at the same level. This will also occur between Indians and non-Indian faculty.

The carrot usually dangled in front of the faculty is that they will have the space to create their own courses. For those of us quite used to doing so for decades in a public university like JNU, the stick that accompanies this privilege seems more like a police baton.

Inherent violence in government-led privatisation of public resources

The present administrative regime is simply following the current government's policy of rampant privatisation of public resources. Such a process is perforce managerial and anti-democratic in its imagination. The JNU instance makes clear that compliance enforcement and punitive measures are knitted into its very approach.

The only unexpected element in this is how JNU's university community - its students and faculty - have resisted all attempts at this wanton destruction of a nationally important public institution. They have not succumbed to the management's speak of becoming ""stakeholders""; they know what the stakes are, and continue to fight back as a community of scholars.

The battle for JNU's survival matters not only to those who work or study there - it has grave implications for the intellectual and political future of the country. Public higher education is a democratic right of all Indians. It is precisely for this reason that all who care about India's future, and wish to make it safe from ugly corporatisation or bigoted cultural agendas, must fight for the survival of the public university."

Provision of schools does not guarantee the availability of necessary facilities in schools. The gap is still wide when compared to the enrolment of children in the school and learning outcome.

Captain Indraani Singh, Founder, and CEO, Literacy India talks about online education in India, technological advancements and Literacy India helping out students with the educational program.

How can online education transform the Indian education sector?

Education in India is a dire need to help reduce unemployment and increase economic activity in the country. The setting up of physical schools is a time taking and expensive process, thereby slowing down the pace of eradicating education gap. While online education helps to reach more students in the least amount of time and is not expensive either. Therefore, online education can increase the speed of education in our country where digitization is spreading rapidly as well.

Besides, online learning enables students to engage with the subject matter, interact with course videos and learn at their own pace, which also reduces dropouts as its more engaging, interesting and makes students more familiar with using computers. On the other hand, it allows teachers to assign, monitor and evaluate coursework remotely, apart from highlighting the areas of students which need improvement.

How does Literacy India help drop-out students in the transition to education?

Literacy India's technology-enabled remedial education program Gyantantra Udbhav has helped mainstream thousands of drop-out students. The program essentially enables these drop-out students who do not respond well to the confines of traditional classrooms and experience lack of access to education. The education program combines practical, intellectual and social attributes to create composite learning modules to help students complete school curriculum till Class 5. Embedded with an interactive multimedia interface, the modules are designed with a systematic instructional approach that makes learning fun, even for those who lack basic reading and writing skills. The tool tracks minimum levels of learning based on assessments and outcomes. Once students complete the program, they are eligible to join any other government school.

How AI is being used in the system?

Gyantantra Udbhav is an interactive multimedia interface, which includes modules designed with a systematic instructional approach that makes learning fun, even for those who lack basic reading and writing skills. The tool tracks minimum levels of learning based on assessments and outcomes. It leverages gaming technology embedded with cartoon characters thereby ensuring effective retention of the information. As such the program is customized to bridge the learning gap which is of common existence among this set of children, who either are out-of-school or in-school children faltering on fundamental concepts. Understandably, technology and innovation with its various verticals such as IoT and AI have the ability to ably support the education mediums and increase efficiency and productivity of those involved like these children. Thus, it is with the integration of such new age technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning or virtual reality that the learning experience will be more interactive and personalized thereby enhancing and improving access to education and learning.

Can technology improve engagement and result in better learning outcomes?

The most obvious benefit of technology run education is that it is subjective to the learner's ability and level. Through virtual interactive engagement, it teaches students with different speeds depending on their backgrounds and more importantly different starting points. Also, technological education platform is cost-effective and time-efficient and is flexible to the needs of every single student -- be it on-the-go, class of one, on-demand, gamified or crowdsourced.

How can online education impact India's education and development landscape?

Education is an important part of a country's growth and development. It is not only about employment but also empowerment. Education serves as the front-runner in transforming the society, economy, and polity for better. Accompanied with technological advancements, that is online education, is then a game changer for a nation like India, which has an enormous population, with approximately 28 percent of children in the age group 0-14. Gyantantra program has been conceived to meet these very needs of the country, that is mass education and creating awareness about social and economic identity in a world marked by technological innovation. Ultimately, the future of education is to converge into the India's new economy, which notably is fast on track to digitization. Online learning is then a natural step for the future generations and workforce in order to survive future technological disruptions."

As many as 13 schools have recorded zero enrolment, while another 171 schools have fewer than 20 students. A total of 1,140 schools have fewer than 40 students.

These were the details furnished by the state in 2017-18 to the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), a database about schools in India, developed at the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA). According to officials, the reason for the low enrolment is parents' preference to private schools due to lack of infrastructure, teacher absenteeism, and poor quality education in government schools, among others.

This is in addition to 1,773 schools without buildings, which the government plans to merge with nearby schools with infrastructure. The merger plan comes after the state failed to land for the 1,773 schools. Most of these schools have been merged. Of them, 190 schools in Patna district alone.

The enrolment in government schools dropped to 1.8 crore in 2017-18 from 1.99 crore in 2016-17. The number is expected to drop further when fresh data is examined, diluting the government claim of more than 99% enrolment.

The most alarming trend reflected through U-DISE is that the dropout rate from Class 9 to Class 10- almost 25% of the total enrollment in 2014-15, which jumped to 39.73% in 2016-17, the period when there was unprecedented increase in the number of students failing in Bihar class 10 and 12 board exams.

One of the reasons for the drop, authorities admitted, is parents' preference for private schools for better education and infrastructure.

""If the incentives (such as scholarships, bicycles) attached with government schools are removed, the number will drop further. Many students get admitted to government schools to avail incentives but study in private schools. In 2011, when reports on inflated enrolments surfaced, it created a flutter,"" an education department official added.

Three years ago, the then principal secretary, department of education, Amarjeet Sinha, had said the duplication of enrolment in government schools could be up to 20%.

Bihar Education Project Council (BSEPC) director Sanjay Singh, however, said that the drop in students' number was due to government's drive to do away with duplication in enrolment. ""The number children availing mid-day meal has come down to 1.20 crore compare to previous years,"" he added.

Singh said that the sanctity of data was being maintained. ""Earlier, there was no data on private schools. Now, that is also being prepared. Around 12 lakh more students have joined private schools, not necessarily because they have suddenly opened, but because they are being documented,"" he added.

Singh said under the Right to Education Act, there should be a school within a kilometre for Class 1-5 students provided there are a minimum of 40 students. ""If that is not the case, teachers can be used elsewhere more effectively. Having 3-4 teachers for fewer than 40 children is not relevant,"" he said, adding he would do another appraisal in January after studying the reasons and reports of physical verification."

Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were part of the study.

Overall, the study revealed that there is a shortage of five lakh elementary school teachers in these states, while 14 per cent of government secondary schools do not meet the mandatory minimum number of six teachers.

Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra were the best performers in filling up teaching posts, recruiting about 95 per cent of the sanctioned strength at their elementary schools.

On the other hand, Bihar was found to have the greatest proportion of untrained teachers at the elementary as well as the secondary school levels, with West Bengal emerging as the runner-up in the metric.

38.7 per cent and 35.1 per cent of Bihar's teachers were found to be professionally unqualified at the elementary and secondary levels respectively. In case of West Bengal, 35.1 per cent of its primary teachers and 23.9 per cent of its secondary teachers are untrained.

A two-day conference and EXPO on 'Advancing Implementation of Green Chemistry and Engineering in the Indian Pharma Industry' was recently organised by Green ChemisTree Foundation in collaboration with the ACS-Green Chemistry Institute's Pharmaceutical Roundtable (GCIPR) in Hyderabad.

The main objectives of the conference were to provide subject-specific interactions on topics pertinent for green chemistry and engineering (GC&E) integration in the pharma API industry and to facilitate learning of green chemistry implementation strategies and practices from successful case studies.

The conference was attended by over 200 senior representatives from industry, solution providers, government bodies, regulatory agencies, industry associations and media. Scientists from Hetero Research Foundation, GVK Biosciences, Laurus Labs and Natco Pharma attended the one-on-one meetings.

The conference was organised in collaboration with ACS-Green Chemistry Institute's Pharmaceutical Roundtable (GCIPR); and supported by Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB). Companies including Bristol Myers Squibb India, Laurus Labs, Hikal, Natco Pharma, GVK Biosciences and Pfizer India Healthcare served as industry partners. The Bulk Drug Manufacturers Association of India (BDMA), PHARMEXCIL, and Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) supported the Conference as Associate Partners, whereas the Research and Innovation Circle of Hyderabad (RICH) was on-board for the first time to serve as the Knowledge Partner to the conference. Continuing the strong support and active involvement of past years, Express Pharma continued was one of the conference media partners this year as well.

While a Pharma Leadership Summit and workshop on bio-catalysis was held on the first day, the second day had the GCIPR workshop on Essential Tools & Techniques and a seminar on Ready-to-Implement Tools, Technologies & Solutions. The structure and content of the conference provided a conducive platform for solution provider companies to engage in focussed interactions with the industry participants across the two days.

The conference was inaugurated and attended by senior representatives from pharma industry, industry associations, government and regulatory bodies including Telangana and Andhra State Pollution Control Boards. Their presence indicated their endorsement of GC&E practices while their messages to the audience emphasised the role of each stakeholder towards accelerating GC&E implementation in Indian pharma API industry. Gracing the inaugural dais were Dr Juan Colberg, Senior Director, Pfizer, US; Dr David Constable, Science Director, American Chemical Society - Green Chemistry Institute; RK Agarwal, Managing Director, Nakoda Chemicals; Prof S Dayanand, Dept of Animal Sciences, School of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad; Dr Guy Humphrey, Distinguished Senior Investigator, MSD, US; and Nitesh Mehta, Conference Convener and Co-Founder - Green ChemisTree Foundation and founding director of Newreka Green Synth Technologies.

Pharma Leadership Summit

The objective of the Pharma Leadership Summit was primarily to bring together leaders from the Indian pharma industry to collectively engaging in various aspects of GC&E implementation - from identifying opportunities, to recognising gaps, getting acquainted to collaborative models and enabling platforms, to exploring emerging tools and solutions for advancing the implementation of GC&E practices in the industry.

The session commenced with two keynote addresses by Dr David Constable, Science Director, ACS- Green Chemistry Institute, who shared a global perspective on GC&E implementation and sustainability in the pharma industry; followed by Sai Sethuram, Head, Product & Portfolio Development, Pfizer Healthcare, who spoke on the importance of sustainability in the Indian pharma industry for emerging as a robust and sustainable supplier to the global pharma industry.

The talk by Dr Guy Humphrey, Distinguished Senior Investigator, MSD (Merck) US, shared insights on the business-case for green chemistry and how over the years, Merck has been strategically and systematically investing in the field of green chemistry for their products. This outlook was reinforced by Dr Rajappa Vaidyanathan, Group Director and Head, Chemical Development and API Supply, Bristol Myers Squibb, in his talk, wherein he elaborated on various case-studies citing examples on how BMS has been integrating the application of green chemistry principles in early phase development processes.

Dr Sudhir Nambiar, President - R&T, Hikal spoke on his company's journey towards GC&E implementation, and outlined the events leading from identification to implementation of GC&E practices at Hikal. This was pertinent as Hikal is the first Indian pharma company which is now on-board with the ACS-Green Chemistry Pharmaceutical Roundtable (GCIPR) as a Member Company.

This session was followed by Dr Vilas Dahanukar, R&D Director, Bioxera Research India who pointed out various gaps and opportunities of implementing GC&E practices in the pharma sector, further emphasising the need to develop a mind-set for greener and simpler processes, and newer approaches to problem solving.

Speaking in the last session of the summit, Dr Juan Colberg, Senior Director, Pfizer, US spoke about green chemistry and manufacturing technologies at Pfizer. He remarked that the challenges in resource and environmental sustainability requires more efficient and benign technologies for chemical processes and emphasised that the importance of manufacturing products through green chemistry means that these can potentially addresses such challenges.

Workshop on bio-catalysis in pharma API industry

The objective of this workshop was to have focussed deliberation on exploring the real-time potential of bio-catalysis in pharma API synthesis. The content of the workshop was designed to expand the technical understanding of bio-catalysis, while also learn from successful case-studies and explore relevant bio-catalytic solutions vis-à-vis the pharma API industry's challenges and requirements.

The session commenced with a keynote address and half-day technical workshop by subject expert, Prof Nicholas Turner, Professor of Chemical Biology, School of Chemistry, Manchester Institute of Biotechnology, UK. In his session, he provided an introduction to biocatalysis in the pharma industry, illustrated with examples the various biocatalytic pathways that can make manufacturing of pharma APIs greener, and posited a need to increase application of biocatalysis in discovery chemistry.

The next session was conducted by Dr Guy Humphrey, Distinguished Senior Investigator, MSD (Merck), US, who discussed the role of biocatalysis in green and sustainable development. He opined that enzymes specificity, selectivity, ability to be evolved are key propertiesthat create aspirational opportunities and the answer to the chemist's question ""do you have an enzyme that can do x, y or z?"" is no longer 'Yes' or 'No'. It's increasingly 'Yes' or 'Not yet'. The biocatalysis case-studies as presented by Dr Humphrey were reportedly shared for the very first time in a public forum and the workshop participants were fortunate to be able to learn from these very exciting projects being done at Merck, US. Similarly Dr Juan Colberg shared relevant case-studies from Pfizer to illustrate the advantages of bio-catalysis in pharma synthesis while Dr Ishwar B Bajaj, Senior Scientific Manager, Biocon shared case-studies on the application of biocatalysis in syntheses of complex APIs.

In the last session of the workshop, presenters shared pharma API relevant technologies and solutions in the bio-catalysis space. Suresh Kumar from Advanced Enzymes Technologies, discussed the viability of enzymes as ""Green Catalysts in the Pharma Industry,"" and presented case-studies where AET enzymes have shown break-through results in complex API synthesis. The last presenter, Saravanan Jothi, Iosynth Labs, deliberated on white biotechnology and its application in chiral synthesis. He stated that bio-catalysis is an effective tool for achieving chiral purity, which is critical in the pharma industry.

Besides the presentations, participants at the workshop also continued with offline interactions and focussed discussions in the break hours with experts like Prof Nick Turner present throught the conference.

GCIPR workshop on essential tools and techniques

The workshop was designed to facilitate learning from the collective efforts of GCIPR towards performing several PMI benchmarking exercises of chemical processes across different development stages over the last one decade within the member companies of the Green Chemistry Institute's Pharmaceutical Roundtable (GCIPR). The workshop highlighted on how smarter decisions on solvents (including water) and raw materials using the solvent and reagent selection guides can result quickly in significant reductions of wastes, and enhance greener and more sustainable processing.

The first session was conducted by Dr Guy Humphrey, who introduced the objectives and background of the GCIPR model, and set the context for sustainability in the pharma industry. He stated that GC&E enables lowest cost API production, helps mitigate supply-chain risks and presented examples on how GCIPR catalyses innovative approaches to improving process efficiency in the sector.

This was followed by a session by Dr David Constables on PMI metrics, with extensive examples and hands-on exercises. After a detailed introduction on the solvent and reagent selection guides, he demonstrated how R&D teams could integrate these tools on a day-to-day basis.

Industrial experts like Dr Bhuvaneshwari Sridhar, Head of API & R&D, Pfizer Healthcare India, Dr Rajappa Vaidyanathan, Group Director & Head, Chem Dev & API Supply, Bristol-Myers Squibb, India and Dr Guy Humphrey, Distinguished Senior Investigator, MSD (Merck), US shared relevant and real-time examples of integrating GCIPR tools and techniques in making conventional synthesis 'greener'.

Mehta, Conference Convener and Co-founder, Green ChemisTree Foundation, concluded the session by acknowledging the GCIPR for their generous support and partnership in forwarding the ""Green Chemistry Initiative for Pharma Industry"" in India over the years. He also reiterated the importance and relevance of the GCIPR tools and techniques for the pharma industry in India.

Tools, technologies and solutions in GC&E

The seminar on 'Ready-to-Implement' Technologies and Solutions, was designed to bring together GC&E solutions at the door-step of participating companies. Combined with case-study presentations and demonstrations, the presentations in the seminar introduced emerging tools, technologies and environmental solutions which have the potential to address industry's immediate environmental and process-related challenges. The seminar was categorised into two distinct categories, with the first half being dedicated to tools and technologies applicable at the R&D stage and the second session about those available for process, manufacturing and operations stage.

The first session was commenced with a keynote address by Dr Rakeshwar Bandichhor, Director and CoE Chemistry Head - API R&D, Dr Reddy's Laboratories who provided a consolidated insight into the array of GC&E tools and techniques which R&D teams can incorporate at various process-development stages. The next presenter, Dr Satya Lakshmi Oruganty, Director - LifeSciences - Enterprise Analytics and Intelligence, PerkinElmer, further discussed the various lab informatics tools as developed and offered by PerkinElmer.

The talk by Dr Sivakumar, Technical Services Manager, Johnson Matthey, discussed the use and applications of homogenous hydrogen and through case studies and examples highlighted how optimised homogeneous catalytic system can offer safer, milder conditions (lower temperature and/or pressure), increased chemoselectivity and functional group tolerance (e.g. to halogens). He also explained how these catalysts help in creating simpler work-up procedures and most importantly help in reducing waste generation (as compared to hydrides).

The next presenter, Virendra Chouhan, GM, Equinox Software & Services discussed an innovative Multi Batch Distillation System (MBDS) software technology for carrying out distillation using a stand-alone advanced and effective tool. The MBDS is a user friendly tool developed by Equinox in association with Stochastic LLC (US). He shared examples highlighted the functioning of this tool, and how it can handle both batch and continuous distillations.

Prathamesh Kulkarni, from ACS International India discussed the CAS' SciFinder Tool, which is a research discovery application that provides integrated access to the world's most comprehensive and authoritative source of references, substances and reactions. With the help of case studies, he explained the functioning of CAS SciFinder Tool to find green synthetic routes for API molecules, various green reactions and 'green' solvent reactions; and various other parameters as required.

Dr Shailaja Donempudi, Senior Principal Scientist, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (CSIR-IICT) in her talk briefly shared the journey of 75 years and the focus areas as evolved over the years at IICT. She also shared various case-studies and examples where-in the institute demonstrated development of sustainable and robust 'green' solutions in the areas of multistep and asymmetric synthesis, flow chemistry, parallel synthesis, biotransformations, bench scale level to pilot plant facility, technology for organo-fluoro chemistry, reactors for gas and liquid phase reactions, photochemical reactions, and supercritical carbon dioxide extraction.

The second session on GC&E solutions and technologies for process manufacturing and operations level, included four presentations, starting with Pratas Baruah, National Sales Head - ACC Geocycle who spoke on the efficacy of 'co-processing' as a sustainable and compliant waste management solution for the pharma API industry. Dr Prashant Waske, Mettler Toledo, presented Mettler Toledo's expertise in offering process safety and process optimisation engineering solutions while Ankur Turakhia discussed a 'green' approach to ZLD, Sugam Pariyavaran Vikalp's innovation ZLD solution of ""Constructed Geological Filter System"".

The last presentation in the seminar was by Megha Shanbhag, Business Development Manager, Newreka Green Synth Technologies who discussed their RecycleSource solutions for API and the pharma industry. He elaborated on the current reality of this industry generating multiple effluent streams with widely differing quantities and characteristics. Taking into account this reality, Newreka's platform technologies are developed for recycling effluent streams in early stage pharma synthesis, particularly for those API molecules which are high in volume and thus high in effluent. With relevant examples and successful case-studies, she shared Neweka's platform technologies and the customer-friendly business model.

The conference was followed by one-day workshop for teachers and students on ""Essential Tools and Guides for Green Chemistry Education and Research,"" held at K J Somaiya College of Science and Commerce, Mumbai."

At a recent interaction with BJP party workers from Puducherry via video conferencing, Prime Minister Narendra Modi faced a tough question on the tax burden plaguing the middle-class. Neither did Modi like the question, nor did he expect it. The video, therefore, went viral. The only explanation for this is can be that the man who sold Modi the question paper the previous night had promised that a question on taxes would not appear.

Now, instead of answering questions in a better manner, Modi has decided to ban unscripted questions from these party interactions altogether. BJP members have been asked to shoot a video of their question and send it 48 hours ahead of a scheduled interaction with the PM. These questions will be screened by party workers and then picked for Modi to answer. This is borderline shameful considering that Modi is no ordinary PM. Most of us forget that he is the author of the #1 bestseller Exam Warriors.

Friends, this man has written a book that revolves around the concept of answering tough questions to get ahead in life. And now, he has a problem taking questions. What would the students think of you, Modiji?

Also read: In Madhya Pradesh, Narendra Modi ko gussa kyon aata hai

All this was set off by the embarrassment at the Puducherry meeting where the question went something like, ""Honourable Prime Minister... I am grateful for this opportunity to speak to you. My question is the work that you are doing to change the country is undoubtedly a good step but the middle sections of people are of the opinion that your government is only busy collecting tax in all manner and in all ways. They did not get the relaxation they were hoping fBor in the IT sector, loan processing procedure and bank transaction fees and penalty. It is my request that you take care of the middle class, which is the root of your party, like the way you take care while collecting tax from them. Thank you sir.""

Modi was so dumbfounded by the question that, for a second, he looked like a sad Vinod Kambli contemplating life choices and trying to figure out where it all went wrong.

All Modi could do was to come to a profound conclusion that since the guy was a trader, he wanted to talk business. Like what? And then he froze, hoping the earth would split into two and just gobble him up. When that didn't happen, he passed another random statement about how he will take care of the people. Then, he took a longer pause and just uttered the words, ""Chaliye, Puducherry ko wanakkam"". You know someone has really run out of ideas when cultural appropriation becomes their go-to punchline. Imagine what would happen, Modiji, when the IT department sends notices to all South Indians for not filing their income tax, and the only reply they get is ""Kem chho"" written in font size 84 across an A4 paper.

Modi hasn't held a single press conference or taken open questions in the last four and a half years. But that ship has sailed, it's not a big deal anymore. However, this episode further reaffirms my feelings in the popular belief that our PM doesn't have a college degree. Because if you went to an Indian college, the least you would learn is how to fudge your way through questions which you skipped preparing for. If my education has taught me one thing, it is to confidently repeat 75 per cent of the question that is posed to you as is, until you can use the word ""because"". ""The government is only busy collecting tax in all manner and in all ways from the middle-class, and they do not get the relaxation they were hoping for in IT sector, loan processing procedure and bank transaction fees and penalty because...""

This method succeeds in boring the person who posed the question enough to make them automatically lose interest in the answer, post ""because"". You can literally get away with saying anything. Trust me, because I have a degree in industrial engineering by just writing zoological names of monkeys in a thermodynamics paper.

Modi could have at least done what contestants at the Miss India pageant do during the Q&A round. To buy time to think of something that could pass off as an answer, they start appreciating the question first. And then, talk about India's population. ""First, I want to thank the member for posing such a thought-provoking question. As you know, India is a vast country of over a billion people, with over a thousand dialects and thousands of taxes. And I'm proud of our rich culture and taxes... I would like to thank my tax-paying parents, tax-paying teachers and you, the tax-paying audience.""

This at least shows intent, and in my book, you would have gotten marks for trying. Or like they say in school, ""marks for steps"".

Also read: Modi's Exam Warriors: It's all about politics, stupid!

What if students across India took a leaf out of their beloved PM's latest diktat, and started demanding that teachers shoot a video of the questions for the exam and submit it 48 hours in advance.

Imagine Priya ma'am submitting her questions: ""Train A leaves the station five hours before Train B. If Train A is travelling at 50 km/hr, how long will it take for Train A to meet Train B?"" The BJP's first response to the question would be to change the name of Train A to Hanuman Express and Train B to Ram Janmabhoomi Express. And then, they would ban the question because guess what, both trains wouldn't have made it out of the station anyway, since the whole problem is set in 2002. Do we want 2002?

I'm not saying Modi should hold open press conferences. That's just too much to ask for. Let's take baby steps instead. I just want him to put some effort while taking the whole country for a ride on Train B, while claiming that the 'B' in the train stands for bullet.

According to a report by The Epoch Times, students at more than 10 schools in Guizhou Province, one of China's poorer provinces, as well as the neighboring Guangxi region now have to wear ""intelligent uniforms,"" which are embedded with electronic chips that track their movements.

The 'smart' uniforms help school officials, teachers, and parents track the movements of students in real-time, Lin Zongwu, principal of the No. 11 School of Renhuai in Guizhou Province, told the state-run newspaper Global Times on December 20. If students skip school without permission, an alarm will be triggered.

The uniforms have a host of other features including alerting appropriate authorities if a student falls asleep in class, as well as letting parents monitor what their kids' are buying and even setting spending limits.

More Black Mirror-ish is the tracking technology being embedded into the uniforms with databases being set up to match each uniform to each student's face, with facial-recognition equipment being installed at school entrances that can match a student's face with the chip embedded in the uniform. This is to prevent students from exchanging uniforms or trying to manipulate the system.

According to authorities, attendance in schools has seen a surge since the new tech has been implemented now that students are aware that their every movement is being tracked.

While this may sound more and more like a police state's gambit, Chinese officials insist that it is part of the country's emphasis on digital education and smart campuses.

On its official website, Guizhou Guanyu, the firm that designs the chips and embeds, explains that it was established ""to respond to the country's and the Communist Party's call"" for the application of ""smart school campuses""."

She began her career as a teacher at a civic body school before moving to a Delhi government school in 2010.

A mother of three, Qanungo is known for her innovative teaching ways. Last year, too, she was given a state award for best teacher, and had also received an award from a university in London.

""English is a subject in which students in our government schools don't feel very comfortable. I diagnosed the problem and developed a strategy. Rather than making it a subject confined to reading and writing, I worked on developing listening skills of the children. I would ask them to hear the announcement at railway stations, metro, radio and call centres. The strategy worked and students became very confident,"" Qanungo said.

Venezuela saw bloody protests in 2018 and January 20 was like no other.

Security forces clashed with mourners for Oscar Perez at the main morgue in the Venuzuelan capital, Caracas.

Oscar Perez had been the leading man in an action film, a pilot who fought crime from parachutes with a dog strapped to his back.

In June, he commandeered a helicopter during protests, fired on the Venezuelan supreme court and unfurled a banner urging Venezuelans to rebel.

Perez was an actor, a detective and an insurgent.

To the government he was a terrorist.

To his followers he was a freedom fighter, a modern folk hero like Che Guevara.

Perez's end came on January 15. His body sat in a freezer at the Caracas morgue, with two bullet wounds and a cracked mandible, under armed guard.

On January 21, the government released the corpse, which was buried naked, except for a white sheet wrapped around it.

It has been republished from The Quint's archives on the anniversary of the deadly tsunami that hit Chennai in 2004.)

A brown stained building with a roof torn and windows shattered stood in Keechankuppam, a small fishing hamlet in Nagapattinam.

After the tsunami waves had calmed down and people came out of their safe shelters, they were rattled by sight in front of them. It took a long while for families to pick up the broken pieces of their lives and start over. Help poured in from everywhere and people began moving away from the coast into homes built by the government. New utensils and books were bought and memorials were built.

But this school in the village was left abandoned because the building was ruined beyond repair. There was a sense of fear looming over it.

80 children who studied in the school died in the tsunami.

I was 10 when the tsunami struck. We ran away and returned when everything was normal again. I wondered what the school would be like. The then Principal sent word to all friends of the kids who died in the tsunami, so I went to school and my teachers told that most of our friends had died... My best friend Sathyavani too. Even today I cannot forget her face.Kokila, who is now working as a teacher in the same school

Fast forward to 2017 - The school which was once in ruins has been recognised by the Tamil Nadu government as one of the best schools in the state with the highest number of children joining every year.

The Fear Is Real

Situated between the river and the sea, the people in the village feared sending their children to this school again.

The scene of giant waves gobbling up the school haunted them. Gradually, the strength of the school went down to just 92 in 2012, from 428 in 2004.

The school had to be renovated and so a teacher working in a village nearby was called in to give the school a second lease of life.

When the Going Gets Tough

A new school building came up in 2008. But still there were no kids joining school. Balu joined as the Principal of the school in 2013 and he took it upon himself to transform the lives of the children.

People of the village told him that if the school had facilities like no other, then they would fight their fears and send their children to school.

To begin with, he installed a projector and turned one of the classes into a smart classroom. By the next year, the entire school was turned 'smart' and everyone started looking up to Balu's school.

In 2015, 134 kids joined and the school was recognised by the Tamil Nadu state government as the school with the second largest number of children joining school in the state.

To overcome fear, we brought in smart classes and made the school worth coming to. Once the school got the reputation, many children came in. Today, at the cost for 45 lakhs, given by officers and the village, the school has become what it is today.R Balu, Principal

Balu got tsunami ravaged discarded furniture from banks and offices, repaired and polished them. Today, every classroom has tables with drawers and lockers.

Making wealth out of waste, literally, and a small reminder of the hardships they've endured.

Putting Private Schools to Shame

The school today has everything that a private school offers in terms of infrastructure. The classrooms are Wi-Fi enabled, it has science and computer labs, RO drinking water facilities, clean toilets, a huge playground, greenery all around, interactive classes, laptops and even a rooftop garden !

In the book, there will be only one picture, but here we have so much more. We can see places where we can never go in real life. For example, we usually see only one picture of Taj Mahal from the outside, but now we get to see what the roof looks like, what stones it us made of. I want to come to school without bunking a single day. Tamilarasi, Student

They have a recognised Parent Teachers' Association and conduct regular meetings to address grievances. The management works in the way Parliament does - the Principal is the President, teachers are the chief ministers and the children are in charge of departments like sanitation and hygiene.

For the Village, by the Village

The school's transformation was possible owing to the overwhelming support from the villagers, service organisations and government departments.

The village was impressed with the efforts of the Principal and so requested him to give a list of items that they can donate to the school.

Just like a wedding where the family goes on a procession with gifts for their daughter, the villagers prayed at the local temple and walked to the school with fruits, vegetables, tables, chairs, stationery, black boards, skeletons, equipment for the labs and whatever each one could donate.

One of the fisherfolk who didn't have the money to donate, gave a box of chalk pieces as a token of gratitude for building such a remarkable school.

But the Principal has bigger plans - at least five laptops for each classroom, exclusive computer science and physical education teachers, and school buses.

Showering Laurels

The PU school is one among 11 in its category in the State, and 100 in the country, to receive the Swachh Vidyalaya Puraska. The school got the coveted ISO stamp and was honoured with the Kamarajar Best School award by the Tamil Nadu state government.

Balu was awarded the Best Teacher National award by former President Pranab Mukherjee.

Memories Linger On

The school has a memorial set up for remembering those children who lost their lives to the tsunami.

The children who were traumatised by the deaths of their classmates are today serving as teachers in the same school.

Dear children, had you been alive, we would have given you such good education. Today you have not died, you have sowed the seeds of prosperity. Soon the children here will someday become IAS, IFS, IRS officers and you children should bless them all with such big dreams. An ode from Principal R Balu to the children who died in the tsunami

The previous BJP government increased the time of school by an hour in 2014. Teachers across the state had opposed the increase of the school timing but the government did not reduce it. For the last four years, teachers have been agitating while demanding reducing school time.

The Congress promised to reduce school time in its election manifesto and so teachers are now reminding the Congress government of its promise.

Similarly, teachers' training camps are organised every year in the state. These camps were non-residential during the previous Congress government's tenure. The BJP government had ordered to conduct residential teacher training camp three years ago and teachers across the state had protested against it. Teachers in different districts of the state boycotted these camps forcing the previous BJP government to take disciplinary action against them.

Now the government has changed in the state and so teachers are demanding that these camps be made non-residential.

Teachers' delegation led by Rajasthan Primary Secondary Teachers Association president Shashi Bhushan Sharma and senior vice president Vipin Prakash Sharma met both Gehlot and Pilot on Tuesday. They handed over their five-point demand letter. Sharma said that both CM and Deputy CM listened to them carefully. They then instructed the officers to take immediate action.

""We have also demanded to eliminate the new pension scheme and implement the one and also reopen 25,000 schools closed by the previous government. Teachers' training camps will start on Wednesday.

Digital boards will be installed in classrooms from 9th grade to post-graduation and the project will be completed in three years.

Pointing out that former Prime Minister late AB Vajpayee launched Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, which helped to reach education to every section of the society, he said the 'digital board' project would enhance the reach of education to a greater extent.

The digital board will make it possible to teach a single concept through various angles. It will be easier for students to participate in a discussion on the topic in presence of expert teachers, thereby enhancing the quality of education.

The Maharashtra International Education Board has created 13 international schools and the schools are named after Bharat Ratna AB Vajpayee, Javadekar said. The Union Minister was addressing a gathering of students, teachers and officials at Sahyadri Guest House here.

Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, Maharashtra Education Minister Vinod Tawde, minister Pankaja Munde, MoS Agriculture Sadabhau Khot, computer expert Dr Vijay Bhatkar, actress Swaroop Sampat, among others, were present.

Minister Tawde said the pilot project will have 13 schools as international schools after which 100 more will be made international. At present, all schools are government ones. In the next phase, aided and self-financed schools too would be included under Bharat Ratna AB Vajpayee International School project. He said the pressure on CBSE schools would ease with the formation of these international schools.

""Maharashtra used to be ranked 15 and 16 in education earlier. The state now ranks third,"" said CM Fadnavis, expressing confidence that the project will help Maharashtra climb even higher."

This decision has been taken after the central government, in July this year, scrapped the 'No detention policy', thereby allowing states to detain children in class 5 and 8.

Earlier, schools could not detain or make any child repeat a class until Class 8. The amendment to Section 16 of the Right To Education Act, takes away the important 'no detention policy' which was enforced in 2010.

Confirming the same, Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, state education minister, said, ""All the damage in the state of Gujarat has been done due to the no detention policy. Due to the policy, fear among students had gone which led to poor results. Not just students, even the parents stopped paying attention to their studies. With no exams till class 8, how do you expect a child to perform well in higher standards? The result of the policy was seen during board exams.""

While the centre has asked states to conduct exams in class 5 and 8, we are likely to introduce the same for class 3 also. The issue is pending in Rajya Sabha now. Once we get the nod, we will be implementing the same.""

The seventh edition of Gunotsav, annual drive to ascertain learning levels of primary school students, had revealed shocking results, with nearly 6 lakh of the 21 lakh surveyed could not do basic reading, writing or arithmetic.

Lauding the centre's decision of scrapping No detention policy, Anisha Shaikh, Principal, FD School for Girls, said, ""It is a great move as the quality of education was deteriorating and we were the sufferers. In class 9, we as teachers had to start from zero as most students would not know basics as we had to promote them. Now even the parents will be concerned for the students future.""

However, she feels that exams should not be introduced in class 3. ""For classes 1-4, focus should be on reading, writing and learning rather than exams. Language of students should be clear till class 4 and their basics in Math. Once they get their hold in these, it helps them in higher classes."""

However, a closer look at the new conditions in fine print reveals that the part-time teachers may not be able to earn the assured sum even in entire year.

As per the GR issued by department of higher and technical education on November 14, the colleges and universities compulsorily need to follow a lengthy procedure to decide number of part-timers they require before appointing them. The new system has held up appointments for this year and is likely to disrupt teaching activity next year too.

Going by the GR, colleges and universities won't be able to assign work to part-time teachers before February. The university exam would start from February 15, thus leaving 15 lectures in 2018-19 session, experts say.

Earlier, the universities and colleges had the liberty to appoint CHB teachers in July itself and get approval by December from the department. Henceforth, the appointments can't be finalized until the government and universities okay the workload, which is decided only at September end when admissions close.

This year, colleges under Nagpur University (NU) as well as other parts of the state have been unable to recruit part-time teachers even though the second term of academic year has begun because of the draconian rules.

Surprisingly, several principals and aspirants have been unable to decipher the details of the GR which would entail months of unemployment and classes without teachers.

""People are so happy about the hike in remuneration that they didn't realize its drawbacks. The government is working against the interest of the students and teachers,' said Rajendra Bhoyar, president of Maharashtra Principals' Forum.

The biggest setback for teachers is restriction on working part-time in more than one college besides possessing higher qualification not less the PhD, NET/SET.

""This is injustice to teachers in the name of increasing the pay,"" said Anil Dhage, former secretary of NUTA.

He added that the GR restricts the number of lectures for a part-time teacher to 9. Earlier it was 7 but teachers were allowed to work in any number of colleges.

Bhoyar said imposing such norms not only increases unemployment among youth but also leaves students without teachers. ""At several colleges, no classes have been held so far. We have demanded that instead the government allows us to recruit contractual teachers just like the Nagpur University has done. We are ready to pay Rs25,000 a month to contract teachers,"" he said."

Public schools in India are facing a dearth of teachers which makes quality education a far cry for children, says a study conducted by a child rights NGO. There is a shortage of more than five lakh teachers in elementary schools and 14 per cent of government secondary schools do not have the prescribed minimum of six teachers, the report says.

The study by Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability (CBGA) and Child Rights and You (CRY) found that across the six states, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh together account for more than 4.2 lakhs of vacant posts. Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra do fairly well in this regard, as they have recruitment in almost 95 per cent of the sanctioned posts at the elementary level.

Bihar has the highest proportion of untrained teachers, both at the elementary and secondary level, followed by West Bengal, says the study. As per the report, Bihar has 38.7 per cent professionally unqualified teachers at the elementary and 35.1 per cent at the secondary level. West Bengal, on the other hand, reported a shortfall of 31.4 per cent and 23.9 per cent of qualified teachers at the elementary and secondary levels, respectively.

Notwithstanding increased budgetary allocations for school education in many states, scarcity of duly qualified teachers and lack of proper school infrastructure are the major problems that still remain in place, mentioned the study

Advertising

Though the states have increased funding for school education in the 14th Finance Commission, states have not fully utilised their budgets to change the composition of their school education spending. This has led to a crunch in the allocation of resources, the study found.

Due to the dearth of qualified teachers, many states were compelled to recruit under-qualified and contractual teachers. The study was drafted on the basis of school education budgets for six states, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu."

I insisted her to go to school till the time she was married, but she didn't,"" says Lakshmi, staring at her daughter Priya. ""I wanted to continue my studies, but he didn't want me to,"" says Priya, a teenager, blaming her husband Chinnarasu, who was sitting on the floor beside her. After a pause, all three laugh, recalling an incident that happened eighteen months ago.

In April 2017, Chinnarasu proposed to Priya, after a short courtship period. Families in the Narikuravar (an indigenous community) colony in Pallavaram gathered for a panchayat meeting, where it was decided that Priya and Chinnarasu would tie the knot. When the gathering cheered the couple, an important person, Priya's mother Lakshmi, hardly had any say in the decision.

Lakshmi is a mother of four girls and a boy. Priya is her second daughter. She did not want any of her children to earn their livelihood as a garbage collector and wanted all of them to study and secure good jobs.Lakshmi begins her work at 6 am, along with her husband Vijayan. She makes several trips on a green tricycle to keep the streets of Pallavaram clean. Vijayan rides it and Lakshmi separates the non-biodegradable items for an additional income. Leftovers at restaurants turn breakfast and lunch for the couple. On Fridays, they do a mom-and-pop business by selling household items at the Friday market along the Pallavaram-Tirusulam stretch.

Lakshmi's eldest daughter, Manjula, does not have a community certificate, and so she could not enrol in school. ""For us, the certificate is the road to education,"" says Lakshmi. Manjula eventually became a garbage collector. So, Lakshmi pinned all her hopes on Priya. The couple admitted Priya to four different schools, whenever she wanted a switch in schooling. Lakshmi was even specific about her daughter's becoming teachers.

""Priya had appeared for her class 9 final exams when Chinnarasu came with the proposal,"" Lakshmi says. Chinnarasu dropped out of school in class 3 after his teacher had scolded him for inhaling snuff during class hours. ""I did not want Priya to quit school, but the community would have wanted it,"" says Chinnarasu, citing clothing as the major reason for the decision. ""A girl who is engaged must stop wearing salwar kameez or top and leggings,"" he says. All married women are clad in saris while men are seen in dhotis and shirts.

Though the panchayat had decided to get Priya and Chinnarasu married, the ceremony was held off, owing to the spending. ""The groom's family gives a sum to the bride's kin as dowry,"" says Lakshmi, who received '50,000 from Chinnarasu's family. In addition to the dowry and her savings, she borrowed a loan from a local usurer. Around 10 months after the panchayat meeting, the duo got married with a due ceremony that got Chinnarasu's family a debt of over '3 lakh.

""Families of both brides and grooms in our community must give their relatives '200-'500, bangles to women and a bottle of liquor, either before the wedding or during the ceremony,"" Lakshmi says. She spent nearly half of the total money in giving these presents and the rest in buying shirts, dhotis and turbans for close relatives. The groom's family bore the ceremonial expenses.

The newly weds spent the first nine months of their marriage at Lakshmi's thatched hut and moved to a nearby hut recently. They live on Chinnarasu's income that he earns by riding his tricycle and collecting remains of food at restaurants.

Giving fate another chance, Lakshmi has now pinned her hopes on her daughter, Gangotri, a class 7 student. She aims to become a doctor. For the first time, two girls in the colony have entered class 12.

Three others, including two boys and a girl go to school. While the boys are in class 11 and the girl is in class 10. Priya gives these statistics and believes the dropout rate in the colony will come down. She has joined her mother in seeing education as the change for the better.

All efforts in vain

The headmistress of a government-aided school, Hepsiba, who has breathed new life into the community, is an inspiration to the family. She tried to persuade Lakshmi and Vijayan to postpone Priya's marriage until she completed school. But, all efforts went in vain."

The two schools, along with numerous other establishments like the handloom weaving centre, which bore the brunt of the floods, are on the path of fast revival -- thanks to the effective intervention of voluntary agencies and the local people.

While rebuilding by the government agencies in different parts of the state is only in the initial stages, the UP and LP schools which remained half submerged in the flood waters for over five days suffering huge damage to their facilities, have come back to life. In the forefront of the effort to revive them was the Deepalaya Trust in Delhi which lost no time in identifying the devastated schools and offering its help.

In a commendable operation coordinated by A J Philip, Deepalaya executive officer and eminent journalist; Dr George Mathew, Chairman, Institute of Social Sciences, New Delhi; and A J Abraham, social activist in Ernakulam, the rebuilding of the school started in right earnest in September itself and the work was completed within two months.

The so-called government red-tapes and delays were overcome with the strong support provided by the school authorities, including the AEO Latha, school headmaster V K Santhosh, panchayat president T G Anoop, Cartoonist Academy and the local people.

The Trust spent Rs 33 lakh in replacing the damaged computers, reconstructing the collapsed compound walls, removing the slush and debris from the compound and classrooms, laying tiles on the floors, painting the walls and re-equipping the library. Soon, other NGOs joined hands, including 'Human Values' and 'Rapid Response' of Pondicherry, which replaced the old furniture, desks and benches with modern ones.

Now the schools sport a completely new look and none who visits the place will realise that these were the ones the floods had ravaged only a few months ago. To celebrate its rejuvenation, the school organised a function on Saturday, which was attended by Sethu, writer and former chairman of South Indian Bank, Dr George Mathew, Cartoon Academy members, panchayat president, ward members, school children, parents, teachers and local people."

However, there was a perceptible change in the tone of his address unlike the last time when he launched a frontal attack on Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik and ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD).His address lasting a little over half an hour did not have Chief Minister and BJD supremo Naveen Patnaik's name come up even once. Nor did the BJD, even though he was unsparing in his criticism of the State Government.

His entire address dwelt on the issues of corruption, and the State Government's failure in health, education, agriculture and farmer's welfare and other sectors. In a stinging attack on the State Government, Modi said corruption has become all pervasive in Odisha. ""Demon of corruption in the form of chit fund scam and PC (percentage commission) culture has grown strong in Odisha,"" he said, and sought to know who is ""feeding and patronising the demon of corruption.""

""The Centre has launched a slew of projects and pumped in huge funds for Odisha's development and despite all these, Odisha is lagging behind,"" he added.Under 'Swahh Bharat' (Clean India) campaign, Modi said the country has achieved 97 per cent 'swachhata' (cleanliness) but Odisha is lagging far behind other states in becoming 'Open Defecation Free'. Children of the State are suffering from malnutrition while farmers are struggling due to lack of remunerative prices for their produce and basic irrigation facilities. The State has failed to provide safe drinking water to almost half of the population and teachers are forced to agitate due to denial of proper salary, he alleged.

Criticising the State Government for its refusal to join the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana 'Ayushman Bharat' scheme, Modi said, ""Odias would have availed free medical facilities upto ' five lakh in major hospitals across the country if the State had joined the scheme.

People want to know why the State Government refused to join the scheme.""

Stating that around six lakh people have benefited from the Centre's flagship healthcare scheme, Modi said, ""I regret that not a single Odia is among the beneficiaries."" He asserted that the Centre is committed to strengthen healthcare services. Steps have been taken for setting up five medical colleges in the State.

""The Centre is committed to the all round development of Odisha. We will change Odisha's fate and take the State on the path of development towards a new future,"" Modi said. People including farmers and women are realising there is a wave for change to take the State on a new path of progress and development and are raising their voice, he added.

He said '1.5 crore is being invested in oil and petroleum sector in the State which would make it the country's petro hub. Besides, the Centre is taking all steps to strengthen connectivity and road networks in Odisha.

Talking to the media persons in Ranchi, School Education and Literacy Minister Neera Yadav said that the State Government is ready for talks and consider the logical demands made by them in a transparent manner. Notably, around 67000 para-teachers all over the State have been agitating for the last 38 days demanding regularisation of their services and other facilities on the lines of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal and have been staging indefinite rotation dharnas outside the residences of ministers in the State Government. Education in around 12000 primary and middle schools have been completely or partially been affected due to this deadlock.

""Even though we are ready for talks, the protesting para - teachers are not ready for it.even if they come tomorrow, we are ready for a discussion with an assurance that their demands, if rational, will be fulfilled. otherwise we will be forced to take strong step in the interest of the children,"" said Yadav.

""If they show some willingness for talks, we will further extend the deadline for another one day, in case they are reluctant to start the talks on Christmas,"" said Yadav.

Counting on the facilities the para-teachers have been given since Government of Raghubar Das came into power; Yadav said that the State Government is committed towards providing quality education.

""Future of thousands of students could not be put on stake anymore and hence they must come forward for talks or the Government is free to take steps to secure quality education to the children in this State,"" said the minister. Para teachers, on the other hand, are adamant on their demands and are not ready to bow down before the State Government. ""

He, however, cleared that any talks with the State Government will be held only after the Assembly Session ends on July 27. Prasad said that they will not let go the sacrifice of the five para - teachers who lost their lives in this movement.

A circular by the directorate of elementary education, dated December 20, stated that one section in class 6 of 310 government schools across the state would start using English as the medium of instruction from 2019-2020 academic session. So far, in class 6, all subjects other than English are taught in Hindi. Out of a total of 310 schools in the district that have been chosen for the initiative, the highest number of schools are in Gurugram.

District elementary education officer Premlata Yadav said that the initiative was aimed at improving the student's command over the language. ""Till now, students in class 6 were only studying English as a single subject. They will become more familiar with the language if they use it regularly for studying all the subjects.

About 40 English books will be made available to each of these schools in the next academic session to facilitate the initiative. All schools have been directed to ensure that the message is communicated to teachers, students and parents at the beginning of the next academic session.

One section of class 9 in these 310 schools is already using English as a medium of instruction for studying mathematics and science.

While the move has been welcomed by parents and children, some teachers have raised concerns about the lack of qualified English post-graduate teachers in schools.

She further said a TET pass teacher for Class-1 to Class-5 used to get Rs 7,800 per month before 2015. After the talk with para-teachers in 2015, their remuneration increased to Rs 9, 438. Now, government has increased their remuneration to Rs 11,000.

""Untrained teacher did not get any increment. Government is considering on the issue,"" Yadav said, adding, government is also setting up a corpus of Rs 10 crore for welfare of the para-teachers. Besides, their retirement age was also increased to 60.

When we proposed the same building plan, the government estimated a cost of Rs 6 crore, but we have completed the work by spending Rs 2.2 crore.""

The school has five government-appointed teachers, three guest teachers, three vehicle drivers, and Karate, dance and music teachers. About16 staff are paid by the Shree Durga Friends Club members. All the facilities are provided free-of-cost to children, including transportation.

Success story

In 2015, when the school was about to shut down, the Shree Durga Friends Club members swung into action. They made their own children quit from English-medium schools and admitted them to the school, due to which their number rose to 56 from 30. The members later sought permission from the department of public instruction to convert the medium of instruction to English. It has adopted teaching in the English-medium in a Kannada school, which is a model similar to what is followed in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The club is in a five-year agreement with the government to run the school in various capacities.

Earlier, the school had only three teachers appointed by the government. After taking over, club members have recruited additional teachers, and the club pays their salaries. It has transportation and other facilities."

Of these, at least half were from the SC/ST category, with 16 from the SC category and 9 ST students. The General and OBC categories accounted for 12 suicides each, reported the daily.

According to data acquired via an RTI, a majority of the students who committed suicide were boys. Further, the suicide rate hit the double digits in 2016, ringing warning bells in the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti, which issued a 11-page circular as reckoner on the issue.

According to the Express's investigation, the highest number of suicides were in class 12, followed by class 11, class 9 and class 10.

The reasons for suicides range from unrequited love, family problems, punishment in school, humiliation faced, etc.

Of the 49 suicides, 42 were death by hanging. The remaining cases involved drowning, jumping in front of a train and jumping from a height. Most of the victims were either found by their friends or teachers.

Speaking to the daily, the commission of the NVS Biswajit Kumar Singh said the period of the suicides peaked in the three months after summer vacations, and the exam months, confirming the possibility of the stress of domestic dispute, and academic stress.

The Express investigation involved 46 schools, of which 41 schools were approached for interviews, etc. Over the course of their investigation, it was revealed that the schools are currently facing several challenges.

The Navodaya schools were established in 1985 by the government to uplift sections of the poor by enrolling talented students from weaker sections of the society. Since 2012, the schools have boasted a 99 percent pass percentage in class 10 and 95 percentage in class 12, surpassing private and CBSE schools. Located in places with a higher rural population, over 2.8 lakh students currently study in these schools.

A proposal for 20 such schools with low enrolment was cleared by the north corporation's House meeting on Monday. These will give rise to 10 new schools.

Located mostly in the Karol Bagh, Narela and Rohini zones, these schools are currently running at places like Inderpuri, Pyare Lal Road, Shahbad Daulatpur, Nimari Colony, Shiv Nagar, Pratap Kunj, Avantika, Sangam Park, Molar Basti, Old Ranjeet Nagar, Azadpur Colony and Auchandi.

A senior corporation official attributed the decision to low enrolment, poor finances, and proper utilisation of resources. He gave the example of the proposal to merge Municipal Corporation Primary School (MCPS) Pyare Lal Road 2 and MCPS New Dev Nagar Co-ed School. ""Keeping in view better management, saving of posts and the poor economic condition of north corporation, it would be feasible to merge schools in case of availability of accommodation,"" he said.

The proposal also argues that more and more parents want to educate their wards in morning-shift schools. ""MCPS Pyarelal Road has 202 kids while the Dev Nagar school has 265. After merger, a school with 467 kids and 12 sections will be formed,"" the official said.

He added: ""There are many vacancies in other schools and the staff from the schools being closed down can be sent there. At the same time, we will be able to use the buildings and other infrastructure for purposes such as sports academies.""

The merger of the two schools alone would lead to a surplus of a principal, five teachers and two Class IV employees who could be reassigned. The official also said that 29 schools with low enrolment had been similarly shut down two years ago. But education experts have been criticising the corporations for their failure to enrol more children.

Khagesh Jha, a Supreme Court lawyer and education activist, remarked, ""If the corporation has extra land, why not add to the capital's school infrastructure so that more kids can be brought in the school system? There are more than 20 lakh kids outside the school system in the city. Besides, children from unrecognised schools too need to be brought to government schools.""

The north civic body runs 714 municipal primary schools, in which children, mostly from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, study. Enrolment in all corporation-run schools, however, has been declining steadily. Around 70,000 students have opted out of north schools since the 2012 trifurcation. It then had 3,70,648 students in its primary schools. This figure slid to 3,50,611 in 2013-14 and 3,14,022 in 2016-17. At present, around three lakh students are on the rolls."

Some employees of these centres, fearing job cuts, said 8,000 centres in the state had fewer that 25 students each and that the move would have an adverse impact on government school enrolment.

The nutritious meal programme, aimed at bringing children to government schools, was pioneered by chief minister K Kamaraj in the 1960s and was extended to all children upto Class X by M G Ramachandran (MGR).

Later, the Centre extended support and currently more than 50 lakh students benefit under the scheme at 43,200 centres, shows official data.

The staff strength at eEach centre, comprising a head cook, an assistant and an organiser, increases with student strength. Of the Rs 5,000-Rs 7,000 a month paid to each employee, the Centre pays Rs 1,000 and the state the rest.

Concerned over the drop in government school enrolment with more than 1,000 schools having less than 10 children, the state has decided to re-position employees to centres where there is a demand. Officials have been asked to close centres in low-enrolment schools and transport food from nearby centres to children in these schools.

Condemning this, TN Noon Meal Workers Association secretary R Noorjahan said transporting food from nearby centres would delay distribution. ""Already 10,000 cooking assistant posts are vacant and this will weaken the nutritious meal programme further. When the government is ready to pay over Rs 1lakh for teachers in low-enrolment schools, what is the big deal about paying Rs.5,000 for cooks?""

Social welfare commissioner V Amuthavalli said the order, originally passed in 1992, was being implemented now. ""The aim was to rationalise the workforce. This involves several steps and centres will not be closed straightaway.""

Experts say this will impact student enrolment and eventually lead to closure of the schools. State has already planned to merge 1,053 schools with low enrolment and another 1,950 schools face an uncertain future with funds being cut."

WITH 49 student suicides reported over the last five years from Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas across India, the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) has proposed that the central government deploy two fulltime counsellors in each school, NVS Commissioner Bishwajit Kumar Singh tells Ritika Chopra. Excerpts:

Close to 50 suicides in five years. Is there something that the JNVs are doing wrong?

Student suicides in JNVs have to be understood in the context of the social background and psychological make-up of the children who study here. Entering the (Navodaya) system is a big change for them. There is a world of difference between rural life and life in a Navodaya Vidyalaya. I think we need a specialised set-up to help children acclimatise.

Although we have a system in place, it is not a specialised set-up. Our teachers are working hard on this front, but you have to acknowledge that one JNV teacher is responsible for 80 kids in a school. Raising even two children is a big challenge for parents these days. The teachers have largely succeeded (in helping students acclimatise), but there have been incidents of suicides.

Have you identified the main reasons behind the suicides?

Advertising

As I have mentioned already, the culture shock that a village boy or girl experiences after joining a JNV is a big reason. This is probably why suicides peak in July, August and September, which is right after the two-month summer break. The second peak period is exam season, January and February. Unrequited love and a hostile relationship between parents also drive students to an early grave. Lastly, corporal punishment or humiliation suffered at the hand of a teacher is also a reason why suicides have happened in the past.

Read: Suicides in Navodaya schools: 49 in 5 years, half of them Dalit and tribal students

What are you doing to stem these deaths?

Instead of leaving a chunk of teaching to the last few months before the exams, we have asked teachers to complete the syllabus by November, so that students have enough time to cope with stress. We are keen on engaging at least two counsellors in each school and we have recently submitted a proposal to this effect to the HRD Ministry.

We also noticed that a majority of suicides is by boys. This is probably because there are not any full-time wardens for the boys' hostels. The girls' hostel has had matrons since 1993. In the last one year, we have tried recruiting ex-servicemen as wardens, but there are not enough candidates. We have decided to not restrict the post to ex-servicemen.

Has the government agreed to the proposal on employing full-time counsellors in JNVs?

The proposal we sent involves an expenditure of Rs 56 to 60 crore every year. It is very expensive. So we are now looking at achieving the objective in an economical way. The fact remains that we do not require counsellors throughout the day. So now, there are two thoughts. First, why not have reputed institutions, which can be available on an on-call basis or which can counsel students online? Second, we could assign a counsellor to a cluster of five schools.

What do you do after a suicide to help other JNV students cope with the tragedy? Are they counselled?

Our school principals have certain amount of contingency fund, which can be used to hire a professional, but in general that does not happen. Usually, we depute teachers from other schools to ensure that they speak to the students so that they are not scared.

In many cases, JNV principals and teachers have been either suspended or transferred after a suicide for not being able to spot change in a child's behaviour or tell-tale signs of depression. They feel it's unfair to expect the overburdened employees to know what's going on in every child's mind. Your comment.

Advertising

When you head an institution you have to responsible and accountable. We have acted against principals and House Masters only in cases where we noticed they haven't discharged their duties properly. In 2017, a child in a JNV in Haryana committed suicide because a classmate didn't reciprocate his feelings. In such a case, the school authorities cannot claim they weren't aware of the change in the child's behaviour. The children are in our custody and the teachers should have known what the boy was going through. In a residential set-up, it is wrong for a teacher to think that their duty is only to teach. Also, should we not act in cases of corporal punishment? These incidents warranted action. We are not trying to harass teachers. Before any action there are two levels of inquiries."

N. Thenmukilan, a Class VIII student of Shri Vidhya Mandir, Palani, drew an image of an astronaut cultivating fruits and vegetables in space to boost nutrition. He said that it took two full days to put his concept on paper. His entry was chosen from among thousands of others vying for a spot in the calendar at an international level.

"285","1025888263","2018-12-24","http://risingkashmir.com/news/the-wrong-address-of-an-award","The wrong address of an award","RisingKashmir",FALSE,"On September 26, 2018 in a nearby Government Higher Secondary School (GHSS) a function for the outgoing batches of 8th, 10th and 12th classes was organized.

The function was given beautification by inviting the previous year toppers (belonging to different classes and schools) who had showed outstanding performance at the cluster level so to felicitate them, serving dual purposes of boosting their confidence to perform even better as well as giving them a chance to motivate the outgoing batches to perform better.

One among other invited toppers was also my younger sister, who had topped 8th class exams at cluster level. She surely could have served as a source of inspiration for the outgoing 8th class female folks at that moment. But the story turned out altogether a different one.

Keeping it succinct, she was informed about the event by school authorities (calling her parents), in the morning, the day programme was going to be held. Within no time, her mother made some immediate arrangements, so to help her daughter to attend such a function.

Finally, Principal of the school from where she had completed her class 8th accompanied her to GHSS and asked one of the teachers there to guide her accordingly.

Everything there happened as per schedule except one thing - my sister's name was left out unannounced.

How much embarrassment and worthlessness she would have felt during those few hours was clear from her face once I met her in the evening?

Sad, lost in her thoughts and even nervous as well as angry, she appeared, as she was certainly unable to understand whom to blame.

I instantly called the Principal who accompanied her to the function. Politely, he replied, I am myself unable to understand why they left her name unannounced.

Through him, I got the contact numbers of all the three teachers who were coordinating the programme. Whether you call it their smartness or stupidness, they all put forth a different verbal script.

First one said we were not aware about her attending the function. The second one said we actually were in a bit hurry so forgot. The third one said we actually had no details of her like name, so we couldn't make her announcement.

Puzzled with their responses, I asked third one, few questions which are till now unanswered.

First, why you all put forth three different responses?

Second, if you didn't know her whereabouts then how you informed her about the event and also how you have then arranged a gift for her (as one of the teacher said that the award is lying with me now and I will send it tomorrow)?

Third, let's suppose you don't have her name, then you could have identified her by calling just school name (is a girl belonging to the school -- who topped previous years 8th exam present here, if she is, may come forward to receive her award), but instead choose to skip this all, why?

In an uneducated language he replied, the award was not as costly as you are making out of it and besides what these awards serve? They don't have so much importance. Send your sister to our Higher Secondary tomorrow I will award her during morning assembly.

To all such kind of teachers I say, efforts put in work by any person, when recognized and respected, bring happiness as well as motivation. Efforts that mostly yield the great and desired results are actually ""priceless"", as no rate/award can ever be fixed for the emotions and struggles linked with them.

Efforts as such are made by all from a ""peasant to a lawmaker"", from a ""doctor to an administrator"", from a ""student to a teacher"" and so on.

But among all such efforts, is an effort of students, very delicate and fragile in nature, which needs ""recognition and support"", so to help them grow and succeed.

Surely awards don't have too much materialistic value, but it is the emotions that get associated with them, that motivate a person during hard times to come, that are priceless.

Surely teachers like you can't understand the value of an award, as your mind can't go beyond materialistic value.

I would suggest, if in future you host any award function, do present some valuable gifts to students, worth lakhs, so that at least you can't say after your carelessness that the awards were not so worthy.

Finally, on December 20, 2018 the same award reached through one of our close relative to my home. What wondered me again was that they had not even at this time a modicum of regret for their carelessness that humiliated and shook the confidence of a growing and budding student; as one of the teacher at this time used a new verbal script of ""unfortunately could not announce her name as it was a bit confusing one with little tough pronunciation."" How shameless they are?

The award no more belongs to my home (my sister), as it lacks all such attached emotions (confidence, strength, and enthusiasm) that it could invoke on just looking at it.

Getting it at the right time would have made it like a souvenir, worth remembering. It is now just like other ordinary items. The attached emotions of zeal, enthusiasm and dedication, which might have got attached with it, died the moment it was snatched away from my sister.

Dear teachers you have posted it on a wrong address, we don't own it anymore. The award belongs to you. Feel free to get it back any time.

P.S: Truly said, lies don't last long. As I was having an argument with the third teacher, he in his closing argument spoke his heart out, as his tongue slipped with my sister's name and I stopped him instantly and questioned how you know now my sister's name?"
"286","1025888260","2018-12-24","http://risingkashmir.com/news/what-is-wrong-with-semester-system","What is wrong with semester system?","RisingKashmir",FALSE,"Semester system has proved just an examination system with lack of in-depth teaching learning activities

Kashmir valley is quite unique in terms of its land locked nature, climatic conditions and existing political scenario. Our education system is in transition and quite vulnerable to the changing political and climatic trends. We are living in the era when technology has revolutionised the education system worldwide.

Further, we have witnessed technological revolution from black boards to digital boards with elaborate measures for teaching and evaluation.

However, we must admit the fact that we might have adopted new teaching learning processes and technologies but truly our examination system is age old and is in shambles.

We have completely failed in restoring the glory of examinations and have not been able to reform our question asking styles and evaluation system which is due to be overhauled and revised.

Various measures have been adopted to improve the college education system in our valley. The most recent one being the introduction of semester and choice based credit system in 2015.

The semester system being a flexible and proactive system with scope of continuous learning was adopted in our degree colleges as a broad major of educational reform over the old annual system.

Simultaneously, Choice Based Credit System as the new model of the academic curriculum was also introduced to enhance the college level education by flexible accumulation of credits across the subjects both for the teachers and the students.

It was perhaps introduced with the target to engage both the teachers and the students throughout the year in academic activities and back to back end semester examinations.

However, failures in its effective implementation, lack of adequate teaching hours and delay in conducting semester examinations and declaring results is evident due to multiple reasons, climate being a significant one.

Teachers too are facing a lot of problems like the overburden of teaching, evaluations, conducting research and corporate responsibilities in the institutions.

Infrastructure to support the class work for two semesters and two examinations in a year is either missing or is inadequate in Kashmir valley.

Majority of colleges particularly rural are deficit in various infrastructural facilities. Beyond November, it is very difficult to conduct classes in absence of adequate heating and lighting arrangements in the classrooms of our ailing degree colleges barring few. It is equally very tough for the students to listen their teacher under cold and crippled conditions.

Perhaps they remain under cold stress throughout the duration of the class and hampers the whole process of learning. Now who is to be blamed for this mess of the education system? It has been always felt that education is perhaps not among the priority areas of the government.

Why we don't have the classrooms with proper windows, lighting arrangement, heating facilities besides the normal aids of teaching-learning process.

We took no time to adopt the European models of education but we lag behind completely to raise the standards of our classroom infrastructure for effective teaching and learning in our institutions.

Can't our government invest much to improve the classrooms in the patterns of central heating system to enable them for post autumn and winter learning?

Such a gesture can be quite helpful in continuing with the odd-even semesterised classes beyond or during cold months.

Instead government is boosting more and more creation of colleges with less scope for the infrastructural setup in tune with the local socio-cultural setup and climate needs.

Therefore, we can surely pose question to ourselves that what has the semester system given to the students besides loss of a precious time of their academic carrier?

Overall, we can say that institutions, teachers and students failed to co-evolve themselves with the changing paradigm shift in education within this new semesterised system. It has ailed our education system which has taken the shape of a syndrome and factors and reasons are multiple and known to us.

For example, the cold climate conditions, inadequate heating arrangements in the class rooms and examination halls, effects of present socio-political turmoil, discontinuous nature of classwork due to frequent off days, and above all the delay in conducting examinations and declaring results at its proper time due to one or the other reason.

This has subsequently resulted in the unrest and psychological distress among the students who have knocked the doors of authorities on many occasions to press for their genuine demands either to roll back it or asking for concessions.

The only one affiliating university (University of Kashmir) having around a cent colleges sunder the banner of its affiliation proved quite defunct to facilitate and help in running the semester system effectively in colleges.

The University failed to manage the affairs vis-à-vis its affiliated colleges due to overburden of conducting examinations and declaring fool proof results timely.

The need is the establishment of autonomous institutions from the existing lot of colleges at least one or two from each district of the valley with decentralisation of examination burden vested with University of Kashmir.

The concerned university can act as a watch dog to monitor the various aspects of examination from paper setting through conducting to evaluation.

A college with its able leadership and qualified faculty for all practical purposes is quite competent and trustworthy to conduct the examination for its students and declare the results in stipulated time to run the odd and even semesters smoothly.

An example can be taken of the Islamia College of Science and Commerce (ICSC), Srinagar which has shown a remarkable progress in conducting examinations and declaring results well in time. Recently, the college was able to declare the results of semester 4th in just 13 odd days, which is quite rewarding.

Pertinently, ICSC is functioning as an academic autonomous institution since 2015 granted and endorsed by UGC and State Government respectively.

To conclude, it seems that semester system has not suited to our college education system and has proved just an examination system with lack of in-depth teaching learning activities.

Further, we have failed to sensitise ourselves with the needs to run the semester system and it has created problems both for the teachers and students.

No doubt a semester system provides a greater scope and freedom to enhance the quality of learning, the utmost need is to streamline the semesterised education system in accordance with our climatic and environmental conditions."

When Myanmar security forces launched its now notorious ""clearance operations"" in western Rakhine state in August 2017, it was not the first time the country's Rohingya Muslim minority had fled en masse into neighboring Bangladesh.

But a failed attempt to repatriate a first group to Myanmar in November and the construction of solid, concrete buildings on an island off the Bangladeshi coast signal an entirely new situation is emerging: a Palestine-like scenario with a permanent, stateless and impoverished refugee population ripe for exploitation by extremist groups in South and Southeast Asia.The dailyReport Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox

More than 720,000 Rohingyas fled Myanmar's brutal security force crackdown, adding to another few hundred thousand that were already in Bangladesh. The United Nations has indicated the forced expulsion represented crimes against humanity and may have been driven by ""genocidal intent.""

A first batch of 2,200 refugees was supposed to have been repatriated on November 15, but none agreed to return if their demands for citizenship and justice for the atrocities they had been subjected to were met.

That, of course, was a non-starter as the government in Naypyitaw is highly unlikely to grant the Rohingya, who they consider illegal migrants from Bangladesh, citizenship or accept responsibility for an offensive security officials say was a legitimate response to Rohingya insurgent attacks on border guard posts.

Myanmar's military leaders, now struggling to stay out of the reach of The Hague's International Criminal Court, where they could potentially face genocide charges for their 2017 crackdown, have not faced any moves domestically to seek justice for the widespread death and destruction.

Plans to relocate as many as 100,000 Rohingya refugees to Bangladesh's Bhasan Char Island would ease pressure on the overcrowded camps on the Myanmar border, but it is unclear how refugees with few skills and no resources would survive on a small, isolated and barren island located in one of the world's most cyclone-prone areas.

Construction on the island is reportedly proceeding apace, although no relocation is expected to take place before Bangladesh's general election on December 30. Rohingya refugees are already reportedly reluctant to move to the island.

The election will also decide whether the more secular Awami League remains in power, or if the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which includes among its top allies Islamic groups such as the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, will take over.

The situation today is in sharp contrast to 1978 and 1991-1992, when hundreds of thousands of Rohingyas similarly fled persecution to Bangladesh. In 1978, the Myanmar government launched an operation code-named Naga Min, or King of Dragons, which aimed at identifying illegal immigrants across the country.

The campaign began in Kachin and Shan states, where many Chinese were believed to have taken shelter, but it quickly turned into a massive violent crackdown on the Rohingyas when the military reached Rakhine state.

Despite reports of rape, arson and murder, the then ruling military got support from even its most vocal domestic critics, who shared the view that the Rohingyas are not indigenous but rather ""Bengali settlers"" from Bangladesh.

An estimated 200,000 Rohingyas fled across the border, but were allowed to return when Myanmar and Bangladesh, after a stream of protests mainly from Islamic countries leading to intervention by the United Nations, reached an agreement in July 1978.

Many, however, filtered back into Bangladesh when they found that their old homes in Myanmar had been razed and their land had been taken over by new ethnic Burman or Rakhine settlers. In early 1991, thousands of Rohingyas once again began streaming across the border, bringing with them tales of forcible eviction from their homes, and the destruction of mosques and Islamic schools.

By 1992, more than 200,000 refugees were living in makeshift camps across the border in Bangladesh until a repatriation agreement was reached under the auspices of the United Nations. During the 1992 crisis, Prince Khaled Sultan Abdul Aziz, commander of the Saudi contingent in the 1991 Gulf War, visited Dhaka and lashed out against the Myanmar government for its persecution of the Rohingyas.

Then, he publicly recommended a ""Desert Storm-like"" action against Myanmar, similar to the US military intervention that liberated Kuwait from Iraqi occupation. No such action was taken against Myanmar, but it was a clear sign of the wider Muslim world's interest in the Rohingyas plight.

The first was in 1978, when the immensely wealthy Saudi Arabian charity Rabitat-al-Alam-al-Islami sent aid to the refugees and built a hospital, mosque and madrasa for them at Ukhia, south of Cox's Bazar in southeastern Bangladesh.

Saudi religious teachers were sent to Ukhia, and the radicalization of some Rohingya leaders and activists began. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the Rohingya Solidarity Organization (RSO), the main militant group among them, forged links with the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and, especially, its even more radical youth wing, the Islami Chhatra Shibir.

With those new connections, the RSO also contacted Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hizb-e-Islami in Afghanistan and likeminded organizations in Pakistan, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Afghan instructors were even sent to RSO's camp near Ukhia, while about a hundred RSO militants went to Afghanistan to undergo military training with Hizb-e-Islami in the province of Khost.

Today's main political and military organization among the Rohingyas, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) or, as it is better known locally, Harakah al-Yaqin -- the Faith Movement -- has its roots in radical milieus in Karachi, Pakistan.

There, several hundred thousand first, second and third generation Rohingyas, many descendants of Muslims who left Myanmar after World War II, live in impoverished suburbs. Nearly all of them are stateless, although they have lived in Pakistan for generations, with most of them born in the country.

The areas where the Rohingya live in Karachi have long served as hotbeds for extremist activities; many were among those recruited to fight in the wars in Afghanistan. ARSA's leader, Ataullah abu Ammar Junjuni, also known as Hafiz Tohar, was born in Karachi and received madrasa education in Saudi Arabia.

According to recent reports from the camps in Bangladesh, the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen (JMB), an Islamic organization operating in Bangladesh which is listed as a terror group in the United Kingdom, is bidding to cultivate links with the Rohingyas.

JMB is believed to have been involved in several bomb attacks in Bangladesh and its stated aim is to replace the country's democracy with an Islamic state based on Sharia law.

It is uncertain to what extent the group has been able to link up with militants among the Rohingyas, but the Bangladesh Daily Star reported on December 13 that the country's Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) unit had arrested three JMB members who were ""providing training to Rohingya refugees.""

A CTTC official was quoted as saying that the JMB has ""been working in the Rohingya camps"" with its military chief ""providing training to refugees since 2016."" Those accusations could augur a militant response when Myanmar's civil and military authorities refuse to yield to the demands of the refugees, including their calls for citizenship and justice.

The radicalization of Rohingyas, which began in the late 1970s, is bound to continue in the current Palestine-like situation. Analysts say that could lead to more ARSA cross-border raids, similar to the ones in August last year that prompted the Myanmar military to unleash its campaign of terror in Rohingya-inhabited areas of northern Rakhine state.

A permanent refugee population in Bangladesh, and possible alliances between various groups of militants, could also have grave implications for the domestic security situation in that country, similar to the volatility seen in Lebanon and other Middle Eastern countries where Palestinian refugees have been languishing for more than half a century.

Hitting out at Naveen Patnaik's BJD government in Odisha, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday alleged the ""demon of corruption"" has become strong in the state with an all-pervading 'percentage commission culture'.

Virtually sounding a poll bugle in Odisha where state elections would coincide with the national polls next year, Modi alleged that inefficiency and corruption have kept the state backwards despite assistance from the Centre and sought to know who is ""feeding and patronising the demon of corruption"".

Modi was addressing a BJP rally in Khurda town near the state capital Bhubaneshwar after launching a slew of projects for the state and releasing a stamp and a coin to commemorate Odisha's 1817 Paika rebellion.

""Demon of corruption in the form of chit fund scams and PC (percentage commission) culture has grown strong in Odisha,"" he said.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has declared Odisha as a priority state for the state as well as Lok Sabha elections. Naveen Patnaik of Biju Janata Dal (BJD) has been at the helm of affairs since 2000 in the state and will be seeking a fifth term as CM next year.

In a stinging attack on the BJD government, Modi said, ""The Centre has launched a slew of projects and pumped in huge funds for Odisha's development, but despite all these, the state is lagging behind.""

Modi inaugurated a new IIT-Bhubaneswar campus and launched projects worth over Rs 145 billion in Odisha, which he said would accelerate the state's development and make the state an engine for transformation of the country into a 'New India'.

Accusing the state government of inaction on the 'Swachh Bharat' (Clean India) campaign, Modi said the country has achieved 97 per cent 'swachhata' (cleanliness), but Odisha is lagging far behind other states in becoming 'Open Defecation Free (ODF)'.

Claiming that children are suffering from malnutrition in the state, he said farmers are struggling due to lack of remunerative prices for their produce and in absence of proper irrigation facilities.

Modi alleged the state government has failed to provide safe drinking water to the people, while teachers are forced to agitate against denial of adequate salary due to the government's apathy.

The prime minister also alleged the Odisha government's refusal to join the 'Ayushman Bharat' scheme deprived people of the state of free healthcare benefits.

""People of the state want to know as to why Odisha government refused to link with Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana which would have enabled them to get free medical treatment outside the state,"" Modi said at the rally.

He said Odias would have availed of free medical facilities up to Rs 500,000 in major hospitals outside if the state had joined the scheme.

Stating that around 600,000 people have benefitted from the Centre's flagship health care scheme, Modi said, ""I regret that not a single Odia is among the beneficiaries.""

Asserting that the Centre is committed to strengthening healthcare services in Odisha, Modi said his government has taken steps for setting up five medical colleges in the state.

Modi, who earlier in the day dedicated a 100-bed revamped and upgraded ESI Hospital to the nation readied as a cost of Rs 735.1 million, said the state government should also wake up to meet the people's needs.

Affirming the Centre's commitment to all-round development of Odisha, Modi said a whopping Rs 15 million is being invested in the oil and petroleum sector in the state which would make it the country's petro-hub.

While a plastic park and polypropylene project are coming up in Paradip near the Indian Oil refinery, a bio-fuel plant is being set up in Bargarh and a strategic oil reserve is being established in Chandikhole, he said.

The prime minister also laid foundation stones for two projects -- Indian Oil's pipeline from Paradip to Hyderabad at a projected cost of Rs 38 billion and GAIL's gas pipeline from Angul to Bokaro in Jharkhand at a projected cost of Rs 34.37 billion under the Urja Ganga Yojana.

Modi said people in 19 districts of the state would be able to get cheap piped cooking gas with the spread of these pipeline projects.

Asserting that the Centre is taking all steps to strengthen connectivity and road networks in Odisha, Modi said Rs 43.61 billion is being spent for four National Highway projects of 263 km to streamline traffic and check mishaps in the state.

Central funds for infrastructure projects in the state have been increased five times during the BJP-led NDA government, he said. New highways, rail lines and airports are coming up in the state due to the Centre's initiative, he said.

Noting that 35 lakh free LPG connections have been provided to the poor people in the state, Modi said 70 per cent of the state population use cooking gas now, as against only 20 per cent earlier, and the aim is to reach all.

PM Modi Takes a Swipe at Naveen Patnaik Govt in Odisha Rally","News18",FALSE,"Khurda (Odisha): Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday took a dig at the Naveen Patnaik government in Odisha, saying the ""demon of corruption"" had become strong in various sectors in the state.

Sounding the poll bugle in Odisha where state elections will coincide with the national polls next year, Modi alleged that inefficiency and corruption has kept the state backward despite assistance from the Centre and sought to know who is ""feeding and patronising the demon of corruption"".

Modi was addressing a BJP rally in Khurda town near the state capital Bhubaneswar after launching a slew of projects for the state and releasing a stamp and a coin to commemorate Odisha's 1817 Paika rebellion. ""Demon of corruption in the form of chit fund scams and PC (percentage commission) culture has grown strong in Odisha,"" he said.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has declared Odisha as a priority state for the state as well as Lok Sabha elections. Naveen Patnaik of Biju Janata Dal (BJD) has been at the helm of affairs since 2000 in the state and will be seeking a fifth term as CM next year.

In a stinging attack on the BJD government, Modi said, ""The Centre has launched a slew of project and pumped in huge funds for Odisha's development, but despite all these, the state is lagging behind.""

The Prime Minister said people are realising there is a wave for change to take the state to a new path of progress and development and the people here, including farmers and women, are raising their voice.

Modi inaugurated a new IIT-Bhubaneswar campus and launched projects worth over Rs 14,500 crore in Odisha, which he said would accelerate the state's development and make the state an engine for transformation of the country into a 'New India'.

Accusing the state government of inaction on the 'Swahh Bharat' (Clean India) campaign, Modi said the country has achieved 97 per cent 'swachhata' (cleanliness), but Odisha is lagging far behind other states in becoming 'Open Defecation Free (ODF)'.

Claiming that children are suffering from malnutrition in the state, he said farmers are struggling due to lack of remunerative prices for their produce and in absence of proper irrigation facilities.

Modi alleged the state government has failed to provide safe drinking water to the people, while teachers are forced to agitate against denial of adequate salary due to the government's apathy.

The PM also alleged the Odisha government's refusal to join the 'Ayushman Bharat' scheme deprived people of the state of free healthcare benefits. ""People of the state want to know as to why Odisha government refused to link with Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana which would have enabled them to get free medical treatment outside the state,"" Modi said at the rally.

He said Odias would have availed free medical facilities up to Rs five lakh in major hospitals outside if the state had joined the scheme. Stating that around six lakh people have benefitted from the Centre's flagship health care scheme, Modi said, ""I regret that not a single Odia is among the beneficiaries.""

Asserting that the Centre is committed to strengthen healthcare services in Odisha, Modi said his government has taken steps for setting up five medical colleges in the state.

Modi, who earlier in the day dedicated a 100-bed revamped and upgraded ESI Hospital to the nation readied as a cost of Rs 73.51 crore, said the state government should also wake up to meet the people's needs.

Affirming the Centre's commitment to an all-round development of Odisha, Modi said a whopping Rs 1.5 crore is being invested in oil and petroleum sector in the state which would make it the country's petro-hub.

While a plastic park and polypropylene project are coming up in Paradip near the Indian Oil refinery, a bio-fuel plant is being set up in Bargarh and a strategic oil reserve is being established in Chandikhole, he said.

The Prime Minister also laid foundation stones for two projects -- Indian Oil's pipeline from Paradip to Hyderabad at a projected cost of Rs 3,800 crore and GAIL's gas pipeline from Angul to Bokaro in Jharkhand at a projected cost of Rs 3,437 crore under the Urja Ganga Yojana. Modi said people in 19 districts of the state would be able to get cheap piped cooking gas with spread of these pipeline projects.

Asserting that the Centre is taking all steps to strengthen connectivity and road networks in Odisha, Modi said Rs 4,361 crore is being spent for four National Highway projects of 263 kms to streamline traffic and check mishaps in the state.

Central funds for infrastructure projects in the state have been increased five times during the BJP-led NDA government, he said. New highways, rail lines and airports are coming up in the state due to Centre's initiative, he said.

Noting that 35 lakh free LPG connections have been provided to the poor people in the state, Modi said 70 per cent of the state population use cooking gas now, as against only 20 per cent earlier, and aim is to reach all. He alleged the BJD government was neglecting farmers and pitched for a mandate for the BJP to take the state forward to a path of development.

Modi alleged the state government has failed to fulfil the 2014 election promise to provide irrigation facilities to additional 10 lakh hectare of land."

Substance abuse, Insolvency, banking fraud, ethical hacking, terrorism negotiation were introduced across Indian universities this year.

From cybercrime to criminal justice and technology, forensic audit to de-addiction - in the passing year 2018, many courses related to crime was launched by Indian institutions. While earlier such programmes were meant for those working with defence or police, in recent years there is a surge in demand and universities are coming with unique programmes to detect cyber frauds.

These courses are open for everyone showcasing how important is for students to learn to safeguard and defend themselves and others.

The Council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) launched a certificate course in forensic accounting and fraud detection. Within few months of its launch, the course has already registered over 6,000 people. This course was aimed for only ICAI registered CAS but due to high demand, employees of IOCL and HPCL got registration. The ICAI has launched Data Analytics/ Forensic Analytics Labs at Noida, Hyderabad, Kanpur, Chennai, Kolkata and Chandigarh already.

ICAI president, Naveen ND Gupta, said, ""The course is created by experts from the field of accountancy and law keeping in mind the emerging economic scenarios. Specialisation in this area is much sought-after considering increasing incidents of cybercrime and fraud detection. It is the practice of utilising accounting, auditing, CAATs/ Data Mining Tools and investigative skills to detect frauds.""

There was a rise in cyber crimes this year. A total of 30 people were arrested in cyber crimes out of which 12 were juvenile, according to the National Crime Bureau report. The data collected is till August 2018. According to NCR crime in India 2016 report, there has been a rise of 3 per cent in crimes committed 2014-15 3 per cent and a 2.6 per cent rise in crimes committed in 2015-16, showing a continuous uprise.

A total of 31,396 cases were registered against juveniles in 2015, almost double the number in 2001.

Keeping this scenario in mind, Punjabi University at Patiala started a course on substance abuse in October this year. So far, 35 candidates have registered. The university also conducts a course in HIV awareness which had witnessed the maximum strength up to 26 students. Those who enrol in substance abuse courses will be sent to do field work in which they will be asked to spread the message of prevention against drug abuse.

On completion of the course, one can work at a rehab centre or as a psychotherapist in government, private and not for profit organisations.

Naina Sharma, assistant professor, Punjabi University said, ""The course was introduced keeping in mind the spreading epidemic of substance abuse. To our surprise, a large number of school teachers enrolled for the course showing how deeply rooted the issue is and the need for early intervention.""

Managing director of a corporate security and risk consulting firm - Netrika, Sanjay Kaushik, highlighted while there is an increase in number of courses related to physical, digital and social security in India, most of them are introduced as short-term and additional level, however, a formal and in-depth training is required in the fields. ""India still lacks formal training in security-related courses. Even today, people do not consider it to be a full-term primary career choice.""

Netrika launched several programmes including certified anti-terrorism specialists, crime prevention specialist. PEACE interview and investigation technique, corporate security management specialist among others. There has been a rise in enrolment up to 17 per cent for these courses. While Netrika has global association including the forensic investigation services, Unites States of America, Gujarat Forensic Sciences University is the only Indian university to tie-up with the India-based firm.

""While the crime keeps increasing at a high rate, the pace of defence is not as high. Every organisation including corporate houses host such mandatory coaching, the approach remains theoretical. It is important to teach students in an artificial atmosphere how to handle an adverse situation,"" he adds.

Among most unique crime courses was 'Insolvency Associates' launched and designed by Ministry of Skill Development, the course is not yet open to learners. The ministry is in talks with the University of Delhi (DU) to initiate the course. The aim of the course is to impart knowledge about insolvency law and catch financial frauds. DU this year had also launched a centre for cyber crimes. The centre provides a postgraduate diploma in cybersecurity and law.

The event kicked-off with a grand Inaugural Function accompanied by a Cultural Program on December 22nd, at the Chitkara University, Punjab Campus. Dr SK Das, Director, IIT Ropar, was the Chief Guest at the occasion.

On December 23rd, the day started with the National Olympics Briefing, followed by the distribution of 'Jet Toy' and 'Skimmer' kits to students. The chief guest for the day was Dr. Bala Bhardwaj, Managing Director, R & D, Boeing India. In all, around 320 students and teachers from 37 regions from India, actively participated in the track events (37 Jet Toy Teams and 28 Skimmer Teams) and made innovative 'toys' using their creative thinking skills, with special AWIM kits. The participating students worked as teams, applying scientific design concepts and exploring the principles of Physics such as force, momentum, friction, Jet Propulsion, etc. to create moving vehicles like 'Skimmer' and 'Balloon-powered Jet-Toy Cars'. The 'toys' were judged on the basis of their performance in different tracks.

A glittering Valedictory Ceremony complemented with beautiful cultural performances brought the event to a close, on a high note. The National Winners for the event were Modern Education Society English Medium School, Nashik, in the 'Jet Toy' category; and Swami Swarupanand Vidyamandir School, Ratnagiri, in the 'Skimmer' category.

AWIM is a contest where fun and challenge are the two main ingredients. This innovative, hands-on, physical science curriculum was designed by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), USA. After USA, India is the second country to conduct the competition at the National Level for students. Many corporations across the industry have committed their resources to support AWIM. Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI), Mahindra & Mahindra, ARAI, Trim India, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, John Deere, Eaton, etc., in India, have backed the event in different cities of India and provided engineers who voluntarily mentored students and teachers.

Even the giant teddy bear at the mall entrance wasn't spared, said Ma Jun, who works at a tutoring company in the building.

""Everything is gone and cleaned,"" she said.

Christmas continues to be a shopping festival across most of China, with huge trees adorning shopping malls in Shanghai and Beijing, but a growing emphasis on traditional culture by the ruling Communist Party and the systematic suppression of religion under President Xi Jinping are imperiling Santa Claus's position.

At least four Chinese cities and one county have ordered restrictions on Christmas celebrations this year, according to official notices and interviews. Students, teachers and parents from 10 schools around China said Christmas celebrations have been curtailed.

""The ongoing local reaction against Christmas is part of the wider sentiment since Xi took power,"" said Zi Yang, a China expert at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.

Xi is trying to broaden the appeal of the Communist Party by casting it as a crusader for Chinese tradition in a fast-changing world, he said. ""Therefore, foreign cultural elements such as Christmas are placed on the chopping block.""

The seasonal humbug follows similar outbreaks of anti-Christmas rhetoric in 2014 and 2017. It appears not to be centrally organised, but rather a spreading resistance to foreign festivals by local authorities seeking to align themselves with the growing tide of cultural nationalism.

The squeeze on Christmas is an example of how efforts to ""normalise"" thinking bleed into the everyday lives of many Chinese. That push exploded into view this year through re-education camps for Uighur Muslims and a crackdown on Christian churches that has continued with force in recent weeks.

In Nanyang, about 950 kilometers (600 miles) west of Shanghai, government officials stopped by the office and shopping complex on 16 December to say that Christmas decorations would have to come down, said Ma, the tutoring company employee.

An official from the city's urban management bureau hung up when asked for comment.

Nine hours by car south, Hengyang, a city in Hunan province, said in a 19 December notice posted on an official government social media account that anyone caught holding Christmas sales or celebrations that blocked the streets would be punished. Communist Party members, the notice said, should avoid foreign festivals and instead be ""models of adherence to Chinese traditional culture."" Hengyang police posted a video on their official social media account of locals discussing the importance of Chinese culture and plans to avoid ostentatious Christmas celebrations.

Langfang city, just south of Beijing, banned Christmas stage performances and merchandising promotions, according to a notice circulated on social media.

Shop windows were to be stripped of Christmas stickers and streets kept free of Christmas banners and lights. Law enforcement patrols were to be stepped up 23-25 December to prevent illegal signs of celebration.

The Langfang urban management bureau declined comment. The state-run Global Times newspaper argued that Western media are exaggerating China's crackdown on Christmas and reported that the restrictions in Langfang were aimed not at Christmas but at cleaning up roadside stalls and migrant vendors in hopes of winning a ""National Civilized City"" award from the Communist Party.

Some 270 kilometers (167 miles) west, Fuping county, also in Hebei province, issued a similar clean-up notice. Though the 21 December announcement mentions Christmas eleven times, an official from the Fuping urban management bureau said the rules were aimed at street vendors generally, not Christmas.

Police in the Panlong district of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province in southern China, circulated a notice that hotels, karaoke parlors, internet cafes, bars and other crowded places must prohibit Christmas-related decorations and activities.

""It is forbidden to hang Christmas stockings, wear Christmas hats, place Christmas trees, and so on,"" the notice read.

It wasn't clear if the notice applied to all of Kunming city, though a police officer told the AP that the order to circulate it came from city officials.

Reverend Jonathan Liu, founder of the Chinese Christian Fellowship of Righteousness, a California nonprofit, said the pushback against Christmas reflects Xi's efforts to ""Sinicize"" religion.

Preachers are coached on how to convey Communist Party core values in their sermons and national flags and songs have been injected into some church services, he said.

Liu provided the AP with a notice sent to churches in Zhoukou, a city to the east of Nanyang in Henan province.

It tells churches to vet Christmas plans with the government, forbids minors from participating in Christmas events and caps expenses at 2000 yuan ($290). ""I wish you all a happy Christmas! God bless you,"" read the notice, which Liu received from a pastor in China.

An official at the United Front Work Department in Zhoukou referred queries to the religious affairs bureau, which could not be reached for comment.

Before becoming president, Xi went to Finland in 2010 and was photographed with Santa Claus. That kind of chumminess appears to be a thing of Christmas past, experts say.

The central government issued guidelines last year for a cultural revival project that calls for a marked boost in the international influence of Chinese traditional culture by 2025.

""You have a culturally conservative ethos in the country that has definitely been encouraged by the central party-state,"" said Guo Yingjie, a professor of Chinese studies at the University of Sydney. ""It's not hard for university presidents or officials to say, 'OK celebrating Christmas can easily be seen as de-Sinification or promoting Western culture.'""

Students have taken to social media to complain about restrictions on Christmas celebrations at their schools.

At a top Shanghai university, a student union had its Christmas plans cancelled for the first time, an organizer told the AP on condition of anonymity, fearing rebuke.

The students came up with a solution: By replacing ""Christmas"" with ""New Year's"" in their activity proposal and changing the date from 25 December, it sailed past school administrators.

Students in the city of Qingdao were reprimanded for hosting an event about gratitude on Thanksgiving Day and warned not to celebrate Christmas publicly, according to a student, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retribution.

Liu Kaiming, president of the Institute of Contemporary Observation, a civil society group in the city of Shenzhen, said that despite the drumbeat of official discontent, Christmas cheer continues to spread in China.

""The sound of resistance is more powerful on the surface, but it has no practical effect,"" he said. ""Young people's enthusiasm for the festival is ever-increasing.""

""The state government is misusing the official machinery for gathering a crowd for the PM's proposed rally on December 27 in Dharamshala,"" Bali, a senior Congress leader, told reporters in Kangra.

Bali claimed that all sub-divisional magistrates in the state have been asked to ensure a large gathering of people to attend the prime minister's rally.

For this, the officials have been asked to identify beneficiaries of various government schemes and arrange for their to-and-fro travel to the prime minister's rally site from all nooks and corners of the state, he added.

The Aayog said the quality of health professional training and adherence to standards is sub-optimal, including in the private sector.

To address the shortage of doctors in the country, the Aayog has suggested creating conditions to facilitate import of doctors, especially those of Indian origin working abroad, and also deploying teachers from universities abroad as visiting professors at AIIMS or NIEs while linking at least 40 per cent of district hospitals with medical colleges.

It also suggested developing framework for deployment of doctors and specialists from the private sector to government hospitals on a visiting or honorary basis and expanding the system of Diplomate of National Board (DNB) and Diplomas from College of Physicians and Surgeons (CPS).

The government enhanced the retirement age of the latter by two years in 2014; it should be increased in the same proportion for college teachers,"" Chitta Mohapatra, general secretary of Aongctea, said.

He also demanded the implementation of the 7th Pay Commission for teachers and other employees of colleges in the state from January 1, 2016. ""The government had implemented it from October 2017 for college employees. As a result, we lost out on the increased salary for 21 months. We demand that the government pay the increased salary from January 2016,"" he added.

The association also called for the promotion of lecturers to readers after 18 years of service instead of the existing 27 years, abolition of the block grant system and payment of full grant to the block grant colleges, and promotion of the non-teaching staffs of the colleges.

Mohapatra said, ""Around 18,000 teaching and non-teaching staff of the non-government colleges across the state have drawn the attention of the government to their problems from time to time. But the government did not pay heed to their demands.""

Food, consumer welfare and cooperatives minister S N Patro and former higher education minister and MLA (Gopalpur) Pradeep Kumar Panigrahy, who were guests at the conference, assured that they would talk to the minister concerned, Ananta Das, about the demands of the association."

""NDA seals deal for Lok Sabha seat-sharing in Bihar"" reads a headline in The Hindu. Hindustan Times leads with it too, reporting the alliance's reformation after Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) left to join the Congress. In the latest development, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Janata Dal (United) will take 17 seats each, while the Lok Janshakti Party -- the newest entrant into the seat sharing deal -- will field candidates for the remaining six. That makes 40 in total.

""The Bharatiya Janata Party's pact with Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) has cemented the wider National Democratic Alliance equation in Bihar"", HT writes in its editorial, ""Only an inclusive NDA -- which has the BJP in senior role as the anchor but not as a hegemonic partner -- can help the party deal with the Opposition challenge.""

In its 'Explained' box, the Indian Express says, ""Ram Vilas Paswan is an important Dalit leader, and his exit would have sent a wrong signal. With the other prominent Dalit leader, Mayawati, firmly against the BJP, the ruling alliance needs a counter balance. Conceding a Rajya Sabha seat to the LJP is not a big ask for the political optics.""

The Express leads with an investigation that finds that the suicide rate in government sponsored Navodaya schools is higher than the national average, at 5.5. Of the 49 students who have committed suicide in the last 5 years, half are Dalit and tribal.

""For every one lakh students studying in these schools, almost six students committed suicide in 2017. This is slightly higher than the national suicide rate for a similar age group in 2015 -- roughly 3 suicides per lakh population aged 6 to 17 years,"" says the report.

""The causes of suicides in JNVs are disparate and range from unrequited love, family problems, corporal punishment or humiliation by teachers, academic pressure, depression, and fight between friends. Of these, the first three are cited most often as reasons behind suicides,"" adds the report.

The Times of India's biggest story of the day is the government's ""last mile push for Ayodhya resolution in SC"". Within, it writes, ""The forceful stance will reflect the state government's, as also the Modi government's, empathy for the urgency with which VHP with the strong backing of RSS -- has taken up its long pending demand for a Ram temple in Ayodhya in recent weeks.""

The BJP hasn't conceded to demands for an ordinance on the matter, ""but the anticipated thrust in the Supreme Court can well be the last opportunity to get a verdict ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections,"" writes TOI.

Also making headlines is the government's decision to monitor online content more closely. In ""Govt moves to access and trace all 'unlawful' content online"", The Indian Express reports that amendments to the Information Technology Act could ""make it mandatory for online platforms to ""proactively"" deploy technology, which would enable a ferreting of content seen as ""unlawful"". They also require end-to-end encryption to be broken so that the origin of messages can be traced.""

The report follows orders by the Union government last week, giving ten intelligence agencies the green signal to ""intercept, monitor and decrypt any information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer.""

TOI is not pleased and says so in its editorial. ""This needs to be tested against the recent nine-judge bench judgment of the Supreme Court, which ruled the right to privacy was integral to the fundamental right to life,"" it writes. ""At the very least, circumstances permitting such surveillance must be very clearly and narrowly defined. Moreover, a measure of judicial oversight can be brought in as well. In the US, security agencies require a court order to read unopened emails. India should consider similar safeguards,"" it said.

The acquittal of all those accused in the Sohrabuddin encounter case finds place in The Hindu's lengthy editorial, calling it the ""failure of justice"". ""It is the prosecution's duty to ensure the safety of witnesses and give them the confidence and courage to speak the truth under oath. While it is perhaps not surprising that witnesses in the police did not support the prosecution, it is disappointing that others could not be encouraged to do so.""

India Today

India Today anchor Pooja Shali discussed whether the BJP-led Union government is targeting Congress-ruled states. Congress governments in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan are believed to be facing issues on the agriculture front in the middle of the rabi season due to shortage of urea in several districts.

Congress spokesperson Vinayak Dalmiya said that BJP is trying to punish the farmers while party spokesperson Aman Sinha commented that charges made against BJP government is baseless.

Dalmiya said, ""This is completely against the principle of cooperative federalism, as BJP has lost in these states due to agrarian crisis they want to punish the farmers.""

Sinha said, ""Why are only the Congress governed states facing money shortage? They are making baseless acquisitions.""

Republic TV

On his show, Republic TV anchor Arnab Goswami asked who has a bigger role in saving democracy -- the government or the opposition.

Goswami said, ""The pseudo-liberal media remained completely kept quiet when Calcutta High Court did not allow BJP to carry out rath yatra in West Bengal.""

Writer Saira Shah Halim pointed out that there is terrorism taking place in the name of cow in the country, while BJP spokesperson Syed Zafar Islam said that pseudo-liberal media does not want to talk about development work done in the last four and a half years.

Halim said, ""It's about time we rephrase our verbiage. There's no such thing as cow vigilantism, it's cow terrorism.""

Islam said, ""You don't want to talk about all the good work we have done in four and a half years. Hence, they talk about cow vigilantism.""

Aaj Tak

Aaj Tak anchor Sweta Singh interviewed Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot on the show Seedhi Baat.

Singh asked Pilot if Congress would form a coalition to defeat the BJP-led NDA in the upcoming 2019 general elections.

Pilot replied, ""A rainbow coalition is being made in the country. Very soon you will see all the opposition parties of the country uniting.""

He also pointed out that only Congress can confront BJP at the national stage. As regional parties are also important these days, Congress is willing to ""give and take"".

When asked if Congress would be able to secure majority in the general elections, Pilot replied, ""No matter what, do remember that BJP is not going to form the government.""

Sarva Siksha Mission has already taken up the project of restoring the Grade IIB heritage building and the renovation work was started on Saturday. The state government has already identified this school, where an English medium primary section will be started from the next academic year along with the existing Bengali medium section.

Chairman of Sarva Siksha Mission and primary school council, Kartik Manna, said: ""The project of restoring the heritage school was taken up under the initiative of chief minister Mamata Banerjee and education minister Partha

Chatterjee. At present, we are renovating three rooms, where classes will be held from January 2. Gradually, we will renovate and restoretheentirebuilding."" Manna also said that the belongings of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar will also be preserved and kept on the school premises.

Three teachers have already been recruited for the English medium section of the school. Teacher-in-charge Ritopa Bhattacharya is happy with how things have taken shape. She thanked the state government for its timely intervention, which will not only save the school but also the ageold building. She felt that with 25 students, the future of the school looked bleak. ""But the decision to open an English medium section and restore the age-old institution is like a ray of hope,"" she added.

Despite being a heritage building, KMC pulled down a dilapidated portion of the Burrabazar branch of the Metropolitan Institution on April7 as it posed threat to public. But a timely intervention of the residents and the members of Purono Kolkata'r Golpo (PKG), a Facebook group, saved the building from demolition.

Swarnali Chattopadhyay, admin of the group, said, ""It is a proud moment for us as our initiative of restoring Metropolitan Institution has finally paid off. We proved that common citizens can do wonders if there is a will to bring about a change.""

Ellora Saha, councillor of the area, said it was her duty to restore the glory of the school. ""On Friday, I got the news of the school's restoration and was very happy.

""Therefore, foreign cultural elements such as Christmas are placed on the chopping block.""

It took less than 24 hours for all the Christmas trees, lights and bells to disappear from a 27-story shopping and office complex in the Chinese city of Nanyang.

Even the giant teddy bear at the mall entrance wasn't spared, said Ma Jun, who works at a tutoring company in the building. ""Everything is gone and cleaned,"" she said.

Christmas continues to be a shopping festival across most of China, with huge trees adorning shopping malls in Shanghai and Beijing, but a growing emphasis on traditional culture by the ruling Communist Party and the systematic suppression of religion under President Xi Jinping are imperiling Santa Claus's position.

At least four Chinese cities and one county have ordered Christmas decorations banned this year, according to official notices and interviews. Students, teachers and parents from 10 schools around China told The Associated Press that Christmas celebrations have been curtailed.

""The ongoing local reaction against Christmas is part of the wider sentiment since Xi took power,"" said Zi Yang, a China expert at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.

Xi is trying to broaden the appeal of the Communist Party by casting it as a crusader for Chinese tradition in a fast-changing world, he said. ""Therefore, foreign cultural elements such as Christmas are placed on the chopping block.""

The seasonal humbug follows similar outbreaks of anti-Christmas rhetoric in 2014 and 2017. It appears not to be centrally organised, but rather a spreading resistance to foreign festivals by local authorities seeking to align themselves with the growing tide of cultural nationalism.

The squeeze on Christmas is an example of how efforts to ""normalise"" thinking bleed into the everyday lives of many Chinese. That push exploded into view this year through re-education camps for Uighur Muslims and a crackdown on Christian churches that has continued with force in recent weeks.

In Nanyang, about 950 kilometers west of Shanghai, government officials stopped by the office and shopping complex on December 16 to say that Christmas decorations would have to come down, said Ma, the tutoring company employee.

An official from the city's urban management bureau hung up when asked for comment.

Nine hours by car south, Hengyang, a city in Hunan province, said in a December 19 notice posted on an official government social media account that anyone caught holding Christmas sales or celebrations that blocked the streets would be punished.

Communist Party members, the notice said, should avoid foreign festivals and instead be ""models of adherence to Chinese traditional culture."" Hengyang police posted a video on their official social media account of locals discussing the importance of Chinese culture and plans to avoid ostentatious Christmas celebrations.

Langfang city, just south of Beijing, banned Christmas stage performances and merchandising promotions, according to a notice circulated on social media.

Shop windows were to be stripped of Christmas stickers and streets kept free of Christmas banners and lights. Law enforcement patrols were to be stepped up Dec. 23-25 to prevent illegal signs of celebration.

The Langfang urban management bureau declined comment. The state-run Global Times newspaper argued that Western media are exaggerating China's crackdown on Christmas and reported that the restrictions in Langfang were aimed not at Christmas but at cleaning up roadside stalls and migrant vendors in hopes of winning a ""National Civilized City"" award from the Communist Party.

Some 270 kilometers west, Fuping county, also in Hebei province, issued a similar clean-up notice. Though the December 21 announcement mentions Christmas eleven times, an official from the Fuping urban management bureau said the rules were aimed at street vendors generally, not Christmas.

Police in the Panlong district of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province in southern China, circulated a notice that hotels, karaoke parlors, internet cafes, bars and other crowded places must prohibit Christmas-related decorations and activities. ""It is forbidden to hang Christmas stockings, wear Christmas hats, place Christmas trees, and so on,"" the notice read.

It wasn't clear if the notice applied to all of Kunming city, though a police officer told the AP that the order to circulate it came from city officials.

Reverend Jonathan Liu, founder of the Chinese Christian Fellowship of Righteousness, a California nonprofit, said the pushback against Christmas reflects Xi's efforts to ""Sinicize"" religion.

Preachers are coached on how to convey Communist Party core values in their sermons and national flags and songs have been injected into some church services, he said. Liu provided the AP with a notice sent to churches in Zhoukou, a city to the east of Nanyang in Henan province.

It tells churches to vet Christmas plans with the government, forbids minors from participating in Christmas events and caps expenses at 2000 yuan (USD 290). ""I wish you all a happy Christmas! God bless you,"" read the notice, which Liu received from a pastor in China.

An official at the United Front Work Department in Zhoukou referred queries to the religious affairs bureau, which could not be reached for comment.

Before becoming president, Xi went to Finland in 2010 and was photographed with Santa Claus. That kind of chumminess appears to be a thing of Christmas past, experts say.

Jashn-e-Rekhta, an organisation dedicated to the preservation and promotion of the Urdu language, its literature and culture, recently concluded its 5th edition in Delhi last week. Jashn-e-Rekhta, which literally means 'the festival of Urdu', has been extremely successful in attracting huge audiences to its events built around Urdu. The popularity of the event has led to the establishment of another organization, Rang-e-Rekhta, curated by the Rekhta Foundation, which takes the success of Urdu to other cities. So far it has held three events in Chandigarh, Jaipur and Gurugram.

This apparent success of Urdu also raises an important question about the de facto status of Urdu in India. Scholarly studies show that Urdu has suffered marginalisation and that its social landscape is shrinking. Against this backdrop, many claim that the success of Jashn marks the revival of the Urdu language and literature. For instance, the Bollywood artist Javed Jaffrey said: ""Urdu khatre mein nahin hai, Urdu to qatre qatre mein hai (Urdu is not in danger; Urdu is actually in every drop)."" This pithy line received a round of applause from the audience. Tanweer Ahmad of the Urdu Qaumi Awaz made it into a headline.

Similar claims were made at the end of the 2017 Jashn festival. Malini Nayar of the Times of India dismissed the idea that Urdu was dying. She too echoed the jubilation and enthusiasm about Urdu's revival with her headline, 'Urdu language is not only alive but rocking.' Urdu newspapers followed suit. The Siasat Daily published a report on the role of Jashn in reviving Urdu with the headline, 'Jashn-e-Rekhta has proved that Urdu is not only alive but is creating waves'. Twitter resonated with the excitement of revival too.

Such views about its 'revival' and 'resurgence' overlook the ground reality that Urdu is actually in sharp decline in North India, especially in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, considered its traditional strongholds. Clearly, if there is a revival, it will mean that the young generation, who will be the carriers of the language, is learning it. The attendance at a Jashn festival or a mushaira or a qawwali is not an indicator of the revival of a language.

Sudha Pai, a scholar of political science, notes that other than the two Urdu medium schools run by Aligarh Muslim University, there is not one single primary or junior high school in the whole of UP where Urdu is fully the medium of instruction . The symbolic second language status accorded to Urdu by the UP government has not arrested its decline either. The recommendations of Gujral Committee (1975), the Ale Ahmad Suroor Committee (1979), and the Ali Sardar Jafri Committee (1990) to revive and popularise Urdu have never been implemented.

The situation of Urdu teaching in Delhi is no less gloomy. As per an RTI filed in 2013, a whopping 73% of posts for Urdu teachers within Delhi government schools are vacant. This despite the fact that Urdu has been granted the second official language status in Delhi. Furthermore, 74 out of 80 textbooks needed in Urdu schools were not available in the market. The result was an abnormally high failure rate in Urdu schools in Delhi.

For the claim of Urdu revival to be true, it follows that the young generation has the opportunity to learn its script as well. This point was stressed by Gulzar, the legendary Bollywood figure in the 2017 Rekhta festival. A declining proficiency in the Urdu script can be seen in the mushrooming of Urdu books transliterated into Devanagari found in Urdu Bazar, Old Delhi. Urdu in Devanagari has emerged as a response to the lack of proficiency in the script among the younger generation of speakers in Delhi and UP.

Another indicator of its decline in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi is the loss of the pronunciation of Urdu sounds, especially /kh̲/,/gh̲/, and /q/, as in kh̲uda (God) gh̲alat (wrong) and qalam (pen) respectively. Considered the shibboleths of Urdu as a language, the young generation is increasingly non-observant of these sounds. The decline interestingly is also visible in the pronunciation of words in Bollywood songs; the new generation of singers pronounce words containing these sounds using the Hindi pronunciation norms.

So what does the success of Jashn festival actually mean? In my view, it says little about the 'health' of the language and more about the marketing of the event. First of all, utilising the linkages between Urdu and popular culture, they have successfully galvanised Bollywood celebrities to promote it. Not all the Bollywood stars who have graced the Jashn are stars of Urdu language and literature. But they are all big crowd pullers.

Secondly, on the socio-political front, Urdu is no longer a force to reckon with as it has lost its battle for survival in North India. Such events are, therefore, aimed at the elite - especially the English educated ones. The first few editions did not have the Jashn-e-Rekhta written in Urdu. The recent ones did include the Urdu script. However, the schedules were available only in English. The big 'I LOVE URDU' cut-out where the youth were seen taking pictures was only in English. Both speak volumes about the targeted audience.

The English-speaking elite, however, has not embraced Urdu as it is. This elite has a romanticised and orientalised view of the language of love, beauty, politeness, tahzeeb and romance. Contrary to this, for its traditional speakers, Urdu is a world of myriad lived experiences which include, but are not limited to, love, romance and politeness. For them, Urdu is as much about love (mohabbat) as it is about revolt and revolution (inqilab). The new admirers of Urdu may not know that Urdu has some of the strongest expletives as well.

The success of Jashn-e-Rekhta, then, seems to be analogous to the popularity of sarson ka saag and makke ki roti in elite hotels and restaurants where the dish is an exotica - an occasional item on the menu rather than a lived experience of a villager. For the non-Urdu elites, it is more a matter of yaadgaar - something memorable, butwhich also means an old building - than a matter of rozgaar, or employment."

"316","1025468861","2018-12-24","https://www.thehindu.com/education/setting-the-record-straight/article25806501.ece","Setting the record straight","The Hindu",FALSE,"That spoken English should be taught as a separate subject in all Tamil-medium sections in schools, a plea made recently in the Madras High Court by a former MLA, M. Appau, led the judges to seek details on the functioning of the English-medium sections in the State's government-run schools. This initiative has triggered a flurry of questions among stakeholders, such as:

Should spoken English be mandated as an independent subject?

Why are millions of learners unable to acquire even the basic level of competence, although they have been taught English from the first standard?

Are schools equipped to facilitate students' acquisition of oral fluency in English?

What has been the impact of the many training programmes undertaken by various agencies such as the state partnership with the British Council, attempts of DIET, SSA and RSA to transform the pedagogical practices through the year? Nothing seems to explain why despite such well-intentioned efforts, speaking English fluently still remains ""an unachievable goal"".

Not too positive

When asked to describe the images that come to their minds whenever they think of English, Tamil-medium students in Anna University (which gets a huge chunk of students from rural areas who are high scorers in English in their class XII exams -- not less than 90%), describe English as a 'ghost', 'pitch black', 'red colour', 'wild beast chasing', and so on -- obviously only negative ones dominating their psyche. And the teachers in Tamil-medium schools are at a loss to teach English effectively due to their lack of sufficient exposure to the second language, lack of role models (for example, their own teachers), lack of genuine need to employ the language in their day-to-day communication, and the ineffective and insufficient training programmes, making them diffident and undoubtedly. Besides this vicious circle, there are certain deep-rooted myths, which have distorted the focus of teaching English in our country, over the years:

Myth 1: Centrality of grammar

Learning one's mother tongue or any other tongue involves the same cognitive process. No mother taught the initial words in Tamil, such as thatha, amma, or appa as nouns. So, in the case of English, why is the skewed approach to teach it based on or through grammar? Strangely, English grammar, to say the least, appears illogical and incoherent even to teachers; besides certain rules, there are more exceptions than rules and the same linguistic item carries varied grammatical roles/labels depending on the contexts. Even a thorough familiarisation does not ensure their automatised, accurate application.

Further, it has now been recognised (unfortunately not among the practising teachers) that the grammar of spoken English is different from that of the written language. In spoken form, a word, a phrase, incomplete sentences, and even ungrammatical constructions can achieve the desired communicative effect, whereas the written form has to strictly adhere to the rules. Despite the leeway the spoken mode enjoys, the tragedy is that the grammar of the written language is thrust upon the spoken form, which impedes learning. Experts maintain that spoken language is not written language spoken out and similarly, the written language is NOT spoken language written down. So, the shift should be towards the grammar of spoken language and not on dishing out grammar rules for the written mode.

Myth 2: Accurate pronunciation

It is familiar to all of us that the pronunciation of our mother tongue varies from person to person, community to community, and place to place. David Crystal, a well-known British expert on pronunciation, states that there are many accents in any language, which depend on the people we speak with. When we converse with children, we adopt one kind of pronunciation which radically differs from when we talk with other family members, colleagues or strangers, determined by the context and purpose. He further observes that English pronunciation is not static or rigid as it is being influenced by other world languages. What matters most is the intelligibility and not the so-called received pronunciation(RP). Instead of mimicking someone else's style, one has to speak in one's natural accent without sacrificing clarity.

Myth 3: High volume of vocabulary

No doubt, English is the richest language embracing more than one million words and each passing year adding more than 1,000 words to its stock. However, it is statistically proven that the spoken form requires only 3,000 high frequency words with ""the, be, to, of, and"" being the top five frequently used words. Against the traditional practice of learning individual words, the shift has moved towards chunks of language, otherwise called, lexical items.

Given the allegations levelled against the search panel formed to appoint a vice-chancellor for the Tamil University, Thanjavur, experts and teachers want the soon-to-be-constituted panels to be more vigilant while shortlisting names for the posts.

According to norms, search panels consist of three members -- nominated by the government, university syndicate (executive body) and senate (governing body of academic professionals). The government is yet to appoint its nominee to the panel to shortlist names for the post of V-C of BU, which fell vacant after the arrest of Ganapathi in February 2018 in connection with a bribery case.

As far as MKU is concerned, 196 have applied for the V-C post, which has been vacant since June. P P Chellathurai's appointment as V-C was set aside by the Madurai Bench of the Madras high court on the grounds that the selection rules were violated.

The vacancies have had an adverse impact on the functioning of the universities, particularly affecting academics, according to educationists. In the absence of a V-C, a committee headed by the state higher education secretary is formed to run the university.

It is primarily the duty of the V-C to demand grants or additional funds required for settling bills or meeting unforeseen expenditures. Without a V-C, the committee is able to just 'manage' the administration.

Distance education centres usually help universities get revenue. But the recent UGC direction allowed only four universities to conduct select courses in distance education mode has not the others.

To make proper representations on such issues to the government, universities need V-Cs. Committees can run only day-to-day affairs, not take policy decisions or promote research.

Even to conduct a convocation ceremony to distribute degree certificates to students, a person of authority is required. There have been instances where such events were postponed because there was no V-C.As far as the five universities are concerned, the V-Cs are at the fag end of their three-year tenure. The search panels, instead of just looking at the applicants' bio-data highlighting their academic performance, should check their administrative experience and integrity, inorder to curb corruption, say educationists.CR Ravi, a retired principal, said that it was high time the selection and appointment of V-Cs wasmade more transparent. Universities should not be used as cash cows. It is to be remembered, he said, that a former Anna University V-V, a fomer Chairman of IIT Kanpur and a present panel member of the search committee in MKU had verified that Rs 50 crores was paid to a Minister, he added."

Of the 49 suicides witnessed from 2013 to 2017, half were by Dalit and tribal students, and a majority of them were boys, records obtained by The Indian Express under the Right To Information (RTI) Act show. And all, except seven, were suicides by hanging, and the bodies were discovered either by classmates or members of the school staff.

Known for producing the best results in board examinations, the JNVs, which were started in 1985-86, have become a passport out of poverty for thousands of underprivileged children. Since 2012, these schools have consistently recorded a pass percentage of over 99 per cent in Class 10 and over 95 per cent in Class 12, which is far better than private schools and CBSE's national average.

""The Navodaya Vidyalaya system, which began as a unique experiment, is today unparalleled in the annals of school education in India and elsewhere,"" states the official website of the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS), an autonomous organisation under the HRD Ministry tasked with managing all 635 JNVs.

Advertising

According to norms, at least 75 per cent of the seats in these schools are set aside for rural children. Hence, a JNV is never sanctioned for a district with 100 per cent urban population. A Navodaya Vidyalaya starts from Class 6 and goes up to Class 12. All admissions in Class 6 are done through a merit test. In fact, the popularity of JNVs is evident

from the fact that less than 3 per cent of the candidates appearing for the entrance test every year makes the cut.

However, data obtained by The Indian Express and verified individually with 41 out of 46 vidyalayas, shows that JNVs are facing a serious challenge. The Indian Express has not revealed the identities of teachers and school authorities it spoke to.

Currently, there are 635 JNVs with 2.8 lakh students. As on March 31, 2017, a total of 2.53 lakh students in the age group of nine to 19 were enrolled across roughly 600 JNVs. That same year, the number of suicides touched 14. Hence, the suicide rate -- suicides per population of 1,00,000 -- at JNVs for 2017 works out to 5.5.

In other words, for every one lakh students studying in these schools, almost six students committed suicide in 2017. This is slightly higher than the national suicide rate for a similar age group in 2015 -- roughly 3 suicides per lakh population aged 6 to 17 years.

Given the population in JNVs, the number in absolute terms is not very different from the suicide rate in the general population of that age, but what is significant is the profile of victims -- more than half are Dalits and STs.

Consider this:

-Student suicides in JNVs first hit double digits (12) in 2016 and peaked last year with 14 suicides. In all, there have been 49 suicides in 46 schools across 20 states in five years, from 2013 to 2017. The states of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal and Uttarakhand alone account for more than half of the total suicides.

-The largest number of student suicides (16) in JNVs was by students belonging to the SC category. SC and ST students together account for over half or 25 suicide deaths in Navodaya Vidyalayas. The general and OBC category students account for 12 suicides each.

In JNVs, seats are reserved for children from SC and ST communities in proportion to their population in the district where the school is located, but not less than the national average, which is 15 per cent for SCs and 7.5 per cent for STs.

According to enrolment data as on March 31, 2017, 55 per cent (or 1,41,022) of the total intake were students from the general category (including OBCs) and the remaining -- 25 per cent SC and 20 per cent ST -- from the reserved categories.

-Thirty five, or roughly 71 per cent, of the 49 suicides were by boys. The ratio of boys to girls in JNVs is 60:40.

-All suicides, except six, are by students in Classes 9, 10, 11 and 12. The highest number (15) is of Class 12 students, followed by Class 11 (11 suicides), Class 9 (9) and Class 10 (8).

-In 42 of 49 cases, students died by hanging. That apart, there were two deaths by drowning, two by jumping from a height and three by jumping in front of a train. Currently, there is no system in place for professional counselling of students traumatised after discovering or seeing their schoolmate's dead body on campus.

-The causes of suicides in JNVs are disparate and range from unrequited love, family problems, corporal punishment or humiliation by teachers, academic pressure, depression, and fight between friends. Of these, the first three are cited most often as reasons behind suicides.

Interestingly, suicides peak in the three months following the two-month-long summer break that ends in July and during the examination season, that is, January, February and March.

According to NVS commissioner Bishwajit Kumar Singh, the timing of suicides reflects that students, after spending considerable time at home during summer vacation, have a tough time adjusting to school life or that they are stressed over strained domestic relations.

Alarms bells went off in the Navodaya ecosystem in 2016, when suicide figures hit double digits for the first time. The NVS shot off an 11-page circular in November, 2016, listing out ways to spot suicidal tendencies and prevent suicides on campus. The circular states that when a suicide takes place within the school premises, a JNV cannot escape responsibility.

""A child cannot take all of a sudden such an extreme step without showing some visible symptoms in advance. Vidyalaya administration failed to detect such symptoms though these symptoms were heard or seen by the students they were taken lightly,"" it said.

However, three years after the above circular was released, much of government's plans for stemming the growing trend of suicides in JNVs remain on paper.

Besides the students and teachers of the tuition class, family members of a few students had also joined the tour. The accident happened when the bus was returning to the city from Dang.

All the victims were from the Diamond City's Amroli area. Soon after the bodies arrived, a few families cremated them in the morning hours. A large number of people took part in the funeral.

At least, 65 of the 97 passengers were given treatment at Ahwa Civil Hospital in Dang and many were discharged. Later, 36 injured were shifted to New Civil Hospital (NCH) in the city. Of them, 29 are still under treatment with condition of three reported to be critical.

An offence was registered against Nita Patel, who runs Gurukrupa Classes, and bus driver Sanjay Mehta at Subir police station of Dang for causing death by negligence. Nita and her husband Bipin were seriously injured in the accident and have been shifted to Vadodara by their family members for further treatment. Mehta, who was also injured, is undergoing treatment in the city. Police have collected Mehta's blood samples for examination to find out if he was drunk.

""We carried out post mortem of the bodies at the earliest so that they could be handed over to the respective families soon. Health department teams had provided immediate treatment to patients and 22 with serious injuries were among those shifted to Surat,"" said Megha Mehta, chief district health officer, Dang.

""The rescue operation was over by early morning and the bodies of deceased persons were shifted to Surat in ambulances. Police will investigate what caused the accident,"" said Dang district collector B Kumar.

Education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasma visited NCH and met the injured patients and their family members. ""It is a serious crime to travel with 97 people in a bus which has capacity for 50 only,"" Chudasma said.

The state government has announced compensation of Rs2.50 lakh to families of each deceased and Rs1 lakh to each injured.

Chief minister Vijay Rupani visited the injured at NCH in the evening. ""We started the rescue operations immediately after the accident and required care is being given to those who were injured. Strict action will be taken against those responsible for the accident,"" Rupani said.

This year too India bagged five gold and one silver medals. The students were Amay Deshmukh from Jalgaon, Dhananjay Raman from Delhi, Mohit Gupta and Naman Singh Rana from Kota and Vaibha Raj who won gold and Varun Parua also from Kota won silver.

""Neither the schools nor students or parents are aware of this examination in the region, be they CBSE schools or the state board schools. In fact, none of them even understand the difference between a government-supported Olympiad and private Olympiads which are organized by NGOs and agencies,"" said Hemant Pande who is a former chemistry professor at Hislop College.

Pande was one of the science teachers (chemistry) from the Homi Bhaba Centre for Science Education (HBCSE) in Mumbai which trains the students for this Olympiad at national level. The government exam charges just Rs150 from students whereas the private agencies change Rs500-700.

Pande says that since this happens to be the only government-supported competitive Olympiad examination meant to promote science among students, there is a strong need to promote this examination in the region. ""I have been going to many schools in the city for promotion of this exam. Unfortunately, everywhere the private Olympiad agencies are found to have already booked dates. Schools also don't realize the importance of the government supported examination,"" said Pande.

This year besides Pande, VG Gambhir from HBCSE and Raja Ranjan from BARC were the ones who trained the students. For IJSO only about 30-60,000 students appear in the first round. Of these 300 are selected for stage II exam. Then from these 30-40 are selected for the theory and multiple-choice exam. And of these only six are selected for final competition at global level.

The IJSO preparation and exam develops love for science in students right from Std X. It triggers the thinking process in them and allows them to apply their knowledge. If these students then participate in the senior examination than they get preference in admissions to Indian Institute Science Education and Research (IISER) and the National Institute of Science Education and Research.

Pande tells that now he has taken up the job of creating awareness among Vidarbha schools on himself. ""I am retired now. I want to otherwise also promote the pursuit of science in students. This will also create competitors for higher examinations like the IRIS (Initiative for Research and Innovation in Science),"" he said."

The scheme that gives financial assistance of Rs 1,00,116 has become popular after it was launched by Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao on October 2, 2014. Many parents, due to poverty, used to get their daughters married before attaining adolescence.

Such was the situation that police used to intervene and foil child marriages as and when they get information and counsel parents. But for the last three and a half years, the situation has changed as the scheme is financially supporting the distressed families, according to officials.

District Welfare Officer GK Sunanda said child marriages registered a considerable dip after launching the scheme. More number of parents found to be performing the marriage of their daughter only after attaining 18, which is a prerequisite to avail the scheme.

According to Hyderabad District Child Protection Officer Imtiyaz, some 19 complaints related to child marriages were received in 2018 up to November as against 35 in 2017. ""We have foiled all the child marriages and counselled the parents,"" he said adding a case was registered against family members in three complaints after they failed to concede with.

He said the district administration had constituted over 914 child protection committees covering almost all the slums in the city. The committee members, along with 'Anganwadi' teachers, give information about child marriages after which officials rush to the location and counsel family members. If necessary, the assistance of police would also be taken."

Ravindranath has said. He was speaking at the P.M. Foundation Education Awards function here on Sunday.

Students' creative aptitude gets killed when education becomes examination-centric. Probably, such a trend does not create geniuses -- be it scientists or artists -- despite the fact that the State has made immense progress in the education sector.

The government is not in favour of examination-centric education, and it aims to transform the education system from being teacher-centric to student-centric. It is also the objective of the education protection campaign, the Minister said.

He added that studies should be considered as a journey towards making discoveries, and that one does not gain much by learning things by heart. An A+ in life is more important than an A+ in examinations, and students, teachers, and parents should be sensitive to this significant aspect, Mr. Ravindranath said. He also called upon students to use their mother tongue as a tool to excel in life.

The Minister pointed out that parents and teachers should motivate students to excel in their own creative fields. Never should a student be discriminated against for not making the grade.

With just three months left for the conclusion of the current academic year, Samagra Shiksha, Keralam, is gearing up to utilise the funds allocated for various projects for school students on time.

The Union government merged the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shikshak Abhiyan to form Samagra Shiksha early this year.

Improvement of academic standards as well as infrastructure development at schools from pre-primary to Class 12 were brought within its ambit. However, there had been a delay in convening a meeting of functionaries of the new entity, which also resulted in many projects getting stuck. As the non-utilisation of allocated funds this academic year may lead to the Centre reducing the funds next year, a State-level workshop is now being held in Kozhikode.

K.J. Harikumar, State Programme Officer, Samgra Shiksha, Keralam, told The Hindu on Sunday that it had been decided to conduct a 'Mikavulsavam' for students of Classes 1 to 7 in aided and government schools to improve academic standards. English teachers in higher secondary schools will be given special training. They would be given Malayalam translations of history, geography and economics textbooks, he added.

According to sources, coordinators of the programme from 14 districts and Block Resource Centre functionaries are participating in the workshop. It has been decided to complete the construction of science parks in all aided and government schools under the aegis of Samgra Shiksha, by the next academic year. The ongoing projects to improve the efficiency of students in science, mathematics, and English, Malayalam and Hindi will be modified and rearranged, if necessary."

Still, we have so many expectations, apprehensions about the 'next year' that will greet us. Many look at it as a new life if the current one didn't go well.

When it comes to realm of Indian politics and government, it was quite an interesting year. Former Chief Justice of India, Dipak Misra delivered historic verdicts including decriminalisation of consensual gay sex, not considering adultery as an offence anymore, recognising an individual's right to privacy in the Aadhaar case, making instant triple talaq a legal offence and most recently giving women the right to enter the Sabrimala temple.

The decriminalisation of IPC's Section 377, which considered consensual sex between homosexuals as 'unnatural' and a 'criminal' offence has significant importance, given the verdict had already been once repealed in 2013.

Members of the LGBTQ+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer) community thronged streets as they rejoiced in colours of love and pride. As we passed this test with rainbow colours, we speak to Mr Gay World India 2016, Anwesh Sahoo to share if things have only changed on paper this year. Here are the key lessons he learnt in 2018:

There has been a drastic change in the corporate culture, believes Anwesh since the verdict has come out. Multinational Corporations have started changing their policies to make them more inclusive for the LGBTQ community. Whenever he goes for a job interview, the only question that he is being asked is, 'When can you join us?'

This is imperative given today's workspace is so fast-paced, where employees are doing a nine-to-nine shift, one could actually discover their LGBTQ partner in office. It opens many avenues and provides them with an opportunity to live a dignified, respected life.

Anwesh is proud to inform that he has a boyfriend, Pance Naumov, who is currently a Radcliffe Fellow at Harvard (Well, we all wish we were gay to have a boyfriend studying at Harvard) who no longer shies away from expressing his love for him in public. ""We met two years ago at a Bombay pride parade and since then we haven't stopped talking. Earlier, he wouldn't hold my hand in public and he was very apprehensive because of the culture here"" but now it isn't the same for the couple.

Though, he adds that it might take years for India to build a society where it would be completely normal for us to have a trans teacher at school and taking children to pride parades, the law does matter. The law sends a clear signal that bigotry against LGBTQ community is unacceptable.

Battling taboos and an archaic law around the binary concept of sexuality hasn't been easy for Anwesh. However, he acknowledges himself to be a headstrong person who has learnt to embrace his uniqueness and continues to experiment with life.

For someone who has worn many hats, Mr Gay India has three things to say to his peers:

Best Memory Of 2018: ""I was on a radio show speaking to a variety of people when the verdict came out (September 06) and my phone was flooded with texts from people congratulating and sending love. That was also the first time I talked about my boyfriend on a public platform and that too on a show I have grown up listening.""

Best Place Visited In 2018: ""We were touring with a UK based dance company in India. They needed language assistance and I got to meet four other gay persons who were a part of the dance group. We travelled from Delhi to Bhopal to Jabalpur and Kurukshetra. I had a gala time in Bhopal and Jabalpur especially, trying everything, their food, culture, places. It was the best experience of the year.""

What Do I Look Forward To In 2019: As I enter the second year of my masters programme, I really want to intern abroad this time.

What We Still Lack In LGBTQ+ Realm: We need introduction of sex education in schools in order to build a system where it is completely normal for teachers to take their students to pride parades and show them the LGBTQ culture. This binary concept where we believe pink is not meant for men and a man cannot be effeminate needs to eliminated. Many people had one bad experience with an LGBTQ member which led to the formation of a public opinion.

The 'danger of a single story' which makes or mars a person's experience also needs to be taken care of. A new LGBTQ chapter is opening up in our country and more and more number of people are finding acceptance in the city.

On Representation Of LGBTQ In Digital Medium: I am still waiting for that day when LGBTQ members are represented in a dignified and empowered manner in regular, mainstream films. The fact that the last movie in which we had a gay couple came out a decade ago speaks volumes about the representation of our community in mainstream media.

On LGBTQ Taking Refuge In Dating Apps: I do not support members taking refuge in dating apps because I believe it crushes your ego and it brings your self-pride down. Though, it can vary from person to person.

Various associations of school teachers in the state have already registered protests against the recommendation.

Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, the other day, gave a slew of recommendations in the Niti Ayog's 'Strategy for New India @ 75' and one of his recommendations was a complete overhaul of the school education system by improving the standards of teachers and revising the curriculum.

According to office bearers of Kerala School Teachers Association (KSTA), the recommendations will only lead to teachers losing their confidence.

""The periodical examinations to test the efficiency of teachers will only create differences among them. Also conducting the test is practically impossible. We will not allow this to be implemented in the state. We have many additional duties apart from teaching. If the quarterly examinations are implemented, there will be more pressure on teachers. Hence we will stage a protest to stop the Centre's move,"" said K C Harikrishnan, general secretary, KSTA.

He also said the Union Government's recommendation could be on the basis of the increase in the number of unqualified teachers in many schools in North India. "" In Kerala, the appointment of teachers are being made in a transparent manner and all are qualified too,"" Harikrishnan added.

The unaided school teachers and private school teachers have also echoed the opinion of KSTA and they said they can not handle more pressures and this will adversely affect the academic performance of the students.

""The Union Minister said in the recommendation that this will improve the education standards. But as far as Kerala is concerned, the academic performance of students are moving in the right direction.

""The teaching is also far better compared to other states. So there is no point in implementing the recommendation here,"" said Sreekanth (name changed), a private school teacher.

In the report, the Union Government has recommended that the spending on education should be increased to at least six per cent of GDP by 2022. Niti Ayog has addressed the key areas such as school education, higher education and vocational education.

The report has also made recommendations to improve enrollment, learning outcome, employability, and reduce stress on school children.

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Naidu, congratulated the Telangana Chief Minister, Shri K.Chandra Sekhara Rao for organising the celebrations 42 years, after the first conference was held during J. Vengal Rao's time.

He said there is an urgent need to emphasise the importance of mother tongue from childhood only. Children should be told about the beauty and greatness of Telugu language and literature by parents and teachers and learn to appreciate the language, he said.

Language, which developed as part of man's efforts to express himself, differs depending on the social, economic, geographic and historic perspectives. The Vice-President said that there is ample evidence to believe that Telugu is an ancient language, and inscriptions dating back to 2 century AD were found to be in Telugu.

Various dialects of Telugu language are unique they must be encouraged, he said. For language to grow and flourish, use is very important and efforts must be made to use Telugu in these modern times, and in the age of internet, he said.

The Vice-President said that Telugu literature was very rich and great literary works like Maha Bhagavatam by Potana and Maha Bharatam translated into Telugu by Nannaya. Tikkana and Yerrana - 'Kavitrayam' should be introduced to children at an early age.

He congratulated the Telangana Government for making Telugu a compulsory medium of instruction from the next year.

Many versatile statesmen were born in Telugu, one of whom was former Prime Minister, Shri P.V. Narasimha Rao, Shri Venkaia Naidu further said that cinema and television too have a role in preserving language.

Telugu should be widely used in internet. Education and jobs should be connected to language he said. He said reservation for those who studied in Telugu should be brought in and arrangements must be made for facilitating national level examinations in Telugu, he added.

Governor of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh states, Shri E.S.L. Narasimhan, Governor of Maharashtra, Shri Ch. Vidya Sagar Rao, Ministers of Telangana Government, several Ministers, poets and people in huge members from both Telugu states participated in the grand opening celebrations.>"

The inquiry was ordered on December 21 by director of primary education Arvind Kumar Verma. ""Some irregularities were found in the selection process of teachers between 2006 and 2017. He has been given 15-day time to reply to the education department,"" he said.

Arvind told this newspaper on Saturday if Arun failed to come up with satisfactory reply, stern action will be taken against him.

The inquiry was initiated on a complaint from Gopalganj's district education officer (DEO) and district programme officer (establishment). In their letters to the department in August, the DEO and DPO alleged that Arun had committed large-scale bungling in teachers' selection.

According to education department officials, Arun appointed around 100 teachers at panchayat and block level in government primary schools of Gopalganj district without following the criteria of recruitment prescribed by the department.

""In case of any vacancy in government primary school after a teacher retired or died, Arun made appointments on the basis of a merit list issued in 2006 and 2008, without inviting fresh applications.

In its 'Strategy for New India @75' document released on Wednesday, the Aayog has recommended revamp of the regulatory system of nursing education to ensure quality training in nursing schools and also stressed on developing centres of excellence in nursing and enhancing the stature of government nurses.

It also suggested developing framework for deployment of doctors and specialists from the private sector to government hospitals on a visiting or honorary basis and expanding the system of Diplomate of National Board (DNB) and Diplomas from College of Physicians and Surgeons (CPS).

The warmth of love harbours relationships

And home is where humanity dwells

Never found respect in that house... but only disrespect

Never had a moment of happiness... but just gloom

So much, so that I begged for my death to the almighty

However, he never let me have that wish

Because our friendship was destined to be

He never let me have that wish

Because I had to see my daughter succeed

The moment had brought back joy in my life

[My daughter cleared the grade VII scholarship exam]

I came across a person on this turn of life

Who gave me a whole new hope to live

And a day came when I forgot everything and dissolved into you

... And I still cherish the memories of that day

-- Jivhala (Translated from Marathi by Vishakha Ghadi)

These are the lines from a thank you note written by Suvarna Maskar who describes it as 'the moment of awakening'. ""Maybe because I didn't know what to do [sic]. I spoke everything,"" she says with a sigh of relief. The note is a conversation from 2008 which the 46-year-old Suvarna had with Jadhav ma'am, a Government school teacher in Shirgaon village of Satara's Wai taluka in Maharashtra.

The note was a build-up of two decades. A farmer and a home-maker, Suvarna always wanted to complete her education. She dropped out after grade X. ""During that time, girls were rarely sent to school and I also faced the same,"" she recollects. ""I felt like I had lost everything in the world.""

Tired of her routine life which had cut her freedom, she would often pray for death. Once while bringing her children back from the school, she conveyed everything to Jadhav ma'am and felt 'liberated'. Later, she wrote a thank you note which became her first ever work of poetry. ""I didn't know what a poem was,"" she remembers.

A week later, she went to the school again for the parents meeting. A school teacher praised the thank you note publicly. Immediately, Jadhav replied saying that Suvarna is a 'big poet'. ""That was the moment when I felt I could achieve something in life,"" she says with the widest grin.

Challenges while writing

After the incident, she started exploring the art form. Within a fortnight she wrote a handful of poems. ""No one believed that I had written them. People used to ask me how a farmer can be a poet?"" she says. A lot of fellow villagers even falsely accused her of plagiarism.

""In the initial days, even my husband didn't believe that I could write poems. Once after coming from the field, I wrote a poem in front of him. From that instant, he has never doubted me,"" she explains. Her husband, Uttam, 53, is a farmer and knows about all her poems. ""I like her poems and enjoy listening to them,"" he says proudly.

Earlier, she was scared of showing the poems to school teachers and editors of the newspapers. ""My husband would proudly show them to the editors,"" she says. This restored her lost confidence and soon Suvarna herself began meeting with the school teachers and editors. ""This happened only when my husband understood the importance of my poems. He would always take me to various poetry competitions in other talukas of [Satara] district,"" she explains.

Some of the awards which Suvarna won in the past eight years

Her first poem was published within a few months in 2008 in a Marathi daily Pudhari. ""That's when people started believing me,"" she asserts. Her mother in law isn't a big fan of Suvarna choosing the path of poetry. ""She would always taunt what you will do by becoming a poet.""

Suvarna is now a regular contributor to Pudhari, Sakal, Gramodhar, Nave Shahar newspapers, and Gumfan, Muktagiri, Amrutgat, Pudcha Paul, Lokjagar, Laxmiputra, Sarvoyda Vichar magazines in Marathi.

Suvarna has maintained an archive of all her poems which have been published in newspapers to date

""Now, people's perspective has changed. They have started recognising me as a woman farmer poet,"" she says proudly. There are still a lot of challenges ahead. ""People aren't very receptive of romantic poems, but I don't pay attention to what they say now."" She loves writing poems on love and is breaking the conservative barriers with her romantic poems now.

It's not just the orthodox society which Suvarna has been battling, she has to complete the majority of the farming work first and then pursue her passion for poetry. Every day she wakes up at five in the morning, completes her household chores, milks her two animals twice and then leaves for farming at 10 am and returns by 6 pm. They own 2.5-acre land where they cultivate sugarcane, jowar, and a few vegetables.

The art of poetry and inspiration

She has a plethora of topics in her repertoire. Some of them include agrarian crisis, alcoholism, addiction, children, rural life, societal issues, women, patriarchy and romantic poems.

In the school days, she was fascinated by the names of authors and poets in the end [of every chapter and poem]. ""I always wanted my name to be published under a story or poem,"" she recalls. ""We live our lives only once and I want to leave behind a legacy.""

""I don't feel like I've to sit back, think and then write poems. It happens naturally,"" she says. All her poems come from the field and personal experiences. Citing one such experience, she narrates her long story titled Gurakhi [Shepherd] from 2017 which was published in the Diwali edition of Laxmiputra magazine. The story is a fictional conversation between the local hill and a shepherd regarding the environment degradation by human beings. Some of her poems are reactions to the wrongdoings and crimes in the society. The Kopardi [2016] rape incident deeply affected her and she expressed the anguish in the form of a poem.

Talking about dealing with criticism, she says, ""Only a poet can understand the happiness behind the written word [in the poem]."" She credits her childhood reading habits for the huge vocabulary she has built now. Her elder brother Suryakant Yadav is a voracious reader. ""He would always get me a lot of books from Mumbai,"" she recalls smilingly. Her father, the late Babanrao Yadav would always read aloud spiritual books. ""Those interesting mythological stories made me fall in love with books,"" she says. ""When I read my poems to him, he had tears in his eyes.""

Her mother, Yashodabai, now in her early 80s, could never see the steps of the school. ""She always supported me and said that one day, these poems will liberate me and take me forward,"" says Suvarna proudly.

Inspiring others

Suvarna is now invited in various gatherings at the schools to recite her poetry. ""I am restricted to places from where I can return the same day,"" she says sadly. ""I've to milk the animals every day."" She is optimist enough to find a solution to this and pursue her passion of poetry full time. Suvarna's dream is to present her poetry in several villages across Maharashtra. ""I want to use poetry as a means of community development,"" she tells me as she talks about the coming poetry competitions and conferences she's looking forward to.

She has won around 30 awards for her poetry in the past eight years. She has also recited her poetry several times on All India Radio, Satara. Suvarna has handwritten more than 500 poems and filled four diaries in eight years penning down her experiences. She has also written 15 long stories.

Hand written stories and poems of Suvarna Maskar

In 2013, her first book titled Suvarngandh [a smell as precious as gold] which is a collection of 46 poems was published by Akshara Publication, Satara. The book covers a wide range of topics like addiction, societal awakening, women's issues, agriculture, romantic poems, etc. 500 copies of the books were printed. ""I can't afford to get any book published right now,"" she says. ""But in a few years my next books will be published,"" she says confidently.

Suvarna likes the work of the late Bahinabai Chaudhari, a woman cotton farmer from Jalgaon district. ""People didn't have confidence in me, but I was self-confident to become a poet,"" she says smilingly.

Her first book Suvarngandh was published in 2013 which is a collection of 46 poems

""I've four teachers at home,"" she says proudly referring to her children and husband who have been inspiring her to keep improving her poems. Her daughter Neelam, and Akshada, both are engineers and are working currently. Her youngest son, Tejas is pursuing his Bachelors in Pharmacy from Karad city in Maharashtra.

""The reading habit amongst people has come down. We would be able to keep our independence only if we are well read and informed,"" she says.

Interesting anecdotes

Her poems transcend books and schools and have now become an inherent part of her life. Once she was seeking a dental treatment in Pachwad village. ""During the times I had to visit the doctor, I used to observe his work carefully and later wrote a poem on him."" This was published in a local newspaper. The dentist loved it and later visited Suvarna to thank her. ""He also used better quality caps for my teeth without charging any extra money,"" she says smilingly.

She met Jagdish Khebudkar, a renowned Marathi littérateur and lyricist in the Akhil Bharatiya Sahitya Parishad's conference in Mumbai in 2010. ""He spoke to me about his struggles writing Lavanis for the Pinjra movie [1972] and how he overcame his fear. He also asked me to keep writing more poems,"" she says. That moment was an inspiring feat for Suvarna. ""Whenever I feel like giving up, I remember moments like these,"" she explains.

Looking back at her struggle, she pauses for a while, smiles, takes a deep breath and says, ""I never imagined that my life will ever change.""

Highlighting the great Indian tradition of 'guru-shishya parampara,' he said teachers and students used to live together and engage in a constant dialogue. Naidu stressed on technology and tradition going together.

He suggested that only 50 percent of the time should be spent in class rooms with remaining 50 percent spent outside.

Noting that lifestyle changes were leading to a number of diseases, he said Indian food was time-tested and the Indianness should be preserved. ""Instant food means constant disease,"" the vice president said.

He said ""People who have ruled us, ruined us, looted us, cheated us, cheated our minds also.""

This has resulted in an inferiority complex in the country that those things English are great and the things Indian are inferior, Naidu said. He also said no government could provide jobs to everybody.

Replying to queries from students, he said farmers in the country were in distress not because of any particular government or any party, but ""somehow our policy from the beginning, the planning commission those days, the parliament, the press and political parties have not given adequate importance to agriculture and rural development.""

The government approach needs to be restructured with emphasis on rural roads, connectivity, electricity, water supply, linking of rivers, construction of godowns and cold storage units, he said. The government's E-NAM initiative would also help farmers, he said.

He termed loan waiver as a temporary solution and said the country must find out ways and means of structural changes.

Observing that there was a lot of competition in the era of globalisation, with WTO rules in force, he said the Indian manufacturing sector is not able to withstand competition effectively for a variety of reasons.

Many were not able to invest and take up manufacturing as wealth was concentrated in the hands of a few, the vice president said.

The priority of the governments at the centre and states should be to focus more on manufacturing, he added.

In its 'Strategy for New India @75' document released on Wednesday, the Aayog has recommended revamp of the regulatory system of nursing education to ensure quality training in nursing schools and also stressed on developing centres of excellence in nursing and enhancing the stature of government nurses.

The Aayog said the quality of health professional training and adherence to standards is sub-optimal, including in the private sector.

To address the shortage of doctors in the country, the Aayog has suggested creating conditions to facilitate import of doctors, especially those of Indian origin working abroad, and also deploying teachers from universities abroad as visiting professors at AIIMS or NIEs while linking at least 40 per cent of district hospitals with medical colleges.

It also suggested developing framework for deployment of doctors and specialists from the private sector to government hospitals on a visiting or honorary basis and expanding the system of Diplomate of National Board (DNB) and Diplomas from College of Physicians and Surgeons (CPS).

""Workforce shortages and uneven distribution of doctors, nurses, specialists and allied health professionals plague the sector,"" the Aayog said while observing that urban areas have four times as many doctors and three times as many nurses as compared to rural areas.

Medical and nursing colleges are concentrated in a few states like Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Gujarat and Maharashtra.

Pointing to the severe shortages in the category of allied health professionals (AHPs) including medical lab technicians, optometrists and radiologists, the Aayog has sought establishment of a Council to ensure standardization of education and putting in place quality control mechanisms for educational institutions, teaching methods and workforce management.

It suggested putting in place an updated curriculum for medical and allied professions that keeps pace with the changing dynamics of public health, policy and demographics.

As far as specialists are concerned, the Aayog observed that a large number of posts are vacant all over the country. According to estimates, India needs close to five lakh additional specialists, the report highlighted.

There is also an acute shortage of medical faculty. Of the 1,830 faculty posts across six All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), approximately 583 (31 per cent) had been filled up until July 2017, the Aayog pointed out.

According to the report, as of March 2017, there were 10.23 lakh allopathic doctors registered with the MCI or state medical councils.

Assuming 80 per cent availability, the Aayog estimated that around 8.18 lakh doctors may actually be available for active service. This gives a doctor population ratio of 1:1613 against the WHO norm of 1:1000, it said.

The current nurse-population ratio is 1:588.

""Due to the suboptimal quality of training offered by several institutions that have mushroomed over the years, limited career prospects and poor working conditions, especially in the private sector, there is a significant shortage of skilled nurses in the country,"" the Aayog stated.

""Private practice by medial faculty in teaching institutions is rampant in several states, compromising on the commitment to teaching and institutional clinical work,"" it highlighted.

Among the constraints the Aayog mentioned were poor infrastructure in many state and private medical/nursing/dental colleges.

It further said that health professionals in the public sector are inadequately compensated and motivation levels are extremely poor.Fair compensation in the private sector, for nurses, is also a challenge.

The Aayog has suggested creating a cadre of primary healthcare practitioners by introducing a three-year competency-based dynamic course for primary, community and family medicine and partner with private hospitals or private medical practitioners to skill technicians, nursing and para-nursing as well as para-medical staff to deal with paucity of health professionals."

Although from school and college records, he is now 72 years old. A striking persona with his carelessly wrapped turban and walrus moustache, he is an easy man to talk to, what with the treasure trove of anecdotes he can recount from key moments in India's post-Independence history.

He says he was just five or six years old when Master Maadu Ram, a local Arya Samaj leader, visited his father's simple home in Gorakhpur village. Maadu Ram, Swarup says, fascinated him with his fearless advocation of rationalism against blind faith and idol worship. ""I have never since stepped inside a temple, mosque, church or gurudwara,"" says the man who now devotes all his time to educating others, including young school and college students, employee unions, farmers' collectives and even local khap panchayats (caste councils) who care to hear his unorthodox views.

Starting out in student politics in the early 1970s, Swarup, then a postgraduate student of history, recalls how he was rusticated from Hisar's Jat College in 1973, when he preferred to support a statewide school teachers' strike instead of taking a prized opportunity to work as a stipendiary teacher. ""The government was offering the jobs to break the teachers' strike and I refused,"" he says. The early influences and the heady days of student politics made for that inevitable drift to the Left (he became a card holder of the CPI(M).

But it was after 2008, when he withdrew from politics (he says, ""I simply did not renew my card in 2012"") that Swarup, who is now respectfully referred to as 'Comrade Krishan Swarup Gorakhpuria', really came into his own.

Back in Gorakhpur, he spearheaded the establishment of the Comrade Prithvi Singh Yadgaar Committee (a tribute to a local Left leader), which now has bustling premises on one edge of the village. It is among several places where he engages with youth, both of the village and from settlements nearby. Discussions range from sports, afforestation, organic and zero-budget farming to advances in science and education. The centre also serves as a sports academy, which sent as many as seven boys to the volleyball nationals this year, and a coaching centre to prepare young boys and girls for competitive examinations.

And while he watches over the centre in Gorakhpur, Swarup spends the remainder of his time addressing employees' unions, farmers and students. ""This is to inform people of their rights and responsibilities,"" he says. For instance, he spent weeks during a recent roadways union agitation in Haryana, talking to workers unions, advising them on how best to press for their demands. And he regularly visits government and private schools to similarly engage with students, whom he sees as the workforce of the future. ""I engage in agitational and educational activity,"" he chuckles. He is also head of one of the most progressive Khap panchayats in Haryana, through which he continues to wage a virtual war against female foeticide and honour killings amid Haryana's intensely patriarchal rural society.

But the comrade isn't merely a preacher. Two of his four children are in inter-caste marriages; on his insistence, his matriculate daughter-in-law went on to graduate and to teaching in a local school; and the delight on his face while visiting his grand-daughters in Chandigarh is telling."

The creation of State Open School Board -- where an array of skill-based subjects and other vocations made a foray into mainstream education -- was exalted by teachers and students alike. Now, in a further boost to this phenomenon, the state education department has given it equivalence to Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE). Every student engaged in open schooling will be considered on a par with those who take the traditional route and will be awarded state board's certificate at the end of it.

A final decision in this regard had been pending since the state announced inclusion of open schooling in 2017, with work on the syllabus underway, being carefully scrutinised by the board. They had ascertained that final certificates will bear no difference, and subsequently, this decision was formalised through a December 21 government resolution.

Kale, chairman of MSBSHSE, said, ""An amendment or resolution was important to impart the equivalent status to open schooling. According to the new diktat, students who will appear for classes X and XII exams through open schooling will get the same certificates from the state board.""

The process of setting up open schools is in its final stages with two centres all set to function -- one each in and jurisdictions. A third centre will be disclosed in the coming week, after which enrolments are expected to commence. Also, students will now be allowed to take up home schooling, for which they will have to attempt exams for classes V, VIII, X and XII.

The syllabus will include Marathi as a compulsory subject with other choices being perched in a wide spectrum of vocations -- like Indian classical music and 13 skill-based subjects -- all approved by NCERT. The catalogue of skill-based subjects boasts of courses on beauty, baking and confectionery, printing, agriculture, water management, computer repair, art and craft among others.

The inclusion of such subjects, deemed the core of open schooling, was done with the objective of favouring those students who cannot go to a regular school due to keen interest in extra-curricular activities or sports. Furthermore, there is no upper age limit for enrolment (minimum being 10), the schooling will benefit children with special needs, senior citizens and others who lagged behind on education. They will be able to bag secondary and higher secondary board degrees through experiential learning.

Nonetheless, this announcement is still snagged with doubts as a handful of parents wonder if open schooling will of higher education for their children. For instance, Yamini Dhopavkar, a parent of fiveyear-old, who has been enrolled in an activity centre and planning for board for final examination, emphasised that these tests matter apart from experiential learning. ""It is important that even after imparting open schooling, the child should be able to apply for various higher education courses. If this open schooling gives equivalence to state board then definitely it will be one of the choices,"" she added."

Manchadi, a realistic mathematics education (RME) programme would be introduced in all local bodies, said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.

He was speaking here on Saturday at the launch of Manchadi aimed at bringing children closer to mathematics by helping them to connect with mathematics in real-life situations. The RME mode of mathematics and science learning is a widely appreciated model which institutions in many developed and developing countries follows. The programme in Kerala's context is developed by Kerala state innovation council. The programme, rich with digital and interactive content, would be introduced on pilot-basis in five panchayats - Alappad, Chalavara, Perinthalmanna, Feroke and Thirunelli.

""By introducing a mechanism that would help children to identify and learn mathematics as an integral part of social life, the government wants to emphasise its commitment to the younger generation. Knowingly or unknowingly, we depend on mathematics throughout our lives'', he said. According to CM, the government objective was to dissipate the fear of mathematics among children.

Based on the result of the pilot programmes in five panchayats, the initiative would later be replicated throughout the state, he said.

Realistic mathematics education (RME) is a teaching and learning theory in mathematics education that was first introduced and developed by the Freudenthal Institute in the Netherlands. This theory has been adopted by several countries across the world including England, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Portugal, South Africa, Brazil, the USA, Japan, and Malaysia. It is predominantly determined by mathematician Freudenthal's views that mathematics must be connected to reality and should be realized as part of human activity. However, the word 'realistic', refers not just to the connection with the real world, but also refers to problem situations which are real in students' minds. For the problems to be presented to the students this means that the context can be a real-world context but this is not always necessary.

Local bodies interested in setting up the facility for the programme should find 1,000 sq ft space, 10 volunteers and three retired teachers. Fifty students in two age groups such as 6 to 9 and 10 to 12 can benefit from the programme. Kerala development and innovation strategic council (K-DISC) would ensure the service of animators for providing training to Manchadi units."

Hiremath added that new-age scientists have to dwell upon issues pertaining to pollution, water scarcity, food management, protection of natural resources, effective management of energy, conserving biodiversity and other issues which are the need of the hour.

Along with teaching academics, science teachers must expose students to such burning issues and motivate them to come up with solutions, Hiremath said.

Laxmi Inamdar Doddamani, a professor at KUD, said Inspire Awards, the flagship programme of the Union science and technology department, has provided a perfect platform for students to display their scientific skills.

The SDG India Index measures the progress of states and UTs complying with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. The First Baseline Report of SDG India Index for 2018 has been prepared with support from Global Green Growth Institute and the UN.

""Among the UTs, Chandigarh takes the lead because of its exemplary performance in providing clean water and sanitation to its people. It has further made good progress towards providing affordable and clean energy, generating decent work and economic growth, and providing quality education,"" the report stated.

Chandigarh is in the category of ""front runners"", while Himachal Pradesh and Kerala has topped the index with a score of 69. They are also ""front runners"" in achieving the SDG.

""We normalised the raw data on a score of 0-100. The lowest score means worst performing and 100 means best. A state or UT scoring 68 means that it is inching closer to the complete score in terms of accomplishment of the goals,"" said Officer on Special Duty Sanyukta Samaddar from Niti Aayog.

There were 16 SDGs, including sanitation and clean water, poverty eradication, human health, quality education and various others, on which the states/UTs were measured ""to help organise and streamline development actions for greater achievement of human well being"".

In the goal of ""Quality Education"", Chandigarh was among the best performing with 85 index score and ranked in ""front runners""

The goal was measured on adjusted net enrollment ratio at elementary (Class 1-8) and secondary (Class 9-10) schools, percentage of correct responses on learning outcomes in language, mathematics and EVS for Class 5 students, correct responses in language, mathematics, science and social science for Class 8 students and school teachers professionally qualified.

In the goal of ""Gender Equality"", Chandigarh scored 51, second among the states/UTs.

The goal was measured on sex ratio at birth (female per 1,000 male), average female to male ratio of average wages/salaries received per day by regular wage/salaried employees of age 15-59 years for rural and urban and ensuring women's full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision, percentage of seats won by women in the General elections to state legislative Assembly and various others.

However, there are several areas where a lot if improvement is required.

The first goal of ""No Poverty"" had Chandigarh scoring just 39 marks. The index parameters, under which the city was surveyed, included percentage of population living below National Poverty Line, households with any usual member covered by any health scheme or insurance, percentage of persons who demanded employment under MGNREGA, proportion of the population (out of the total eligible) receiving social protection benefits like maternity benefit and number of homeless per 10,000 households.

Chandigarh fell in ""Aspirant"" category, while Tamil Nadu and Mizoram were the best performers with 76 and 71 index score.

In another goal ""Good Health and Well Being"", Chandigarh has an index score of only 23, while Kerala tops with 92. Even Punjab and Haryana scored better than Chandigarh in this with 71 and 57 respectively.

In this category, the city was measured on parameters like maternal mortality ratio, number of government physicians, nurses, midwives per lakh population and under-five mortality rate per 1,000 live births, percentage of children aged 12-23 months fully immunised (BCG, measles and three doses of pentavalent vaccine) and annual notification of tuberculosis cases per lakh population. Chandigarh was found wanting on these criteria and thus scored among the least.

The policy is likely to be released by the government in a month or two. Professor Bhargava was here to receive the SIES Sri Chandrasekarendra Saraswathi National Eminence Award on Saturday evening. He also delivered a lecture on the legacy of renowned mathematician Srinivas Ramanujan, whose birth anniversary was on Saturday. The day is observed as the National Mathematics Day.

Speaking to TOI, Bhargava said the education policy has taken a holistic approach and addressed issues ranging from access to communication by scientists. ""The entire process involved thousands of consultations,"" he said, explaining the delay.

Emphasising the need for communications in science education, Bhargava said it was just as important as getting results. ""Ph D programmes do not take care of this aspect. Good writing, good speaking is equally important. Scientists should be able to speak about science in indian languages. Every Ph D programme should have a communication course where you learn to talk about your subject to the general public, to peers,"" he said. Scientists are well known for not being able to speak very well, he added in jest.

In a country where most school-going students are gripped by math phobia, Bhargava was a child prodigy who went on to win the Fields Medal, the highest honour in the discipline. ""Mathematics is an art and the teaching should be more play-based, creativity based and discovery based, where students are described a situation and they are asked to solve it and everybody can come up with different solutions. Mathematics is wonderful - the correct answer is the correct answer. But there can be many paths to get to that answer. Teachers should allow students to discover those paths. That's all,"" he said. ""Because you discovered that path, you will never forget it. If you just memorise something, you learn it for the test and then you forget it,"" he added.

""We have very old textbooks that we continue from year to year and the teaching methods are just passed on from one generation to other. A revolution is waiting to happen there,"" he said. Bhargava felt that research institutions like TIFR and IIT can help bring out the creative side in science and math teaching.

Speaking about the flawed system of board exams and entrance exams in the country, Bhargava said standardised tests waste students' time. ""Students spend all the time just mugging and going to coaching classess instead of actually getting a chance to play with the material...the board exams and the standardised exams are actually a distraction from actual learning,"" said Bhargava. Having one standardised test that you can take multiple times whenever you want would be a lot better than having an exam on one day that determines your life, he said."

The move came after department officials inspected several schools to learn that almost all schools have several articles lying without any use. State has over 71,000 schools. The department is expecting to generate space equivalent to the around 2,000-3,000 classrooms.

Replying to queries from students, he said farmers in the country were in distress not because of any particular government or any party, but ""somehow our policy from the beginning, the planning commission those days, the parliament, the press and political parties have not given adequate importance to agriculture and rural development.""

The government's E-NAM initiative would also help farmers, he said.

He termed loan waiver as a temporary solution and said the country must find out ways and means of structural changes.

Observing that there was a lot of competition in the era of globalisation, with WTO rules in force, he said the Indian manufacturing sector is not able to withstand competition effectively for a variety of reasons.

Many were not able to invest and take up manufacturing as wealth was concentrated in the hands of a few, the vice president said.

The priority of the governments at the centre and states should be to focus more on manufacturing, he added.

The Vijay Mallya extradition saga rolled on throughout the year, while the cut-and-thrust of domestic politics was reflected in two high-profile visits: the April visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the Commonwealth Summit, and the August visit of Congress president Rahul Gandhi to interact with policymakers, MPs, scholars as well as Indian journalists and students.

Strengths and challenges of Indian law, banking, prisons, politics and the media were closely examined during the Mallya extradition hearings, as the flamboyant businessman used the media contingent waiting outside the court to try and change the narrative that he stole money from India.

The Westminster magistrates court recommended Mallya's extradition, but many hoops remain before this can happen. He, however, remains enmeshed in several other legal cases, including those seeking to possess his houses and assets.

On the diplomatic front, there was a change of guard in India House, when Y K Sinha retired and Ruchi Ghanshyam took over as only the second woman high commissioner since 1947 (Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit was the first).

One Indian issue that has long endured in the UK is the row over 'Khalistan', which figured during Modi's visit when the Indian flag was torn by a Khalistan supporter; a rally in Trafalgar Square in August seeking a so-called 'referendum' for the independence of Punjab ; and a senior Indian official prevented from entering the Shepherd's Bush gurdwara in November.

In July, the Theresa May government brought the curtain down on the sensitive issue of enacting a law to bar caste-based discrimination. After years of debate, it decided not to legislate but to rely on emerging case-law courts.

The 1.5 million-strong Indian community has been deeply divided on the issue, with influential Hindu, Sikh and Jain lobbies denying that caste-based discrimination exists in Britain and contending that enacting such a law would entrench ideas of caste where none exist, while several individuals, Dalit and other groups insist it exists.

During most of 2018, there were four Indian-origin ministers in the May government: Alok Sharma, Shhailesh Vara, Rishi Sunak and Suella Braverman (nee Fernandes), but Brexit-related concerns prompted Vara and Braverman to resign in November. Preet Kaur Gill was appointed shadow minister for international development.

Members of the Indian community continued to figure prominently in royal honours lists. Also for the first time, a Sikh soldier of the Coldstream Guards - Charanpreet Singh Lall - figured in the in traditional Trooping the Colour ceremony at Buckingham Palace for Queen Elizabeth's birthday in June.

Meanwhile, Neil Basu was appointed head of Scotland Yard's counter-terror operations, while Imtiyaz Shaikh, who hails from Vasco da Gama, became the first councillor of Goan origin to be elected to the council in Swindon.

On Independence Day, Scotland Yard returned to the Indian high commission a 12th century Buddha statue that was stolen from the Archaeological Survey of India's museum in Nalanda, Bihar, in August 1961, and recovered in the UK.

The year also saw a school in England launch a unique course on 'Hinglish', the popular portmanteau of English and Hindi used in Indian films, newspaper headlines, television and everyday discourse. Teachers in the school are surprised at the interest in the course.

The India-UK links also extended to the difficult world of stammering. A delighted Matthew Richardson, returning after conducting the first McGuire Programme in New Delhi in December for 30 people, said, ""They arrived as people unable to speak effectively and left as proud public speakers. Helping people in India to break the stigma of stammering is something I am very proud of"".

And finally, 'Bihar Diwas', on March 22, was celebrated in a unique location: Patna, in Scotland, a village in East Ayrshire founded in the early nineteenth century by a Briton, who was born in Patna, Bihar but returned to Scotland, to house mine workers. The chief guest was also appropriate: the Patna-born Y K Sinha, the former high commissioner."

For actor, performer and learner Anjali Patil, cinema itself carries meaning. A headstrong individual, both on-screen and off, Anjali is known for her interesting choice of films that are a far cry from commercial cinema. At 31 years old, she is a performer par excellence with several award nominations and five wins, both nationally and internationally.

Best known in the circuit of parallel cinema, Anjali is 19 films old, with a web series debut also on the cards.

Finding her light

At just 10 years old, the actor did her first street play after much coaxing of her parents and dramatics teachers. Talking about her first memory of being an actor, she says, ""I had to convince my teachers a lot to take me into dramas. I think I was the youngest one to do street plays; on AIDS awareness at 10 years old. But, I was ready to do it because all the older girls thought I couldn't pull it off. I knew it was a disease, and didn't know much detail; I wasn't adult enough, and yet, I kept doing 40 shows of that, playing the HIV victim, educating people.""

Being a globe-trotter

Travelling is the most crucial part in the actor's life, where she says it gave her the drive to explore the world quite early. Talking about her parents' plans to make her a doctor back then, she jests, ""There were some very limited options 20 years ago. And my parents expected me to take up a government job, become a doctor as I was good at biology. All these reality shows and films were not all hep and cool like they are now. I had to go through a lot of struggle to convince my parents (about acting as a viable career)""

Education and perpetual musings

The National Film Award-winner for Naa Bangaaru Thalli caught her talent young and began to nurture it ever since. Talking about her love for the arts, she gleams, ""I was really into dance. I studied Kathak and Bharatanatyam when I was young. And then, I went to Pune University to study acting and ended up getting the gold medal. My parents were surprised; reassured that acting can be a respected profession.""

Then, just when her parents asked her of her next step, she said that she wanted to study more. Her father's strained finances forced her to drop the idea of universities in London.

""I figured that I needed to be economically-independent so I can make my own decisions. So, I went to National School of Drama (NSD), I was the youngest there too. I had a scholarship and I chose direction because I wanted to challenge myself,"" she reveals.

Making an essential yet existential statement, she says, ""I just feel that we as human beings have tremendous capacity to do many things, we get caught up in our identities. I kept changing things that defined me as Anjali Patil.""

Backstage banter

""After my direction stint in NSD, I got my first film, Delhi in a Day and I just did it. I never planned to act in independent films and then get into mainstream. The film gave me happiness. The film did amazingly well, went to 30 plus film festivals, and one after the other, in a span of a few years, I was doing 6-7 films. None of them were planned,"" says she.

It has been five years since Naa Bangaaru Talli, a bi-lingual award hoarder that the actor was a part of. ""I'm still waiting for a good script. The Telugu industry also has a certain bracket and I might not fit the bill. I mean, I can do glamorous roles, but at the end of the day, they need to give me something to work with. Just to look beautiful, sing and dance would be disastrous for them and for me,"" says the talent.

Raving about Pa Ranjith's Kaala, the actor says the women in the film were given both freedom and focus.

Relatively speaking

Youngest in a family of five, Anjali has a brother and a sister. She visits her parents in Nashik and the actor says her relationship with her parents was not always paradise-like. ""I never blame them for resisting; slowly but steadily they understood my passion. Our equation is ever-evolving, and it is beautiful. In 2007, I turned Buddhist, left city life to live in the mountains; they supported me. It took many years to realise that my parents gave their best to me, and now, I have become a parent to them because they're growing old,"" says the actor in a tranquil tone."

The affidavit and the court order give credence to the allegation that the state will be using the funds allocated for ""women empowerment.""

The interim order on Friday directed the state to file an affidavit giving details of the total expenditure to be incurred for the event.

""This is more so because the State Attorney KV Sohan has referred us to the budget speech for the year 2018-19 where allocations are seen made for various social welfare schemes proposed by the government, especially with regard to women welfare and empowerment,"" said the order of the High Court.

Besides, the affidavit filed by the state before the HC stated that in the 2018-2019 budget speech, it was declared that an amount of Rs 50 crore has been earmarked for various schemes aimed at preventing the atrocities against women. It was aimed to conduct a massive campaign by involving various categories of government employees including police, people's representatives, lawyers, teachers and students and the general public.

Albeit, if walls could speak, they would recite decade-old tales of boys, rowdy yet respectful, who roamed the halls, not knowing that they would create history someday.

The school in question is the Sree Rama Varma Govt Model High School, popularly known as the SRV High School.

Accessible on the western side through the MG Road, southern side via the Karakkat Crossroad and on the eastern side by the Chittoor Road, Cochin's first school lies in the heart of the city.

Replete with buildings dating all the way to 1845, and founded by the Cochin Royal family in 1843, SRV is Kochi's first school.

Post-independence, the school was handed over to the government. To celebrate 175 years since it's founding, the Old Students' Association(OSA) gathered steam and tracked alumni down. And they discovered treasure.

""Finding our batch mates from the 1960s and 1970s was an arduous task. There were no records, unlike today. We found out that almost every student who had passed out of SRV in its early years has either retired from higher positions or currently hold high ranks,"" said Ramachandran P K, class of 1969 and current vice-president of the OSA. He then went to list alumni, ""Swami Chinmayananda, founder of Chinmaya Mission; Krishnaswami Kasturirangan, former chairman, ISRO; A K Sheshadri, former Kochi Mayor..."" One can see that the school has indeed churned out valuables.

A day before their 175th-year celebrations, members of the OSA narrated tales from their school days. A K Sabapathy, president of the OSA, who passed out in the 1950s, and the oldest among them, spoke about the respect for teachers. ""Unlike today, we were scared of teachers. Classes would begin at 9 am so we would arrive much before time,"" he said.

K Kasturirangan fondly remembered his SRV years as the most eventful. ""In our class, a few tables were kept apart for the members of the Cochin Royal family. These boys used to come in a limousine, and enter the class just a minute before the lessons. This was to keep a level of separation between the children of Royal family and commoners,"" he says.

He goes on to speak about meeting the Cochin Maharaja at a function during his stint as the chairman of ISRO. ""He was also a student around that time when I was in SRVHS. We exchanged some very pleasant experiences of sharing the same class between Royalty and commoners,"" Kasturirangan said. He has also played an enormous role in the school's growth.

Director Amal Neerad who passed out in 1990 reminisced his schooling days. ""I passed out in 1990. The school was nicknamed 'Sakala Rowdy Vidyalayam'. We used to have brilliant teachers who dealt issues with a sense of humour. Also, my first tryst with theatre was at SRV,"" he says.

Nevertheless, the alumni feel the school has lost its shine. ""We intend to reclaim its lost glory. The school has immense facilities with exceptional teachers. The entry of CBSE sure has taken away most students, along with the lack of ambience. The school falls under the Corporation. Together, SRV could attract students like how it used to,"" says Aravindakshan, joint secretary of the OSA, class of 1967."

It was in 2010 that Delhi's Shri Ram School Maths and Computer Science teacher Sujata Sahu first went on a trip to Ladakh. It was a solo trek, and on the third day, she began to face extreme difficulty breathing and walking. The low oxygen in the altitudes as high as 16,100 feet had given her Pulmonary Edema.

She needed to rest, and with the help of two passing trekkers, she decided to spend the night at a remote village --

""A village which has no road access, is reachable only after a day's walk, and one which boasted of just one home with three occupants. I had neither medicines, nor the ability to call my family, nor access to medical care,"" says 50-year-old Sahu, a resident of Gurugram.

In was in these conditions that she saw two tiny schools which totally changed her life.

The first primary school -- Sku-Kaya -- had five students and two teachers. It had two rooms which were being rebuilt. While one teacher had stayed in the village, the other had gone to Leh to get uniforms and mid-day meal supplies for the school.

The second school had eight children and three teachers. It was two of them who had stopped to help Sahu when she was feeling sick. They had been walking back to Leh for textbooks and uniforms

The children were being taught from English books, which was very alien to them as they had no electricity or TV or telephone connectivity and thus, had no idea what the outside world was like. Having never set foot out of their villages, the exposure level of these children was very low.

.In Ladakh, even the summer months were bitingly cold but that didn't stop the kids from coming to school to learn. ""One of the children even brought his little brother along, who was barely two years old and the love and care with which all the children and the teacher took care of the child was a lesson for me,"" says Sahu.

What really hit her on that fateful Ladakh trip was the sheer drive of the Ladakhi people there to keep growing and improving their circumstances.

""Their determination to come to school and learn, the eagerness of the teacher to learn something new to teach his students, and the aspiration of the parents to educate their children was my inspiration to drop everything and help these amazing people,"" says Sahu.

From a regular school teacher to Ladakh's 'Iron Lady'

""My experience with the schools in Ladakh gave me a path to follow, one that I knew I could contribute to,"" says Sujata Sahu, who had spent 12 years in the corporate world before starting to work with children.

But she had been working at the Shri Ram School for just two years at the time, and leaving this job was the hardest decision she had to make in her life.

""I was planning to take on a seemingly herculean task, in possibly one of the toughest terrains of the world. I had no idea about where I would get the funds from and was also not very clear on how much of an impact I alone could make,"" she says.

Moreover, no one had done something like this before her in Ladakh. But thankfully, she found with herself two strong founding partners -- her husband, Sandeep Sahu, who had been trekking in the region for almost 35 years, and Dawa Jora, a Ladakhi businessman, all of whom had the strong conviction that something like this was really needed for the region.

In 2011, unable to find other NGOs to partner with, the three founders went on a three-day trek to one of the most isolated villages in Lingshed (in Ladakh), carrying 1500 kg of education material on 25 horses, and crossing three mountains at extreme temperatures as low as minus 15 degrees.

The treacherous and steep pass they crossed at an altitude of almost 17000 ft inspired the name of the '17000 ft foundation'.

As she started off on her mission to provide Ladakh schools with the right resources to further the education of their students, she realised this wouldn't be very easy.

""One of our biggest challenges was convincing corporates that even remote areas with extremely scattered and small populations needed support,"" says Sahu.

For the first two years, the foundation worked only with the founders' own funds and kind contributions of friends and family members.

""Though no non-profit organisations were willing to take on Ladakh as a region, we were given support in the form of knowledge, pedagogy and even a large donation of books for our first 100 libraries,"" she says.

Sujata Sahu's undying passion to help the people of Ladakh earned her the nickname of the 'Iron Lady'.

How Ladakh poses a unique set of education problems

India is a geographical anomaly as it has every type of topographical setup, each of which comes with its own challenges. This makes it extremely difficult for the government to cater to every type of problem that can arise in this vast country owing to accessibility issues, extreme weather conditions etc.

Ladakh has almost a 1000 schools across Leh and Kargil, spread across 60,000 sq km of harsh mountains. Catering to a school going population of under 40,000 children, the average school strength of these schools is barely 25 students across the two districts, explains Sahu.

Teachers themselves come from remote villages and have to travel long distances for training, school supplies and even basic administrative functions, leading to long absences and shortage of staff, she adds.

Also, ""While teachers are given basic residential training during winters as well as in-service training, most of the trainings are not contextualized for the uniqueness of the Ladakhi education system,"" she says.

The extreme weather also adds to the problems with schools being shut for severe winters for three months in a year when the roads become inaccessible due to thick snow and temperatures as low as minus 35-40 degrees.

""Incredibly, despite the remoteness of the region, every little hamlet which has even 10 school going children has a tiny government school with teachers in attendance, thanks to the local administration. A little wonder then, that 89% of the schools in Ladakh are govt schools with the private schools present in just a handful of the larger villages,"" she says.

""What is commendable is that all these 900 plus schools are functional and have qualified teachers in attendance. What is even more remarkable is that every child in every village goes to school, managing to at least complete middle school,"" Sahu adds

However, it is only the larger villages which have middle schools and after passing class 5, children have to walk around two hours to get to school to continue their education. Public transport isn't available in such terrain and the army provides army vans for commuting.

.Despite the presence of these govt schools, the community here wants a better life and quality education for their children so they can get better jobs. This aspiration makes them send their very young children, often as young as three years old, to be enrolled in private schools, often extremely far away from their homes.

""Cut off from their villages and parents for months in a year, these children grow up in dormitories, hostels or with other families. Lacking the care and guidance they need in their growing up years, this leads to large-scale dropouts and a population of youth who are unable to go back to their villages,"" Sahu explains.

17000 ft works in these remote villages by improving existing govt schools so that parents would have faith in them and stop sending their children away so far that it disconnects them from their roots.

How voluntourism is helping 17000 ft foundation grow

Sujata Sahu started her non-profit organisation with just the founders and a few volunteers who were given the task to survey the entire length and breadth of Ladakh.

The team mapped around 600 schools after a seven-month-long study. Some of these schools had been bomb shelters during the Kargil war and the buildings had to be shifted multiple times.

The success of the volunteer programmes helped the foundation grow and each of these schools has been geo-mapped for travellers to find.

""We, very early on, piloted our volunteering programmes to involve outsiders in the work of our organization and to also understand if people could be encouraged to donate to such a cause. The enthusiasm and support shown by complete strangers told us that we were on the right track,"" says Sahu.

""Our volunteers, who are our brand ambassadors, then carried the story of our work into their workplaces and CSR then became our main source of funding. Voluntourism, as it is called today, still forms a good 25% of our annual budget and helps us maintain our backend costs,"" she adds.

Why playgrounds are so important in Ladakh schools

Though the govt schools all over Ladakh have proper buildings, they lack the proper facilities that make a school a happy, joyous and welcoming place for children. And in a remote location with rugged ground, a playground comes as a blessing.

""In these remote villages, where nothing is available, there are absolutely no options for children to play with. Though these schools have well-qualified teachers and very low pupil-teacher-ratio, parents often judge the performance of a school based just on the facilities they provide,"" says Sahu.

Thus, parents see the existence of a playground in govt schools as a very good incentive to not send away their kids to far-off private schools.

""Today, 17000 ft foundation has setup playgrounds in 140 schools with colourful swings, slides, see saws etc. many of which the team had to carry over horseback for days to reach our remotest schools,"" she says.

Solving the problem of no native language storybooks in Ladakh

A big aspect of Ladakh education that surprised Sujata Sahu was how the kids learned in English medium schools even though they have no exposure to the foreign language. Their native language was Bhoti.

""To add to this burden, children also have to study their local language as well an additional Hindi/Urdu from grade 1,"" says Sahu.

To enable the children to read better and get comfortable with the number of languages they have to deal with, 17000 ft set up libraries in 230 schools with simple and easy to read story books in English, Hindi and Urdu.

""However, sadly, there are absolutely no story books in Bhoti for children to read. Sensing this gap, we undertook a mission to translate storybooks from English to Bhoti.""

""In 2015, we launched our first phase where we translated 21 titles and published 21,000 storybooks for distribution into 300 schools,"" says Sahu.

This year again, the organisation not only translated another 20 titles, but also added illustrations and changed narratives to make them more relatable to the children of Ladakh.

What has 17000 ft foundation achieved so far?

In the span of just six years, Sujata Sahu's organisation has accomplished much.

""Today, 17000 ft works with 250 govt schools across Leh and Kargil and we are already seeing a reverse trend of children coming back from private schools back to the govt schools in their villages,"" says Sahu.

The organisation has set up libraries in 230 schools, playgrounds in 140 schools, and trained over 1500 teachers in various methodologies with a team which is in Ladakh every winter for training teachers.

17000 ft foundation has conducted multiple community workshops in 125 villages with over 10,000 villagers contributing to our workshops and programmes in the schools.

Recently, the organisation electrified and digitized 120 schools in Leh and Kargil, providing solar electricity and tablets with customized digital learning content, a TV, and a server to provide offline data syncing.

The DigiLab project is the non-profit's most ambitious programme bringing offline hybrid digital learning solutions to the remote villages.

The well-furnished digital labs supported by workshops from the team throughout the year can help the students learn independently with guidance from their teachers.

How crowfunding is helping 17000 ft foundation

Crowdfunding is increasingly coming up as a very important resource collection measure.

""17000 ft has been involved with ImpactGuru.com in multiple projects, the latest being the funding of a Playground for a very remote school in Kargil. We had also fundraised for our Bhoti Book Translation project through ImpactGuru.com and managed to raise more than we needed,"" says Sahu.

Fundraising platforms are great for helping nonprofits fund small projects that have tangible goals and timelines. It is an excellent way to help get the word out to potential supporters and garner more support for the non-profit, says the Iron Lady of Ladakh.

Future of 17000 ft foundation

Before 17000 ft was established, there was little or no attention on the remote schools of Ladakh, and today with all our work and efforts and the participation of the local communities, govt schools are looking and performing better and we are seeing a reverse trend of children coming back to their villages and govt schools.

""When we started, one of our biggest challenges was encouraging donors, volunteers, foundations and even corporates to focus on remote regions of Ladakh. Today, however, we are confident that our model is working and we can get the support we need,"" beams Sahu.

Sujata Sahu now wants to take this model to other remote and mountainous regions, like Arunachal Pradesh, or the remote areas of Himachal.

""We feel that we are closer now to our vision of a better life and education for all children, regardless of geography or terrain,"" she says.

The Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ranchi, will evaluate the merger of primary schools in Jharkhand. The state education department has roped in the institute for a detailed study of 4,600 merged schools to find out if the reorganisation has brought about any improvement or not, department officials said.

State education secretary AP Singh said, ""IIM Ranchi would see if the reorganisation has brought any benefits for students as well as the education system. It would also evaluate if the initiative brought about any improvement in the education of those students who were shifted to other schools in the merger process,"" he said. ""We have sought a financial proposal from the institute for the study.""

The reorganisation exercise of schools had also caught the interest of IIM Bangalore, which expressed its willingness to carry out a study on the process and its benefits, said the secretary.

Merging schools with low enrolment is an exercise that has been undertake by Rajasthan and Jharkhand in the country with the support of the Union government and NITI (National Institution for Transforming India) Aayog, the policy think tank of the Government of India. Jharkhand started the merging procedure in 2016-17.

Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) director Uma Shankar Singh said that there were 39,600 schools in 2016-17 under the education department in Jharkhand. ""Of them, 18,000 schools had 60 or fewer students. These schools had an average of one or two teachers per school. Providing quality education was a major challenge. One teacher was handling four-five classes at a time. How could one expect a better education in these schools?"" he said.

The council said that a four-step process -- field inspection; cross-district verification; block and district consultation; and final notification -- was undertaken to merge the schools.

Singh said that 98% students from the 4,600 primary schools had been shifted and 96% of the students had expressed satisfaction with the consolidation. ""We faced difficulty in shifting 150 schools due to some technical reasons. Now, the issue has been resolved, and students from 120 schools have been shifted,"" he said.

The reorganisation of primary schools benefited seven lakh students, giving them better teacher availability, and cut the requirement of 4,500 teaching positions. The merger process saved the government Rs 400 crore by reducing teaching positions and infrastructure requirements, said JEPC officials. The officials added that the funds thus saved would be spent on strengthening the education infrastructure of the merged schools."

Each year on the 22 December, schools and educational institutes around the country observe and celebrate National Mathematics Day.

And while not everyone feels the need to celebrate mathematics, the day is observed not to honour the field as a whole, but a very special Indian mathematician whose trust with mathematics has inspired books, art and our tradition to commemorate the genius of Srinivasa Ramanujan on 22 December each year - his birth anniversary - as National Mathematics Day.

Born in 1887 in the charming city of Erode, Tamil Nadu, Ramanujan's earliest stories begin around the age of 12. He had mastered the dizzying logic of trigonometry and developed theorems on his own without any assistance.

His passion for mathematics and the brilliance of the world it translated to at an early age.

The wiz kid

Turning 10 years old in 1897, he aced his primary school exams in English, Tamil, geography and arithmetic with the best scores in his district. Ramanujan entered Town Higher Secondary School that year, where he encountered formal mathematics for the first time.

By age 11, he had exhausted the mathematical knowledge of two college students lodging at his home, and was lent a book on advanced trigonometry around the same time. He mastered this by age 13, by which time he was discovering sophisticated theorems on his own.

Ramanujan at 14 was being lauded with merit certificates and academic awards in a trend that weaves through his entire school career, where he also assisted the school with logistics of placing 1200 students, each with needs of their own, under the tutelage of its 35-odd teachers.

He would complete mathematical exams in half the allotted time, and unwittingly brought on comments from his peers over the years, who ""rarely understood him"" and ""stood in respectful awe"" of him in the years since.

Awakening the genius

Ramanujan at age 16 in 1903 got access to a library copy of a book - A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics, a collection of 5,000 mathematical theorems, which he reportedly studied in great detail. This book is generally acknowledged by accounts of his life as a key element in awakening his genius.

Towards his schooling's end, this earned him a scholarship to study at the Government Arts College of Kumbakonam in Tamil Nadu. His headmaster in school would introduce Ramanujan as ""the outstanding student who deserved scores higher than the maximum"". But he squandered the opportunity due to his horrendous performance in other important subjects, including English, philosophy and Sanskrit.

Without a formal degree, Ramanujan is said to have dropped out of college and pursued research in mathematics on his own, living in stark poverty, at the brink of starvation. It was in 1910 at age 23 that support from renowned mathematician Ramaswamy Iyer helped him scored a job clerking at the Madras Port Trust.

Cambridge calling

He would work at the office by day, and do what came naturally to him (theoretical mathematics, that is) in his spare time. British mathematician G Hardy wrote Ramanujan a letter in 1913, expressing interest in learning more about his work. It was ""essential that I should see proofs of some of your assertions"", he is said to have added.

Ramanujan responded to Hardy, who eventually became his mentor, on principles of mutual interest to them, saying:

""I beg to introduce myself to you as a clerk in the Accounts Department of the Port Trust Office at Madras... I have no University education but I have undergone the ordinary school course. After leaving school I have been employing the spare time at my disposal to work at Mathematics. I have not trodden through the conventional regular course which is followed in a University course, but I am striking out a new path for myself.""

G Hardy and Ramanujan ended up working together in Cambridge for five years shortly after their first correspondence. Their collaboration was a clash of different cultures, beliefs, and working styles, but his work in Mathematics made a left a deep impression on Hardy for years to come. Hardy was quoted to have said about Ramanujan in a book:

""He could remember the idiosyncrasies of numbers in an almost uncanny way. It was Littlewood (a mutual colleague) who said that every positive integer was one of Ramanujan's personal friends. I remember once going to see him when he was ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an unfavorable omen. ""No,"" he replied, ""it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.""

A self-made luminary

Born to a housewife and a sari clerk, his family home in Kumbakonam was small and modest. The modest thatched-roof house on Saranhapani Sannidhi Street has been turned into a museum in his honour.

Ramanujan was a self-taught mathematician. He contributed inordinately to the world of mathematics, and was globally popular - one of the most influential mathematicians of his time. From compiling over 3900 mathematical theorems and equations to having discoveries and streets named after him, his assertions in mathematics were unshakeable and profound to others researching mathematics."
"383","1024407572","2018-12-22","https://swarajyamag.com/culture/in-coimbatore-library-love-endures-among-readers-and-researchers-amidst-digitalisation","In Coimbatore, Library Love Endures Among Readers And Researchers Amidst Digitalisation","swarajyamag.com",FALSE,"The two main libraries in Coimbatore serve readers and researchers alike, with a Rs 7 crore grant by the government aiming to further spruce up stock and enable the digitisation drive.

A muffled traffic buzz manages to intrude the 'silent' confines of a library on the busy Cowly Brown road in Coimbatore. The unassuming two-storey building is nevertheless the district central library, the largest public library in the city, which seems to be in a hurry to go 'paperless'.

A register at the entrance with a pen strung to it, where visitors sign in and sign out, does not give away much about the library that provides access to about 3 lakh books of all categories for a modest annual membership fee of Rs 60, and is just a month away from implementing the tracking technology, radio frequency identification (RFID).

There are 199 libraries (including village and grade two levels) tucked away in various parts of Coimbatore. Starved of a meaningful upgrade for more than five years now, a Rs 7 crore grant by the state's Minister for Education K A Sengottaiyan, this year, has come as a welcome move that can bring about a substantial overhaul in terms of book replenishment, says N Manikandan, district library officer in charge of Tirupur and Coimbatore districts.

For instance, in 2015-16, the central district library added 7,090 books valued at Rs 1,073,126 to its collection. While 2016-17 didn't see any addition at all, 2,781 books costing Rs 1,195,554 were added in 2017-18.

Started in 1952, the central district library has about 62,000 members on its roll and 700 visiting it every day, which includes newspaper loyalists, while the second biggest branch library in Coimbatore's busy Town Hall with about 80,359 books, has 230 visiting it on a daily basis.

Students at the research section

About 110,000 visitors have used the district library in the year 2017-18, with a large proportion of them having benefited from its research material. These numbers suggest libraries have become centres of allied activities - a shift from the passive role of a book lender to engaging visitors in enterprising projects. For instance, as part of the district library's non-customary programmes, a group of retired professors have been mentoring civil service aspirants for the past one year.

""The lectures we organise have drawn a lot of interest, and this is one way to encourage library visits,"" said Manikandan, who sits at the district library headquarters in Town Hall, which also hosts the branch library.

This has also redefined their purpose, which has acquired a more academic character. A key role of the library today is to put vast resources at the disposal of students preparing for civil services and competitive examinations, which include online access to important data. He cites Megastar, an online resource platform that gives access to 250 magazines, as an example.

Though a handful of youngsters poring over bulky books and handwritten notes in the research chamber of the district library appear to recreate a classroom environment, they are a content lot. ""I refer books here from morning until evening,"" says Elakiya Ravindra Kumar, a civil service aspirant. Pointing to a pair of computer systems, she says they can access research material and get ready assistance from librarians to locate books and other material.

So, sceptics who are weighing libraries' relevance in the digital age may have to settle for the truth that these repositories of books are not hastening to fade into oblivion, as the district central librarian P Rajendran vouches: ""Physical books are not going away anywhere soon, though we are digitising library management at all levels possible. Our transactions, lending and sorting of books returned, are digitised, and the implementation of RFID is only going to make tracking easier and circulation operations more efficient and faster.""

RFID will also limit all sorts of losses to the library such as book theft, said the librarian. However, he said with a smile, the library treats this 'offence' with leniency as it's love of books that triggers this temptation, though, he said, it will deprive an equally deserving reader of a book that has been 'unceremoniously' taken off the shelf.

Some limitations even with a reasonable extent of digitisation is the difficulty in locating 'mislaid' books. Visitors browsing through the shelves may inadvertently leave a history book in the literature section, where it will languish for years.

Every section of readers from men, women and children to the physically/intellectually challenged has a place in the library that has 60 per cent Tamil and 40 per cent English books, said Rajendran.

Stepping into the hallway of the library, the outstanding facilities for the differently-abled don't go unnoticed. A carefully designed section is fitted out with the gear that help the blind and other physically- and intellectually-challenged visitors experience library 'moments'.

Specially adapted computer keyboards like low vision/large print accessory, braille books, 'magnetic minds' for hand and eye coordination, tactile graphics for the visually challenged, specifically designed chess boards, and geometry and algebra kits are a small part of the paraphernalia helping the differently-abled readers, about 15 of them who visit the library mostly during the weekends, experience reading in a library.

Books for differently-abled children sit on low-built shelves

Low-built shelves and a wheel-chair ramp and trained staff at the section said a lot about the thought that has gone into making the library accessible to all.

Rajendran said with the aid of the 'read easy' device, which supports an audio format, some of their visually challenged scholar readers have gone on to acquire a PhD. The library also arranges volunteers to assist the visually-challenged with their exams.

The colourfully designed children's section, if one ignores some of the broken soft toys and ill-matched furnishings, stands in stark contrast to the adjoining reading room with its conventional carrels, and empty shelves waiting for 'new arrivals'. While there is a separate book-lending section for children, next to the women's reading section, this enclosure is used for story-reading.

""We have expert teachers volunteering to read stories to about 50 children during the weekends,"" Rajendran said, adding, summer camps coordinated by the library is very popular, and about 50 to 70 children attend them on an average.

The branch library in Town Hall

The branch library in Town Hall, though modest, is a place where neighbouring residents spend some quiet time and keep the library tradition alive. An incomprehensible combination of numbers and letters pasted on the books sitting on rudimentary iron shelves are ""the codes holding the description and location of books,"" explained chief librarian M Manimekalai.

Used mostly by students preparing for civil services, the library is also visited by the older generation, especially to read newspapers and know the day's happenings, she said.

The library landscape of Coimbatore is dotted with university libraries, which of course, provide limited access to their resources. For the purpose of this article, the Bharathiar University, which has the third-largest collection of books in the state, next to only the Madras University and Madurai Kamaraj University, was selected.

With a book stock of 2 lakh, the sprawling university campus is home to one of the most technologically advanced library facilities. ""We have a reading lab fitted with 40 computer systems, which the students use to read, download material from and for reference,"" said university librarian Dr R Sarangapani.

""Students use internet protocol address, mostly, to access a vast source of professional journals and books for their dissertations,"" he said.

A leading example of source for research was INFLIBNET, an autonomous inter-university centre of the University Grants Commission under the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD). ""It was available for five years, from 2012 to 2017, but now the services have been suspended. The MHRD is in talks with the government to restore it,"" said Sarangapani.

Bharathiar University's e-resources also comprise the opulent publications database built by its faculty. The university has been ranked thirteenth for research development by MHRD's National Institutional Ranking Framework.

In order to stay relevant and more useful, libraries have indeed moved beyond facilitating reading for pleasure. Its custodian's role, too, has expanded from just physically curating operations to managing and streamlining electronic content.

Why we need a building when the world is turning 'bookless' is a question that may have to wait, perhaps forever, as books emanate an energy that is palpable and libraries would remain the top-shelf option as long as there is a zeal for credibility and community.

Perhaps, this thought was on French philosopher Jean-Paul Satre's mind when he described his library moments as a child: ""I set off on incredible adventures. This meant climbing chairs and tables, at the risk of provoking avalanches which might have buried me.""

Walking through the silent alleys of the district library, I traced my fingers along the spine of the books, content to realise they will continue to serve readers through the twenty-first century, with e-books and devices supporting alongside the pursuit for limitless information and knowledge."

The bench passed the order while dismissing an appeal by a teacher whose absence from the school had been treated by authorities as ""dies non"".

At present, teachers whose retirement date falls after June (beginning of an academic year) are given extension till March-April (end of the academic year). Given the surplus teaching strength in government schools, school education department officials said the extensions were causing an additional financial burden in terms of monthly salaries.

A government order released in connection with this stated that there will no more re-employment of teachers who retired at the age of 58. The practice of re-employing retired teachers began in 1959 when there was a shortage of teachers and government found it difficult to find replacements in the middle of an academic year. This in turn had an adverse impact on the students' academic performance. To avoid this, teachers were allowed to serve till the end of the academic year.

On an average, 2,500 teachers retire each year and 500 of them receive extensions, shows data. But now TN has 15,000 surplus teachers, claim government reports. With 2.3 lakh teachers, the teacher:student ratio is around 1:25. Despite lack of subject teachers and existence of single-teacher schools, it is comfortably above national average.

So, re-employment of retired teachers was an additional financial burden and doing away with it won't impact the students, read orders issued by Pradeep Yadav, state school education secretary. Also, most of the teachers are not allotted classes regularly and some are promoted to do administrative work in district-level education department offices, it added. The GO exempted schools where there are no surplus teachers.

In a related development, the government has decided to take strict action against teachers who go on unauthorised leave. District and chief educational officers have been instructed to take strict action against such absentees, failing which disciplinary proceedings will be initiated against them, read a circular sent to schools. The circular warned that pension and other benefits of teachers who die during such unauthorised leave period will be stopped."

4. JU Tech Faculty Gets 7 Days To Decide Whether It Wants NBA Tag

Jadavpur University on Wednesday, 19 December, gave its engineering departments seven days to come clear if they want to be recognised by the National Board of Accreditation (NBA).

None of the 14 engineering departments has replied, a university official said on Friday, 21 December.

Some mechanical engineering and production engineering teachers are opposed to the NBA accreditation because they feel the process has diluted the university's autonomy in drawing up its curriculum, the official said.

6. City Cops Get Safety Cushion To Buffer Fall From Even 20th floor

All nine people, who jumped from a height of about 50-feet during the March 2010 Stephen Court blaze on Park Street, would be alive today if the city police had a piece of life-saving equipment that it does now -- a mighty cushion that can safely break the fall from up to a 20-storey structure.

Possibly the first of its kind in the country, the stateof-the-art Vetter SP 60 safety cushion could have also saved the lives of two guests, who had jumped off the third floor of a Ho Chi Minh Sarani hotel to escape a blaze last year.

7. Man Barges Into Salt Lake Flat, Chases, Stabs Elderly Woman

A 71-year-old woman in Salt Lake was slashed and stabbed by a man who rang the doorbell of her house to ask for money on Friday, 21 December. The attacker, who hid his face behind a full-mask helmet, fled the first-floor flat in Purbachal Housing Society with some cash.

Victim Banasree Chakraborty and her family -- her son Anish, his wife and son -- have lived at the 650sqft, two-bedroom apartment for 28 years. Around noon on Friday, when her son and his wife were at work, the doorbell rang. Chakraborty thought her grandson had returned from school and opened the door without checking. Instead, she found a man wearing a helmet who asked for money for his mother's treatment. When Chakraborty turned to look for some money, he allegedly forced his way in and attacked her.

Occupations traditionally considered as 'lowly', like sweeping and leather work, continue to be dominated by scheduled castes in general, more so by the specific castes associated with such work. And the jobs at the top are almost entirely in the grip of those who are not from scheduled castes or tribes.

Among coveted jobs at the top, those entirely in the private sector -- corporate managers and business professionals -- have the worst representation of SCs and STs. About 93% of corporate manager jobs are held by non-SC/ST people. In the case of sectors with significant government presence, such as teaching and healthcare, the scenario is much better.

It is difficult to say from the current data set how much this skew in the presence of SCs and STs in many professions is because of class -- as class closely mirrors caste in India -- and how much is due to actual caste discrimination. But what is amply evident is that the link between caste and occupation remains strong. Also, worryingly, the link between occupations traditionally viewed as 'lowly', such as sweepers and leather workers, seems to be as strong in younger age groups as in older ones.

Among the aspirational jobs that TOI looked at in the census data (see graphics), SCs have the highest proportion among teachers and healthcare professionals, 8.9% and 9.3%, respectively, though still well below their proportion of 14% in all non-farm workers. STs have proportional representation in the teaching profession in almost all states.

Another profession with representation of SCs (13.7%) and STs (9.3%) almost in proportion to their population shares is that of policemen, again totally in the government sector. In fact, STs have a representation among police personnel well over their proportion of 4% among all non-farm workers, thanks to many states with significant tribal populations taking them in large numbers into the police force.

Despite several reports of mid-day meal cooks belonging to scheduled castes facing discrimination, intriguingly, there is a fairly high proportion of SCs among cooks in several states, including Punjab (44.3%) and Uttar Pradesh (21.3%), two states generally seen as caste-ridden. Why this is the case is not clear.

Among lower rung professions, those involving hard manual labour again show a pattern of SC and ST representation well above their proportion in the non-farm worker population. In the middling professions, their presence improves considerably compared to the aspirational professions, but remains lower than their share in all non-farm jobs.

There are only two professions, leather work and sweeping, where the scheduled castes are in a majority. For instance, of the 46,000 leather workers in Uttar Pradesh, 41,000 are from castes traditionally associated with leather work -- Chamars, Dhusia, Jatava, etc. Similarly, in Rajasthan, of 76,000 sweepers, almost 52,000 belong to castes such as Bhangi, Mehtar and Chura, associated traditionally with this job.

Though there are signs of SCs breaking into better jobs to some extent, in the case of castes associated with sweeping and leather work, a significant chunk is still stuck in these traditional occupations. For instance, in Uttar Pradesh, of the total number of SC persons in the 35-59 age group working as sweepers, 63.4% are Balmikis. Even in the 15-34 age group, 62% of SC sweepers are Balmikis, showing how little has changed for the new generation. Similarly, of SCs engaged in leather work in the 35-59 age group, Chamars, Dhusias, Jatavas account for 88.2%. In the 15-34 age group, too, that proportion is 88.2%. A similar pattern holds in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan as well.

Visiting Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday proposed setting up of Confucius Institutes in India as part of what he called ""brand projects"".

He publicly made the pitch after a bilateral meeting with External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, as he listed several projects including pilgrimage tours, celebrating Chinese New Year in India, and joint medical teams.

Confucius Institutes across the world have faced intense scrutiny and criticism for allegedly spreading Chinese propaganda. India has been reticent about the proliferation of Confucius Institutes, even as Beijing has been sending feelers to Delhi about its intention to establish them.

ExplainedInstitute can be subject to outside influence

With growing foreign policy clout, China is perceived to be using a state-sponsored cultural institution, the Confucius Institute, as a tool to increase its public influence overseas. Founded in 2004, its faculty are not employed by host universities, so they are not protected by codes of academic freedom and can be subject to outside influence. Their courses often ignore Beijing's history of human rights abuse and authoritarianism -- - the Tiananmen Square massacre is ignored, Taiwan and Tibet are portrayed as undisputed territories and the persecution of Uighurs and Falun Gong is missing. The students receive a whitewashed version of China. New Delhi must welcome Confucius institutes, but on its own terms and not China's.

But, on Friday, after co-chairing the 'High Level Mechanism on Cultural and People-to-People Exchanges', Wang said, ""We agreed we shall develop brand projects for people-to-people interaction, including pilgrimage tours, celebrating Chinese New Year, develop Confucius Institutes, youth exchanges, joint medical teams and museum communication.""

Advertising

""We will examine when they come up with concrete proposals on the issue,"" a South Block source said, when asked about Beijing's plans to develop more Confucius Institutes. As of now, India has two Confucius Institutes, Mumbai University and VIT University in Vellore (Tamil Nadu).

Former Indian ambassador to China Ashok Kantha told The Indian Express, ""In the past, the Indian government has deemed Confucius Institutes as foreign cultural centres and as such subject to the regime applicable to such centres. This has not been acceptable to Hanban, which runs Confucius Institutes.

""The alternative is Hanban promoting Chinese language teaching, etc. in partnership with Indian educational institutions (for instance, by providing Chinese language teachers) without insisting that it must be done under the aegis of Confucius Institutes. The latter is a pragmatic option, which was pursued successfully in 2014 when Hanban provided 30-plus Chinese language teachers for introducing Chinese language in CBSE schools,"" said Kantha, who heads the Delhi-based think-tank Institute of Chinese Studies.

Several US universities had snapped ties with Confucius Institute following concerns raised by US Congressmen over ""Chinese government influence spreading throughout educational institutions in Texas"".

In 2014, the American Association of University Professors issued a statement criticising Confucius Institutes as ""functioning as an arm of the Chinese state"" and being ""allowed to ignore academic freedom"". In February 2018, FBI director Christopher Wray suggested during testimony to the US Senate Intelligence Committee that China was using ""collectors"" to infiltrate US universities and gather intelligence on behalf of the Chinese government.

Swaraj did not mention Confucius Institutes in her remarks. Instead, the minister, who called Wang her ""brother"" and ""close friend"", said that India and China have agreed on ""10 pillars"" of cooperation to enhance cultural and people-to-people exchanges. The 10 pillars are cultural exchange, cooperation in films and television, cooperation in museum administration, cooperation sports, exchanges between youths, cooperation on tourism, exchanges between states and cities, cooperation in traditional medicine, cooperation in yoga and cooperation in education, she said.

Wang said, ""India-China relations have reached a new historical stage... it reflects a personal commitment of our leaders, and this is a major initiative in the history of India-China relations."" He said this at the inaugural session of 3rd India-China High Level Media Forum.

Swaraj said she was ""satisfied"" with the outcome of her two-hour dialogue, and bilateral cooperation has improved significantly after the Wuhan Summit.

She said the armies of the two countries were also making efforts and implementing confidence-building measures to maintain peace and tranquility along the border. She raised the issue of trade deficit, but appreciated Chinese efforts to make it balanced and sustainable."

The Gurugram police said that they would launch a probe the allegations.

A few students also complained about men lurking outside their school and harassing them on their way home after the classes daily.

Rocky Mittal, the programme director of the government reform programme 'Ek aur Sudhaar', visited the school for an inspection on Friday and asked the girls about their problems.

Three students of Class 6 told him that the teacher of the primary school, located across the road from the girls' school, used to sexually harass them around a year ago.

""A number of girls started crying when they were asked about their issues. Even the teachers admitted how they have seen the girls being subjected to harassment by miscreants outside the school. The girls also named a teacher of the nearby school, saying he would harass them under the pretext of free tuitions,"" said Mittal.

Under the Ek aur Sudhaar project, Mittal has visited schools in 15 districts, including Gurugram, so far. Police said that they would look into the complaints. ""No formal complaint has been filed in the matter and the harassment of school girls is not restricted to one teacher. Students complained that they were being harassed on a daily basis, especially on their way home after school,"" said a senior police officer. The accused teacher, police said, had been posted with the neighbouring school for two years but the school authority was unaware of the girls' ordeal. The principal of the school could not be reached for comments."

Of the more than 20,000 houses in the Perumbakkam TNSCB tenements, over 13,000 have been allotted. Officials estimate there are over 8,000 children and of this, around 3,000 are studying in schools in and around the colony.

However, in order to get an exact figure of the number of school going children and to find out their needs, the school education department is conducting the survey.Over 160 teachers will take part in the survey exercise that will start at 8.30 a.m. The TNSCB has requested at least one member of the family to stay at home. ""The teachers will go door-to-door to find out the number of children and if they are going to school. They will also understand the needs of the children including the medium of education they prefer and what is lacking in the schools in the colony,"" said an official from the school education department.

Based on the survey, the School Education Department will conduct a meeting and decide upon amenities in the schools and upgrading the existing ones. Proposals for the same would be sent to the government.

""We have directions from the government to start a primary school immediately, if necessary. If the students need English-medium schools, we will send proposals for the same,"" added an official from the department. According to the TNSCB officials, the exercise will be carried out in other resettlement colonies soon.

Meanwhile, parents said the main problem they face was the improper functioning of government schools. ""They don't complete the syllabus on time. Besides, the special care given in government or Chennai schools in the city is not found here. This is the reason why many take loans and shift their children to private schools,"" said a parent."

Given the vacant posts, several important tasks at universities had been put on hold. In addition, several posts of teachers in colleges and universities across the state had been lying vacant due to non-availability of funds with the Maharashtra government.

A senior official at the ministry told this newspaper, ""The proposals and funds for recruiting deans and faculty members have been cleared on a priority basis so by the beginning of the next academic year, the vacant posts will be filled.""

Several state universities don't have full-time, permanent deans, principals, registrars, etc. Adding to this, close to 9,511 teaching positions - including those of senior professors, teachers and faculty members - are still lying vacant. Last month, the state announced it would fill up 27 per cent of such posts after facing protests, strikes and backlash from teaching groups across Maharashtra. Colleges and universities complain about inconvenience caused by the lack of proper accountability in the absence of principals and deans.

""Even for recruitment and salaries, due to non-availability of funds, all these positions remained vacant. Somehow, the available officials in-charge or lower-level staff managed to keep up with the procedure in colleges and universities.

Every month, Diwan Manna, Chairperson of Punjab Lalit Kala Akademi, Chandigarh, along with two artists and technicians, travels to sleepy little towns of Punjab such as Ralla (Mansa), Nakodar (Jalandhar) and other relatively bigger cities like Sangrur, Jalalabad, Patiala, Amritsar, Taran Taran and Sunam among others, and visits schools, colleges and craft institutes. The effort is to present a uniquely conceptualised and curated programme that encompasses an audio-visual presentation, hands-on workshops, familiarisation with materials and tools of art and also an introduction to writings on art and artists for young adults. All over India, rues Manna, there is little awareness about visual arts and that the knowledge of folk art is fast depleting. ""We are scared to look at art, for we think we don't understand it. So we decided to reach out to the younger generation and teachers, in places where there is almost no access to art,"" says Manna, the brainchild behind the project titled, Adharshila, Punjab Lalit Kala Akademi's new initiative to reach out to the younger generation in rural Punjab. The initiave has been put in place to help the young minds connect with the visual arts. The initiative attempts to help approach art, look at it and in the process prepare a generation that is sensitised towards the nuances of fine arts.

""We begin with an audio-video introduction in which we show original works of art to the participants. We then show photographs of various artists to the participants, the many facets of a portrait, landscapes, street scene among others. We share our journeys as artists in a simple, absorbing manner and they all relate and connect to it,"" shares Manna. The programme is conducted in Punjabi and the entire premise rests on the idea of helping students and teachers appreciating art and not necessarily creating artists, encouraging them to look at it and follow their senses.

Bookmarks on various artists such as Amrita Sher-Gil, Krishen Khanna, Manjit Bawa, Raghu Rai, and Paramjit Singh among others, have been created, on which the name, portrait, work and also some information about the artist is printed in both English and Punjabi. These, along with booklets on 30 artists and special catalogues are shared with the library of the school, college or institute.

Clay modelling and drawing workshops, painting and drawing workshops, sculpture workshops are being conducted by artists such as Madan Lal, Jagdeep Jolly, Jaspreet Singh, Sarabjeet Singh, Nakshdeep Singh, Prabhinder Lall, Basudeb Biswas and Mandeep Singh. ""We demonstrate our techniques by painting and drawing live, talking about the process of creation, involving the students of different age groups in conversations about the work, and later, the students also draw, paint and try their hand at sculpture, to get an experiential feel of the process,"" says artist Madan Lal, who recently did a workshop at Government Girls Senior Secondary Smart School, Nakodar.

The artists and Manna, as part of the workshop, provide the participants with a sort of live commentary on the mediums that can be used to create art, the kind of brushes available, the kind of pressure and paint needed to create a certain form, how mixing of colours can be done. The idea, adds sculptor, Basudeb Biswas, is to involve the students and teachers, and for them to respond. ""If the government provides us with funds, we can follow up these activities with serious workshops in places where art is taught. We can get a van, which can be like a moving library, we can travel with our equipment and artists across the state and make this an ongoing process. Art education in the state can be improved at the grassroots by bringing some of the most significant artists to various institutes. These artists can then share their art practices and educate others,"" says Manna."

Two things have certainly happened during the current millennium. The infrastructure (school buildings) has shown remarkable improvement though there is still a long way to go. And, thanks to the mid-day-meal, we have managed to get the child to the school.

However, what is appalling is the poor quality of education that is imparted in most of the government schools. This is evidenced by the fact that the learning outcomes have actually come down during the past decade despite enormous amount of investments. The number of teachers has gone up substantially and the average pupil-teacher ratio comes close to the required levels.

However, this does not solve the problem of quality. To begin with, a large number of teachers are not qualified to teach, yet they are teaching. According to a rough estimate, out of eight million teachers around 1.4 million fall in this category. Politics has seeped into this cadre in the most insidious manner resulting in skewed distribution of teachers in most of the States as the tendency is to hang in and around urban areas.

The Right to Education Act did precious little on this front. In fact, the legislation made the task of delivering quality education complex and difficult. The focus of the Act is primarily on 'inputs' (like infrastructure) rather than 'outcomes'. It has created an adversarial role between 'public' and 'private' schools. The Act mandates under Section 12(1)(c) that even private schools ""shall admit in Class I, to the extent of at least 25 per cent of the strength of that class, children belonging to weaker section and disadvantaged group."" The manner in which reimbursement is to be provided has created a number of problems.

The norms and standards prescribed in the schedule for a school are far removed from ground reality. What is perhaps desirable has been made mandatory. This has resulted in a phenomenal increase in the number of teachers. During 2015-16, there were 39,608 government schools that had less than 10 children but each school was mandated to have minimum of two teachers.

The budget private schools, most of whom are doing a great job in imparting education, are under enormous pressure to meet the prescribed standards or face closure. No attempt was made while enacting this legislation to look at the ground reality.

The consequences have been disastrous. On an average, an amount of around ₹10,000 per child gets spent in government schools. The budget schools do it for much less and impart as good, if not better, education. Unfortunately, the focus so far has primarily been on regulation (legislations are perhaps meant for that) and not on development of the private sector. Consequently, even after eight years of enactment, the country is none the better than what it was.

The RTE Act has done more damage to delivery of education. Section 16 of the Act provides that ""No child admitted in a school shall be held back in any class or expelled from school till completion of elementary education.""

The 'expulsion' part can be understood but not holding back a child in a class has meant that a large number of children are getting promoted without acquiring the necessary attributes. The model of 'no detention' was apparently picked up from the West and transplanted in this country without taking into account the objective conditions obtaining here.

Yet again, the consequences have been devastating as there is a huge bottleneck getting created at Class X where the pass percentage has plummeted. The States were not even given freedom to take a call on the issue. The government has subsequently decided to provide an option to the States and the amendment is under consideration of Parliament.

A new Education Policy is round the corner. However, what needs to be understood is whether there is a need for a policy to address the issues that afflict school education. Most of the action relating to education lies in the States. In any case, the country is too diverse to consider a single mandate by way of policy for the entire country. If a teacher does not go to a school in Kerala, he could well be ""lynched"" but in some of the States of northern India, they consider it their right not to go to the school. There are instances of these regular teachers employing a ""substitute"" to represent them and even teach on their behalf.

What is actually required is an action plan clearly outlining: What needs to be done? How it will be done? Who will do it? And, by when it will be done? The roles of respective entities should be clearly defined so that the performance can be assessed. One has often wondered why should only the Centre assess the performance of States? Why can't it be the other way round?

The action plan needs to focus on the teacher who plays a pivotal role in imparting education. The entire value chain needs to be looked at, understood and interventions clearly outlined. Beginning with pre-service training, to selection process, to in-service training, to transfer and posting, to engagement of teachers in non-educational activities, to their promotional avenues and morale will need to be looked at.

An action plan for each State will have to be worked out in detail, clearly outlining the roles of the Centre and the respective State government. Intervention for each State will vary from State to State. Unlike the present dispensation, there will have to be sufficient flexibility in the central schemes to accommodate the differences among States. The whole approach has to be outcome based rather than input based as has been the case so far.

Our country has been obsessed with the western world. We had looked at Finland, England, Scotland, Holland and all the lands of the world but not at motherland. A lot of wonderful work is being done within the country but has so far gone unnoticed. ""Policy"" cannot help in this regard.

What needs to be done is to facilitate identification, understanding and scaling of successful practices. If these home-grown practices have succeeded in the prevalent objective conditions, the chances of their replication and scaling are pretty high as compared to an 'imported' idea or practice.

What is also required is to learn from States, like Rajasthan, that have turned it around through some remarkable State level interventions both administrative and financial.

Policy debates provide food for intellectual stimulation but what matters is what is done on the ground. Hence, the dire need for an action plan."

The Karnataka legislative assembly was adjourned ""sine die"" Friday amid pandemonium as BJP members continued with their protest from the Well, seeking clarity from the government on the farm loan waiver scheme.

BJP members also demanded that Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy apologise to Leader of Opposition B S Yeddyurappa for his comments against the former chief minister during the debate.

As the House met for the day, BJP members squatted in the well of the House, shouting slogans such as ""down down to the anti-farmer government"", ""loan waiver should be implemented"".

However, amidst the din, the assembly passed three bills, following which Speaker Ramesh Kumar adjourned the House sine die.

The bills that were passed on Friday include, The Karnataka Legislature (Prevention of Disqualification) (Amendment) Bill, 2018, aimed at making provision to exempt the post of political secretary to the chief minister from incurring disqualification for being a member of the assembly or council, when he is appointed to the post.

Also passed was the Karnataka Civil Service (Procedure for Selection of Candidates during Recruitment) Bill, 2018, that provides for restoring a rule, wherein candidates belonging to reserved category securing high marks in KPSC exams would find themselves in the general merit list besides enjoying reservation benefits they are entitled to.

It was aimed at circumventing a High Court order that quashed the rule.

The BJP has been protesting from the Well since Wednesday evening seeking clarity from Kumaraswamy on loan waiver and the exact day by which debt-free certificates would be issued to the farmers.

They also wanted him to apologise to Yeddyurappa for accusing him of ""colluding"" with nationalised banks, who are now non-committal on their earlier one-time settlement offer to NPA accounts.

Kumaraswamy on Thursday had said he would not apologise as demanded by the BJP.

After the session, Speaker Ramesh Kumar told reporters that extra care was given to certain issues with respect to facilities provided to officials and public representatives during their stay in Belagavi.

He said, ""We are not happy about huge money that was spent last time, so we tried curtailing on it while not compromising on quality.""

""Compared to last year, we have been able to reduce the spending by about Rs 8 crore-10 crore this time.... last year according to information that I have, it had gone up to Rs 20 crore-22 crore,"" he said.

The speaker said he was ""pained"", as special discussion on issues relating to North Karnataka region, on transporting of sand, among other important things,could not be discussed due to ruckus, and had ""personal regret"" for it.

He also noted that attendance of MLAs during the session has ""by far improved"" this time.

Belagavi in north Karnataka, bordering Mahrarashtra has been hosting legislature session once a year since 2006 when the move was initiated by the JD(S)-BJP coalition government, with Kumaraswamy as its chief Minister.

Government schools have to resort to buying water from tankers when the borewells fail or there is a problem with electricity to pump the water up. Cooking mid-day meals, water for washing the dishes, for the small garden which they sometimes have and above all water for using the toilets becomes a challenge in the absence of a reliable source.

One way of addressing the problem and providing supplemental water for schools is to build a rainwater harvesting system which collects rooftop rainwater in underground sump tanks. Thanks to funding from WIPRO Cares and some good work by Manjunath, a self-trained plumber, 10 schools now have rooftop rainwater harvesting systems. The school heads and teachers met recently to discuss how the system was working, the challenges encountered in maintaining them and what lessons were learnt from the experience. The Block Education Officer turned up, which was a pleasant surprise to the teachers assembled. She exhorted them to continue the good work, maintain the systems and to strike partnerships with companies for CSR funds and NGOs for implementation of water and sanitation especially since the region was dry and water tables were falling.

Apart from the water supplement that it brings, rainwater harvesting teaches many lessons for the children. For example, with the help of a small rain gauge they learn how much it rains in their school area. Even a rainfall of 500 mm over a 200 square metre roof area means 100,000 litres of rainwater to collect and harvest, a figure that usually surprises them.

With small experimental testing kits and guidance, they check the quality of rainwater for its pH, its bacterial content and its chemical content. They learn how rainwater filters work and how sump tanks need to be maintained for cleanliness. The usage of water for drinking and for cooking, for the toilet and for washing dishes is calculated and they learn the demand put on water. They learn to notice where the used water goes and whether it is treated or left untreated.

Children also become aware about aquifers, groundwater, its quality and its challenge in terms of fluoride, nitrates and other contaminants that are becoming common. They learn to test and identify good groundwater sources in their villages and towns.

It requires sustained hand holding and an interested and committed group to make this possible. Funds from companies and other donors is of great value. Working with teachers and the school management council is a skill that takes time and patience to acquire.

Above all, it takes a local committed plumber like Manjunath to be in constant touch with schools, repair pipes, clean filters and generally counsel and assist the school in taking care of its water and sanitation systems.

In the great endeavour of a clean India and in line with the Sustainable Development Goals, especially Goal 6- Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, it is necessary for a society and a nation to invest in schools and the schoolchildren to help them become water literate and be wise stewards of water in the future.

In this lies water wisdom and in this we must not fail."

The claim comes at a time when efforts of the opposition parties to form a grand alliance in the state are at nascent stage and the seat is being eyed both by the Congress and the JMM.

Ever since Jagannathpur MLA Gita Koda, wife for former chief minister Madhu Koda, joined the Congress in November, there has been speculation that the party wants to field its candidate from Singhbhum.

Soren was in Chaibasa on Thursday to welcome new members in the party. He gave membership receipt to former Chakradharpur MLA Sukhram Oraon along with his wife Navmi Oraon and around 100 new members.

During the visit, Soren said his represented five out of six assembly seats in Singhbhum parliamentary segment and so was a claimant for it.

""The party has a natural entitlement over the seat for upcoming parliamentary elections. JMM legislators represent Chaibasa, Chakradharpur, Manoharpur, Manjhgaon and Seraikela assembly seats under Singhbhum. In seat sharing by Mahagathbandhan parties, JMM would demand the seat, but the party was ready for any sacrifice to root out the BJP in the upcoming elections,"" Soren said.

""JMM is ready to give maximum number of seats to Congress to let the Mahagathbandhan come in power at Centre. Babulal Marandi's Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JMM) will help in giving tough fight to the BJP in Jharkhand. Face of the alliance for assembly elections in Jharkhand is not a big issue. Non-BJP parties are intact to remove the Raghubar Das government and best decisions will be taken in due course of time including the face of the alliance,"" the former CM said.

Soren said that an outsider (referring to Chhattisgarh roots of chief minister Raghubar Das), who had come to Jharkhand for earning, became a Raja (ruler). ""He has been torturing the original inhabitants of the state with the lathi he brought while coming from Chhattisgarh,"" Soren said.

The JMM leader said that under Das' 'dictatorship', innocent para-teachers were being killed. All sections of the society in Jharkhand are suffering due to anti public policies, he said.

Former MLA from Chakradharpur and BJP leader Sukhram Oraon along with his wife Navmi Oraon and supporters returned to the JMM at the party meeting. He had joined BJP before 2014 assembly elections and left it later, while accusing Singhbhum MP Laxman Gilua of dictatorship.

After merger of 4,600 primary schools, the Jharkhand government is planning to shut over 6,466 middle schools (classes 6 to 8), having less than 100 students.

These schools would be merged with upgraded high schools in phases, starting with the institutions, which have less than 50 students, education department officials said on Thursday.

Initially, 3,732 middle schools having less than 50 students would be undertaken for merger. The process of merging has already been started.

""Merger is an effort to provide quality education to students in a better educational ambience. Jharkhand has around 411 such middle schools where number of students is less than 10. If these schools are merged with high schools, students would get better education,"" said state education secretary AP Singh.

""As per the rules in the right to education (RTE), there should be at least three trained graduate teacher (TGT) in middle schools where number of students is less than 100. It means, we would have to afford additional Rs 18 lakh on teachers' salary even in the schools where number of students is less than 10, which is not logical,"" he added.

The decision comes at a time when the opposition parties and critics have been criticising the state government for merging the primary schools. Several ruling party elected representatives have also been lobbying with the government against the move. There have been protests in several parts of the state as well, against merger of schools.

The officials, however, argue that, ideally, there should be one middle school and five to seven primary schools in a panchayat. As many as 6,466 middle schools have been identified in Jharkhand, which could be merged with high schools within a 5-km radius in a panchayat, Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) officials said.

The state government has decided to offer bicycles to the students, who would be shifted to other schools so that they do not face any trouble in commuting to the school.

Meanwhile, the JEPC officials said they have completed the merging exercise of 4,600 primary schools.

JEPC director Uma Shankar Singh said there were 39,600 schools in 2016-17 under education department in Jharkhand. ""Of them, 18,000 schools had 60 or few students. These schools had an average of 1 or two teachers per school. Providing quality education was a major challenge. One teacher was handling four to five classes at a time. How could one expect a better education in these schools,"" he said.

The council said four-step process including field inspection, cross-district verification, block and district consultation and final notification to merge the schools.

Singh said 98% students from the 4,600 primary schools have been shifted and 96% students have expressed satisfaction with the consolidation. ""We faced difficulty to shift 150 students due to some technical reasons. Now, the issue is resolved and 120 students were shifted,"" he said.

The reorganisation of primary schools benefited seven lakh students with better teachers' availability and reduced the requirements of teachers by 4,500. Besides, the process saved government's Rs 400 crore through reduced teachers and infrastructure requirements, JEPC officials said.

Education Dept ropes in IIM Ranchi for merged school evaluation

State education secretary AP Singh said the department has roped in Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ranchi, for evaluation of the merged schools. The IIM, Ranchi would see if the reorganization process brought any difference in improving the education of students, who were shifted in merging process.

He said IIM Bangalore has also expressed willingness for a study of the reorganization process and its benefit."

Thereafter I'll write a TOI blog post on this topic.

Who are these economists?

Thirteen senior economists, including former Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan, IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath and Sajjid Chinoy of JP Morgan. Others are: Abhijit Banerjee, Pranjul Bhandari, Maitreesh Ghatak, Amartya Lahiri, Neelkanth Mishra, Prachi Mishra, Karthik Muralidharan, Rohini Pande, Eswar Prasad and E. Somanathan.

Unfortunately, I've not heard of any of these economists apart from Raghuram Rajan and read none of them before. I read only the world's best economists (with Hayek and Friedman being my benchmark), and no Indian economist comes in that category. And given what these economists have produced in this report, I will not be reading their work anyway.

In this report, they're OK on labour reforms, ordinary on most issues and pretty hopeless on agriculture, education and healthcare. Most importantly, they have totally missed governance reforms although they repeatedly point out the massive failure of government in every field. A major blind spot these economists need to fix.

The Imperative for Strong, Equitable, and Sustainable Growth

India is one of the fastest growing large countries in the world, having grown at an average of almost 7 percent for the last 25 years. There have been many notable reforms over this period - most recently, the co-operative fiscal federalism that has brought the Goods and Services Tax into being, the enactment of the Indian Bankruptcy Code, and the dramatic dis-inflation of recent years, partly as a result of a move to an inflation targeting regime.

While commendable, we should not be satisfied with this. India is still one of the poorest countries in the G-20, and poor countries ought to grow faster because catch-up growth is easier. As important, the benefits of growth in India have been distributed extremely unequally, with top incomes rising much faster than the rest. [Sanjeev: The real issue remains extreme poverty] We have seen new environmental challenges, in the form of sharp increases in both local pollution levels and in CO2 emissions [Sanjeev: CO2 emissions are GOOD, not bad] that, if unchecked, threaten to stall or reverse progress. India is also not creating enough jobs: even though data on employment in India are both low quality and controversial, the recent news that 28 million applied for 90,000 low level railway jobs suggests we are not satisfying the demand for jobs.1 Unfortunately, we are not well-positioned to follow the export-led growth path that allowed many Asian countries to climb out of poverty. Despite abundant cheap labor, we are not part of many global supply chains. Even as global firms seek to diversify away from China so as to reduce political risk, India is rarely seen as an obvious alternative. [That's because socialism has messed up everything in India]

Given India's continental size, it need not follow the export-led path. It will, however, have to ensure that growth generates jobs and incomes across the skill spectrum, in the process

There are tremendous possibilities for reforms that will take us towards faster and more equitable growth, as this report will lay out. However, we have to allocate scarce resources carefully to make sure that there is enough investment in sectors such as infrastructure to create jobs. India's aggregate fiscal deficit (state plus center) is still close to 6.5 percent of GDP, higher than almost any in the G-20, and not significantly lower than levels that existed five years ago. However, our investment rate has fallen sharply in recent years. Despite that, our external financing requirement (as measured by the current account deficit) increased appreciably earlier this year, increasing vulnerability. Moreover, to the extent that India grows while being more reliant on domestic demand than were other Asian emerging markets, it needs a much greater focus on macroeconomic stability than they did. For all these reasons, it needs to prioritize government spending better, focusing on filling clear investment gaps and protecting the vulnerable. It also needs to increase revenues by making the tax system more progressive both in taxes levied as well as through more effective collection from rich non-payers, by bringing more people into the tax net, and by charging users for government services where appropriate.

A key factor in spurring growth will be reforms that alleviate ""supply side"" constraints on growth and job creation. We have to enable both the industrial sector as well as the service sector to operate at larger scale. This involves embracing highly overdue labor reforms including allowing for a rich menu of contracts with workers that allow for more possibilities than just permanent workers and short term contractual labor in firms [Agree]. Such additional contracting possibilities could give workers more job security, give firms the incentive to train and invest in their skilling, even while giving firms more reason to scale up. Similarly, cleaner title to land, as well as a land acquisition process that protects the seller while simplifying acquisition, will reduce the cost of developing land, a critical need if we are to create jobs [Agree, but these economists should ask why Indian governance system can't perform this most basic function]. A more predictable and better regulatory environment - which prunes redundant or unnecessary regulation, carefully sets regulations in new areas necessitated by our development, and enforces regulations effectively and impartially - will create a much better environment for business. We must also improve the capabilities as well as strengthen the independence of our regulatory institutions. [Agree, but why is India's governance in such a mess even today?]

Scale is also key for productivity growth which, in turn, is essential for India to expand its share of world exports. The ongoing reorientation of the United States away from dependence on China provides India with a great opportunity to position itself as a viable alternative for cheap sourcing of goods and parts. But this would require macro and industrial policy reforms of the kind just outlined that remove existing impediments to India becoming a valued partner in global supply chains. Rolling back the recent increases in import tariffs along with a renewed commitment to resisting protective policies would be a good way of signaling this goal. [Agree]

In outlining an economic agenda, we have to recognize government capacity is limited - the number of government employees is often low relative to the tasks they are assigned [Sanjeev: TOTALLY DISAGREE here. The issue is SHEER AND TOTAL INCOMPETENCE AND CORRUPTION]. This is often compounded by low staff motivation and relatedly high absenteeism, as well as inadequate training. Government takes on too much, while delivering too little. Yet for growth to be equitable, a must in our democracy, effective and well-targeted government engagement is essential. [Why are these economists not talking about governance reforms?]

One partial solution is more decentralization, with more powers and funding delegated to the states, and perhaps more importantly, within the states to municipalities and panchayats. It will allow for a much more dynamic decision-making process, resulting in government policies that are more sensitive to local conditions, as well as more local democratic control of officialdom. [This is fine in principle but totally fails to account for the fact that the SAME bureaucracy and political incentives will lead to the SAME outcome.]

The strategic use of technology has the potential to help here as long as we are careful not to make a fetish of technology, are mindful of the human dimension of transactions, and deploy technology with enough safeguards. Technology can make it easier to monitor flows of funds and uses of funding locally, allowing for more devolution of funding, something that has been proposed by previous Finance Commissions. More generally, effective use of technology can also help substitute for government manpower, increase the points of access to government services, help monitor service provision, and reduce leakage in the system.

The debate on whether the public sector should occupy areas that can be done by the private sector will no doubt continue, and there is an obvious case for exiting areas where the public sector contributes little while draining the exchequer and distorting competition. [Sanjeev: Why is government involved in ANY business at all? And this is not a specific recommendation: a motherhood statement] The government should also reconsider its interventions in areas where it adds noise and uncertainty - for instance, the constant fiddling with agricultural import tariffs, the unpredictable closures or opening of export and import windows, and the inability to procure agricultural commodities or release them effectively, does significantly more damage than good to agriculture. While actions are taken in the name of the farmer or the consumer, it is the middleman who often benefits. [Sanjeev: there's nothing wrong with the middleman benefiting in a competitive and open market. But the market is not open. This recommendation fails to recognise the huge blockages on agriculture sector trade.]

Moreover, even when the consumer benefits from high farm production and low agricultural prices, which also help contain inflation, the cost to the farmers can be significant. The case of pulses is revealing. In 2016-17 for example, India witnessed its highest ever domestic production - close to 23 million metric tonnes -- likely reflecting a combination of a normal monsoon after successive droughts and the farmer response to higher market prices and MSPs. This was sufficient to fully satisfy domestic demand. Despite that, India imported a hefty 6.6 million tonnes of pulses (almost a third of total domestic production) at zero import duty - leading to a massive domestic supply glut, and a sharp and sustained fall in pulse prices over the next two years which continues to this day, with prices currently 30% lower than their 2016 peaks.

In addition to getting the government out of areas it should not be in, there is an equally urgent task of strengthening the government in areas it does poorly or is virtually absent in - for instance, regulating and certifying educational or medical service providers, apprehending and successfully prosecuting economic offenders [What about non-economic??!!], or regulating haphazard development and environmental despoliation without blocking growth. [When even murderers like Modi can remain on the loose, then what hope of justice? This was the opportunity to talk about governance reforms.]

For growth to be equitable and sustained, we have to reform our education, skilling, healthcare, and welfare systems significantly. Our record on primary education is dismal, with only about half of the children in class five able to do math or reading at the second-grade level. Parents have responded by increasingly migrating to private schooling, but private schools are only slightly better than government schools, and in their current form will not solve the problem of low education quality. [This is a TERRIBLE comment to make - to downplay private enterprise, the only thing that is working in India for the POOR] It does not get better at higher grades -- our PISA scores were so low that we refused to participate again in that international benchmarking exercise. The poor quality of human capital may already be constraining growth (industry is increasingly concerned about the large and growing skill deficit), limits its inclusiveness and prompt a premature move to replace workers with machines.

Healthcare is another area of major concern. In particular, the public system has largely been abandoned by the patients seeking regular primary care. They prefer paying for private treatment even though many practitioners are unqualified and prescribe the wrong treatment in more than 70% of the cases. This is partly a consequence of the failure of the public sector -- public sector practitioners are often absent, and when present they put very little effort into treatment. It is unclear how the recent Ayushman Bharat insurance scheme, which is the main current effort to deal with healthcare issues, will address this issue. [Sanjeev: with the BLATANT failure of government staring in the face, where is the talk about governance reforms?]

This is especially a problem because dealing with the large growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and the many, only partly-solved, child and maternal health issues, relies heavily on getting frontline providers to lead the charge. Similar concerns apply in the education sector. A failure to ensure high-quality education and health care provision means that a substantial proportion of our future labor force will grow up underequipped with skills needed in the labor market and suffering from the long term consequences of stunting and wasting. Much of the middle-aged population will be dealing with debilitating diseases that could have been prevented or controlled. This obviously limits the sustainability and the inclusiveness of growth.

The environment is, of course, a critical challenge to the continuation of our growth and to the extent to which growth translates into improved quality of life. Many of our cities are increasingly experiencing levels of pollution that border on the toxic. If we cannot manage the environment at our present level of development, greater growth will make matters far worse. [Sanjeev: once again, this points to severe government failure - but no mention of the need for governance reforms] The consequences of environmentally myopic policies are reflected, for example, in the rapidly falling water table in many parts of the country, which threatens the sustainability of our agriculture. Relatedly, climate change is already having very significant effects on productivity and the quality of lives in India and we need to be at the forefront of global efforts to combat it. [Sanjeev: this claim is, of course, CRAP]

That our current policies do not add up to an inclusive and sustainable growth agenda is reflected in growing agitation across our society. Agrarian unrest, and the constant demand for loan waivers, is now compounded by demands for some form of government support from sections of society that are nowhere near the poorest. This reflects Indians' growing anxiety about their future and that of their children in an increasingly winner-take-all society, where they often end up on the losing side. Our welfare schemes like the MGNREGA and Pradhan Mantri Gramin Awas Yojana are mostly directed towards the very poor (the one exception being the public distribution system), so they do not serve the purpose of protecting those outside that group. Without stronger, sustainable, and inclusive growth we simply do not have the resources to expand our welfare schemes significantly, [Sanjeev: BUT WHY SHOULD WELFARE BE EXPANDED?] but if we do generate that growth, not only will there be less demand for welfare but there will be more resources to service any demand.

The bottom line is that while we have performed creditably in the last 25 years across different administrations, we cannot be complacent about our economic challenges. They are mounting. We are a group of economists, each with different specializations and interests, who have come together to offer proposals for the way ahead. Some of us are based in India, some outside, but we are all closely engaged in, and concerned about, India's development. We do not belong to any party, nor are we from the government. We hope this non-partisan analysis of our situation, while not intended to be comprehensive, will help spur debate as India moves to elections. The rest of this note summarizes our proposals, and offers our consensus view on some of the key issues we face. We then append individual notes by members of the group, which offers more details of individual views and proposals. Each note reflects the view of the author(s) in their personal capacity, and does not necessarily represent the institution they are affiliated with.

Macroeconomic stability: a prerequisite to sustainable growth and job creation

India's economic history is replete with the same lesson: preserving and protecting macroeconomic stability is an essential prerequisite to strong and sustained growth. Every time macro stability has been traded off to boost growth, the economy has been pushed towards a crisis, the consequences of which have undermined the very growth that was the initial policy focus.

Ensuring macroeconomic stability has at least three elements to it: maintaining low and stable inflation, ensuring the consolidated fiscal deficit leaves enough space for private investment, and ensuring that the current account deficit is sustainable and can be financed largely through stable capital inflows, to help insulate the economy from sudden swings in global sentiment. High and variable inflation constitutes a regressive tax, with the poor bearing the biggest brunt, since their incomes are typically least indexed to inflation. It also dissuades foreign investors from investing in rupee assets. Similarly, large and unsustainable fiscal/external imbalances impart significant macroeconomic and financial market uncertainty, push up borrowing costs and risk premia in the economy and threaten financial stability. All this impedes private and public investment.

Fiscal consolidation to creating space for more investment

The economy has made significant progress in combating inflation in recent years. Over the last 4 years inflation has averaged just over 4% versus almost 10% in the previous five years, and household inflation expectations are getting progressively anchored. The same, however, cannot be said of the fiscal side.

While the center's fiscal deficit has been steadily brought down, the combined deficit of the states - even after adjusting for UDAY - has continued to widen in recent years and, thereby, largely undone the center's consolidation. Consequently, the consolidated fiscal deficit in 2017-18, stood above 6.5%, not very different from its levels five years ago. Our primary suggestions to make progress on this difficult issue:

De-risking the external sector

India's heavy dependence on oil imports often results in ""boom-bust"" cycles on the balance of payments when crude prices change. For example, the CAD narrowed to 0.7% of GDP in 2016-17 as crude prices fell and was then tracking close to 3% of GDP in 2018 when crude prices bounced back up. This resulted in a large balance of payments surplus in the first instance and a large deficit in the second. These sharp swings complicate monetary policy, as well as exchange rate and liquidity management, and create undue external and fiscal volatility (since oil prices also alter the fiscal math). We should:

Fixing the Stressed Sectors

Careful but quick policy reforms are needed for the sectors/areas that are stressed. These include agriculture, infrastructure (including power), exports and banking. There are common themes in any revival. Typically, we need to redeploy government effort in each of these sectors, focusing it on areas where it is truly needed to play an enabling role, while freeing the sector of excessive bureaucracy and intervention, which results in inadequate access to markets, distorted prices, and poor incentives. While the recent focus on improving India's ranking on the World Bank's Doing Business measures is commendable, we should guard against the temptation to focus on the specifics of the World Bank measures, while neglecting the broader impediments to producing in India. [Agreed] We now consider each of these sectors in more detail.

Agriculture & the rural economy

We need deep rooted transformation of agriculture, treating it not as a sector that has to be propped up through repeated sops, but as an engine of India's job creation and growth. For that, it is imperative that we thoroughly reform agricultural and land policies. In particular, a key source of agrarian distress in recent years has been that the terms-of-trade confronting farmers has turned progressively more adverse, partly as a result of policies to combat food inflation. While low inflation is desirable in itself, the impact on farmers also needs to be taken into account. A policy priority should be to reduce distortions in farm product prices as well as input prices. Another important enabler is technology, both in educating and informing farmers, as well as in opening access to markets. Some specific proposals include

Infrastructure

Accelerating the pace of the infrastructure build-out will help in a number of ways; it will create jobs in construction and new economic activity around the resulting roads, ports, airports, railways, and housing; it will promote inclusion as it connects interior rural areas to markets; it will make our exports (and import-competing manufacturing) more competitive as it reduces input costs such as land (as cheaper areas are connected) and power, as well as improves logistics and reduces transportation costs; it will open up India to both domestic and foreign tourism, which can be a tremendous source of semi- skilled jobs. This will require

Power

Despite having some of the largest reserves of coal, as well as having substantial unutilized power generation capacity, India is both short of coal as well as short of power. These are policy self-goals, arising from both the dominant presence of government in coal mining and power distribution as well as populist impulses in pricing. Nevertheless, our low base allows us to choose a path that is both more energy efficient as well as less polluting as we reform the system for the twenty first century. For this we need:

Exports

India's non-oil, non-gold current account has deteriorated by almost 3% of GDP in the last three years, suggesting an urgent need to improve the underlying competitiveness of the tradable sector. Boosting exports should be the lynchpin of that strategy. [Sanjeev: Any economist who says this is simply not a good economist. Refer to Kautilya, and the best economists who agree that IMPORTS are the key. Let consumption be the focus of economists, and exports are a minor subset of this production process.] The existing constraints in the export sector appear to be reflective of more general problems in manufacturing: low scale of production, low productivity, bureaucratic impediments, high cost of inputs like land and power. We have suggested ways to address these earlier. In addition,

Financial Sector

Given the non-performing asset (NPA) build up in the banking system, it is imperative we make the banking system more robust and well capitalized [Sanjeev: HOW? By taxpayer subsidy??], expand its capacity to extend credit, and improve incentives to lend to the most productive sectors. While the recent travails of the NBFCs are a matter of concern, some of their problems stem from an overly rapid expansion of their balance sheets as they grew to substitute for banks. Stability in the banking system will help spread stability to other parts of the financial system as, of course, will the reverse.

The main challenges for the banking sector are to improve governance, transparency, and incentives in the banking system. Key measures should include

The non-bank financial sector needs a strong banking system as well as deep equity and bond markets, supported by liquid secondary markets and a robust regulatory and legal infrastructure. Key priorities include:

Making growth inclusive and sustainable

A good job is often the most important form of inclusion. In addition, we need to help individuals obtain the human capabilities that will enable them to secure and hold that job, as well as protect those who cannot get jobs. Let us now turn to proposals on inclusion.

Education

The single greatest limitation of the Indian education system is its inability to deliver universal functional literacy and numeracy in primary school. Several studies show that students who fail to achieve basic skills by the end of class 3 learn very little in subsequent years even if they are enrolled in school. Our top education policy priority is therefore:

The Right to Education (RTE) Bill's input-based approach to education quality was unlikely to succeed given the extensive evidence that most school inputs are neither necessary nor sufficient for improving learning outcomes. RTE has led to an unnecessary and disruptive closure of several low-cost private schools that parents were choosing of their own accord. In many cases, even government schools are in violation of these input-based norms. We therefore recommend:

While improvement in schooling is a key building block to education, we cannot neglect either vocational training/skilling or college education. Both will be critical to providing our youth with the wherewithal for the jobs of the future. High quality research universities will be essential, both to train the teachers for our colleges as well as to fuel the innovation needed for the next stage of our growth. [Sanjeev: GET THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF THESE]

Dealing with the skills shortage

There is wide recognition that the current models of publicly subsidized skilling are not performing very well even though skills are extremely scarce. What seems to work better is the skilling provided by private firms that are training their own labor force. However, under current laws, firms can employ workers for up to one year after which they either have to fire them or make them permanent. Since there are significant costs and inflexibilities in making workers permanent, many firms keep workers on short contracts and terminate them before they can become permanent. This state of affairs serves neither the firm, which has to hire new workers frequently and has no incentive to train them, nor the worker, who has no security of employment, and who is not trained. At the same time, since the government is often the only employer that offers secure jobs, young people spend their twenties applying for these jobs rather than working. However, these jobs are extremely expensive thanks partly to the munificence of the Pay Commissions and therefore there are too few of them. As a result, a cynic could argue that the government and the private sector lack manpower, while young people sit at home filling applications and preparing for tests. We propose that:

Women's labor force participation

There are clearly both supply-side issues-families not allowing women to work, women feeling disempowered -- and demand-side issues -- lack of women-friendly jobs in the private sector as well as discrimination. Some useful first steps here:

Healthcare

There is much to be done to reform the healthcare system in India. Increasingly, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer play a much bigger role, so healthcare needs to be reoriented to address these.

Environment

Even while business complains about the difficulty of getting environmental approvals, the quality of our environment leaves much to be desired and with climate change looming we should be thinking in terms of reaching peak emissions within the next decade or so and then sharply reducing them. For all of this we need to get more professional about the environment and climate change, as well as more transparent about the regulatory process.

Social Protection

India has more than 400 separate social protection schemes. A vast majority of them are funded at very low levels and do very little. However, they absorb some amount of bureaucratic capacity. And despite the wide variety of schemes available on paper, as the many protests make clear, people do not feel protected. In particular while MGNREGA provides some support for the rural landless, most other relatively poor people have only the PDS to fall back on. This is one reason that it is so difficult to remove any government scheme, however inefficient. There is a clear need to create a reliable pipeline for providing compensation for losers, as we move towards a more rational system of social protection. The Direct Benefits Transfer is a good starting point and building on it by being credible in compensating losers will be key. Specifically we suggest"

In the long run, Teach For India will build a powerful and ever-growing leadership force of alumni who will work from inside and outside the educational system to effect the fundamental, long-term changes necessary to ultimately realize educational opportunity for all.

The event took place in an upscale hotel in the city where the children slowly gathered in numbers to meet in person the legends. The children accompanied by the TFI Fellow and a parent gathered in a boardroom-style conference room, adding an extra zing to the proceedings as they looked like mini-CEOs taking turns to pick the brains of the Manchester United legends.

The focus of the session was on the importance of sports in the holistic development of a child. While everyone agreed about the role that education plays in a child's upbringing, it was proven beyond a doubt that sport confers a unique set of skills that books cannot provide.

The two guests were perfect for the occasion. Englishman Wes Brown joined the Manchester United academy at the tender age of 12, and went on to spend 2 decades at the club, which provided him an education, and eventually, a flourishing livelihood. Dwight Yorke, from Trinidad and Tobago, was one of the most successful strikers in his era, and had fascinating insight about how perseverance can make all the difference in becoming successful.

The students, certainly not shy, articulated their questions very well and were bursting with enthusiasm when the legends walked into the room.

While the children might not have seen the players play live at their peaks, they were certainly made aware of the greatness that surrounded them and spoke to the legends with utmost respect and admiration.

The first few questions focused on the upbringing of the players, how they performed in school, the importance of coaches and mentors in their growth, and the people who inspired the players as role models.

The mood in the room was certainly lifted when one student stood up and asked the players whether they preferred Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo! This was not a question the legends were expecting, and they were thrilled to find out the level of knowledge the children had at such a young age.

This question seemed to spur them on, as they got more personal with the questions. The session ended with one child even asking the legends who the better player between them was, amidst a chorus of laughter.

At the end of the day, everyone left the room with smiles on their faces, whether it was the students, who by the end of the session were acting like seasoned journalists, the players, who were having a lot of fun, or the parents, who saw their children in a new light.

From walking in with excitement to leaving with dreams in their eyes, the students had a day to remember. Most, if not all, of them, have now become Manchester United fans for life."

After 15 years of repression, misrule and loot of Chhattisgarh's natural resources, the defeat of Raman Singh's BJP government offers a historic opportunity for the state. In voting so decisively for the Congress, the people have not just unseated an incumbent, but signalled the kind of change they want.

Some of these aspirations are presaged in the Congress's manifesto, prepared, we are told, after extensive consultations with different sections of society.Apart from the farm loan waiver, increased minimum support prices and unemployment allowance, an emphasis on quality healthcare and education seem to be priorities for people, and the Congress would be wise to treat these as its priorities too.

But where the Congress has the chance to be really transformative is in how it addresses the Naxalite conflict. This is Rahul Gandhi's litmus test to show if he and his party care about India's adivasis.

If the Congress initiates talks with the Maoists, as they say in point 22 of their manifesto, they will have the full support of the people of Bastar. Far from ""teaching Congress a lesson for supporting urban Maoists"", as Modi repeatedly said on the campaign trail, the people of the region have given the Congress 11 out of 12 seats. There are indications in this win - for instance, the fact that they allowed Congress candidates to campaign in interior villages - that the Maoists too are ready for some kind of talks. They would be colossally foolish to give up an opportunity for a negotiated peace.

But equally important, a foundation must be built for such talks to succeed, and this can only be built on the basis of justice. 'Development' is no substitute for justice; both are rights but in different spheres and cannot be traded off against each other.

It is perhaps divine providence that the Delhi high court judgment on Sajjan Kumar came on the same day as the swearing in of the new Congress governments. Even though the party failed the test of justice in Madhya Pradesh by appointing Kamal Nath as chief minister, it has a chance in Chhattisgarh to redress its own historic wrongs.

Mahendra Karma, the Congress leader who was the local face of the BJP-backed Salwa Judum movement is no longer around to haunt the Congress. But the legacy of entire villages burnt, rape survivors, and children whose parents were brutally killed under the banner of Salwa Judum will continue to dog the footsteps of both the Congress and the BJP.

In a country where violence piles up on violence and every part of the country is torn and bleeding due to its own history of pogroms and massacres, it is easy to forget. Let me therefore quote from just one fact-finding report of December 2007, by Shanta Sinha, then the chairperson of the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights, J.M. Lyngdoh (former CEC) and Venkat Reddy:

The public hearing was held in Charla and was attended by more than 200 IDP: men, women and children. The team heard the testimonies of over 35 people. Every testimony included a narrative of extreme violence committed against them, their families and property, by the Naxalites, Salwa Judum and the security forces. Many people shared accounts of family members being killed and women raped by the Salwa Judum. Having faced repeated acts of violence, harassment, arson and pillage the only option for these people was to run away from their villages and seek refuge in another state....Leaving behind their land and livestock they have arrived in Andhra Pradesh in a state of penury and distress.

The current deputy speaker of the Rajya Sabha, Harivansh, then editor of Prabhat Khabar, was a member of another fact-finding report on Bastar, War in the Heart of India, by the Independent Citizens Initiative, which found armed minor SPOs on the prowl, people forced into camps and complete lawlessness.

There has been no shortage of ground reports, media accounts and testimonies submitted to courts at all levels as well as institutions like the NHRC in the past 13 years which indicate human rights violations on a large scale, including mass gang rapes and the killing of unarmed civilian children. Unlike Delhi 1984 and Gujarat 2002, however, these atrocities have lasted for years over a vast area. As recently as September 2018, on a visit to Konta, I found the security forces were still raiding villages, destroying goods and killing individuals randomly on suspicion of being Maoists. Unlike 1984 and 2002, the violence has also not been one-sided: the only political strategy the Maoists appear to know is 'counter violence', whether against security forces or suspected (civilian) informers.

It is not as if the courts have not responded to these pleas - in its 2011 judgment the Supreme Court, apart from directing that SPOs be disbanded and disarmed, also directed the prosecution of all those guilty of human rights violations and compensation to all those affected. The tragedy, however, is that the government of Chhattisgarh wilfully flouted all these directions. A case for contempt has been pending in the Supreme Court since 2012.

In its manifesto, the Congress has promised to raise the prices of forest produce, to implement the Forest Rights Act 2006 and the Land Acquisition and Rehabilitation Act (LARR) 2013. All of these are extremely important, and can make a difference to people outside the zone of immediate conflict as well as to lives ravaged by violence and illegal mining.

The Congress has also promised to give each 'Naxal affected panchayat' Rs 10 million, However, money to panchayats will not solve the problem - the brute reality is that in the worst ""Maoist affected Panchayats"", it is the Maoists and not the government who decide whether panchayat funds can be spent.

The Maoist complaint is that the money is spent on paper only, through collusion between district officials and sarpanches who live in Salwa Judum camps. They also argue that the excessive inflow of funds corrupts people, and have implemented a model of self-reliance in their areas, where people work on each other's fields and build ponds collectively.

""The people"", however, want panchayat funds so that they can develop their own villages instead of migrating as coolie labour to Andhra, but in these regions also trust the Maoists more than the government to protect their land and their lives. Villagers want schools and they want health facilities. The government has been saying that teachers can't go back to the villages without security, but the people don't see these as connected - for them it is security camps, which are the greatest source of insecurity.

The only basis on which this complicated narrative can be slowly changed is if the government makes justice its first priority. Fortunately, there are many examples around the world where such long running counter-insurgencies have been addressed - like Peru's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, or Guatemala's Commission for Historical Clarification. Closer home, we have already submitted a Rehabilitation Plan to the Supreme Court, which outlines certain procedures. These include a survey of all conflict affected villages in Bastar to map the loss of lives and property; announcement of compensation; fast-track courts to release all those falsely accused in Naxalite cases; and restoration of essential services like schools, anganwadis, public distribution system etc.

For over a decade we have been pleading for an independent monitoring committee or at least a joint committee to oversee this rehabilitative exercise, in which all sides can work together instead of being adversarial.

Unlike its predecessor regime which believed that the way to fight legal battles where the evidence is clearly against you is to imprison your opponents on scurrilously false charges, the new government has a chance to act honourably. It should throw open the state to journalists, researchers, lawyers and activists - who have in the past been threatened, forced out, and vilified, and withdraw all false cases against them. Bastar can no longer be the fiefdom of megalomaniac police officers who threaten to stone human rights activists or run over them in SUVs. To be sure, prosecution of those responsible for human rights violations will be difficult with MLAs like Salwa Judum leader Vikram Mandavi of Bijapur, but not insurmountable.

The Jeeram Ghati incident in which much of the Congress leadership was killed, and in which some Congress quarters suspect BJP complicity, should indeed be investigated. But the government must move beyond justice for the Congress to justice for the people it represents. There is so much work to be done - and so many exciting new beginnings that are possible."

Earlier, K A Sengottaiyan, school education minister, said the department was considering reduction of lessons for Class XI and XII students following representations over the 'voluminous textbooks'.

His statement came soon after the National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) announced that syllabus will be halved for CBSE students next year. A senior school education department official said the committee formed to write the new textbooks would proceed with the original plan to not reduce content.

""We might contemplate over this later, after NCERT's announcement is implemented,"" the official added.

Welcoming this, experts called the earlier proposal to reduce content as a retrograde step.

M Anandakrishnan, former IIT Kanpur chairman, said the new syllabus was framed in a a manner to help students in higher education and competitive exams. ""Reducing it will leave them handicapped,"" he said.

Government school teachers, who oppose the 'voluminous syllabus', said the higher secondary students, who were trained under a simple syllabus till Class X, were struggling to cope up with the vast content.

Responding to this, a curriculum revision committee member said, ""The new textbooks is voluminous by pages and not content. A study to compare the old and new textbooks revealed that there was an increase by only 5-7%, excluding value additions and worked out examples. Better design, layout and trimming repetitions in reference sections will reduce the number of pages also.""

The official added that though CBSE lessons might be reduced, NEET content will remain the same. ""Reducing our textbook content in a rush will only put our students at a comparative disadvantage,"" he added. Responding to this, S Prabhudoss from TN Post Graduate Teachers Association said, ""Present training modsule is effective. But without a blueprint, we are unable to guide the students.""

Educationist Prince Gajendra Babu said, ""Tamil Nadu should not follow NCERT's footsteps as it is not a benchmark. It is fine to revisit and make corrections so that contents are age-appropriate."""

Speaking to The Shillong Times, Education Minister Lahkmen Rymbui said the direction to reduce weight of school bags and other matters as directed by the Ministry of Human Resource Development will be analysed by the government.

Though the minister admitted that it is necessary to reduce the burden of children, he said solid foundation of education should be imparted too.

""The root of education should not be weakened. We have to check the books as well. There is no need to rush as it is for the benefit of students,"" he added.

As the government still contemplates implementing the order, parents keep worrying about their children and the ""unnecessary"" pressure that they have to endure. ""My daughter has seven to eight periods in a day and every subject has a separate notebook. These are besides the separate exercise books for both class-work and home-work. Add to these the books for each subject. She also has to carry tiffin box and water bottle. Interestingly, she is only in Class II. Now can you imagine what we are doing to them,"" said the mother of two on condition of anonymity.

Another parent of a Class VI student was critical of the existing education system. According to him, more books and heavier bags do not make a student scholar.

""It is the way teachers teach in schools that makes a difference. But how many teachers are sincere? I see every student taking tuitions and why? Because what is taught in schools is not enough. And what about their health? My son already complains of backache,"" said the father who refused to give his name lest ""my ward is harassed and that is another issue, you cannot speak the truth"".

Robert Z Street, chairman of St John's Whitehall, sympathises with the children and their parents. ""The number of textbooks should be reduced and the children should instead take home story books. There is no benefit in giving excessive homework. Teaching and understanding should be in the classroom,"" he said.

Some parents feel there should be locker facilities. ""Heavy school bags are the problems for children... I strongly feel that schools should have some kind of arrangements to keep some of the workbooks in the class pigeonholes with locking facility,"" said a father.

Aaron Warjri, the principal of Shillong Government School, while welcoming the directive said children these days are ""overburdened by heavy schoolbags which may harm their bodies at a later age""."

Her score would be below expectations until she began learning from the new 'energized' textbooks, carrying quick response (QR) codes.

""It has improved my performance in exams and I have gained confidence in learning the subject,"" she said.

Supriya isn't the only one. The ease with which students are able to access quality content online has made QR codes a hit. Six months after the textbooks were launched for standard I, VI, IX and XI, there have been more than 2 crore scans and over 1 crore downloads, highest compared to Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan, which have also launched these textbooks.

These 'energized' textbooks (a termed coined by the school education department) provide more information and contextualised content in the form of audio and video films made accessible through the codes placed below every lesson. And to get more information all a student or a teacher needs to do is install the DIKSHA app or any other external QR code scanner app. This will be linked to audio, video content or worksheets at the DIKSHA repository.

""The children no more fear subjects like they used to. The new textbooks have brought about a change in the manner students approach subjects such as chemistry, biology, Tamil and maths. Children like Tamil because there is musical content,"" said R C Saraswati, principal, Government Girls Higher Secondary School, Ashok Nagar.

Officials from the department said at least 4,000 such codes had been placed in textbooks across the state.

""These books are used by more than 36 lakh students across the state. Next year we will be launching them for Classes II,VII, X and XII,"" said Satheesh R.M, state coordinator, DIKSHA and Digital Assessment.

Meanwhile, a few teachers from government and private matriculation schools said codes placed in maths and biology textbooks were not working and that in some other textbooks only two or three lessons were linked. Officials from the department said they are looking into the complaints.

The app would have had more takers had there been more awareness. ""Authorities need to train more teachers as many are not aware of this technology,"" said K Shanmugavelayutham, convener, TN-FORCES.

""There are hardly any teachers there. She often tells me that kids sit clueless as teachers are forced to teach subjects they themselves don't understand well. I wonder if she will remain underprepared for challenges ahead in life, he said.

Singh sums up the crisis in Delhi government schools which have only 35,034 regular teachers against a sanctioned strength of 64,096. A shortage of 29,062 regular hands (45.34 per cent) has left the teachers exhausted and students vulnerable. A total of 15,04,627 students are enrolled in 1,024 schools run by the AAP government.

There are 22,016 guest teachers that take the existing number to 57,050 but they work on daily-wage contracts that must be renewed every year. Even if guest teachers are factored in, Delhi government schools are short of 7,046 (10.99 per cent) teaching hands.

Saroj Sharma, a primary teacher at a Greater Kailash school said, On several occasions, I have had to teach higher-secondary class subjects. We are overworked and stressed. We are filling in for many others. School heads are aware of the crisis, but nothing has been done.

Neeru Loriya, a teacher coordinator at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in RK Puram Sector 4, also said that several subjects are not being taught properly. Barkha Kumari, a Class VI student at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Rohini said, My Class has 50 students. We need more teachers to ensure we're taught well. It's not that the government isn't working at all. After the Aam Aadmi Party came to power in Delhi in 2014, the government has built 48 schools.

But where are the teachers? We have sent several reminders to the government. Nothing has happened, said a teacher at a Pusa Road school. Most regular posts are filled through promotions. But they have not happened since 2013, he said.

Sanjay Goel, head of the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) told Mail Today, We're aware of the problem. Each year, guest teachers are being enrolled to minimise the shortage. Avdhesh Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, also said, There is a problem. But the government is hiring guest teachers to tackle it.

But facts tell a different tale. In July, the Delhi government had announced that schools would get 9,000 guest teachers by mid-August. It did not happen. Hiring guest teachers is anyway no solution to this huge crisis, said Ajay Veer Singh, general secretary of the last Government School Teachers' Association (GSTA) elected in 2014. GSTA elections have not taken place since 2014.

So its demands have not been heard effectively, its office-bearers claim. We have asked for elections. But education department officials have not paid any heed. The future of government school teachers is dark, said Singh. GSTA has a three-year term.

Greg Hallen, programme leader of the Food, Environment, and Health Program at Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC) speaks to Taru Bahl on enabling greater diversity in food consumption, stronger regulatory norms and more in-depth research on solutions to address NCDs:

What are the main concerns around food related diseases?

In 2015 NCDs killed 15 million people in developing countries, nearly 3.8 million more than in 2000. One reason for the spurt is that conditions like obesity have been perceived as problems of wealthy communities and an inevitable result of progress. Solutions are left to the individual and assumed to be a lack of skills or awareness. However, the situation is more complex and more a problem of poverty and powerlessness than is perceived.

In middle and low income countries, lower socioeconomic groups are the most vulnerable, largely due to high treatment costs and the lack of access to care. In the case of food-related NCDs the new challenge globally is obesity, fuelled by poor quality diets high in sugar, salt and trans fats. Long shelf life foods of low nutritional quality are increasingly affordable and accessible everywhere, out-competing our efforts to make nutritious foods more affordable and accessible.

Is it government apathy, lack of awareness, absence of regulation or commercial gains that hinders reform?

Individuals, parents and teachers alone cannot make the difference that's needed. Governments are needed in the response. And research is important to understand what they can do, how and what difference their actions will make to lives and economies. This cannot be addressed by the health sector alone. Health, finance, trade and industry, agriculture, information and broadcasting all need to take ownership and see the benefits of acting.

Public health and well-being should be our main motivator but may not be the driver for all sectors. In the pursuit of this understanding there are gross imbalances of power, voice and influence that need to be understood as we try to get to the truth about the social and economic benefits of making our food environments healthier.

Any good global actions that India can draw from?

Several countries have begun to adopt fiscal policies that aim to drive down the affordability of unhealthy commodities and some seek to increase the affordability of health foods. Mexico imposed a tax on sugary drinks and junk food. Researchers found about a 5% fall in purchases of sugary drinks in the first year and almost 10% decline in the second year. In Chile, government is effectively restricting misleading marketing of food to children, especially with respect to food packaging and labelling. All cartoon characters and child-focussed images have been removed from unhealthy foods, besides having their sale in Chilean schools or in TV ads restricted. It is still early to assess the impact but reports suggest industry is also responding by reformulating its products.

Brazil has a policy that requires 30% of all school food to be acquired from local family farms benefitting not only students with fresh food but also creating an assured market for farmers. Given the complexity of processes and various interests in policy making, it is worth drawing attention sometimes to the incoherence between policies: Some that are deliberately designed to improve food systems and benefit health and well-being and others that are in direct conflict with health goals.

What has been IDRC's role in tackling diet related diseases?

We are supporting research that helps create better understanding of how food environments are changing, how to model the potential impact of policies, regulations and other interventions and evaluate those that do get adopted. Even in case of fiscal policy, nobody really pretends that the attack on sugary drinks can serve as a silver bullet. But it definitely contributes to healthy consumption of products. Industry too responds to these policies since it affects their profitability.

Can you list priority action points that countries like India can adopt?

Embrace a systems approach that aims to make nutritious foods more affordable and available, create incentives for healthy food businesses to be strong and competitive. Seek robust, independently generated evidence on the health and economic impacts. Find ways to make the foods with the least value to health, the least profitable.

Currently, we have things the other way around. Think of the food system from the perspective of the youngest in our communities. What are they exposed to? What opportunities will they have to live healthier lives than their parents' generation? Education, as important as it is, won't enable them change the environment they rely on. Protect them and their families from misleading information and marketing. Recognise that addressing diet-related disease is a multi-sector issue. We cannot rely on the health sector to turn back the tide, nor can health systems bear the expensive burden of diet related diseases."

Already, the Aadhaar biometric attendance system was being used in 9,349 government-run schools in 12 districts across Telangana. Now, the Directorate of School Education decided to extend the system to all government-run schools and sent a proposal to the State government seeking budgetary support for installing the machines.

The department tied up with Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) and Telangana State Technology Services (TSTS) for implementing the Aadhaar biometric attendance. One biometric machine was being provided for every 100 students, with managements being directed to record attendance of teaching and non-teaching staff twice a day -- morning and evening -- and for students, before serving the mid-day meal.

In both schools, students reported to having seen a lizard in the food they were served. What is strange, however, is that the two incidents were reported from two different districts of the state - Bagalkote and Ballary.

In Chikkamagi government higher primary school in Hunagunda taluk in Bagalkote district, one student spotted a lizard in the food that he was served. A few other students are said to have started eating by the time he had alerted his teachers.

Those students who had already eaten were made to throw up the food immediately. A hundred and five students from the school were then taken to the hospital for observation.

""All of them are out of danger. As a precautionary measure they were all brought to the hospital. Out of them, 101 were discharged. The other four would be discharged by Friday,"" Ananth Desai, DHO, Bagalkote, told CNN-News18.

Following the incident, three cooks at the school have been dismissed.

""Until Monday, meals won't be provided at the school. The students will now have that fear. We will speak to the students and parents, take them into confidence and then start providing meals,"" said MR Kamakshi, DDPI, Bagalkote.

In Agaluru, government primary school in Siruguppa taluk in Bellary district, at least 40 students were taken to the hospital after the mid-day meal was suspected to be poisoned.

""There has been allergic reaction in kids after they had the mid-day meal in school. There was lizard in it is what they have said. Some of them had vomited. They could have diarrhoea too. But they are all safe. They have been given intravenous fluids,"" Arun Rangarajan, SP, Ballary, said.

The students were taken to a primary health centre and 19 of them were later taken to a government hospital.

""One hundred and fifty nine students were present in the school at the time. Forty students who had eaten the meal were hospitalised. All of them are safe,"" said A Shridhar, DDPI, Bellary.

The Government High School at Attavara in Hassan taluk gives a tough fight to private schools nearby by securing good results in SSLC, besides organising some unique activities to improve the learning ability of students. Unlike many schools in rural areas, the school registered 100% results in SSLC this year. Of the 29 students who took the exams, 27 secured first-class marks.

""This time our target is 100% results will all first class,"" said K.P. Narayana, headmaster. Last year, we had 98% results and constant efforts by teachers helped improve the results this year. ""There is a notion among the public that rural students do not study hard. We want to prove that wrong. We, teachers, maintain a good rapport with students and their parents and monitor their studies regularly,"" he said. Interestingly, teachers take out their personal time to visit their students late in the evening. Sometimes students are surprised to see their teachers on their doorstep. ""We go to their place and speak to their parents. The exercise helps us develop a contact with the parents and also see if students set aside enough time for studies at home,"" he said.

Recently, the school conducted a rangoli competition for students. It was unique because the students were told to draw the diagrams they study as part of their science syllabus. A student drew an image of the brain, nervous system, and respiratory system using colours provided by the teachers.

After school hours, students of classes 8, 9, and 10 have to take part in group studies. With the help of villagers, the school has got special benches on the campus for evening classes. All 98 students attend the classes, before leaving for home. H.L. Nagaraj, Assistant Commissioner of Hassan sub-division, has taken a special interest in improving basic amenities in the school. He visits the school regularly and motivates teachers and students for improving results.

The school has a rainwater harvesting system. Making use of the available water, students grow vegetables on the campus as part of their co-curricular activities. The vegetables grown are used for midday meals."

The video has gone viral and is being circulated with claims that the teacher working with a school in Congress-JD(S) ruled Karnataka is forcing Hindu kids to read Islamic prayers.

TRUTH

The clip being shared is the one with incomplete information. It is a partial footage from a rehearsal program, where the kids are later taught verses from the Bhagavad Gita and the Bible as well.

The same video had previously gone viral in July this year when several fact-checking websites had debunked the misleading claims made along with it. However, it seemed to have found its way back into social media with fake claims again.

METHODOLOGY

Using Google Chrome extension 'InVid', we were able to extract key-frames and screenshots from the viral video, which were then used to perform reverse-image search on Google.

The results of the above exercise led us to a video posted on Facebook by Shivamogga Live, a regional media outfit of Karnataka, which shows the complete sequence of events.

The footage belongs to Vidyadeepa Vidyalaya, a Kindergarten School in Shimoga (Shivamogga) district of Karnataka.

As per the school authorities, the recitation of verses from three different religious books was a practice session for a programme to be held in the school on Independence day.

""On Environment day the children recited verses from all three religious books. The program was a huge success and the parents were also happy about it. So, the teachers and the group of students were planning and preparing for similar program on Independence Day. But once the first part of the rehearsal video went viral with false claims, disturbed parents protested. Following which, the school dropped the idea of the program to avoid any kind of harm to the school and the teachers. Our intention was to show that the world is one despite many religions. However, some miscreants tried to paint a communal narrative and used the video to spread religious hatred,"" school principal Arathi Janardhan was quoted as saying by Shivamogga Live.

VERIFICATION

Times Group publication Bangalore Mirror too reported about it on July 6 this year.

""The video has been deliberately distorted. It was actually partial footage from a kindergarten school's initiative to teach children verses from not only the Quran but also the Bible and the Bhagavad Gita,"" Bangalore Mirror concluded in its report.

VERDICT

Times Fact Check has found claims about school teachers in Karnataka forcing Hindu kids to read Namaz to be only partially true. The bit where the same kids are later made to recite verses from Hindu as well as Christian scriptures for communal harmony is deliberately omitted from the video being shared, to target Congress-JD(S) government in the state."

For over a century, they have been seeking adequate space to bury their dead but their struggle shows no signs of coming to an end.

P Ramalingam, a 70-year-old resident of Kazhuperumpakkam Colony in Vanur taluk, says that the fight for a new cemetery began during his grandfather's time and has continued to this day, with his grandsons now taking it up. ""Many years ago, our forefathers settled here as farmhands. During that period, the landlords had given us 12 cents of land on the western side of the village to be used as a burial ground. Today, there are 300 families residing here and there is not much space left,"" says Ramalingam.

As this small piece of land has run out of space, the Dalits have been petitioning officials and politicians one after the other to allocate a new burial ground for them. Of course, they can't even imagine asking for the right to bury their dead in the common burial ground of the village - it is a well-settled norm in most villages in Tamil Nadu that Dalits needs to be segregated even in their deaths, with separate burial grounds for them and for caste Hindus.

Recently, officials have started the process to lay a new road to the old cemetery, despite the Dalits telling them that there is no space left there. The Dalits have instead been seeking the allocation of a small portion of the poramboke land in the village as a burial ground for them. This seems to have put them in conflict with the caste Hindus of the village, some of whom have built buildings on the land.

""We are demanding a new cemetery in the poramboke land, which measures more than three acres. We just need some space in that. We have been demanding this for more than a hundred years but a few years ago, some caste Hindu people built a few houses and a shop, and are now opposing the cemetery in that poramboke land,"" said M Ramani, a resident of Kazhuperumpakkam Colony.

She said that government officials had promised a peace meeting last week to settle the issue between them and the caste Hindus. But until Monday, there was no communication from them.

When Express contacted a revenue official in charge of the region, he said, ""We found that one person of the same village, who is a caste Hindu, has constructed his house near the poramboke land, where the villagers are demanding a cemetery. He has got a stay order from the Madras High Court against allocating the land for the cemetery. Due to this, we couldn't allocate the land for this purpose. As an alternative solution, measures are being taken to acquire land to lay a proper path to the old cemetery.""

He promised that work to pave a path for the old cemetery will be started within a week, as the paperwork was already underway. However, villagers said that laying a road to the old cemetery will be of no use as there is not much space left there and demanded that the district administration take action to solve the issue in court, and get the poramboke land for their cemetery.

The Dalits say with 300 families now in the Kazhuperumpakkam Colony, the old cemetery is hardly adequate and it had always been an ordeal whenever one of them dies. The areas surrounding the old cemetery have, over time, been cultivated with casuarina, making it difficult for villagers to carry out the funeral procession. ""Most of the time, farmland owners, who are caste Hindus, water the land deliberately when a Dalit villager dies, forcing us to walk in the mud,"" said Muthukannu, another villager. It becomes even worse during rainy days.

Muthukannu says there is a government school nearby. The teachers in the school have to send their students home when there is a body to be cremated because the fumes engulf the premises.

When a body is cremated (some Dalit families perform cremation as per their beliefs), around five people usually circle the body, ready with bucketfuls of water in case the fire spills over to the casuarina trees of the nearby farm. With the lack of adequate lighting, it is also imperative that the body is buried or cremated before dark.

Villagers added that they had submitted a petition to the collector three weeks ago after which revenue department officials and Vanur constituency MLA M Chakrabani visited the spot. Villagers had blockaded them and demanded a new cemetery."

""It was the first day of the exams and we feared that the students, who have been barred from taking the exams, might create trouble.

A Ganesh Nadar/Rediff.com brings you their inspiring story.

At a time when most parents in India don't mind paying a hefty donation to send their children to English medium schools in hope of a brighter future, a municipal school in Tamil Nadu is trying to do something different.

The Pallavaram Municipality Primary School in Zameen Pallavaram (also called Old Pallavaram), on the outskirts of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, is trying to build skills in students outside of academics, and excel in contact sports like karate and brainy ones like chess.

And they are going out of their way to arrange funds so that they can send their students to international competitions to gain exposure as well as win accolades.

Unlike most civic schools which are either defunct due to lack of teachers and/or students or in dilapidated shape, this school is well maintained.

It has tall and clean whitewashed buildings. There are classes from 1 to 5 with a strength of 580 students and 17 teachers.

When I visit the school, Headmaster N Karthikeyan is addressing students from class 5 who are sitting cross-legged on the ground.

As we are speaking, a young lad enters the class room.

""I want to meet Karate Anna,"" the boy, who had heard about R S Sreenivasan, the school's dedicated karate teacher, says.

""We took only three students to Sri Lanka and came back with six medals -- five gold and one bronze,"" Sreenivasan tells me later.

The three students from the school -- M Aaris (class 2), A M Siddesh Hariharan and I Hari Govind, both from Class 4 -- participated in the 5th Open International Semi Contact Shotokan Karate Championship in Sri Lanka on October 6 and 7.

Some 1,500 students from Australia, Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan competed in the championship.

At another tournament in Aranthangi, Tamil Nadu, where all the five southern states participated, this school won the overall shield and was also the only government school to have won prizes.

It started in 2016 when the government of Tamil Nadu issued a notification that schools should have karate classes for girls so that they learnt self-defence.

""If we only trained the girls, there would never be enough students. Therefore I decided to train the boys, too,"" Karthikeyan recalls how the idea came about.

A Geetha, a teacher at the school, recommended Sreenivasan's name.

A day after the government circular was issued, Sreenivasan began training the school's students.

""We told the master that we would pay Rs 100 per student. He expected at least Rs 5,000 a month for two classes a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays between 4.30 pm to 5.30 pm,"" says Karthikeyan.

""These are poor students. Some pay and some don't. I pay the difference so that the Master is not disappointed,"" he adds.

Arranging funds for the Sri Lankan tournament wasn't easy either.

But help poured in from all quarters.

""Whenever there is a small shortage of funds I pay from my pocket and if we need more I have a few friends that help out,"" says Sreenivasan.

Tamil Nadu Education Minister K A Sengottaiyan was so pleased to know that a government school was participating in an international tournament that he called the headmaster and asked what he could do to help.

The minister sponsored the air tickets to Sri Lanka and also requested government officials on the island to look after the kids.

""We were received at the airport and well looked after. We had a vehicle at our disposal. They had arranged for our stay with separate accommodation for the kids,"" says Karthikeyan.

WATCH R S Sreenivasan train the girl students at the Municipal Primary School in Zameen Pallavaram.

It's not always the funds that bother Karthikeyan.

Just when we are speaking, a lady comes in with her son, a student at the school.

""I asked you to come because he was supposed to be here at 6 am for a tournament but he didn't come,"" says Karthikeyan.

""He overslept,"" the mother answers.

""He will oversleep, he is a child, you should have woken him up. There were 30 students, you don't expect me to call everyone of them in the morning.""

""The tournament and travel fee was Rs 300. I can't ask the tournament organisers for a refund nor can I ask the transporter. I don't mind paying as long as he participates. He did not participate, but someone else could have and maybe even won the prize there. I didn't want him to win, but I definitely wanted him to participate. Next time, don't let him sleep,"" the teacher admonishes the parent.

Karate is not the only game the students excel at. They have won medals in chess too. The Thirumal Chess Academy, Mudichur, coaches the students for free.

""We offered to pay a nominal amount, but they refused,"" said the encouraging headmaster, who proudly displays the prizes his students have won in chess and karate.

""We also have carrom here, which I teach. It's free. After school they can play as long as they want,"" the headmaster adds.

WATCH: R S Sreenivasan trains the boys at the school.

Students at the school recently participated in the national karate tournament in Kanyakumari.

""What we really require is to participate in an international tournament in Malaysia and Singapore in May 2019. The cost per child will be Rs 75,000,"" says Karthikeyan. ""We are planning to send a dozen kids and a coach. We need about Rs 1,000,000 which we hope to get from our well-wishers.""

The Federation of Central Universities Teachers Association (FEDCUTA) has alleged that the Modi government is sitting on quota roster decision for the fear of upper caste votes. Appointments of academic staff in institutes is on hold since July following an order by the Allahabad High Court.

FEDCUTA President Prof Rajib Ray told India Today TV that the Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar had assured an ordinance to restore the previous reservation roster but now since Parliament is in session the government should bring in a bill. The HC verdict in March had struck down 200-point roster treating college/university as unit following which UGC had announced that an individual department should be considered as the base unit to calculate the number of teaching posts to be reserved for Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) candidates leaving them at a disadvantage. The stalemate has resulted in colleges/universities forced to run classes with ad hoc teachers.

""Immediately after the HC verdict on March 5, FEDCUTA, DUTA and several other Universities Teachers Associations protested it, after our representations to HRD Minister, we were promised that the Government will file an appeal in the Supreme Court,"" said Prof Ray. ""We had been repeatedly telling the government to bring an ordinance to restore the old roster, but it has so far done nothing except for filing an appeal due to which appointments have come to a standstill,"" he further said.

Prof Ray claimed that since all the political parties, including Congress, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, CPM and CPI have supported the Teachers Association on the issue, so the government should have no problem if it introduces bill to restore the 200-point roster. ""They should have done this in April itself,"" he said.

Prof Ray said that it was shocking to see that immediately after the HC order came, 7 to 10 universities came up with advertisements according to the new anti-reservation roster, clearly indicating that in the academics the anti-reservation position is a major position. ""The indecisiveness of the government has resulted in vacancies rising to 50 per cent in Delhi University Colleges alone and both reserved as well as the general category candidates seeking jobs are suffering,"" he added.

There is no urgency to fill vacant Teachers Associations of the state and central universities have formed a Joint Forum for Movement (JFME) to carry out a march on February 19 next year to protest against the Modi Government's education policy. ""There will teachers from KG to PG protesting in the capital against the policy attack that has happened against publicly funded institutions,"" said Prof Ray. ""The graded autonomy bills, attempt to dismantle UGC, replacing 'grants' from the UGC, with 'loans' from Higher Education Financing Agency (HEFA) for infrastructure, this is all an attempt towards privatisation and commercialisation of the education sector,"" he added.

The action plan needs to focus on the teacher who plays a pivotal role in imparting education.

Beginning in 1968, India has had two education policies. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government constituted a committee under the chairmanship of late T.S.R. Subramanian to evolve a new policy. By the time the committee submitted its report, the Union HRD minister was changed.

So, another committee was constituted, this time under the chairmanship of K. Kasturirangan to formulate the new education policy. In July this year, the committee got a third extension.

The current government has only a few months to go. One fervently hopes that this report also does not meet the same fate as the one by T.S.R. Subramanian.

However, the key question is whether there is a need for a new education policy at all? It is undoubtedly true that what has so far happened in the education sector leaves a lot to be desired. What also needs to be considered is whether the dismal performance is on account of policy gap or are there other factors that are responsible for the current state of affairs? What is the rationale for a new policy in the school education sector?

During the past decade, the educational infrastructure (like school buildings) has certainly shown remarkable improvement, although there is still a long way to go. And, thanks to the midday meal, we have managed to get the child to the school. However, the quality of education that is imparted in most of the government schools has left a lot to be desired.

The learning outcomes have actually come down during the past decade despite an enormous amount of investment. The number of teachers has gone up substantially and the average pupil-teacher ratio comes close to the required levels. However, this has not solved the problem of quality.

To begin with, a large number of teachers are not qualified to teach, yet they are teaching. According to a rough estimate, out of 8 million teachers around 1.4 million fall in this category. Politics has seeped into this cadre in the most insidious manner resulting in the skewed distribution of teachers in most of the states as the tendency is to hang in and around urban areas.

The Right to Education Act did precious little to salvage these shortcomings. In fact, in some cases, like no-detention policy and mandatory provision relating to qualification and number of teachers, it created more problems than it solved. A tedious process of amendment had to be resorted to correct some of the wrongs.

Most of the action relating to education lies in the states. Moreover, India is too diverse to consider a single mandate by way of policy for the entire country. If a teacher does not go to a school in Kerala, there are chances that he or she will be punished, but some states in northern India are notorious for teacher absenteeism. Although the situation is now improving, it remains a big challenge in many states. Many teachers get away with playing truant. There are also instances of teachers employing a 'substitute' to represent them and even teach on their behalf. What quality of education can be expected from such so-called substitute teachers?

Can a new education policy solve the problems that beset this sector? Problems vary from region to region. If policies were to solve the problems of the country, they would have all been solved long ago. There should be just a short policy statement outlining the objectives: Providing quality education to every child in the country. Instead, what is actually required is an action plan clearly outlining what needs to be done, how will it be done, who will do it, and, by when will it be done? The roles of respective entities should be clearly defined so that the performance can be assessed.

The action plan needs to focus on the teacher who plays a pivotal role in imparting education. The entire value chain needs to be looked at, understood, and interventions clearly outlined. Beginning with pre-service training, to selection process, to in-service training, transfer and posting, engagement of teachers in non-educational activities, their promotional avenues and morale will need to be looked at. An action plan for each state will have to be worked out in detail, clearly outlining the roles of the central government and the respective state governments.

A beginning was made in this regard for the states of Jammu and Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh. The one relating to J&K is apparently being implemented, but UP is languishing. Such plans will have to be made for and in consultation with each state and their execution closely monitored. Intervention for each state will vary.

Unlike the current dispensation, there will have to be sufficient flexibility in the central schemes to accommodate the differences among states. The whole approach has to be outcome-based rather than input-based, as has been the case so far.

Our country has been obsessed with the Western world. We had looked at Finland, England, Scotland, New Zealand, Holland and all the lands of the world, but not at our own motherland. A lot of wonderful work is being done within the country, but has so far gone unnoticed. A new 'policy' can't help in this regard. What needs to be done is to facilitate identification, understanding and scaling of successful practices. If these homegrown practices have succeeded in the prevalent objective conditions, the chances of their replication and scaling are pretty high as compared to an 'imported' idea or practice. What is also required is to learn from states, like Rajasthan, that have turned it around through some remarkable state-level interventions both at administrative and financial levels.

Policy debates are always welcome and should happen, but what is required urgently is an action plan in consultation with all the stakeholders as has been done for a couple of states already. What is required is making things happen on the ground.

The publication of the British government's white paper for a post-Brexit immigration system is long overdue. But coming so late in the day, with such uncertainty continuing about what Brexit will look like, much of what's being proposed feels quite surreal.

The UK's immigration system is currently a malfunctioning mess. It's overly complicated, opaque and weighed down with political and social expectations that cannot be met. It's been consistently castigated by senior legal figures for being so labyrinthine that even immigration lawyers have difficulty navigating it. It's expensive, intrusive, and places unreasonable burdens on citizens, including landlords, health service workers and lecturers, to act as if they were employed as border guards. The current system can also end up unfairly discriminating by ethnicity.

Many of these shortcomings are acknowledged in the Home Office's white paper, and the potential clarity the eventual publication of this document brings to the debate on the UK's future immigration policy is welcome.

In the immediate aftermath of the white paper's publication, much was made of the absence of a numerical target for net migration. But this is a red herring. The target has been politically dead in the water since before the 2016 referendum.

Devil in the detail

There are other, rather more fundamental changes in the government's new plans for both migrants and employers. The resident labour market test will be scrapped, meaning employers can recruit directly from outside the UK without having to advertise in the UK first. Migrants on ""skilled-employment"" visas will also be able to stay for five years, and bring dependants with them. A system of new temporary visas will be created that are not tied to a single employer, enabling migrants to move between employers in precarious and flexible sectors of the labour market. At the same time, these temporary migrants will be prevented from renewing their status or continuing their employment even if they and their employers would prefer it.

What happens to these proposals as they are consulted on, translated into legislation, and then into guidance and Home Office practices will be key.

In UK immigration policy, the devil is always in the detail. Restrictions often become clear in the non-legislative detail of immigration paperwork and key questions must await those technical documents. How high will the health service fee be for migrants on temporary visas? What will the level of the ""skills charge"" be to employers? What checks on prospective qualifications of employees will employers have to make in order to employ someone on a skilled visa?

Nonetheless, the policy outlined in the new white paper has three striking characteristics that shed light on its overall weaknesses. It is in turns, rather surreal, cynical and in places, potentially quite sinister.

Problems with an earnings threshold

There is much weight given within the white paper to the settlement scheme for EU citizens currently living in the UK that will be in place until the end of the Brexit ""implementation period"" in December 2020. Yet without parliament's approval of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, which includes a reciprocal arrangement with the EU on the rights of citizens, the political basis for that scheme is void. That means the proposals in the white paper might be dead by March if there is a no-deal Brexit - at least as far as EU citizens are concerned.

Much is made in the white paper of the ""skills"" basis for the new immigration system.

Yet the skilled employment route has two problems. First, it's likely such a route will be tied to an earnings threshold. The government will consult on a proposal, made by the independent Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) in September, to set that threshold at £30,000 a year, just above median earnings. This is politically contentious as there are many skilled workers who earn well below this. Second, it treats ""skilled employment"" as if this is an objectively measurable attribute - it isn't.

The policy proposals are also pretty cynical. The MAC report found little evidence of large effects of migration on employment and wages. Yet it explicitly made reference to such pressures when it proposed keeping the £30,000 per year earnings threshold for skilled employment, arguing that such a high level might encourage employers to pay their skilled workers - librarians, care workers, physiotherapists, teachers - more. For the same reason, it opposed lowering the income threshold for public sector workers, on the grounds that upward pressure on their wages would be a good thing.

Yet, under current public expenditure levels, skilled public sector workers will not have wage increases to match these requirements. In the face of employer complaints, the government has explicitly invited employers to discuss the rate at which the threshold will be set in a year-long consultation. It's likely the threshold will go down, directly undermining the MAC's rationale for having it at all, and continuing to endorse the UK's low-wage economy. Meanwhile, the gender pay gap, and the differential treatment of skills in typically male and female employment, means that women migrants are less likely to meet whichever threshold is set.

Selecting 'immigrants'

One of the rather understated, but politically telling, elements of the Home Office's plans is that they permit two possible divergences from the new employment visa regimes they are proposing. First, new trade agreements after Brexit may open new routes for migrants from preferred countries and the UK will trade access to its labour market for those willing to do a deal. Yet it's unclear how this constitutes ""taking back control"", being open, or having a skills-led immigration policy.

The second, is that immigration policy may diverge in future if more immigration routes are closed on the basis of ""risk"". ""Low-risk nationalities"" and ""low-risk countries"" will have access to the UK. Migrants - however skilled - that do not conform to this ""risk"" assessment are always vulnerable to exclusion. ""Risks"" can be defined in many ways and give governments wide powers to select which countries the skilled migrants may come from. And the government is specifically proposing to automate such assessments. This opens the possibility for a return to the outright discriminatory and racist immigration policy of the past.

Overall, the timing of the white paper's publication is surreal, it presents proposals that rather cynically reproduce existing inequalities in the UK's precarious labour market and its casts a rather sinister light on how the government thinks about selecting ""immigrants"" after Brexit."

Alleging that the inspections by the government teams are ""motivated"" and ""an attempt just to tarnish the image of civic bodies"", the education committees of both south and north corporations have directed their officials not to let the ""survey teams enter the school premises"".

The government has asked Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) to assess each government, private, and municipal school on parameters like safety, teaching-learning facilities and community engagement. DCPCR is the statutory body to monitor implementation of rights of children and Right To Education Act, 2009 in the city.

The chairperson of the south corporation's education committee, Nandini Sharma, said the House had already rejected the inspection proposal. ""The survey teams had taken permission from us three months ago after showing us a set of questions. But now they have completely changed their track, which is unacceptable."" These inspections also disrupt entire work in schools, she added. ""No permission is sought from the principals and committee members barge into classrooms,"" she alleged.

Sharma's counterpart in the north corporation, Ritu Goel, said she had directed education officials to discontinue the visits with immediate effect. ""We had agreed to the exercise keeping child welfare in mind but the government is using it politically to malign the image of corporation schools."" Goel said she had received complaints from 20-25 teachers about the conduct of inspection teams.

The little kids are asked ""motivated"" questions, Goel alleged. ""Which brave child gets beaten by teachers? Which good student brings the tea for teachers? When a teacher is talking on mobile phones then you don't disturb them -- such types of questions are being asked,"" she said. ""The purpose is only to create a controversy.""

Showing the files about the ""agreed-upon"" questions, she added that the survey was meant to be about issues like safety of kids, guard rooms and visitors in the school. Corporation officials were also asked to provide details of students' family members but they are yet to send any information.

DCPCR member Anurag Kundu, however, claimed that the corporations couldn't legally stop the inspections. ""DCPCR is not under Delhi government and it is an independent statutory body. It is legally obligated to monitor implementation of RTE Act in all schools. The education committee has no authority to stop us,"" he said.

Kundu said the teams were asking the questions agreed upon in joint meetings in September. ""The questions cited by the education committees are not being asked. Only questions like how do you feel in classroom? Are you allowed to ask questions,"" he added.

He also pointed out that Quality Council of India, a central government agency, had been selected as the project management agency for the survey."

Seven women charged by the police in the alleged child sex racket in Yadadri town have approached the High Court seeking permission to meet the children who were forcibly removed from their custody, claiming that the children were their own or wards kept in their custody by relatives and friends.

The petitioners included a man as well, whose sister's daughter has been taken away, and wife sent to jail. A total of 26 women were arrested in July this year on the charges of child trafficking, child rape and others, and 33 children in their care were sent to the State-run shelter home in Nalgonda and Prajwala home for the trafficking survivors in Amangal.

4. 8,000 Eng College Teachers Lose Jobs in a Year

A year since All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) increased the student-faculty ratio from 15:1 to 20:1, thousands of teaching staff in private engineering continue to lose their jobs or face pay cut. Nearly 8,000 teachers have either lost their jobs or had to take up jobs with a massive pay cut in the State -- nearly 70 percent of them are from around 70 engineering colleges in the city.

The ordeal of the teachers is far from over. Most senior level teachers had to take 30-40 per cent pay cut to stay employed post the revamped AICTE guidelines. P Laxman, assistant prof with a city engineering college, said his pay shrunk from '27,000 to '18,000 and no reasons were given. Those who could not compromise, quit and ended up being unemployed, he said.

Context: The Lok Sabha has passed the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2016 to give transgender persons equal rights and protection under law through a voice vote.

The Bill had gone to the standing committee, and as many as 27 amendments have been accepted by the government.

The amendments passed include a change in the previous definition of transgender persons as ""neither wholly female or wholly male"", which was criticised as being insensitive.

According to the new definition, a transgender person is somebody ""whose gender does not match the gender assigned to that person at birth and includes trans-men or trans-women, persons with intersex variations, gender-queers, and persons having socio-cultural identities such as kinnar, hijras, aravani, and jogta"".

Several civil society groups have been vocal about their opposition to the Bill The Bill disregards many of their suggestions as also some of the crucial points raised by the standing committee report of July 2017.

The Bill must recognise that gender identity must go beyond biological; gender identity is an individual's deep and personal experience. It need not correspond to the sex assigned at birth. It includes the personal sense of the body and other expressions such as one's own personal inducing proceeds.

Context: Women and child development ministry has drafted a policy dedicated to the protection of children. Until now, protection of children was only a part of the broader National child policy 2013.

The Supreme Court had asked the centre to consider framing the national policy on protection of children.

Key provisions and highlights of the draft policy:

The Policy should address four aspects- creating awareness, prevention, reporting and responding. The draft needs to go into all these aspects, especially reporting structure involving various nodal bodies and monitoring mechanism for implementation of the guidelines.

The policy makers should take the opportunity to go beyond the role of Institutions and look at the role of individuals.

The norms should be designed in such a way that organisations can customise the policies according to the nature of their work.

Context: A group of researchers at Nagpur-based Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology have developed a new technique which promises to help produce high value graphene from discarded dry cells batteries.

Since graphene is made out of graphite, its production is both expensive and has significant environmental impact. The new technique helps both reduce the cost and preserve environment.

Graphene has been touted in the global electronics industry as a ""miracle material"" given its strength, electrical conductivity and elasticity, and has been seen as an alternative to lithium-ion batteries since its discovery in 2004. It is a form of carbon that can be used to develop smaller, slimmer batteries but with higher capacity.

Graphene is a carbon material that is one atom thick. Its thin composition and high conductivity means it is used in applications ranging from miniaturised electronics to biomedical devices. These properties also enable thinner wire connections; providing extensive benefits for computers, solar panels, batteries, sensors and other devices.

Context: The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) has started the process of ""comprehensively amending"" the backbone of forest governance in India -- the Indian Forest Act, 1927 (IFA).

According to the 1996 Supreme Court order, the dictionary definition of the word forest is taken to be the legal definition too. It covers all statutorily recognised forests, whether designated as reserved, protected or otherwise for the purpose of Section 2(i) of the Forest Conservation Act (1980). As per the Court order, the term forest land, occurring in Section 2, will not only include forest as understood in the dictionary sense, but also any area recorded as forest in the government record irrespective of the ownership.

The Indian Forest Act, 1927 was largely based on previous Indian Forest Acts implemented under the British. The most famous one was the Indian Forest Act of 1878.

Many reports like the MB Shah report of 2010 and the TSR Subramanian report of 2015, have talked about amending the IFA.

Mains Question: The recent amendments to the Indian Forest Act, 1927 will create new markets & jobs for poor communities. Critically analyze.

Context: The Tamil Nadu government has distributed 200 Navic- powered satellite- enabled communication devices developed by ISRO to 80 fishing boat groups.

NAVIC is an independent regional navigation satellite system designed to provide position information in the Indian region and 1500 km around the Indian mainland.

IRNSS would provide two types of services, namely Standard Positioning Services available to all users and Restricted Services provided to authorised users.

It is a regional system and so its constellation will consist of seven satellites. Three of these will be geostationary over the Indian Ocean, i.e., they will appear to be stationary in the sky over the region, and four will be geosynchronous - appearing at the same point in the sky at the same time every day. This configuration ensures each satellite is being tracked by at least one of fourteen ground stations at any given point of time, with a high chance of most of them being visible from any point in India.

Why it is necessary to have indigenous global navigation system?

Having a global navigation system bolsters the ability of a nation to serve as a net security provider, especially through the guarantee of such assurance policies. It can also play a significant role in relief efforts post disasters such as the tsunami in the Indian Ocean region in 2004 and the Pakistan-India earthquake in 2005.

The 7 round of India - South Korea Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) negotiations were held in South Korea from 11 to 13 December, 2018.

South Korea imports around 15 lac tones of raw sugar annually and the Indian sugar industry is making efforts to export raw sugar from India during 2018-19 sugar seasons.

India and South Korea will reduce duties on 11 tariff lines in a bid to expand bilateral trade by updating their existing free-trade agreement, called the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA).

In 2017-18, India exported goods worth $4.4 billion to South Korea while imports from the latter were worth $16.3 billion.

CECA - Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement

CEPA - Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement

The major ""technical"" difference between a CECA and CEPA is that CECA involve only ""tariff reduction/elimination in a phased manner on listed/all items except the negative list and tariff rate quota (TRQ) items. CEPA also covers the trade in services and investment and other areas of economic partnership"".

So CEPA is a wider term that CECA and has the widest coverage.

Usually CECA is signed first with a country and after that negotiations may start for a CEPA.

Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs and Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, gave details on the status of implementation of National e-Vidhan Application (NeVA) Project.

The funding of NeVA is through Central Sponsored Scheme i.e. 60:40; and 90:10 for North East & hilly States and 100% for UTs.

It aims to bring all the legislatures of the country together, in one platform thereby creating a massive data depository without having the complexity of multiple applications.

Highlights of NeVA:

Paperless Assembly or e-Assembly is a concept involving of electronic means to facilitate the work of Assembly.

Himachal Pradesh is already the first Digital Legislature of the country.

Central Project Monitoring Unit (CPMU) and Detailed Project Report (DPR):

The CPMU under MoPA, is responsible for reviewing the financial and technical progress of the project. The State will prepare detailed project report (DPR) and gap analysis report.

The petitioner said that earlier there was a section under the Kerala Education Act by which the PSC had to select teachers for appointments in government and the aided schools.

However, the original section was suspended through an Ordinance in 1960.

The subsequent sections had empowered the managements to make appointments even while the government paid their emoluments.

The school was invited for lunch in the village. The lunch was arranged with the elders in attendance, and the whole community present. The public (government) primary school was doing good work, led by its lone teacher, Sachin. It's his fire that had changed the school.

At the door of the house where the lunch was arranged, some of the students were told not to enter, but sit outside and eat. These children were from Dalit families. Sachin spoke to the organizers. He wanted that there be no discrimination; in the school there was none. The organizers would not let the Dalit children eat with those from ""upper caste"" families inside the house. The teacher did not relent. As the argument escalated, he decided to stop the lunch. Either all of them ate together or they would go back to the school. Frantic negotiations started among the organizers. In the end, the kids sat together.

This teacher is an exception. Even those who never discriminate between their students on any ground inside the school find it hard to take the battle out of the school. They and their students face such conflicts daily, on every dimension of prejudice and discrimination -- caste, gender, religion, poverty and more. This is not a trivial issue. We expect school education to play a crucial role in developing an equal society. But the school is fully embedded in this very world of discrimination. Teachers have to have the understanding and the courage to battle this inside the school and outside. What can support and enable the teacher, to develop this understanding, and have the tenacity to fight these battles day on day?

On a hot September evening, 53 teachers were watching the television screen showing Shyam Benegal's Samvidhan. The room in the government upper primary school was about 600 sq. ft, and sweltering. My colleague Ravi was running the third episode of the 10-part series on the screen. The full series was scheduled to be screened on 10 consecutive days. This was in a small town called Dhorimana. This is 55km from Barmer, Rajasthan.

Ravi would pause the show at crucial moments, throwing a question at the gathering. There is a particularly poignant moment when Rajkumari Amrit Kaur and Hansa Mehta discuss the depth of patriarchy that even they have to face. Ravi paused the show and asked, ""How are things today, almost 70 years after the Constitution?"" It sparked a furore. There were 10 women in the room. But the debate was not divided along the lines of gender. A few men admitted that despite progress in these 70 years, patriarchy and gender discrimination were alive, even within themselves. The discussion moved to caste and then to religion. A minority confessed to the seams of discrimination and prejudice running on all these dimensions. Ravi brought it to a close; the intention was to light a few sparks, not to conclude.

The next time he stopped was after an intense segment where B.R. Ambedkar, Alladi Krishnaswamy Iyer, Syama Prasad Mukherjee and others debate the right to freedom of expression. Till one man spoke, seemingly there was agreement that we had secured freedom of expression for all in the past 70 years. He said, ""What about that woman Gauri Lankesh? She was killed for expressing her views, wasn't she?"" I was surprised to hear that in Dhorimana. But it did spark a fiery 15 minutes. Ravi managed to end the session, without the intensity going down, but with no animosity remaining.

Thirty-five teachers attended the show across the 10 days on an average, with a low of 20 and a high of 58. They came because they were interested, there was no order or incentive. It was an intense 10 days of exploring the Constitution. All in the context of the reality that they live in. Much after the 10 days had ended, we asked the teachers the value of Festival of the Constitution. Understanding the Constitution was only a part of it. The real matter was the discovery of like-minded colleagues. A peer network, which could provide sorely needed support on conflict-ridden matters. This sense that there was someone close to you was a spur for action in the school and outside.

Policies and curriculum mostly enable the teacher. But that is inconsequential, when confronting all this within her community and social relationships. There are those few like Sachin who may have the inherent courage. Many of even those wilt over time. Most who would like to battle discrimination find it hard to act, even within the school.

These biases are deeply ingrained in our society. The question to ask of ourselves is: What supports the teacher (or anyone else) in her daily life in the quest for our Constitutions' ideals? There doesn't seem to be much. Most of those who battle to bring our Constitution to life, in the Dhorimanas of this country, feel alone. They need not, because they are not really alone in Dhorimana. Once they get talking, they build a coalition for the Constitution. But this has to be done, it doesn't happen on its own. We cannot await Godot, we have to do this ourselves."

The Aayog has suggested creating conditions to facilitate the import of doctors, especially those of Indian origin working abroad, and also deploying teachers from universities abroad as visiting professors at AIIMS or NIEs and developing framework for deployment of doctors and specialists from the private sector to government hospitals on a visiting or honorary basis to address the shortage of doctors.

It has recommended expanding the system of Diplomate of National Board (DNB) and Diplomas from College of Physicians and Surgeons (CPS) to help address the shortage of specialists in the country and link at least 40 per cent of district hospitals with medical colleges.

The Aayog has pitched for reforming the governance of medical, nursing, dentistry and pharmacy education in the country by enacting the National Medical Commission (NMC) Bill, 2017.

It suggested establishment of a Council for Allied Health Professionals to ensure standardisation of education and putting in place quality control mechanisms for educational institutions, teaching methods, clinical protocols and workforce management.

It suggested putting in place an updated curriculum for medical and allied professions that keeps pace with the changing dynamics of public health, policy and demographics.

It also called for initiating steps to stop private practice by faculty of government teaching institutions by providing attractive salaries and incentives.

To achieve universal health coverage, the Aayog has pitched for ensuring access to affordable drugs and medical devices.

It has recommended institution of a new Drug Price Control Order (DPCO), which ensures rational drug prices by reducing trade margins and including consumables, in addition to drugs, in the DPCO to control undue profiteering.

It also called for finalising the national pharmaceutical policy to enable access to affordable medicines, promote the use of generic drugs, clamp down on unfair marketing practices and give a boost to local manufacturing to reduce dependence on imports.

It also recommended formulating and implement the e-pharmacy policy to facilitate online access to quality medicines in a cost-effective and timely manner.

For Komal*, a student of class II at a government school in south Delhi, her pink bag with Barbie doll painted on its front side is not less than a treasure.

Everyday Komal carries the bag on her shoulders, stuffed with at least eight to nine books and copies as she walks up to her school. 'Apart from regular set of books, I carry a diary as well for preparing notes', says Komal as we discuss her daily routine.

Class II Student Carrying a Bag Equivalent to Class IX

With Komal's bag weighing 4.6 kg, she is, unknowingly of course, carrying more than twice the weight that has been prescribed by the Delhi government recently.

In a circular dated 1 December 2018, the Delhi government fixed the weight of school bags for students of classes I to X. For students of classes I and II, the circular states that their bags should not weigh more than 1.5 kg. State governments, including Delhi, have come up with guidelines on the weight of school bags after they were told to do so by the HRD Ministry.

At 4.6 kg, Komal is carrying a bag equivalent to that of a class IX student!

For other classes the maximum weight of school bag, as approved by the state government is as follows:

Classes III to V: 2-3 KgClasses VI to VII: 4 KgClasses VIII to IX: 4.5 KgClass X: 5 Kg

In the same government school in south Delhi, students of class I were sitting on top of a cotton durrie spread across the floor. At 2.1 kg, Leena*, a student of class I, may not be facing any health problem but technically speaking, even she is carrying a bag daily, more than the prescribed weight limit.

Extra Diary Needed for Notes

Himanshi*, a student of class VI in a Rajkiya Kanya Ucch Madhyamik Vidyalaya (government school with classes upto XII) aspires to become a doctor. She doesn't like it when her bag is lighter as compared to other days when it weighs 5.2 kg. A heavy bag gives this sixth grader an assurance that she will do well in exams and fulfill her dream one day.

With five books and an equal number of copies, Himanshi's bag also doesn't comply with the weight limit, as has been suggested by the Delhi government.

""At times, the bag is heavy, but I don't complain as everyone at home will start worrying unnecessarily. After joining a learning center that's being run by an NGO, I prefer carrying an extra copy and diary.""Himanshi (Student, Class VI)

This teaching centre where Himanshi spends an hour daily after school helped in clearing her doubts on LCM (Least Common Multiple) problems in Maths and clarified her doubts regarding identification of a proper noun.

So, that extra diary and copy, meant for preparing notes at the training centre, are something Himanshi can't leave behind at home.

Students in the Dark About New Guidelines

Most of the students that The Quint spoke to were not aware about recent guidelines nor were they told about permissible limit regarding the weight of bags by their respective teachers. Due permission was taken from the principal in south Delhi as well as the mentor of the training centre being run by an NGO after which the interviews of students were recorded.

On being asked how the school will ensure the policy on weight of school bags is implemented in letter and spirit, the principal of an MCD school in south Delhi said:

""We are aware of the recent circular and would be discussing with our staff as to how we can implement the same.""Principal of a govt school in south Delhi

According to an activist associated with an NGO that provides teaching facilities at under-resourced schools, an initiative related to cupboards didn't work out.

'We encouraged students to keep books in a cupboard at TFI-certified classrooms but soon some students started complaining after their books went missing', says the activist who has worked with schools earlier in Ahmedabad and is now managing a training center in Delhi.

Is 'Support Material' to be Blamed for Extra Weight?

For Monalisa*, who would be sitting for board exams in less than three months, it is mandatory to carry books of all the subjects to school daily.

""I have six subjects to study, so, I carry all the notebooks and books along with tiffin and a geometry box. It's actually the Maths and Science books that are quite heavy.""Monalisa, Student (Class X)

On being asked whether her friends also carry books of all subjects to school, Monalisa said, 'it's even worse as other students also carry support material for the subjects of Maths, Science and Social Studies'.

Usually students at government schools prefer NCERT textbooks but some schools also distribute separate books of different subjects, commonly referred to as 'supporting material'.

The supporting material usually has chapters in condensed form with brief pointers and has objective as well as subjective questions in order to give students a sense of the exam paper.

""It's the teachers at our school who suggested that NCERT textbooks are not sufficient and therefore, we prefer 'support material'. When the session began, we were given only textbooks but since exams are drawing near, we have now been given support material as well for all the subjects except Hindi and Sanskrit.""Monalisa, Student (Class X)

Private Schools Fall Prey to Publishers' Demands

While government schools don't mind handing out extra books in the name of 'support material', private schools often fall prey to publishers who offer more lucrative deals.

An educationist who has been working with government schools in Delhi since last two years told The Quint:

""Private schools do follow the syllabus which has been prescribed. However, at times, these schools prescribe books that are not part of the curriculum as they get a commission, and this also results in heavier bags.""

Demand for Re-structuring the Syllabus

For Sharmila, whose children study in class VI, VIII and X respectively, packing bag as per the school time-table is among her foremost priorities.

Compared to the pressure that kids endure these days, measures such as limiting the weight of school bags seem half-hearted to parents like Sharmila.

""They should do something about the syllabus, nothing will happen with just reducing the weight of bags."" Sharmila, Parent

It seems that the policy-makers should have spent more time on the weighty issue of course and figuring out a way of embracing smart classroom instead of merely calibrating bags based on weight!

Sea sponges that are processed to manufacture a menstrual sponge, serve as a natural alternative to synthetic tampons present in the market. In reality, sea sponges are marine organisms with a spongy structure that are harvested and industrially processed to produce menstrual sponge. As they are natural in origin, menstrual sponges contain no synthetic material that can harm health. With this, menstrual sponges deliver a natural alternative to synthetic sponges available in the market.

In addition, when harvested, part of the sea sponge is left behind for the organism to regrow. With such renewable resource of origin, the menstrual sponges provide sustainable product approach. Further, menstrual sponges last for six months and can be reused with proper maintenance. With the higher absorption capacity, menstrual sponges are primarily useful during heavy menstrual discharge. With their ease of use, menstrual sponges are the only biodegradable option available in the market against sanitary pads and tampons. With their efficiency to absorb, natural origin and ease of use, the menstrual sponge is gradually gaining consumer traction, leading to the menstrual sponge market growth in the foreseeable future.

Government Initiatives to Spread Awareness Regarding Menstrual Health to Boost Adoption

Lack of awareness regarding menstrual health in developing as well as underdeveloped parts across the globe have led national governments to initiate awareness program with the aim to assist girls and women to live healthy and productive lives where menstrual hygiene is a prerequisite. Specifically, with the focus on educating teenage girls, several government projects and initiatives have been launched. As the intensity of these programs grows, women in rural areas have started adopting hygienic products.

Further, governments in the developing countries like India have made menstrual hygiene an integral part of the nation's hygiene management guidelines. The program manages involvement of state governments, district administrations, engineers and technical experts in line departments; and school head teachers and teachers to ensure considerable penetration of the program among all adolescent girls and women. Increased education levels among females with the support of government initiatives is likely to boost adoption of menstrual sponge market during the estimated period.

Unawareness, Associated Health Risks, and Stringent FDA Regulations to Hamper the Market Progress

Unreachable health care services in the underdeveloped parts of Africa explains the lack of awareness regarding health and hygiene among the common population. As a result, the women population in the region is oblivious to hygiene maintenance, especially during the menstrual cycle. Further, lack of awareness about the use of menstrual sponges and debate associated with its usage is hampering the adoption of menstrual sponge.

Past examinations of sea sponges conducted under FDA revealed the presence of bacteria - Staphylococcus aureus which is responsible to cause toxic shock syndrome. Since then sea sponges that are labelled as menstrual sponges for use as menstrual tampons are required to get a premarket approval under the FDA Section 515. This has led to several manufacturers recalling their products. Further, owing to the risk of development of toxic shock syndrome, medical professionals do not prescribe the frequent use of menstrual sponges. Limited popularity, associated health risks and stringent FDA regulations are factors expected to impound the growth of the menstrual sponge market.

Ask For Customized Report @ www.factmr.com/connectus/sample?flag=RC&rep_id=449

Use of menstrual sponge remains a debatable subject for medical professionals, manufacturers, and regulatory authorities. While facing scrutiny by authorities, manufacturers have introduced reliable menstrual sponge products in the market. However, the steady popularity of sanitary pads and tampons is likely to confine adoption of menstrual sponge, further impacting the progress of the menstrual sponge market.

ThePrint asks: Should Karnataka govt push for onion, garlic in midday meal or let ISKCON follow own plan?

H.D. Kumaraswamy

Chief Minister of Karnataka

Onions and garlic help maintain good health. So, the question I would like to raise is, why should it be a problem in adding it in the midday meals that are served to children in the state?

Let food experts and doctors also explain the benefits. Food experts should advise the government whether to use these ingredients. Karnataka government is seeking the opinions of dietitians, food scientists and others on the advantages and disadvantages of onion and garlic. Then the government will take a call on what has to be done and whether other ingredients can substitute onions and garlic.

Let there be a debate on this on a public platform with all the stakeholders involved and then arrive at a decision.

Naveena Neerada Dasa

Head of communications, ISKCON

ISKCON is committed to feeding hot nutritious meals as prescribed by the MHRD and the state government.

In the last 18 years, we have put all effort to ensure that every child gets a nutritious meal. A lot of investment has gone into the infrastructure for cooking and providing hot meals.

We ensure that meals are cooked in the most hygienic conditions and we spare no effort. Akshaya Patra always feels that feeding the hungry is not a business but our social responsibility. Governments across the state have appreciated our efforts to give the best to children.

Basavaraju R

Executive director, Grassroots Research and Advocacy Movement (GRAAM)

I would say that the government should not insist, but persuade ISKCON to include these ingredients.

We know that garlic and onions are good and many dieticians say that. ISKCON maintains a very high-quality standard, and so, the government has no other option in those five districts that they serve in.

On the other hand is they insisted, I think ISKCON may agree. They should also respect dietary habits.

Children do consume it, but it would also be extreme to say that ISKCON should be forced to serve egg or meat. It will be against their philosophy. It is better to leave this decision on whether these ingredients are a must to the food experts.

We could also look at if onions and garlic can be made in powder form and added later when the food reaches the venue.

Onion and garlic is not as much a source of nutrition, as it is a taste enhancer. If the government wants to take the decision of stopping ISKCON's good service, then it will also have to take up additional responsibilities of hygiene and nutrition. Teachers will be additionally burdened. That's not fair. We should see if dialogue works, if not, we should explore innovative options.

Rohini Swamy

Associate editor, ThePrint

The controversy over using onion and garlic in midday meals has seen enough debate, but the bigger question is whether those who are availing the service are satisfied or not.

The Karnataka government should seek opinion of those who are involved in the scheme to understand whether the meals really offer a balanced diet to children or not. While many diet specialists say that onion and garlic are just taste enhancers and can be compensated with other food ingredients, a scientific approach to this issue is needed.

Another important point to note is that Akshaya Patra has been maintaining high standards of food quality control. This has been one of the primary reasons why the government is hesitant in taking any action against the NGO. Nearly one lakh children are served food under the midday meal scheme daily by Akshaya Patra, and in the last 18 years, there have been no major complaints against the quality or quantity of the food served. Akshaya Patra maintains that they follow the standards set by the MHRD.

With political parties using this issue as a weapon on target each other, children should be caught in this crossfire.

Now CM Kumaraswamy wants the people to help resolve the matter.

Bengaluru: The Karnataka government has been at loggerheads with NGO Akshaya Patra over the question of serving onion and garlic in mid-day meals, and Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy is now ready to take the vexed issue to the people's court.

Speaking to ThePrint, Kumaraswamy said he was ready to open the issue for public debate, and let the people decide whether or not they want the ISKCON-run NGO's onion-and-garlic-free food served to their children.

The Akshaya Patra Foundation, a non-profit organisation, is a midday meal partner of the Karnataka government in five districts -- Bengaluru, Mysuru, Ballari, Hubli and Mangaluru.

The Karnataka State Food Commission conducted a survey of government schools, and found that onion and garlic were absent from the meals served at schools where Akshaya Patra was the providing agency. The panel urged for them to be included to make meals tastier and more nutritious.

Akshaya Patra refused, owing to its belief in the Ayurvedic principle of providing 'sattvic' food -- cooked with organic, vegetarian ingredients. Onion and garlic are considered 'tamasic', that is, items that can trigger lethargy and negative emotions.

Naveena Neerada Dasa, ISKCON's head of strategic communication and projects, told ThePrint that it is Akshaya Patra's ""endeavour to promote good health and nutrition"", and that it ""will continue to follow the prescribed norms set by both the state and central government"".

The state government, meanwhile, began facing pressure from civil rights organisations like the Delhi-based Jan Swasthya Abhiyan and the Right to Food Campaign to cancel its contract with Akshaya Patra. They insist that Akshaya Patra has no right to decide what food has to be served, and cannot impose ""religious diktats"" on a scheme that embodies one's right to food.

The organisations have also spoken about the question of nutrition, though dieticians say onion and garlic only enhance taste -- their nutritional value can easily be replaced by nuts or fibres of different kinds.

Also read: Karnataka civil society groups want govt to dump ISKCON NGO over onion-garlic row

The Union Ministry of Human Resource Development, which oversees the midday meal scheme, does not specify what items are to be provided to children, be it eggs or onion or garlic.

The ministry's guidelines merely state that a primary school child be served food which has a nutritional value of 450 calories -- 12 grams of protein, 100 grams of food grains, 20 grams of pulses, 50 grams of vegetables, 5 grams of oil and fat, and salt and condiments as per need.

For upper primary schoolchildren, the intake is supposed to be 700 calories -- 20 grams of protein, 150 grams of food grains, 30 grams of pulses, 75 grams of vegetables , 7.5 grams of oil and fat, and salt and condiments as per need.

The Karnataka government has been reluctant to cancel its contract with Akshaya Patra, since the midday meal scheme has helped increase the number of admissions in government schools.

It seems to have decided that the only way this matter can be resolved is if it is opened to public debate, rather than be coerced to take a decision based on the observations of civil rights organisations.

Kumaraswamy has now decided to seek the opinion of various stakeholders, including school teachers, headmasters, food scientists and dieticians, on whether there is an absolute need to add onion and garlic in the food that is being served.

""The question we are raising is whether it would cause any major deficiencies to children if (onion and garlic) are not added to their midday meals. We will be able to take an informed stand only after we receive adequate information on it,"" said Kumaraswamy.

""We will ask food experts, doctors and nutritionists on these aspects, and then take a decision. Let's not rush into any decision.""

While this controversy rages, officials at the Department of Primary and Secondary Education have come up with a new idea to bypass the onion-garlic question and yet enhance children's diet.

Preliminary discussions are on to add fruits to the menu, so that children can have a well-rounded meal.

Sources in the department also said the Mysuru-based Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) has been asked to analyse the nutritional value of onion and garlic, and find if there are alternative fruits or vegetables that can provide the same nutrition."

On Tuesday, the court was informed that on November 27, a circular was issued by the Directorate of Education (DoE) where it is specifically mentioned that, ""except DoE, no outside agency' has been hired or engaged for data collection or verification"".

The curriculum will be based on a four-fold framework -- inspire through stories and case studies of entrepreneurial journeys, educate through self-designed micro research, involve through local community, and facilitate by supporting in developing ideas into projects.

Sisodia said, ""Barring few exceptions, once the child completes elementary schooling and joins the secondary class, his entire orientation, which is largely shaped by the teachers and parents, is to secure good marks in exams, get admission in a good college and get a job with decent pay package after completing education. This is considered a trajectory of success and anyone who either secures less marks or fails to join college or fails to secure a job is deemed as unsuccessful.""

Sea sponges that are processed to manufacture a menstrual sponge, serve as a natural alternative to synthetic tampons present in the market. In reality, sea sponges are marine organisms with a spongy structure that are harvested and industrially processed to produce menstrual sponge. As they are natural in origin, menstrual sponges contain no synthetic material that can harm health. With this, menstrual sponges deliver a natural alternative to synthetic sponges available in the market.

In addition, when harvested, part of the sea sponge is left behind for the organism to regrow. With such renewable resource of origin, the menstrual sponges provide sustainable product approach. Further, menstrual sponges last for six months and can be reused with proper maintenance. With the higher absorption capacity, menstrual sponges are primarily useful during heavy menstrual discharge. With their ease of use, menstrual sponges are the only biodegradable option available in the market against sanitary pads and tampons. With their efficiency to absorb, natural origin and ease of use, the menstrual sponge is gradually gaining consumer traction, leading to the menstrual sponge market growth in the foreseeable future.

Government Initiatives to Spread Awareness Regarding Menstrual Health to Boost Adoption

Lack of awareness regarding menstrual health in developing as well as underdeveloped parts across the globe have led national governments to initiate awareness program with the aim to assist girls and women to live healthy and productive lives where menstrual hygiene is a prerequisite. Specifically, with the focus on educating teenage girls, several government projects and initiatives have been launched. As the intensity of these programs grows, women in rural areas have started adopting hygienic products.

Further, governments in the developing countries like India have made menstrual hygiene an integral part of the nation's hygiene management guidelines. The program manages involvement of state governments, district administrations, engineers and technical experts in line departments; and school head teachers and teachers to ensure considerable penetration of the program among all adolescent girls and women. Increased education levels among females with the support of government initiatives is likely to boost adoption of menstrual sponge market during the estimated period.

Unawareness, Associated Health Risks, and Stringent FDA Regulations to Hamper the Market Progress

Unreachable health care services in the underdeveloped parts of Africa explains the lack of awareness regarding health and hygiene among the common population. As a result, the women population in the region is oblivious to hygiene maintenance, especially during the menstrual cycle. Further, lack of awareness about the use of menstrual sponges and debate associated with its usage is hampering the adoption of menstrual sponge.

Past examinations of sea sponges conducted under FDA revealed the presence of bacteria - Staphylococcus aureus which is responsible to cause toxic shock syndrome. Since then sea sponges that are labelled as menstrual sponges for use as menstrual tampons are required to get a premarket approval under the FDA Section 515. This has led to several manufacturers recalling their products. Further, owing to the risk of development of toxic shock syndrome, medical professionals do not prescribe the frequent use of menstrual sponges. Limited popularity, associated health risks and stringent FDA regulations are factors expected to impound the growth of the menstrual sponge market.

Ask For Customized Report @ https://www.factmr.com/connectus/sample?flag=RC&rep_id=449

Use of menstrual sponge remains a debatable subject for medical professionals, manufacturers, and regulatory authorities. While facing scrutiny by authorities, manufacturers have introduced reliable menstrual sponge products in the market. However, the steady popularity of sanitary pads and tampons is likely to confine adoption of menstrual sponge, further impacting the progress of the menstrual sponge market.

In many departments, there are only one or two faculty members and this has affected the academic performance of the students. Sources in the university said a circular by the University Grants Commission (UGC) over reservation pattern in the appointment of faculty members is the reason for the uncertainty. At present, 40 per cent of teaching positions are lying vacant at the KU.

For the past one-and-a-half year, no fresh appointments have been made in the varsity. Last year, the university had notified the job notification to fill 110 vacancies in various departments. However, the UGC guidelines insist fresh appointments should be made only after ensuring reservation criteria in each department. The varsity requested the reservation pattern by considering the whole university as a single unit rather than reservation in each department. Though the university approached the High court against UGC instructions, the UGC filed an appeal in the Supreme Court. In the fallout, a total number of 110 vacancies are yet to be filled and this has been affecting the whole performance of the varsity, sources said.

""We had already advertised for the posts and the process of filling up vacancies was almost done, but it had to be put on hold. But we cannot appoint new teachers because of the ongoing court case with regard to the UGC's circular on hiring reserved category candidates. The shortage of faculty members resulted in lowering of the grade of the university. National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) will also stop funding the varsity and it was one of the reasons for losing the Chancellor's Award,"" a former syndicate member said.

Recently, many colleges under KU lost their NAAC rankings and this made the university reconstitute the academic system, especially the research segment. Vice Chancellor, V P Mahadevan Pillai told Express the issue is a serious matter of concern and they could not make any appointments due to the stringent instructions of the UGC.

He admitted the UGC circular had put a dampener in the hiring process. ""On one side, the UGC has been instructing us to stop the recruitment and they cut down the funds to the varsity citing the shortage of faculty members on the other side. However, I have called on Higher Education Minister K T Jaleel and discussed the issue. I have also requested the government to create 50 new posts too. Hope the issue will be sorted out soon,"" Pillai said.

While as per official data only 100 of the 388 odd posts are said to be filled, the letter sent to a set of candidates on December 5 said all vacancies were filled.

This created confusion among thousands of aspirants who sat for the test in 2017. General candidates who scored 75 or above of a total 150 (50%) in the test were eligible for recruitment with a 40% to 45% cutoff for reserved community candidates. Accordingly, 92 candidates, who scored above the cutoff scores, were shortlisted and appointed chemistry teachers after verification of certificates.

Following this, six candidates approached the Madurai bench of the Madras high court stating that some answers in the key released by the TRB were incorrect.

The court later directed the TRB to include the six candidates to the selection process but clarified that its direction could not be treated as precedent to other candidates. But aspirants have continued to approach the court challenging the answer key released earlier.

One such candidate, M Lakshmi of Tiruvannamalai, who fell short of the cutoff score by one mark, approached the court in July. The court dismissed her plea, saying the TRB was at liberty to consider her representation if she was denied marks despite giving the right answer and provided there were vacancies.

Referring to both directions, the TRB sent a letter to Lakshmi in December stating that they finalised the selection for 2016-17 and all vacancies were filled. ""Only 100 odd seats were filled. There was no clarity on how TRB filled the remaining seats,"" said Prabu, Lakshmi's husband who had gone to inquire with the TRB.

On the other hand, candidates who could not meet the cutoff score despite being awarded marks after approaching the court received a letter from the TRB about being excluded in the selection procedure as they did not meet the cutoff. There was no mention about vacancies being filled in these letters.

When questioned about the discrepancy, S Jayanthi, chairperson, TRB, said, ""This (vacancies filled) was a typographical error by the clerical staff. The vacancies continue to exist and backlogs will be cleared after a fresh notification is issued."""

The fate of 70 mentally challenged students studying at the centre, some of whom are also physically disabled, hinges on how the Dr Zakir Hussain Memorial Welfare Society is able to make ends meet.

These students, aged between four and 18 years, belong to economically disadvantaged families whose meagre incomes come from pulling rickshaws, selling vegetables and fruits or working as domestic help.

The Dr Zakir Hussain Memorial Welfare Society has been managing its Child Guidance Centre (CGC) with the help of financial grants it receives under the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment's Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Rehabilitation Scheme. The crisis for the specialised school began when the ministry issued guidelines that from April 1, 2018, the salaries of the staff were to be increased two and a half times or more. This resulted in the annual expenditure on salaries going up from Rs 5.5 lakh to Rs 14 lakh.

""The yearly government funding on which CGC runs is retrospective, that is, the society has to meet all the expenses, including staff salaries, before it actually receives the grant from the social justice ministry,"" explained Baran Farooqi, general secretary of the society. ""This meant that when the ministry hiked the salaries of teachers employed on contract for the project, the society was forced to arrange almost double the amount it used to till 2017-18 in order to meet the incremental expenses.""

Perhaps even the additional finances could have been somehow managed. But discouragingly, the ministry has affected the working of the school by being erratic in the disbursal of grants. In fact CGC is still awaiting the second instalment of grants for 2015-16.

What also irks Farooqi is the whimsical manner in which the grants are disbursed. ""Reimbursements are either denied to us on arbitrary grounds or only a fraction of the stipulated amount is released,"" he pointed out. As an example, Farooqi reiterated the failure of the ministry to release the second instalment of grants for 2015-16.

The families of the students studying in CGC do not have the means to send them to any other school. Besides, here they can also get the specialised training required by their mentally challenged ward, such as IQ assessment, counselling, psychological assessment, physiotherapy and reading, writing and speech therapies. These and other measures could mean a world of difference in the way the children receive their education.

The society is more than 40 years old and runs several social service programmes other than this school. Jamia does assist it with space and other necessary infrastructural necessities, but CGC has to manage funds on its own."

Breathing life into architecture

At the 34th Coomaraswamy lecture organised by the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya on Monday, Pritzker Prize Laureate and eminent architect BV Doshi spoke to an audience of scholars, architects, historians and urban planners.

He highlighted the importance of having an element of flexibility in architecture and recalled how while he was working on the design of IIM Ahmedabad, several directors changed and his design had to be organic enough to absorb these changes. He also advised against creating spaces that don't allow us to live different seasons and experience nature. Words of wisdom for the city's rapidly changing streetscape.

The Godfather of food in India

Such is the power of British chef Marco Pierre White's steely gaze that even the best of the chefs would doubt their techniques. Fans of one of the most popular and widely followed chefs in the world will be delighted to know that White will arrive in Mumbai on January 19 and 20 as part of the gourmet food festival, World on Plate.

Fans will also get a chance to be a part of two masterclasses at Palladium in Lower Parel, and sneak in a chance to have a memorable photograph with the culinary maestro.

Gone too soon

As news of artist Tushar Joag's sudden death reached Mumbai, a pall of gloom descended over the city's art world. The well-known artist died of a massive heart attack. He was 52. ""A public intervention artist who politicises his art and attempts to aestheticise politics"", as Joag described himself, he lived most of his life in Mumbai before moving to Greater Noida where he established the department of art at the Shiv Nadar University with his wife Sharmila Samant.

A Bachelor of Fine Arts from Sir JJ School of Art, he completed his MFA from the MS University in Vadodara -- where years later, he withdrew from an international festival when the university allegedly faced attacks from right wing groups. Urban development, displacement and citizenship, and political satire were some of the key themes of his work, which included a 53-day motorcycle ride from Mumbai to Shanghai to highlight the appropriation of water from Tibetan lakes by the Chinese government.

He was also an advisor for the art education programme for children by Art1st, a Mumbai-based initiative. When this diarist reached out to Art1st founder Ritu Khoda, and poet and art crtic Ranjit Hoskote, both shared that they were too shocked by the news to comment.

A tell-all from the Sinhas

It began with The Paradoxical Prime Minister by Shashi Tharoor, but when it comes to literary attacks on the current government, this one is going to hit harder. Yashwant Sinha's book India Unmade: How the Modi Government Broke the Economy, co-written with mid-day columnist Aditya Sinha will be released later this week.

A known critic of the Prime Minister, the book by Sinha -- who was the Finance Minister of India from 1998 to 2002 -- speaks of why he feels the GDP numbers are misleading, how the RBI's autonomy is in danger, how there is no comparison between Narendra Modi and AB Vajpayee, and why demonetisation is a huge banking scam. Do we hear fireworks?

A dance for a cause

The city will witness a rather special dance performance on December 21. Dance, of course, is an art form that can truly encapsulate a sense of joi de verve. And that's why a group of four international dance teachers have been invited by the Magic Bus Foundation to teach ballet and hip-hop to around 30 underprivileged children from Thane and Kalwa.

Hailing from diverse countries such as the UK, US and Singapore, the teachers -- Kimberley Martin, Clare Tay, Nicola Ciotta and Kathie Tiffany -- have been holding workshops in the two genres, with the rehearsals culminating in a performance on Friday. The entire process is being supervised by Andy Martin, a teacher who works with children who have special needs. All in all, it seems that this is one Christmas that the children will remember forever."

While rooting out such illegal schools is something governments have to do on a war footing, the condition of some state-run schools in the city is no better. Buildings with roofs partially caved in, cracks running across walls, leaking ceilings, broken urinals in washrooms and crumbling walls are what several government schools serve to the hundreds of students who turn up for classes every day. District elementary education officer Prem Lata Yadav, when asked about the state of infrastructure of government-run schools in the city, said, ""The reason behind the poor condition of school buildings is lack of funds. We've written to the education department to look into the issue.""

Government Senior Secondary School , Islampur

Concrete chunks can be seen falling off the ceiling, with cracks running across the walls, at GSSS Islampur. The building has 15 rooms with 550 students in classes VI-XI. Washrooms were stinking, there were no faucets and urinals were broken. The school principal accept the condition of the school's infrastructure is not good. ""A proposal to rebuild the school building has been placed before the authorities. This building will be brought down soon. MCG officials have taken measurements for the new construction a few months ago,"" said Kanwal Nain, principal. ""This building is small, old, and built on low land, because of which, at times, water accumulates at the entrance,"" he added.

Government Primary School, Satlaka

The 46 students of GPS Satlaka have to brace a school building falling apart at its seams. There are five classrooms, but all classes take place in only one, as the condition of the rest is terrible. ""One can spot cow dung on the floors, broken benches, blackboards and doors. Across the building, the seepage is so heavy that during monsoons this year, the roof of one classroom collapsed,"" said Virender Singh, guest teacher.

TOI also spotted dogs roaming in the classrooms. ""This entire building is unsafe and unfit for tiny tots. Since there is no guard, cows wander in and take shelter inside at night. I'm not paid to clean up the dung,"" said Rahisa, the school's sole sanitation staff. Since the building was constructed in 1972, no teacher has spent more than a year in this school.

Shivji Park Primary School

Shivji Park Primary School doesn't even have its own building. It operates out of Government Senior Secondary School Kadipur, whose classrooms are in a shambles. ""Students are forced to sit in the school hallway or even in the open, as none of the eight classrooms we've been allotted are usable,"" said head teacher Satpal. Even teachers of the Kadipur school are unaware when the crumbling walls were last repaired.

Govt Primary School, Kadipur

One look at the building of GPS Kadipur is enough to tll you that a disaster is waiting to happen. ""There are 180 students in this school. Every now and then, chunks of plaster fall off, making it dangerous for them. The old building has been declared a threat, and a new building is being constructed. Unfortunately, construction work stopped six months ago,"" said a teacher, requesting anonymity.

They must balance school work with household chores; care for younger siblings; deal with parents' who want them to drop-out of school and get married.(Getty Images)

The physical and emotional well-being of India's adolescents (10-19 years) needs urgent attention. India has 243 million adolescents, which is 21% of the entire population. There are only 920 girls for every 1,000 boys and these 8% of 'missing' girls are emblematic of the bias against the girl child that prevails in many parts of India. Nationally, more than 50% of women are anaemic, and 23% have low body mass index, issues that have their roots in adolescence. All data cited is from recent government sources, unless specified. Lack of knowledge about menstrual hygiene also contributes to adolescent health problems.

Younger teenage girls I meet through my work with the Antara Foundation in the villages of Rajasthan, speak animatedly of stepping out from the village, going to college, becoming teachers or joining government services. However, these girls also deal with pressures at home. They must balance school work with household chores; care for younger siblings; deal with parents who want them to drop out of school and get married. They have few opportunities to cultivate friendships. With these kinds of pressures, life can be intolerable, and suicide emerges as the leading cause of death among adolescents (The Lancet).

There is no reason why this tragedy should happen. The most obvious remedy is to delay the age of marriage. Almost 27% of girls in India are married before they turn 18, and that figure is as high as 35-40% in states like Bihar, Rajasthan and West Bengal. India has the maximum number of adolescent pregnancies in the world, resulting in malnourishment of both mother and child. A married child also faces more marital violence. State governments can do a lot, and West Bengal's Kanyashree Prakalpa, to prevent early marriage, is a good example. Through it, there are awareness programmes in school, and parents get a financial incentive for delaying their child's marriage by a few years.

The second step is keeping girls in school. School education broadens horizons, inculcates health-seeking behaviour, and provides opportunities for peer interaction. In India, 32% of adolescent girls do not attend secondary school (ASER). Long distances and lack of safe transport are key reasons. Bihar came up with a popular and effective solution -- giving away cycles to young girls. There was an increase in the enrolment of girl students in class nine, from 1.5 lakh to over eight lakh. Improved education levels result in increase in the age of marriage -- and there is no better example than Kerala, with a women's literacy rate of 97.9% and early marriage prevalence at 7.6%

The onset of menstruation with puberty is a major reason why adolescent girls miss school days. Those five days of each month become an ordeal because girls have no ready access to sanitary napkins. States such as Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh have introduced wonderful programmes to provide sanitary napkins in government schools, as one step towards keeping girls in school. The Hindi movie Padman (2018) contributed in its own way to normalising safe menstrual hygiene. In some schools, boys are being educated about menstruation, developing a heathy respect for women at an early age.

There is also a near term solution: involve girls in community activities. Some states have introduced sports programmes for girls, to provide a boost to self-esteem and assuage feelings of loneliness. In Rajasthan, my foundation is involving adolescent girls as health mobilisers in their local mohallas. Adolescent girls' involvement in community kitchens in Peru has been instrumental in combatting malnutrition, and empowering women.

National programmes directed at the well-being of the adolescent are essential. The Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK) is a great example, with innovative elements such as peer educators, dedicated adolescent health days and sex education. The Weekly Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation (WIFS) introduced in 2012, provides iron and folic acid supplements to over 100 million adolescent girls and boys, through schools and Anganwadi centres. Such programmes and many more are required to assist the adolescent girls of India through their transitional period with care so that they have a happy and healthy future.

Good steps are being taken, but in pockets. The situation calls for a concerted national campaign, like Swachh Bharat. It is time we all got involved: parents, schools, media, and donors. Give our girls the chance to dream!"

The education department is aware of the state of affairs but is yet to replace the sheds housing primary and pre-primary students with a proper building. The remaining classes do run in buildings but lack the space to accommodate these students.

There are eight rooms under the shed in Hallomajra. These include all sections of Classes VI, VIIA and VIIIA. In the evening, all sections of Class I are also conducted under the roof.

In Hallomajra, one class is held in the midday meal room. The block under the tin roof is located on a separate premises. A rickety fence passes off for a boundary wall, leaving students vulnerable to insects and snakes.

The traditional Kashmiri pheran (the loose gown worn during winters) is at the heart of a controversy in Kashmir valley after the education department in Langate banned the dress in its offices.

Leading the campaign against the pheran ban is National Conference vice-president and former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah, who has started a campaign on Twitter to revoke the ban. Drawing flak, the education department withdrew the order in a bid to calm tempers.

The controversy started when the zonal education officer of Langate issued a circular banning pheran, traditional trousers and sleeper/plastic shoes in his office.

""All officials visiting the office are advised to visit in proper dress code during any official visit. It is recommended that no official will visit this office wearing pheran, traditional trousers and sleeper/plastic shoes,"" read the circular.

The issue snowballed into a major controversy with people taking to social media calling it an assault on the Kashmiri culture. ""My father and I have worn pherans to official functions many times over the years and will continue to do so, silly government orders notwithstanding,"" Omar tweeted, with hashtags #dontbanourpheran and #revokepheranban.

People posted pictures wearing the pheran on Twitter to register their protest and oppose the ban. Omar too posted his and his father's pictures, wearing the pheran during functions.

""I fail to understand why pherans should be banned! This is a regressive order that makes no sense at all. Pherans are a very practical way of keeping warm during the cold winter, aside from being part of our identity. This order should be withdrawn,"" Omar said.

Under fire, the education department on Tuesday withdrew the order in a bid to put an end to the raging controversy. ""Teachers were coming to the office wearing sleepers and trousers. He the (zonal education officer) had reprimanded them not to do so. Then he issued an order in which he also included the pheran. Since pheran is our cultural dress, we have withdrawn the order,"" Mohommad Shafi War, chief education officer, Kupwara, told DNA.

Officials said the directions were issued with an aim to maintain office decorum and discipline. ""Since the pheran ban became an issue, we withdrew the order completely,"" said War.

Pheran is a traditional dress of Kashmir and both men and women take pride in donning it. Older Kashmiri women wear it throughout the year while men prefer to wear it during winters to keep warm.

People also use a 'kangri' (traditional fire pot) under the pheran to keep themselves warm. In 2014, the Army had to withdraw its advisory urging journalists not to wear pheran while visiting its Corps Headquarters."

We pick up here with her answer.

""Well ... by then it would be cold enough outside to do it. You have to work at that when it's cold.""

And, like Times News reader Ann Reyes who'd first told me about killing hogs on Thanksgiving, the Hunts didn't have turkey dinner. Phyllis' memories of the day are of biscuits and just-made sausage. And all the work. Everyone pitched in. They did sell much of the end result, but they also canned sausage and tenderloin for later use.

""Gravy and biscuits made from tenderloin is the best thing you will ever put in your mouth,"" Phyllis said.

The next day, gathered around my sister's (Pamela) and brother-in-law's (Larry Fagans) dining table in Knoxville for Thanksgiving, I heard almost the same sentence.

""Pork tenderloin makes the absolute best gravy,"" Larry said.

After dinner, Mom filled me in on what she'd learned by calling various relatives.

My cousin Joyce (Wallen) Ryans said her parents, Jack and Leona, killed hogs on Thanksgiving and my uncles Carson Lawson, Lon Wallen and Mitchell Wallen would come help Uncle Jack outside while my aunt Ova Wallen helped Leona get the sausage made, cooked and canned.

Mom said her own father usually raised and killed three hogs each year, but she doesn't remember it being Thanksgiving. She does remember the fresh and canned tenderloin.

Cousin Gary Wallen, who gave Mom the canned tenderloin recently, and his four siblings have holiday memories of canned tenderloin, but not at Thankgiving. Gary's brother Richard and sister Kathy Walton live near him in Sullivan Gardens and they all three garden and can a lot. Richard told me a while back they buy tenderloin in the grocery store and can it. Kathy says its a great go-to item for your pantry because of its versatility. It can be fried, or slow roasted with vegetables, or shredded and made into barbecue.

Richard said one of their childhood memories is that on Christmas Eve each year his mother Gracie (Tankersley) Wallen would open canned tenderloin and they'd have tenderloin sandwiches for dinner.

Of all the relatives I'd asked about hog-killing and Thanksgiving by that point, I was most surprised to have had Larry chime in that it was among his childhood memories. He grew up in Fort Robinson in Kingsport, not on a farm. What I'd never known was his mother's brother and sister-in-law, Elmer and Annabelle Jeter, had owned a farm in Nickelsville. Larry's parents, Lawrence and Lena Mae would partner with Elmer and Annabelle each year on a few pigs. And Thanksgiving was hog-killing time.

Larry said that lasted until he was nine or 10 years old and he can remember there being snow on the ground in Nickelsville on some of those Thanksgiving mornings. Like everyone I talked to who had the hog-killing day experience, Larry began casually sharing some parts in great detail. We all asked him to stop, please.

Like Ann, who'd started me on this quest, Larry said it was a work day that didn't include ""traditional"" Thanksgiving food. But I guess what I learned from all this is that it did. It's just a tradition I didn't know about. I'm glad I've never had to help kill a hog. But I feel like I discovered a bit of regional and family history. I'm glad. And sort of feel like I missed something

Since ""Part I"" published last week, I've gotten a lot of feedback from readers. Several of them commented that Thanksgiving was a good day to start the annual chore because children (and teachers) were out of school Thursday and Friday and with Saturday thrown in that gave plenty of time to complete the process. I'm going to share more memories from readers next week.

Envisioned to be an extension of the Happiness Curriculum, Education Minister Manish Sisodia Tuesday announced that 'Entrepreneurship Curriculum' will be launched in the upcoming academic year for secondary and senior secondary students in the city's government schools. The aim is to create an ""entrepreneurial mindset"" in young people so they become ""job creators"" and not ""job seekers.""

The Happiness Curriculum was launched in July for students from nursery to Class VIII, to encourage mental well-being and ""human-centric education"".

During the first convocation of Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women on Tuesday, Sisodia announced that entrepreneurship classes will be held for one period of every school day for classes IX-XII. He said: ""We train all our focus on preparing for jobs -- this is a discourse we need to change. In convocations, we should celebrate people who did not accept big jobs and decided to do something that will generate jobs.""

The need for institutions to produce graduates who will generate jobs had earlier been raised by Sisodia at the convocation of Delhi Technological University last week, where he had called the act of generating jobs ""nationalist."" Speaking to The Indian Express, he said: ""Our schools only teach students to transfer pre-learnt knowledge, and not to think out of the box. Young people are afraid of being wrong, they have a fear of failure because of which they seek the security of a job. This needs to be done away with. That is one of the primary focus areas of the curriculum.""

The curriculum will not be a skill-based programme and will include components like ""personality and communication development"" and ""professionally inspiring stories"". Its framework is being charted, said officials.

Sisodia added that he has informally identified a team from the education department -- which he will formally select within a week. Inputs from domain experts will also be incorporated, Sisodia said.

""Models of entrepreneurship training already exist but they are not for children and are concentrated into shorter periods like two months. I want to extend these over a period of four years by weaving them into our school pedagogy to reshape their orientation and encourage innovation,"" said Sisodia. These classes are to be conducted by government school teachers themselves, for which they will receive training, said officials."

""Such incidents will further add fuel to our agitation as the State government is non-responsive towards our problems. They will have to take initiative to find a way out to end the deadlock as we are always open for talks,"" said Prasad.

What one couldn't have missed was the way they handled their roles with a professional touch. It was nothing, but a dedicated show to come out with quality educational videos.

Educational videos are an attempt by the State Council of Education Research and Training (SCERT) to make classes more exciting with innovative teaching methodologies. A team of 40 school teachers from across the state have been deployed for the project and they have made about 3,000 videos on various subjects so far.

One of the students, who participated in a shooting in the city recently, said making of educational videos was itself a joyful experience. Just imagine what could be in store for fellow students, who would learn by watching these videos.

""I was scared at first. But during and after the shooting, I was very happy. My parents, teachers and friends have watched my videos in smart phones and appreciated me,"" said Kiruba S, a student who acted in one of the videos.

""Ten students from our school have participated in the shooting of a Tamil poem. The video was completed in a day. This is a digital warm up for our children. The videos give the children an opportunity to see things and learn. For example, there is a chapter about sea turtles in English. Showing videos of them would be the best experience for the students than showing them pictures,"" said A Saravanaselvi, teacher with a panchayat union middle school at Kinathukadavu block, Dasanayakenpalayam.

Another primary class teacher with the CCMA government high school said even parents were happy with the initiative. ""Little children are more attracted to the background music and are happy to learn from the videos. Seven girls from our school have attended the shooting. Parents are overjoyed,'' said Uma Rani S, assistant head master of the school.

The State Council of Education Research and Training has provided QR codes in the textbooks. Once the QR code is scanned using a mobile phone, the video links will open, allowing teachers to help students see and learn. Approximately 2,500 videos have been linked to QR codes for textbooks of Classes I, VI, IX and XI, and the remaining videos are at the editing stage.

Making of videos for the third term is under way and the process is expected to be completed by December-end.

"506","1021578409","2018-12-18","https://telanganatoday.com/elevate-education-in-telangana","Elevate education in Telangana","Telangana Today",FALSE,"The basic requirement for good administration is good manpower, and good manpower can only result from good education. Good education is in turn dependent on good teachers and good teachers blossom when we have a good rule and a good ruler.

It goes without saying that good education develops a person's personality and makes him a good citizen. A good citizen is one who has good professional values and skills, is creative, productive, innovative, inquisitive, is enlightened and egalitarian, a person of foresight, etc.

Who then is a good teacher? A good teacher is the one who has chosen education as a profession, not as the last resort but as the first; has adequate and appropriate knowledge of the subjects s/he is supposed to teach; has very good communication skills; is inter-disciplinary in approach to teaching; relates teaching to ground realities; is good humoured and emotionally attuned to what s/he teaches which is not only in textual and examination-oriented manner; is ethical in attitude and approach to teaching; has clarity of thought; knows how to make teaching not just skills-oriented but also values-oriented; and keeps the objectives of education as making a student a good human being, a good professional, a good citizen and a good role model.

Better Teaching

How well a State is administered or ruled is judged on the basis of the education system it has. We have to judge our education system by applying these criteria of good education and good teacher. Good teachers are needed not only to teach at the primary level but also at all other levels of education. Needs, objectives and goals remain the same but each higher level education needs higher standard of education. The basic need of good education is good teacher at all levels of education and in all fields. While many other facilities are also necessary for good education, it is the good teacher who is the pivot and makes all the difference.

The role of a teacher earlier was much more difficult than it is today as earlier s/he had to be all by herself. It was just a book, slate, map and chalk most of the times. Today there are many technologies, books and teaching material. However, a teacher needs to make use of these aids and for that she has be a good learner herself as the knowledge is not just vast but is also growing fast. S/he has to be efficient as well as an effective learner.

Multiple Learning

Today, both the learner and the teacher are operating in a highly competitive world where one competes with not only the local but also with the global and, therefore, s/he has to be globally competitive, and not merely matching with the locals locally.

Today's learner is more intelligent and well exposed right from childhood as s/he lives in a rich environment of technologies and cultures. That is an advantage as well as a disadvantage to a teacher of today. S/he faces a bigger challenge of teaching a higher and a superior student. S/he has to have more experience and exposure and be more advanced in skills and values to match her students.

The curricula today are not local like that of yesteryears but are rather global. That makes the task of the teacher much more difficult, thereby requiring more commitment, conviction, hard work, discipline and determination. Though these apply to all other fields and professions, education is the basic input for all other fields and professions and, therefore, has to be the best.

Where Are We?

So, how do we judge whether what is needed in the field of education is happening in Telangana? For that, let us ask if a citizen is playing the role of a citizen well; a professional is playing the role of a professional well; a politician is playing the role of a politician well; whether the rule of law is being observed well; corruption and honesty are less or more; democracy is in practice and not just in theory.

Moreover, does the education and skills required for jobs match those being offered in our educational institutions?

Reasonable Assessment

There are several other ethical moral and cultural criteria by which we can come to a reasonable assessment of whether what is happening in the field of education in Telangana, and on account of that in other fields, is satisfactory.

If we want a better administered State, we have to set right our education system first before all others, as it is the field of education that provides manpower for all other fields and if that is not set right according to the objectives of good education as aforesaid, all others would default and go wrong, cumulatively.

The weakest sides of the education system in Telangana are the systems of recognition and affiliation of institutions, of selection and promotion of staff and of monitoring, inspecting and evaluating the institutions. The government has to address these issues.

But improvements cannot happen all of a sudden. So, improving our education system needs to be accorded high priority and taken up in a phased manner."

Schools in Tuneri grama panchayat in Kozhikode will soon say goodbye to ballpoint pens. The panchayat claims to be the first local body in the State to introduce paper pens in schools. A paper pen carrying a seed at its rear end can be sown to make it grow into a tree.

The administrative committee of the panchayat approved the project on Tuesday.

""We are trying to implement green protocol in all government institutions in the panchayat. The project is part of it,"" said panchayt president Valappil Kunhammad.

Thirteen government/aided L.P. schools, two U.P. schools and one high school in the panchayat will be brought under the project in the first phase.

The Ministry of Women and Child Development has placed the draft policy on its website and invited comments from stakeholders until January 4. This will be the first policy dedicated to the protection of children, an area that until now was only a part of the broader National Child Policy, 2013.

The Supreme Court had earlier directed the CBI to investigate allegations involving 17 shelter homes for children, destitute women, beggars and senior citizens in Bihar following the case of sexual abuse of more than 30 girls in a shelter home in Muzaffarpur in the State. The apex court had also asked the Centre to consider framing a national policy on protection of children.

As per the draft, the policy will apply to ""all institutions, and organisations (including corporate and media houses), government or private sector"".

The draft policy recommends that all organisations must have a code of conduct based on ""zero tolerance of child abuse and exploitation"". It requires organisations to lay down that employees don't use language or behaviour that is ""inappropriate, harassing, abusive, sexually provocative, demeaning or culturally inappropriate"".

Institutions should also designate a staff member to ensure that procedures are in place to ensure the protection of children as well as to report any abuse. Any individual who suspects physical, sexual or emotional abuse must report it to the helpline number 1098, police or a child welfare committee.

Unlike the National Child Policy, 2013, the latest document doesn't talk about children who may need additional special protection measures: including those affected by migration, communal or sectarian violence, children forced into begging or in conflict with the law, and those infected with HIV/AIDS. It also doesn't talk about the role of the state for ensuring the protection of child rights or addressing local grievances.

""We welcome the decision to bring a national policy, but its subsequent versions will need to go into a greater detail,"" said Priti Mahara, Director (Policy, Advocacy and Research) CRY. ""The document needs to define what child protection is as well as what it means by institutions or organisations.""

Ms. Mahara added that the norms should be designed in such a way that organisations can customise their policies according to the nature of their work, thereby, giving them a sense of ownership on safeguarding children's rights.

""A policy has four aspects -- creating awareness, prevention, reporting and responding,"" said Prabhat Kumar, Technical Advisor, Child Protection, Save The Children. ""This document needs to go into all these aspects, especially a reporting structure involving various nodal bodies and a monitoring mechanism for implementation of the guidelines. Moreover, while it talks about organisations laying down a code of conduct, it doesn't explain what is acceptable behaviour such as conduct of teachers in schools,"" he observed.

Mr. Kumar suggested that the government could use the opportunity to go beyond the role of institutions and look at the role of individuals. ""Perhaps the government could look at ensuring that all officials in public service give an undertaking that they will not exploit children,"" Mr. Kumar said."

In an advisory Tuesday, Surgeon General Jerome Adams said parents, teachers, health professionals and government officials must take ""aggressive steps"" to keep children from using e-cigarettes. Federal law bars the sale of e-cigarettes to those under 18.

For young people, ""nicotine is dangerous and it can have negative health effects,"" Adams said in an interview. ""It can impact learning, attention and memory, and it can prime the youth brain for addiction.""

Federal officials are scrambling to reverse a recent explosion in teen vaping that public health officials fear could undermine decades of declines in tobacco use.

An estimated 3.6 million US teens are now using e-cigarettes, representing 1 in 5 high school students and 1 in 20 middle schoolers, according to the latest federal figures.

Separate survey results released Monday showed twice as many high school students used e-cigarettes this year compared to last year.

E-cigarettes and other vaping devices have been sold in the U.S. since 2007, growing into a USD 6.6 billion business. Most devices heat a flavored nicotine solution into an inhalable vapour.

They have been pitched to adult smokers as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes, though there's been little research on the long-term health effects or on whether they help people quit. Even more worrisome, a growing body of research suggests that teens who vape are more likely to try regular cigarettes.

Adams singled out Silicon Valley startup Juul. The company leapfrogged over its larger competitors with online promotions portraying their small device as the latest high-tech gadget for hip, attractive young people. Analysts now estimate the company controls more than 75 per cent of the US e-cigarette market.

The surgeon general's advisory notes that each Juul cartridge, or pod, contains as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes. Additionally, Adams states that Juul's liquid nicotine mixture is specially formulated to give a smoother, more potent nicotine buzz. That effect poses special risks for young people, Adams says.

""We do know that these newer products, such as Juul, can promote dependence in just a few uses,"" Adams said.

Juul said in a statement that it shares the surgeon general's goal: ""We are committed to preventing youth access of Juul products.""

Adams recommends parents, teachers and health professionals learn about e-cigarettes, talk to children about the risks and set an example by not using tobacco products.

He also described Kashmere Gate as an ""incubation centre"" for universities, saying it is a coincidence that several varsities, which were based in the area, are now moving to bigger campuses.

""We had launched the 'happiness curriculum' in government schools. Now we will launch the entrepreneurship curriculum from the next session onwards for secondary and senior secondary students.

""We need to instill confidence among our children in school right from the beginning of secondary education that after completing their education, they should aspire to be job givers and not job seekers,"" Sisodia said.

He explained that after at least 15 years of formal education, if a large number of the youth are not confident of creating something new, which can give them gainful return and add value to the economy, then as a society ""we are failing to nurture their full potential"".

Sisodia said, barring a few exceptions, once a child completes elementary schooling and joins the secondary classes, his entire orientation, which is largely shaped by the teachers and parents, is to secure good marks in exams, get admission in a good college and get a job with decent pay package.

This is considered a trajectory of success and anyone who either secures less marks or fails to join college or fails to secure a job is deemed as unsuccessful, he said.

""This trajectory is obsolete in today's day and age when new ideas and technologies are driving our way of life. If our schools and colleges continue to churn out batches of students who are going to join the queue with the mindset of job seekers we will soon be left with very small number of job givers,"" Sisodia said.

He said the entrepreneurship curriculum will be for students of classes 9 to 12 with the vision that every child should have the confidence of being creator rather than just being a consumer.

""The curriculum shall be based on a four-fold framework-- inspire through stories and case studies of entrepreneurial journeys, educate through self designed micro research, involve through local community and facilitate by supporting in developing ideas into projects,"" said Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio.

To take this idea forward, he has directed the secretary education to set up a high-powered working group having senior faculties from SCERT/DIET, school principals and individuals having domain expertise as members.

""SCERT Delhi will organise a conference in January where it will invite organisations and individuals to present their ideas for the design of the entrepreneurship curriculum as per the framework of the government to a working group.

""Based on the inputs received, the pilot curriculum shall be rolled out from April 2019 onwards,"" Sisodia said.

He said they will try and ensure they take it to private schools as well.

It is for the same reason that people in the prosperous states of India should worry about the huge gap that exists between them and the poorer states, and think of it as their own problem to solve.

The living standard of a person in Gujarat has risen to the tune of over Rs 55,500 since 2011-12, the highest increase among all major states in India. In stark contrast, the improvement in the standard of living for an average person in Bihar over the same period was worth less than Rs 7,000. In fact, just the incremental real income per person in five Southern states -- Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Telangana and Karnataka and the states of Maharashtra, Haryana and Gujarat over this period was higher than the level of real income itself in Bihar in 2017-18.

These numbers understate the real improvement in lives of people residing in poorer states where families receive remittances from close relatives working in other parts of India or abroad. Nonetheless, they can be taken to represent the potential of a state to generate growth and prosperity.

There are some worries among India's prosperous states as well. The economic decline of Tamil Nadu stands out -- it had the second-highest per person income among the five Southern states in 2011-12 and now it has fallen to the fourth spot. While Maharashtra and Gujarat continue to do well, the within-state inequality of income in these states is well known. So what is the mantra for a sustainable long-term growth? And how can growth be made inclusive?

First, invest in people. Second, invest in infrastructure and urban design. Third, encourage scaling up of firms. And fourth, dare one suggest, a radical step of eliminating the in-built permanent job tenure for all government jobs making them linked to employee performance.

People and their skill-level hold the key for prosperity. Given that there is a shortage of teachers, computer-aided education can partly be used to improve the quality of schooling. Our current education system amplifies inequality by offering a small proportion of lucky and relatively well-off kids a world class-level of education, with the majority receiving a dismal quality of schooling.

Investing in infrastructure pays a large growth dividend is something that is known. But, as India upgrades its infrastructure and builds new cities, its important to learn from the Gurgaon experience. While entrepreneurs will build world-class campuses, they would not build sewage systems and roads outside their premises, and rightly so.

It is then the job for the city corporation to assign in advance spaces for all civic facilities, even if they are not built right away, as the Nobel Prize winner Paul Romer emphasizes. Once a city or a town comes up randomly, it can't be bulldozed and one has to settle permanently for a sub-optimal solution.

Would education and infrastructure on their own lead to job creation, India's number One problem, given its millions of working age population? Not really. To give us fighting chance to resolve this issue, we need to enable scaling up of firms. While India has never lacked entrepreneurship, we still have relatively few large firms which can compete on a global scale.

While the small and medium enterprises will remain a key fabric of the society, they thrive when they can supply their goods and services to large firms. The scaling up requires efficient organization and management skills, process developments, efficient legal and dispute resolution systems so on.

Finally, inclusive growth depends on the strength of countries, institutions including its public delivery systems. Restructuring institutions and bringing out a cultural shift in a service attitude is a very slow painstaking process and requires subsequent governments to stick to it. Can the alternative be abolishing a life-time job tenure for public sector employees and moving to a performance-linked system as in the private sector?

Non-permanent jobs do not mean temporary or casual jobs. They would be payroll jobs with all benefits provided, similar to any service industry in the private sector, as long as an employee remains productive. It would nearly instantly lower corruption and raise the standard of service delivery. This is a radical step which is nearly impossible to implement in reality, but radical ideas are the need of the moment. One never knows which idea will work!

Even if we take all the above measures, be prepared for two things. First, more internal migration as millions of young people in poorer states continue to look for better opportunities elsewhere. Second, public policies will inevitably require some redistribution of resources from rich to poor given that we cannot create the millions of jobs that are required.

If India is to prosper, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are among the key states that need to raise their game. But no other parts of India seem to care. But we should, all of us should, if what we want is sustainable and inclusive growth for India.

Tripura government has imposed a set of restrictions on the creation of new government jobs and advised abolition of vacant posts, in case new posts are created.

A memorandum issued by the Finance Department on Monday stated that Tripura already has the highest level of government employment in the country, in proportion to its population.

Tripura has roughly 200,000 government employees, including 60,000 pensioners. The estimated population of the state is 4,000,000.

""The need for this provision arises due to the fact that salaries and wages constitute the largest item of expenditure and it is absolutely necessary to exercise financial prudence and discipline while committing expenditure under these heads.

""Hence, whenever a department submits a proposal for post creation, it should be accompanied by a proposal for surrender/abolition of posts with equivalent financial implications, the memorandum signed by Chief Secretary L K Gupta, who also holds the Finance portfolio, said.

Restrictions were imposed on filling up of vacant posts saying all government departments must ensure that no process of filling up vacant posts is initiated without prior concurrence of the Finance Department and violation of the newly laid out plans would invite disciplinary action against concerned officers, it said.

""Some departments have a wrong notion that the Finance Department has unlimited funds for salaries and wages and that it is their entitlement to fill up all the vacant posts and create new ones. This is not the case,"" the memo said.

The Department of School Education has violated these instructions and was asked to explain their action.

Earlier this year, the department announced recruitment in over 14,000 teaching positions to fill up vacancies, that were to be created by the retirement of 10,323 school teachers, who were terminated by the Supreme Court in 2017.

As per the new rules, the Finance Department would monitor expenditure on salary and wages by each department on a monthly basis and impose cuts from non-salary budget for departments which exceed their approved funds.

The government school in her home town, Chopasni village, can now give competition to city schools after it was upgraded with help from donors. Chanchal and her elder sister Pratibha study in the village school now.

Several people from the village who shifted to Jodhpur city just to provide better education to their wards have returned to the village. Some private schools in the area have shut down due to shortage of students, say villagers. The Chopasni Government School is getting students from nearby villages, too, said block education officer Manohar Singh.

The school's transformation began in 2015 when an alumnus, Himmat Singh Ratnoo, became its principal. The school has recorded 100% results since then. The school has a projector room, computer labs, CCTV cameras, library and RO water facility.

""My first aim was to bring the children out of the inferiority complex of studying in a government school. Along with the villagers, I wrote a letter to ONGC and HPCL requesting help to construct two separate toilets for girls and boys as part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR). The school thus got two toilets that cost Rs 3.5 lakh each,"" said Ratnoo.

""Several girls who dropped out after a certain age due to lack of toilet facilities in school returned to study here,"" said Tima Ram Dhandhu, a villager.

""The next step was ensuring sufficient number of teachers. At present, there are 17 teachers in the school. I contacted several philanthropists and wrote letters to many others requesting financial assistance. The Rotary Club donated a projector and we raised over Rs 4 lakh to construct gated boundary walls and a prayer ground. Several others, including the village panchayat, contributed to construct classrooms in the school and install CCTV cameras,"" said Ratnoo.

Jay Narayan Gehlot, sarpanch of Chopasni village, said that the entire village made it a vision to give a good school to the children of the village. ""Having a school like this in a village like ours where the health facilities could not reach is an achievement. The entire village made it a vision to get better education facilities for our children. The panchayat collected money to make four new rooms in the school,"" said Gehlot.

Suresh Ratnoo, panchayat shayak, said he went door-to-door along with the teachers of the school explaining the developments in the school to the villages and motivating children, especially girls, to join the school. ""We told the people that the school has better education facilities and toilets. Now the number of girls and boys who study in the school is almost the same. From a single village we managed to bring 50-60 new students to join the school, ""said Suresh.

Sarla Ratnoo, a student of class 12, said: ""I can dream big now as I can continue with my education. Had the school been far away or without facilities, it would not have been possible.""

The school has a strength of more than 350 students and provides Identity cards and uniforms. ""CCTV cameras have been installed in the classes. The teachers and I keep watch over every activity in the school. We keep organising sports and other extra-curricular activities from time to time to give boost students' exposure,"" said the proud principal."

The event is being organised to make students understand the importance of agriculture as farmers are moving away from agriculture.

She explained to the students that they would understand the real picture and the difficulty of agriculture only if they get into farms. She was accompanied by farmers, labours and teachers.

""Farmers should not commit suicide under any circumstances. The government has introduced various schemes to protect the farmers. Support price of Rs 1,850 has been announced for paddy. Middlemen should be avoided so that the farmers are benefitted,"" she said.

""Agriculture should be introduced in high school syllabus. I had advocated the same when I was the president of zilla panchayat. Students have no knowledge about paddy cultivation.

When Adith AK packed his bags and left for Majuli, an island in the Brahmaputra river in Assam, in 2017, he did not imagine that he would end up staying there a whole year. ""My backpack had clothes to last me a week; I planned on staying only that long, just having a look around,"" he said.

But something there compelled him to stay put. Back in Chennai for a story recital for Tulika Books, he narrated the reason why.

Before moving to Majuli, Adith wore many hats: storyteller, performer, theatre artiste and dancer. After working with him on a dance video, his friend's friend introduced him to Bipin Dhane, founder of the Ayang trust that runs the Hummingbird School, in rural Majuli -- a primary school providing education to around 250 students.

""Bipin asked me to come and teach whatever I could there, but I did not want to take part in the academics. I wanted to teach kids through theatre or dance. Thankfully, Bipin agreed,"" he said. The Hummingbird, he added, gives tribal communities the relevant education. Books by education boards have lessons that they can't relate to, he said.

For his part, Adith works on teaching children movement. ""I work with teachers on their students' balance, proper hand-eye coordination, especially for younger children who are still working on their fine motor skills,"" he said.

He also trains them in teaching basic subjects through role play. ""For example, we were teaching a group of students about the digestive system. So we divided them into sections and had each of them play a different organ, in rotation. Or say, if you want to do simple addition or subtraction, you role-play as shopkeepers and customers. This helps with memory retention.""

Though he wanted to concentrate on theatre and dance, he also ended up taking charge of administrative work such as fund raising, building libraries and more. ""We collected bamboo and with the help of the locals, built a stage to hold plays,"" he said. He now works with 16 Government schools in the district. He helps teachers integrate theatre into teaching practices.

Life in Majuli, which became the first island to be made a district in India, in 2016, can be slow. The tribal communities form most of the population, and agriculture is the main source of economy. The area has pockets of forests.

Said Adith, ""I was scared I would get bored of the slow lifestyle there. But after a year there, I have realised how kind the people are, and how sustainable the lifestyle there is. I have so much more to learn, I am not coming back anytime soon."""

Muskan flung her quilt and clambered out of her bed. As she peeked through the half-open window to see what was going on, she fell on the ground and screamed, ""Mummy me kya gov"" (What happened to me, Mummy?).

On hearing the piercing shrieks of her daughter, 45-year-old Yasmeena Banu who was preparing morning tea, rushed to the room. Muskan was lying on the floor. She was bleeding profusely. A bullet had hit the right side of Muskan's head.

Muskan Succumbs to Her Injuries

Yasmeena grabbed her own hair in distress and hurriedly descended the stairs to inform her family. ""Muskan janas aaw fire (Muskan was hit by a bullet),"" Yasmeena screamed. Everyone in the family gathered and rushed Muskan to the district hospital in Anantnag, where doctors referred her to Shri Maharaja Hari Singh (SMHS) hospital, Srinagar.

Muskan was injured when there was an exchange of gunfire, only 600 metres from her home, between militants and government forces. According to eyewitnesses, the firing lasted for only 5 minutes.

""It all happened within minutes. We don't know who fired on whom,"" said Ghulam Nabi Wani, Muskan's father.

Inside the ambulance Muskan was repeatedly asking for water. Her injury was itching. She wanted to scratch it. ""The wound was hurting her. She also wanted to drink water, but doctors had given us precautions,"" said Yaseema. ""Near Pampore, before Muskan went into a coma, she murmured Kalima.""

Doctors at SMHS put Muskan on the ventilator. Her family members including Nabi and Yasmeena were wringing their hands in despair, pacing frantically across the hospital corridor. Muskan died within that night. The doctors informed the family the following day, that Muskan had succumbed to her injuries.

Life After Death

""We were praying the whole night. Nobody could get a wink of sleep. It was a painful night,"" said Nabi. ""We cried our hearts out. We had lost our only daughter. Like every parent, we had many dreams about her. They are all shattered now.""

When Muskan's remains reached her village, hundreds of mourners including her teachers and schoolmates were waiting to take part in her last rites.

Muskan was buried in a graveyard in front of her house. ""What could be more painful than this? Our daughter is close to us, but she is resting under mounds of mud and stone,"" said Nabi, pointing at her grave.

Apart from helping her mother with household work and maintaining the kitchen garden, Muskan was a bright student of Sir Syed Memorial School, Qaimoh. She had recently passed her Class 9 exams with a 57 percent.

Since Muskan's death, her classmates have become gloomy and despondent. They were missing their batchmate and loving friend. ""We used to sit, play and eat lunch together. Our Kashmir has become a difficult place to live. I sometimes feel in a class, that Muskan is sitting beside me,"" said Muskan's classmate, wishing to remain anonymous.

These days, Muskan's father Nabi is busy building a new house.

A Plea for Justice

After Muskan's death, the chairman of the International Forum for Justice and Human Rights (IFJHR), Muhammad Ahsan Untoo, and another human rights activist Zeenat Mushtaq, filed a petition with the State Human Rights Commission (SHRC), seeking a report on what led to the killing of Muskan.

On 3 December, in response to the joint petition, chairman of SHRC, Bilal Nazki issued a notice to the superintendent of police and deputy commissioner of Kulgam, to submit a detailed compliance report before the commission, regarding Muskan's killing.

""Nobody can expect justice in Kashmir, and we don't need any compensation from the government,"" said Nabi. ""For decades we have been losing our kids, and the State always replaces justice with compensation.""

Another Child's Death By the Gun

Around three kilometres away from Nabi's house in the same village, grief and anger still clutch the heart of 45-year-old Ali Mohammad Alai every time he thinks about 7 July 2018 when he lost his 12-year-old daughter Andleeb Ali. Andleeb was shot down by government forces near an alleyway, a few meters from her house. Besides Andleeb, the same day, two other young boys, namely Shakir Ahmad Khanday and Irshad Ahmad Lone were also killed. 21-year-old Shakir happened to be Andleeb's cousin.

The villagers said that, that day the government forces had entered Redwani village in the morning. The army vehicles had been pelted with stones near the government high school. The school officials had reported that, while chasing the protestors, the army had entered the school and grabbed a teacher's mobile phone, and picked up a Class 9 student who was attending a lecture.

More Deaths By the Gun

""Some outsiders pelted stones at the Army. They escaped through the school lawn,"" said a school official, on condition of anonymity. ""The Army dragged one of our students inhumanly."" When the villagers heard about the school incidents, they gathered and staged a protest near Anbleeb's house. As per eyewitnesses, the Army opened fire on protesters, and 22-year-old Irshad Ahmad Lone got seriously injured.

Andleeb's cousin Shakir, the family said, was walking home from a nearby graveyard. He tried to retrieve Irshad's body along with other villagers. The Army opened fire again, and this time Shakir was hit.

""As Andleeb has no brother, she was very close to Shakir. When we heard Shakir was lying on the road in a pool of blood, our female members went outside to pick him up,"" said Ali. ""Andleeb took a glass of water with her. When they reached the spot, the Army opened fire again. Bullets hit Andleeb on her right thigh.""

When Andleeb fell to the ground, she grabbed her 16-year-old sister Khusboo Jan's leg. ""Andleeb was bleeding profusely,"" said Khushboo.

After Andleeb's death, Khushboo has gone through intermittent bouts of depression and shock, having lost her dear friend and loving sister.

""Khushboo was most affected by Andleeb's killing. They were more friends than sisters. She is still in shock, and sometimes becomes unconscious when reminding of the scene,"" says Ali.

No Hope for Justice

On the same day as Andleeb's killing, the chairman of IFJHR, Muhammad Ahsan Untoo approached the SHRC to seek an investigation into the details of the killing of the minor. He filed the petition identified under SHRC /227Klgm/2018.

On 4 October, three months after Andleeb's killing, the Jammu and Kashmir Police, in response to a petition filed by Untoo, informed the SHRC that a ""16-year-old girl named Andleeb Jan was part of an unruly mob and the soldiers fired in self-defence"".

The police response also states that the concerned police station of the area received reliable information that a patrolling party of the Army was pelted with stones by an ""unruly mob"" who were carrying lathis (sticks), and they intended to kill the soldiers.

Like Nabi, Ali has no hope for justice. ""How could anyone expect justice from those who even mentioned the wrong age for my daughter? Andleeb was only 12,"" says Ali. ""I had already told everyone including police that my daughter was not a part of any unruly mob."" Ali has recently received a discharge certificate for Andleeb, and school officials have mentioned that she was born on 15 December 2006.

Holding On

Andleeb was a good student, and passed Class 6 from Government Middle School, Akbarabad, with 66.40 percent. ""Andleeb was an active girl. She used to take part in school quizzes and sports as well,"" said Zahoor Ahmad Malik, Andleeb's teacher. ""She was good in mathematics too.""

Since Andleeb's killing, Ali has kept the key to her cupboard with himself. He has kept Andleeb's clothes, books and schoolbag inside it.

Nabi, late Muskan's father, hopes to decorate his daughter's grave a bit more, while Ali visits Andleeb's grave every day, to pray for her soul.

Last week, the TOI had reported how the UT education department was reallocating the students of Government High School in Sarangpur to Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sarangpur and in the new building which has been constructed in PGI campus, Sector 12, for the next academic session. As per the UT officials this was being done as the building of the school was in dilapidated condition and will be demolished soon.

When he received the eviction notice from CMRL a week ago, his fears became a reality. He joined 60 other residents who visited the CMRL officials last week to express their strong opposition about the displacement.

Corridors three and four under phase 2 of the Chennai Metro Rail project has received stiff opposition from residents and commercial establishments alike in thickly populated areas of T Nagar, Alwarpet, Mylapore, Kodambakkam and Nungambakkam.

Soon after they received notices from the Revenue Department to vacate their homes to facilitate Metro rail construction, residents sprung into action and forwarded written petitions to CMRL and state government, expressing their dissent.

""Around 30 shops and multiple houses on Chamiers Road, KB Dasan Road, TTK Road, and in Seethammal Colony are affected. For the sake of development, people cannot lose their houses,"" said a resident from Eldams Road, who took part in the meeting organised by residents last week in Ethiraj Kalyana Mandapam.

Traders and shopkeepers along Kutchery Road, Luz Circle and RK Mutt Road are struggling to find alternate spaces to continue their businesses. But, sources from CMRL made it clear that there will be no changes in the initial plan.

""A change in alignment is too early to decide now as the DPR is only in its initial stages. But, our team will hear all grievances put forth by aggrieved residents,"" said a CMRL official. A meeting is also scheduled on Decemeber 21 to hold negotiation talks with such residents added the official.

Similarly, 200-odd residents from T Nagar and Kodambakkam question the necessity of having a Metro station within 30 metres of Kodambakkam suburban station.

""They issued notices to all residents and shops located across 11 streets in T Nagar. But, under the owner's name, they have mentioned Ramakrishna Mission which owned this land some 60 years ago. This shows the absolute lack of coordination between CMRL, Chennai Corporation and Revenue Department,"" said Pasupathy S, member of Vivekananda Residents Welfare Association and Civic Exnora, from T Nagar.

Also, three months ago, CMRL had informed the management of Good Shepherd School in Nungambakkam that 3,300 sq m of the school's premises will be taken over for Sterling Road Station's car park and entry points. Following this, an online petition on Change.org was created against CMRL's move which was signed by 13,000 anxious alumni, students and teachers.

After the matter was taken to the Madras HC, the acquisition process was stalled. But on October 12, the land acquisition officer in charge of this issue informed the school that CMRL will not be changing its plan and will be acquiring the earmarked land. The school will be losing the ground and the primary block which houses 1,000-odd students from classes 1 to 5."

The aim was 'Know Disability = No Disability'.

And that's precisely what KnowDisability as an organisation has been doing since 2016, by helping the differently-abled live a better, more empowered life through equal opportunities, training and respect.

For Mohit Ahuja, founder, KnowDisability, the trigger point was when he saw his elder sister who suffers from Crouzon Syndrome -- a genetic disorder characterised by the premature fusion of certain skull bones -- making diyas and candles for an NGO.

""She had been going there for 25 years and she did the same thing without an iota of professional growth,"" says Ahuja.

Image: Mohit Ahuja, founder, KnowDisability Photograph: Kind courtesy knowdisability.org/facebook.com

Photography was more of a hobby for the advertising professional who finally bid adieu to that glitzy world in 2015 and got down to building a better world for the ""superhumans"" (that's what Ahuja believes people with disabilities are).

He channelised his hobby and skills to teach these superhumans and enable them take charge of their lives in a better manner.

""Disability is just a state of mind and we have been working dedicatedly since 2011 to change it,"" he adds.

The team at KnowDisability consists of special educators, IT professionals, photographers and people from various other fields.

""The individuals at KnowDisability are professional photographers with a specialisation in Studio Photography. They have clicked photographs for brands like Panasonic India, Harley Davidson, Gurgaon Moms, etc, and keep doing so even today,"" says a proud Ahuja.

It is not just photography that KnowDisability teaches.

The focus is also on computer training, reading and comprehension, sensitisation workshops, training for parents as well as training for teachers.

Ask about the reaction of people to their work, Ahuja cites the example of Indian parents and says people felt he had made a bad career choice until he succeeded.

""Initially, people gave the boys work more out of charity/pity. But then, when they saw the photographs, they just didn't want to go anywhere else.

""Now, the photographers are getting famous and why not? They've worked really hard for it,"" he says.

Amidst everything, Ahuja found convincing his parents was the toughest part of setting up this organisation because ""more often than not, parents of superhuman kids just focus on keeping the child busy"".

""I don't blame them for that though. That's how most organisations in this spectrum work, so whatever little hopes the parents have are killed,"" he says, pointing at the need for enabling these special children and not merely keeping them occupied so they don't create ruckus.

Another challenge that he encountered was working with different disabilities.

""Every person had a different form or a different level of disability. It was quite tough initially to customise our work accordingly but here we are today,"" says Ahuja.

All that he expects from an outsider is ""an open mind and an open heart without any labels"".

Paucity of funds and lack of space is what is holding Ahuja back from taking the next big step.

He is hoping that they are allotted space and funds from the government so that they can continue what they are doing and reach more people.

""Right now, my business and the parents' contribution is running the show. But if I have to make this reach more than just a handful of people, I need some support,"" he says.

Recalling a Eureka! moment from one of his workshops, Ahuja talks about a person named Bharat for whom placing his finger on the click button of the camera for the first two months was a herculean task.

""I literally had to hold his finger and force it towards the button,"" he says, adding he feared this perpetual forcing would damage the camera.

But then, one day, as he handed over the camera, Bharat placed his finger on the click button and pressed it.

There was no looking back for Bharat from then on."

A government resolution issued on December 15 states that schools affiliated to the board will be named after former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. ""Branding of zilla parishad schools as international institutes was a priority because government schools require the right positioning. Private schools which wish to affiliate themselves to the board can continue to use their own brand identity,"" said Francis Joseph, head, development and strategy, MIEB. The board's logo and the new identity of the schools will be launched in the city on December 25 -- the birth anniversary of Vajpayee.

Last year, the government set up the MIEB with the intention to provide an international curriculum, which, over the past few years, has been a draw among private and English medium schools, to state-run schools.

Surender Kumar's father knew how difficult it would be for the next generation to eke out a living from a small piece of ancestral agricultural land. So, his priority was to get both his sons educated, and help them land a government job.

Despite his family pushing him to study, Surender realised books were not his cup of tea. His school teachers agreed, advising that he should perhaps take up sports. Surender knew he would do well in any field that required endurance. But his family vehemently opposed that, even refusing to purchase a hockey stick for R450 in 2006. But that didn't deter the defender, who has become a pillar of the India hockey squad.

At the Bhubaneswar World Cup, Surender was a silver lining in India's campaign, which ended with a 1-2 defeat against Netherlands in the quarter-finals. In the big game, Surender showed maturity and nerves of steel to keep the Dutch at bay. Though it didn't prevent a defeat, he was adjudged the 'Player of the Match'.

""When I heard my name for Man of the Match, I didn't feel any emotion. I was blank. My team was out of the tournament, so it meant nothing. Hockey is a team game and when it comes to team performance, individual honour has no standing,"" says Surender, 24, with 107 India caps. ""Once we were out, I didn't want to return to the stadium to watch any other match. It was all over for me.""

Surender, who played in the 2013 Junior World Cup, is an India regular over the last two years. Except the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games in April, he has played in all other major events.

""Missing the CWG was a big jolt for me. Be it the junior or senior teams, I was never dropped since my international debut. But my family (humble background) has made me mentally strong. So, I took it as a challenge and worked hard on weak areas. After that, I was again in the squad,"" he said.

He took up hockey by accident. ""I used to play cricket with my friends and they joined hockey at the Kurukshetra stadium. When they told me it's an interesting game, I also started going with them to the hockey field. My main concern was getting my own hockey stick because whenever a senior took a break, I used to play with his stick. But my parents were not willing to buy me even a basic stick thinking it was waste of money and a distraction from studies. Eventually, after I revolted, my uncle got me my first stick for R450. Unfortunately, it broke in three-four days and it was back to square one. Thankfully, my seniors supported me.""

He also discovered he was colour blind during medical for a job in ONGC. ""I was worried. I consulted a doctor friend in Delhi, who assured me it won't affect my game."""

Acting against certain government and aided polytechnic colleges for ""not following norms"", the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has directed them to slash their student intake by 25-50 per cent. Some of these institutions have also been put in the 'no admission' category.

He further said, ""We all know we are not able to fulfill AICTE norms.

If students get technical education, at least they will gain confidence to start something on their own.""

Technical Education secretary Bhuvnesh Kumar said there are several issues regarding appointment of teachers. ""The recruitment process is done through the UP Public Service Commission. There was an agitation by teachers in the past that their appointment should be done as per AICTE norms. The government accepted this demand. But the service rules were the old ones. Now the service rules have to be amended according to AICTE norms. That process takes roughly 6-8 months. Service rules have been re-drafted and will now be examined by the personnel department.

How will they be able to learn the spelling of words without reading and writing habits,"" district president of Tamil Nadu Post Graduate Teachers Association GR Chentooran questioned.

Meanwhile, PB Prince Gajendra Babu, an educationist, said the video lessons should only be used in addition to reading and it should never be used as a tool to replace teacher as nothing would match the live interaction between teacher and students.

The government should take steps to appoint a teacher per subject per class in all the government schools and ensure that every student was given equitable access to all its initiatives, he added."

Apart from his parents; he had responded to the voices of Anita Nayakam and Padma, resource persons with Samagra Shiksha Keralam, who did acupressure for Irfan. Both of them are trained in holistic treatment and were entrusted with the job in 2012 and it had begun with sessions by Sam John, a teacher at Government School for Deaf , Jagathy.

Currently employed at Kaniyapuram resource centre, they took turns to be there with Irfan, six days a week. Irfan who would not respond to anyone but his parents would loosen his folded arms for them as they would slowly apply pressure at specific points in his body. ""Normally he would always tighten his grip and never responded to anyone but his parents. If he was asleep, we would tell him that we are going to take his arms and press them. He would open his eyes then,"" recollects Padma, one of the resource persons.

Normally they were tasked with home-based education for bed-ridden patients. With Irfan they had to redesign the methodology. When propped up, Irfan would drag himself to their lap. The teachers would tell him jokingly, 'Okay, now that you are in our lap, let's go to school'. ""We always hoped he would one day go to school. Every minute sign he gave us were so heartening,"" said Nayakam.

When they spotted him paying attention to their bright coloured sarees, they had the entire room decked with bright coloured LED lights. They even made a small nursery of his room, pasting pictures of birds, fruits, alphabets to give an impression that Irfan was actually in a class room like any boy of his age. ""Like his parents we did our best to make sure that he didn't miss anything although he was confined to a room,"" said Padma.

Four months ago, the portion on his abdomen which was intubated had developed wounds and they had to stop acupressure. They didn't stop coming though. ""We would come here and massage his body. We had developed a strong bond with this boy although no words were ever exchanged between us,"" said Nayakam."

The success of any task or activity depends upon the quality of preplanning and whether accomplish or not the objective must be attempted to solidify. To start with a strong monitoring mechanism is imminent in the School level and a rational commitment is needed from all the stakeholders. In my 20 years of continuous selfless attachment in Service Association work like ANSTA & NSEAOA what I personally observed is a logical working system is in the offing particularly management policies at all level and emphatically requires more inputs on academic interest. And to achieve its goal a tangible policy is impending to formulate through the blessing of political will to improvise its traditional tag. In this regard I would like to lay down the following humble suggestions as a measures for improvement of academic acceleration towards qualitative education in the department.

1. Teachers Registry may be installed digitally so as to maintain the actual position of the required Teachers in the GPS, GMS, GHS across the State to balance the staffing pattern and also to check the excess and shortage Teachers in the School. While it can also help in reckoning the actual vacancies caused to be filled up without any discrepancies.

2. Teachers Code with a Working Gown or Working Identity Card may be introduced to Teachers for public recognition in honoring as Professionals. And by doing so it will incline to prevent from manipulative practices of keeping proxy Teacher in the School.

3. Teachers recruitment policy may be taken up on regular basis or conduct at least twice in a year to avoid all sorts of frequent agitation/strikes for want of backlog service regularization which is endless that hampers the daily classroom routine time and again.

4. Primary Education is the backbone of a child's foundation and this basic education must be prioritized by evolving an academic viable policy more of creativity and play way methods of child centered approach to bring about quality education. And it requires a major amalgamation in this sector to carry forward an effective and sustainable teaching learning process which can enable the child to pursue higher education at all level because that is the gate way of building the child's educational future career.

5. An Academic Cell for Primary and Elementary Education may be separately function in the Directorate and promote supervision and monitoring the academic performance of the GPS and GMS in particular. As it is the fundamental basis which can excel in Secondary and Higher Secondary Education ie, HSLC/HSSLC results and therefore more weightage can be given at this stage of primary and elementary targeting to minimize or eliminate the nil result Schools in public exams instead of blaming one another.

6. Regular School inspection with a feed back by the Inspecting Officer may be taken up as a tool for immediate measures towards academic improvement besides cleaning up all

Kinds of unwanted prevalent practices like sharing salaries, Teachers absenteeism, false enrolment of the School etc. While that may lead to minimize the worries and burden of Unions/ NGOs to do the checking indeed this responsibility is being vested to the department officers to carry out periodically.

7. Regular DPC may be held for timely promotion to fill up all the resultant vacancies of Asst. Headmaster, Headmaster at the School level and JEO, SDEO, DEO, the field officers in the Sub. Divisional / District level to upkeep the continuity of coordinating in managing their establishment courteously because these are correlated functionaries as far as administrative aspects are concerned.

8. Teachers Award may be streamlined by giving responsibility to the Heads of the School to identify only deserving genuine Teachers and not by the individual Teachers concerned to initiate by himself/ herself to be awarded. The number of State Teachers Award may be fixed and distributed to all the District on quota wise to do justice to all teaching community in the State. Besides due facilities be accorded and their services can be fully utilized as an outstanding meritorious Teachers in the department.

9. As far as possible Teachers training can be of an oriented motivational teaching learning skill and preferably during vacation so as not to disturb the regular classes.

10. The different formats related to State School Employees bio data/ particulars may be limited to only one and formulate as Unified School Education Format (USEF) inclusive of all expected requirements to fill in such as Staff position, Students enrolment and other physical related matters like building, classrooms, offices, furniture's, fencing, toilets, safe drinking water etc enabling for accessibility use by DoSE, NBSE, SCERT through data base to do away filling of numerous School formats.

11. Instead of opening new Schools the existing Schools may be standardized both in the academic performance and infrastructural facilities to really experience the quality education in the state with the available resources.

12. The Government may plan for observance of Year of Academic Excellence for School Education Department."

The teacher was identified as Kanchan Kumar Das, a resident of Nonihat village under Hasdiha police station in Dumka district. He had been a para-teacher at the Upgraded Middle School in Chinadangaal under Ramgarh block since 2005.

""A postmortem of the body has been performed at Sadar hospital. We are waiting for the report to know the exact cause of the death,"" Dumka superintendent of police Y Ramesh said.

""Chill effect in the weather could be a reason for death. But, it cannot be established until postmortem report comes,"" Ramesh said.

Over 45,000 para teachers across the state are on an indefinite strike since November 16 forcing over 12,000 schools to shut. They are demanding the regularisation of their services after their counterparts in Chhattisgarh, who have served for eight years, have been regularised as assistant teachers.

They launched 'Ghera Dalo, Dera Dalo' programme at residences of BJP ministers, parliamentarians and legislators to push for their demand from November 25.

As part of the programme, Das and other para-teachers were protesting before Marandi's house on Saturday night in Dumka, around 300-km northeast from capital Ranchi.

""After participating in a protest rally in Dumka market in the afternoon, we reached the sit-in venue before the minister's house in the evening. Kanchan was already there in our makeshift tent,"" one of Das' companion Yudhir Mandal said.

Mandal said they went to bed at around 8pm but Das went to the market. He returned around 10pm and they chatted for a while before sleeping.

""We woke up around 5.45am on Sunday and was preparing tea. Around 6.30am, we called Kanchan but he did not give any response and his body shrank in cold. We immediately called an ambulance and took him to Sadar Hospital Dumka. But, the doctors declared him brought dead,"" he said.

Dr Dilip Kumar Bhagat, who examined Das, said his body was brought late. ""He had already died. So, it was hard to find out the exact cause of his death,"" he said.

Das' father Akhilesh Das, 60, said his son had no serious health complications. ""My son died due to cold. It is the state government, who is responsible for his death. The government has killed my son,"" Akhilesh said.

Kanchan was unmarried and lived with his father. His elder brother works in Kolkata.

Opposition parties also held the government responsible for the teacher's demise. Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) has demanded centre's interference in para-teachers' issue.

""The current BJP government in Jharkhand has lost its sensitivity and humanity. A teacher dying before a minister's house is very shameful. A case of murder should be lodged against the minister,"" said JMM spokesperson Supriyo Bhattacharya.

Meanwhile, Ekikrit Para Sikshak Sangharsh Morcha (EPSSM), an umbrella body of different para teachers' associations, has threatened to intensify the agitation.

""The government is not ready for any dialogue over the teachers' issue. We do not know if chief minister has made it a personal ego. We have a simple demand to regularise us on the line of Chhattisgarh,"" said EPSSM state member Vinod Tiwary.

Marandi, who was in Ranchi on Monday, expressed grief over the teacher's death. ""I will talk to the chief minister Raghubar Das and education minister Neera Yadav to sort out the para teachers' issue at the earliest,"" she said.

Marandi said that the government was serious about their issues and agreed to concede demands to some extent. ""I would request the agitating teacher to withdraw their strike,"" she said."

The BJP is still an amateur, even though an aged political party which needs to learn a lot about the Indian system and polity. History has proven that India is a country of, ""Unity in Diversity,"" hence the system of governance cannot escape from that concept. India is not Hindutva and Hindutva is not India. This is the age of development, the age of employment and the age of a progressive generation and no longer the age of building concrete statues and preaching. BJP's policies are no different from a case where without even a proper examination or investigation, the doctor declares a person sick and starts prescribing medicines and treatment. This will instead make a healthy person sick and become weaker.

BJP was crying from day one that India is sick; India needs immediate surgery to remove the tumour of corruption and faulty policies from its system and started waging war against what has been engraved in their beliefs. But little did they know that waging war is not the solution but having the arsenals is. There is no dearth of brains in BJP but the skills are severely lacking. They only know how to think but not how to implement those thoughts keeping in mind the needs of the citizens of this country. It's time for the BJP to invent a new mantra and discard what is no longer saleable for its survival in the future. The Congress Party has in recent times realized that it has to come out of the appeasement politics and to gauge the minds of voters. The metamorphosis has brought the party back into the limelight and fetched three major states into its kitty this time.

A cocooned culture with constant infusion of fear about insecurity and religious terrorism thrives within a limited territory only. Such life does not exist beyond the places of worship and fanatic circles. Youth these days are more concerned about their careers, future, jobs, happiness and security and less interested with religion. The just completed assembly elections are a clear writing on the wall that BJP is not going to get more than 180 MPs in the upcoming 2019 general elections. It is a wee bit late for the BJP to go for any damage control at this juncture. The Party was hallucinating with the charisma of Modi and his pan- India image and neglected the problems which the common man is facing at the grassroots level. It seems BJP took the statement of Omar Abdullah as Gospel truth and foolishly believed him when he said, ""In a nutshell, there is no leader today with a pan- India acceptability who can take on Modi and the BJP in 2019. At this rate, we might as well forget 2019 and start planning/hoping for 2024"".

It took ten years for power to get into the heads of Congress men and women and be drunk with it, but just four years for BJP. Nevertheless the BJP is a necessity for Indian politics and it should pop up once in a decade to be a show stopper or alarm bell to wake up the Congress from the power- drunken state. The Congress knows and understands the people of India better, but at times life becomes too easy for them and they tend to be lazy and not willing to come out of their air conditioned rooms and feel the heat outside. Modern day elections are fought on merit, delivery of promises, performance and development. The era of appeasement, tall promises, sweet talk, shedding tears and emotional blackmailing are over. No matter how influential, popular or strong one is, if he deviates from the track which he has set during the elections, he will definitely bite the dust at the end of the five year (in) glorious journey.

In Meghalaya, people had very high expectations from the present Government as it had portrayed that everything is ugly on the other side of the mirror and had promised during the elections to restore its beauty. However, as time passed by its true colour has started surfacing which is full of sweet words but scarce action. The present Chief Minister is living in the modern day stone age (laying of foundation stones here and there) and delivering tall promises about giving priorities to almost every nook and corner of the state. When he addressed the teaching community during Teachers' Day he said education is the most important sector in our society. The very next day his Government expressed its unwillingness to provide social security to teachers or to release their pay on time.

Then comes the Sports sector where he showered praises on our sportspersons and promised to lift the standard of sports in the state. But when it comes to action, his Government is not ready to promote any sportsperson; not even the minimum sponsorship for their travelling expenses. As a result our sportspersons (with international ranking) could not make it to several international events due to the paucity of funds. And the list goes on and on and on. Performance wise, the present NPP -led Government in Meghalaya headed by its national president, Conrad K Sangma is way below expectation. Its level of performance is not impressive at all and the gossip has already started everywhere. It has failed to convince and impress our neighbour Mizoram to buy its ideology and standard of performance after seeing Meghalaya under its rule. This was not without the several requests made and high voltage campaigns by most of the seniors NPP leaders from Meghalaya. The total votes obtained by NPP in the recently concluded assembly elections in Mizoram were simply pathetic. The result of the upcoming District Council elections will be the first test report for the one year old NPP led Government and the Lok Sabha elections will reveal the level of confidence and trust people have on the Chief Minister and his party's ideology especially in the Garo Hills region.

A real leader doesn't make promises for every issue brought before him, but delivers whatever he has promised. Simply talking without working is a fairy tale as narrated by story tellers. I don't think the present young and dynamic Chief Minister would like to be remembered as a one hit wonder in the history of Meghalaya's politics. Before I forget, I bet that so far he has not given any commitment to make Meghalaya a safer place for women and children by reducing, if not containing, the rising crime rate especially the cold blooded murder of a number of women in Meghalaya."

Difficult roads, they say, often lead to beautiful destinations. There may be multiple challenges, but one thing binds India's change-makers together - they view problems as means for innovation. From tackling unemployment to becoming financially independent and providing livelihoods to others at a time of personal tragedy, YourStory brings you stories of social impact through the Monday Motivation series.

As we draw closer towards the end of 2018, here are some of our top picks from the year.

Recognising the vulnerabilities of migrants who move from rural areas to urban India, Vinod Pandey started a ""tea stall"" with a difference - Rozgar Dhaba, at Shehore district's Nashrullaganj block in Madhya Pradesh. The dhaba not only sells tea and refreshments, but acts as a centre for the exchange of information on livelihood and employment opportunities.

""I am from Bihar and have seen how people from Bihar migrate to different cities in search of jobs, especially for daily wage labour. An elder cousin migrated to Punjab and died because he did not get proper work in the city; he lived in slums, without proper healthcare. The city failed him,"" Vinod says.

Started in January 2018, Rozgar Dhaba caters to over a 1,000 people a month and has hosted over 20 job fairs, and five farm produce sale displays till date. It has over 70 registered entities such as government agencies, skill centres, NGOs, district agriculture centres, grameen centres, and small local businesses that provide regular job information. The dhaba itself provides employment to almost 10 people and has revenue of Rs 8,000 to Rs 12,000.

At a time when rote learning and academic-based examination continue to dominate the Indian school system, a 21-year-old student from IIT-Madras is on a mission to change the way knowledge is imparted. Using the peer teaching model, which has Harvard University's stamp of approval, Divanshu Kumar hopes to improve the learning ability of students through his startup, Involve.

""Most of the world believes that we can improve the quality of learning and have better results by putting more qualified teachers in the classrooms. And while this is true, it fails to address one very important need: capability building of students,"" he says.

Involve's peer teaching method involves a nine-month fellowship where students from higher grades, like from Class 8, can teach and mentor juniors. By getting students who can teach and learners together in a classroom, Involve aims to create a school ecosystem that defines a student's potential not merely in terms of examinations, but through overall academic and personal excellence.

Till date, the team has worked with over 400 students across four schools in Chennai and Bengaluru. These include more than 100 student leaders.

To introduce food processing techniques and create links in the agri-business model, Balaji Balaraman, 35, started Agribolo. The startup aims to create a market linkage opportunity that can become a farm-to-fork, farm-to-mill, and farm-to-warehouse model for farmers and the ecosystem at large.

""The primary necessities include creating multiple pre-processing or primary centres at the farm or village level. That will provide a basic value addition to farmers and an opportunity to develop a cluster-based model,"" Balaji says.

The farmer engagement platform allows an individual to get an umbrella of services under one roof at his location and according to the season, relevance, demand, supply, and in a timely and efficient manner. Agribolo engages and connects farmers with experts, NGOs, and development institutes for training, capacity building, and outreach programmes.

The startup offers a platform to aggregate services in the form of farm mechanisation, plant nursery, protected cultivation, seed production, input demonstration, collateral management, financial inclusion, and local processing that could be co-owned and operated by the community at large.

The farmer is also provided an opportunity to partner with a business solution - available on the platform - that empowers him towards rural employment and social empowerment.

Josephine Arokiya Mary, a National Award winner for apiculture, started her journey with 10 bee boxes. She now has 7,000 bee boxes, and has helped create more than 1,800 entrepreneurs in her district.

In 2010, a year after her daughter's death, Mary took a loan of Rs 10 lakh from Canara Bank to start Vibis Natural Bee Farming with 1,000 bee boxes. Targeting diabetic patients, she accumulated and harvested jamun honey, which gave her good revenues; soon, Mary started harvesting honey from more than 10 varieties of bees. Apart from selling honey, she diversified her business by selling bee wax candles and the pollen bees carry on their legs.

Mary is now known as Queen Bee in her village and sells honey to 23 districts in Tamil Nadu. She offers 25 varieties of honey with flavours like jamun, neem, and amla among others, through her enterprise. She now earns more than Rs 1 lakh per month, and her venture has an annual turnover of Rs 3 crore.

Besides providing employment to over 50 people and helping over 400 women set up honey bee farms, she is training more than 50,000 people in bee harvesting under the National Honey Mission and creating awareness to save bees from going extinct.

Prem Singh's lush green farmland paints a vivid picture of sustainable farming: organic produce and homegrown compost, fruit-bearing trees, livestock shelter with water bodies, well-nourished soil, natural fertilisers, and, most importantly, a continuous source of income.

""I too was captured in the cycle of debt and crop failure; we couldn't control climatic conditions and bank loans kept increasing. And then I started thinking about our ancestors, our traditional farming methods, and knew that this was the key to success. Today, I am debt-free. I am a pragatisheel kisaan,"" he says proudly.

Advocating Avartansheel Kheti, or periodic proportionate farming, Prem Singh believes that farming has to be a self-sustaining occupation for the farmer. The practice encourages a farmer to divide his land into three parts: one-third to be used as a garden to grow fruits and crops, the second part for rearing livestock, and the third to grow timber. His approach advocates crop rotation, organic farming, animal husbandry, food processing, improving soil fertility, and seed development.

This farming method is currently followed by 28 percent farmers in his district and also has followers from the agrarian community of Belgium and France."

Data was collected using a Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) across 18 schools in Bengaluru. Results revealed children and adolescents face issues in five categories: Emotion, conduct, hyperactivity, peer relations and pro-social behaviour. The survey was conducted by AddressHealth, a school health services provider, from June to August.

""As many as 16.7 per cent of primary, middle and high school students surveyed suffered difficulties that could lead to anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, conduct disorders, depression, etc. In this survey, 12 to 15 per cent high school students were found suffering from emotional and social skill issues, while eight to 10 per cent primary school kids suffered conduct and hyperactivity issues,"" said Dr Anand Lakshman, founder of AddressHealth.

Government and private schools following CBSE, ICSE and Karnataka state syllabus were part of this exercise. Teachers and parents filled out questionnaires about students' behaviour.

""Conduct issues such as bullying, not listening to the teacher, aloofness, were factors noticed more by teachers than parents. This is a screening tool and not a diagnostic one. It helped us identify who is more prone to risk. For instance, contemplation of suicide among adolescents warrants seeking treatment, which we provided later through group therapy,"" Lakshman added.

The causes included imbalance of neurochemicals in the brain, social and environmental stressors such as pressure to perform, hyper-competitive nature, overexposure to information on the internet (for example, blue whale challenge being seen as a solution to solve one's problems), nutritional aspects such as high sugar content in food eaten by hyperactive kids, need for instant gratification in terms of likes and approval on social media, etc.

""Most issues stem from childhood. It is a known fact that only 12 to 15 per cent adults seek help. Most do not take treatment due to stigma, so adults pass on their anxieties and stressors to their kids. Depression is used as a bad word. The brain is more susceptible to change when the child is young,"" a public health expert said, further adding, ""Late treatment cannot modify the way the brain works, but can only offer coping strategies to adults. We need to accept our children are at risk and intervene early."""

The District Institute of Education and Training (DIET) responsible for holding Class V exams has hinted that since the model code of conduct was in place since October, the examination process for about 20 lakh students has slowed down.

The involvement of teachers in elections has derailed the course schedule and examination process.

The exam for Class VIII is conducted by the Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education (RBSE) which is already overburdened with class X and XII board exams and has expressed reluctance in taking up any additional responsibility.

""It has certainly affected the process but I am sure that teachers will complete the curriculum on time. Examination forms are being submitted in schools for both classes,"" said Arunesh Sinha, director of DIET, Jaipur.

Some officials shared the inside story. ""Since the model code of conduct is in place since October, the decision-making has become extremely slow. The system will not normalise until the new government is formed. Other than human resources, huge financial resources are also required to conduct these exams which are bigger in volume than the class X and XII exams,"" said an official.

Exams for classes V, VIII will take place after class X and XII boards in April.

Any delay will push the exams to May which has unbearable climatic conditions.

Meanwhile, Kishan Mittal, spokesperson of Swayamsewi Shiksha Sansthan, a body of RBSE schools, has argued that English books for upper primary classes for this year are yet to be distributed in government schools.

""Students are forced to purchase books from the market. It needs to be probed that when order for the books was placed at the beginning of the year, why have they not reached schools,"" said Mittal."

K CHANDRASHEKAR RAO, who has won a second stint as Chief Minister of Telangana, has signalled his intent to play a major role in national politics. After his party's victory, KCR announced that he would form a new non-Congress, non-BJP national consortium of regional parties, and pitched once again for more autonomy to the states, suggesting that the Concurrent List be done away with.

As per the Constitution, powers are demarcated as Central, State and Concurrent. While sectors such as defence, aviation, railways and foreign affairs are with the Centre, and those such as municipal administration, transport and health are with the states, the Concurrent List covers subjects in which both the central and state governments have power -- education from primary to university, health and family welfare, science and technology, forest and environment etc.

In calling for doing away with the Concurrent List, KCR stressed the need for decentralisation and devolution of power. ""National parties want to strengthen the Concurrent List so that the Centre has maximum hold over states. In my view, there should be no Concurrent List and state governments should be able to decide what is best for their states,'' he said.

State vs Centre

Some of the areas in which KCR wants a freer hand for states, specifically Telangana:

Advertising

Muslim reservation: Last year, Telangana passed a Bill providing for 12% reservation to Muslims but has been unable to implement it because of a 50% reservation ceiling ordered by the Supreme Court. KCR has said Parliament should pass a law to do away with this cap on reservations, and that the Centre should let the states decide the quantum of reservation.

Primary education: KCR says the Centre should let states decide on issues like primary education. He has questioned why the Centre should decide where a primary school should come up in some corner of Telangana just because it gives funds, or how many teachers should be recruited for a school. The Telangana government has been paying salaries to panchayat school teachers and contract workers after the Centre withdrew funding two years ago.

Urban development: According to KCR, the Centre should not be the one to decide which town to develop in the state with central funds. ""Each state is different. Local leaders would know better which town or city needs development rather than someone sitting in New Delhi,"" he said.

Supreme Court: KCR has even suggested that every state capital should have a Supreme Court, instead of just one in Delhi.

Regional alternative

KCR has said that neither the BJP nor the Congress has been unable to deliver the kind of governance that people expect now. ""There is a dire need for an alternative political party at the national level. People are desperate for it. I will bring together regional parties from across India which will be an alternative to the Congress and the BJP. I am going to give a new definition to the political scenario in this country,"" KCR said.

He said he and his ally, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, would start touring the country to identity regional parties that can be approached to form an alliance. ""There is an acute political crisis in this country and a surgery is urgently required. A revolution is needed in economic and agriculture sectors. There are 15 crore farmers in this country... A high quality change is required in the politics of this country,'' KCR said.

KCR plans to start meeting leaders of regional parties to build the alternative he is thinking of. ""This election is a vindication of our policies and governance. Telangana is a model for the entire country and you will see soon that I will start working towards forming an alternative national party,'' KCR said."

Eight years after the launch of Pragna, an ""activity-based learning"", in the government primary schools of Gujarat, the project has been considerably scaled down. After spending Rs 150 crore and conducting a series of training sessions for over 80,000 teachers till 2017, the project will be limited to only Class I and II from this year, instead of Class I to V as it was being executed till now.

The Gujarat Council of Educational Research and Training (GCERT) has termed the decision to scale down the project with an aim to universalise it.

""The move to remove Pragna from Class III to V, and scale it down to all Class I and II, is aimed at universalising it. This was necessary for its better implementation,"" GCERT Director T S Joshi told The Indian Express, pointing to the project now being introduced in across 33,000-odd government primary schools. Till date, Pragna covered nearly 23,000 government primary schools.

However, primary teachers' resentment against the ""complicated teaching methodology"" under Pragna cannot be ruled out for the decision to scale it down.

Teachers have resisted the project on several grounds, ranging from difficulty in ""maintaining order"" in classrooms, grouping of different classes in one room causing attention deficit, to ""additional workload"" on them.

This is clearly stated in the survey report prepared and submitted by the Gujarat Evaluation Department under General Administrative Department (GAD) in 2017. The teachers had said in their response, ""It becomes difficult to assign different activities to children within the same group as students are at different milestones"".

EXPLAINED Why Gujarat grapples with improving learning levels

The Gujarat government has been struggling to improve the learning levels of the children in its schools. It has rolled out several measures for it -- from evaluation exercise like Gunotsav to enrolment drive Praveshotsav and Mission Vidya. Despite many quality improvement projects, the learning levels of students remains low as highlighted by the findings of the National Achievement Survey that was released by the Centre's HRD Ministry earlier this year. One reason could be lack of consistency in implementing such schemes. For example, the evaluation part of Praveshotsav continued for only two years, while Mission Vidya ended abruptly despite initial plans to replicate it to lower classes.

A typical Pragna classroom has floor seating, instead of the row-column wise desk-chair seating arrangement. The children are divided into four groups and seated on dhurries encircling bright red coloured angular tables joined to make a small circle, doing their own activity.

""The previous traditional blackboard and desk-chair system was far better than this floor seating as now I alone have to handle nearly 40 students of both Class I and II where half the class has been taught as per the traditional teaching for a year and are now following this new one. Also, since the post of teacher for Class II is vacant I have to teach the entire class,"" said one of the teachers of a municipal corporation school in Ahmedabad, on condition of anonymity.

Based on teachers' complaints of ""extra load"", the project has incorporated several major changes in its curriculum, methodology, thereby simplifying the process. The system had its own specially-designed curriculum and was followed for the last seven years. Now, it has been replaced by curriculum of the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT).

Moreover, the number of groups in which the students were categorised based on their learning levels have been reduced from six to four, and only two subjects -- Gujarati and Mathematics -- instead of existing four -- language, EVS, mathematics and rainbow activities -- will be taught now.

The six groups in which Class I and II students were initially categorised were teacher supported group, partially teacher supported group, peer support group, partial peer support group, self learning group and evaluation group. Now, partially teacher supported group and partial peer support group have been done away with.

The number of cards used to teach students has also been reduced as teachers complained that ""students of Class I and II are young and it becomes difficult to select a card and divide in groups"".

Nearly 10,000 schools, where Pragna has been introduced for the first time, are struggling to catch up with the drastic change. Since both Class I and II are clubbed together under the project, Class II students have been made to shift to the new method of learning without studying in the same format in Class I."

A source involved in the project said, ""We are planning to air programmes round-the-clock. To start with, programmes would be aired only 8 to 10 hours for two to three months from the day of launch. The department has packages in hand for 3,000 hours which is more than sufficient to telecast without interruptions. Work to schedule programmes are under process.""

Videos lessons - mostly for newly introduced concepts and difficult lessons - which practically explain the concepts of academic syllabus would be aired along with short videos on moral values. Videos to educate students about traditional games, Yoga and Thirukkural would also be aired, the source said.

As talents found in government school students and teachers remain hidden, teachers who had adopted innovative methods in their schools and students with real talent would be featured in the channel.

Live classes would also be taken for students preparing for competitive examinations like NEET and CA, the source said, adding that awareness would also be created about important announcements, government schemes and scholarship programmes.

""90% of the programmes would be aired in Tamil and a programme is designed to train the students in English language,"" the source added.

""A group of teachers from all the 32 districts is roped in for the project. Almost all the videos to be aired in the channel were created by the teachers along with outsourced technicians.

A total of Rs 1.35 crore has been allotted to procure equipment, install and to connect the studio with TACTV station through fiber cable. The integrated studio will function from Anna Centenary Library in Chennai, the official said, adding that tender to carry out the process was already floated.

Welcoming the move of the department, a government schoolteacher said it would attract students towards schools.

Chikara, a Class 12 student at Mother Khazani Convent School in Bawana -- from where the question paper was leaked -- rushed to her house and switched on the television.

""It was all over the news. It was my school. They were my teachers. How did this happen?"" recalled Chikara, adding that the incident took place on her first day of Class 12.

Though Chikara's batch has been allowed to appear for the Board exam to be held in 2019 along with the batch currently pursuing Class 10 from the school, the future of around 1,700 students studying in other classes is ""uncertain"".

According to the police, the two teachers had opened the sealed question papers, took photos on their mobile phones and shared them with a tutor in a private coaching centre in Bawana. Later, the school principal was also arrested in connection with the case. The school had approached the Delhi high court against the board's decision. However, it has not received any relief from the court as of now and the matter is sub judice. The next hearing is scheduled on Monday.

Dalbeer Singh, the vice-chairperson of the school, said that as many as 660 students have left the school after the incident. ""The strength of our school has come down from 2,375 to 1,715 in the last seven months. There is a mass exodus from Class 11. Around 50% of students have left after Class 10 this year. There is a sense of uncertainty over the

existence of the school among parents of students studying up to Class 8 and those in Class 10 because they will have to shift to some other school if we do not get a stay from the high court,"" he said.

For Deepanshu Dahiya, a Class 10 student, even the idea of switching schools is ""terrifying"". ""I am studying here in since

Class 5. All my friends and teachers are here. My parents have started shortlisting schools for me but I don't think I will be able to adjust anywhere else easily,"" he said.

Police had said the two teachers had allegedly shared the leaked paper with their students as well. But Singh denied the claim.

""It's not that the result of our students was bad. The highest score in Economics in 2016-17 was 96% and the overall pass percentage was 90. None of our students had seen the paper before their exam. I don't understand who those teachers were trying to help,"" he said.

Officials said that the school is known for sports activities. ""Our Class 12 student Mohit Jhangra plays for the Under 19 India team which recently won the World Cup. Our students are known for contributions in football and kabbadi. The CBSE held its All India Kabaddi Tournament at our campus in 2016. We have grounds and space for every sport here.

Dhancha. Nunnuyir. Vamshavahi. You probably know these words as 'structure', 'bacteria' and 'gene'.

On Saturday, the scientists and researchers at the 'Traditional knowledge meets modern science' lecture held at the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) spoke in Kannada, Tamil and Hindi and not in the dominant language of science - English. Over 100 people attended the talks and Q&A sessions, and they included researchers and their elderly parents and acquaintances, hospitality, canteen and admin staff of the NCBS campus, school-goers, and even a cook and a driver.

The occasion was the second edition of The Jigyasa Proj­ect, which aims to communicate scientific and technological knowledge to the common man in their mother tongue.

It kicked off seven months back, when speakers discussed memory formation, electric pulses that flow through the body, free software movement, and more, in Kannada and Tamil. Kannada was an obvious choice. So was Tamil, because the project is initiated by Mandram, a global platform for people interested in Tamil language and literature, along with Life Science Cluster (BLiSc), a hub of biological research in India. Hindi was added because the city has a rich migrant population from north India. Requests to host science talks in Telugu, Marathi, and Bengali have poured in too, Mahinn Ali Khan, head of communications at BLiSC, informs gladly.

Class-10 student Muskan, who had come with 14 others from Government High School, Kodigehalli, liked the outing. ""To listen to such big scientists explain the concepts (of antibiotics and ) in our mother tongue, Kannada, was interesting."" The students even took notes. Then, Rangappa, who runs a store of stiationery and lab equipment inside the campus, felt regional talks must happen more often. ""I find recalling things that I hear in Kannada, my native language, easier than what I hear in English,"" the 23-year-old says.

'We need to be inclusive'

Khan was initially doubtful of this 'public experiment' but the success of the first edition ""opened her eyes"". She says, ""It was attened by retired government officials and teachers, professors from Kannada and Tamil-medium schools, and elders. It made us realise we have been excluding so many people all this while because we tend to operate in one language, although it was done inadvertently and unintentionally. When you do outreach, you usually tend to do it for people who come from the same language and education as you do, which, in turn, builds the reputation that non-English speakers can't approach your institution. We realised it's a privileged and non-inclusive way of communicating science to the public. We want to break that perception down. We want to be more inclusive.""

We must, agrees Ravi Muddashetty, a neurobiologist at Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine (InStem), who discussed 'How we learn and why we forget' in Kannada in the first edition. He says, ""Scientists and researchers work on taxpayer's money. So we must try to communicate to them what we are working on and why it matters. In a way, everybody should have access to learning and understanding science. It should not be limited by any language.""

That's why ahead of the Saturday's edition, an ""aggressive"" effort was made to invite the hospitality, technical, security, canteen and gardening staff working on these campuses and beyond to attend the lecture. Khan even gave a day-off to her cook and household help. ""That's because the topic of health and medicine concerns everyone,"" she reasons. In order to get more commoners on board, going forward, the team is open to hosting this lecture series closer to the city, because travelling to NCBS, which is located along Bellary Road, is not possible for everyone, she adds.

'To translate or not to'

The speakers were ""scared"", ""reluctant"" and ""curious when they were first offered to talk science in their local language, so they had to put in a little research and thought for the occasion. Muddashetty remembers he had demoed his Kannada speech in front of his mother.

The obvious challenge was to find local equivalents of scientific jargons. Here's how Prof R Sowdhamini from NCBS prepped her 20-minute talk on 'Revealing the science behind traditional practices through plant genome sequencing', which she delivered in Tamil. ""My co-speaker, moderators and I had held a few seatings on how to go about it. We came up with our own translations for a few. Chiral centre became kai-thanmai-konda chinnam, chemical groups became vediyiyal thoguppu, cardioprotective became idaya paadugaappu. In some cases, I didn't like the existing Tamil equivalents, so I coined new ones, such as uyirini for biological cell, and kaai-chi vadigatti for distillation,"" she shared. But the team could not find a worthy Tamil word for Biotechnology, so they stuck to it.

Unlike Sowdhamini, from NCBS did not scour the local lexicon too much. She spoke about the and her work on tigers using genome sequencing, in Hindi, throwing dhancha for 'structure' of the DNA, and vividhitha for 'variation' in the gene pool, in the mix. Mutation remained mutation, and Chimpanzee as Chimpanzee because ""it can't be bundar. It means monkey"". Though she did battle one dilemma - ""Should I first think the matter in English and translate into Hindi, or should I think in Hindi and then talk? These thought processes are a little different,"" she explains.

Dr HS Subramanya, director of Institute of and Applied Biotechnology, and Biocon Chair, kept his speech Kanglish - colloquial Kannada mixed with technical English. The structural biologist says, ""I did cook up vayaktikarisida asudhi for personalise medicine, and vyadhi kshamatva for disease resistance, but it's not worth replacing popular terms such as antibiotic with anything else. And the purpose of these talks is not really to translate or transliterate, but to communicate science in a language and a manner that general can understand better."" So instead of explaining how Pencillin works, he told the story of how it was accidentally discovered.

""Need good local books'

Still, the language discourse is critical in a country that has over 19,500 native languages. After his first Kannada stint at NCBS in the city, Muddashetty was invited to Vivekananda Institute at Mysuru and then at in Shimoga to give a much longer talk of 45 minutes. He shares, ""After the talk in Mysuru, students asked me a lot of questions. And I am confident this would not be the case had I spoken in English, because students from smaller towns usually hesitate to speak up in English."" He additionally feels that Kannada science textbooks are poorly written, and need a bit of work and thought during the process of translation.

At the end of the day, all that these experts want is to communicate the progress of science and research to the layman.

According to the school authorities, several letter have already been sent to the CM. The school has also moved the Delhi high court, which has issued a notice to the directorate of education (DoE) and asked it to reply in a week, said Michael Williams, director, Mount Carmel.

A student, Madhurima Paul, has started a petition on change.org, 'Join hands to recognise Mount Carmel Dwarka', which has so far been signed by over 4,000 people. ""Considering the idea of graduating from a great school, which is just officially de-recognised, it is the value of the students' degree at stake. It is our admission in colleges at stake.... What really concerns me as a student is just that one parameter cannot and should not make the entire school shut down,"" Paul said in the petition addressed to Kejriwal and Sisodia. She has requsted that the school be recognised again.

On the note sent on December 11, the school said, ""We thank you for your continued support and trust in Mount Carmel. If you wish to extend your support, kindly send your emails with a copy to us addressed to chief minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal and deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia. We shall keep you informed of any and all fresh developments.""

The school claimed that it had received the notice, to be effective from April 1, 2019, on the same day. The government ""further instructed that no fresh admission to be taken. This information was made available to media almost a week ago and like many of you, we were greatly shocked and disappointed after reading the newspaper headlines"", said the note, which was signed by principal Sunita Howell.

The school said some parents had complained to DoE against the fixing of fees for the academic year 2016-17. ""So in the directorate's words, 'in the interest of parents and students the school has been de-recognised',"" said the note. According to DoE, the school had increased the fees without the prior approval of the authority.

The parents have been told in the note that the increased fees were utilised to pay the teachers under the seventh pay commission."

Teachers use a mobile phone and enter attendance of children on the application, which is updated in a central server. In all, 13,000 schools are linked to this application so that attendance trends can be monitored and studied, instead of piling it in registers.

The application TN Schools Attendance is facing glitches such as delay in synchronisation of attendance data, absence of database updation and server trouble. Teachers said the entered data was not getting registered in the server and there were other problems with the server too.

""While the data was getting properly marked initially, since the last two weeks we haven't been able to access the application to mark attendance,"" said a teacher from a government school in Ashok Nagar.

The application was created by the school education department's Education Management Information System (EMIS) cell.

The idea behind creating this application was to closely monitor attendance records of each student studying in government schools in cities and districts and intervene if they identify a potential dropout.

The data will be monitored by the State Project Director - Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA).

""The officers, after identifying long absentee can take appropriate steps to intervene and help the child, if needed,"" said Pradeep Yadav, principal secretary to government, department of school education.

Since the data is launched on a pilot basis, officials said they were currently working on resolving all glitches, which may be done in next two months. ""If each school has five to 10 classes, with a total of 50,000 students, the server will be getting around 5 lakh hits. Initially, the server could not handle the load, we are slowly implementing changes and resolving the issues,"" said an official from SSA."

Without fanfare, without pomp and pageantry, without pompous declarations of intent, the Centre of Education which has been running and churning out young minds ceaselessly for the last 75 years renewed its commitment to the deeper ideals and vision of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother and to the wider and larger goal of India's regeneration as the spiritual leader of humanity -- Visvaguru.

The Centre of Education, in a sense, belongs to those institutions which sprung from the vision of our leading thinkers and sages, and grew organically as part of our national march from colonialism to post-colonialism and Independence.

Founded by the Mother in 1943, as the Ashram School with the objective of imparting education to the children of disciples who had opted for the ashram life, the Centre of Education saw the Mother herself direct its activities for the next two decades or so. A core group of dedicated teachers -- many of them accomplished professionals in their own fields before their joining Sri Aurobindo's Ashram -- under the Mother's guidance, inspired by the vision and ideals of Sri Aurobindo, tirelessly dedicated themselves to ensuring that the seat of learning continued to evolve. Their aim was to keep it centred on its founding ideals -- the imparting of an education that looked at learners integrally and strove to shape both, their outer and inner dimensions.

Over the years, the Ashram School grew into the Centre of Education, widening its ambit, enlarging the scope of its activities while ensuring that the purity of its founding ideals was preserved. In a sense, Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education can be said to be a modern replica of the ancient gurukul. Learning was a rigorous and yet joyous process, in which learners were taught to be rooted within as well to one's physical surroundings while encouraging and enabling them to evolve a wider civilisational vision.

When Sri Aurobindo passed away in 1950, the Mother considered the formation of an education institution in his name as one of the most fitting tribute to his vision and memory. Sri Aurobindo himself had a lifelong link to education. In his days in the service of the Gaekwad of Baroda, he taught at the Gaekwad's college and was for a while its acting principal. Later during his early days as a political revolutionary he was at the centre of the national education movement and then in Puducherry as a spiritual revolutionary, he continued to churn out his thoughts on how a national system of education for India ought to be envisaged.

In 1951, the Mother invited Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee to preside over the memorial convention held in Puducherry to deliberate on the formation of a Centre of Education which would strive to realise Sri Aurobindo's vision and prepare legions of young scholars, citizens who would live not for themselves alone but for the country and humanity. The Ashram School thus transmuted into a larger organisation with a wider goal.

For the last 75 years that original founding principle continues to guide the institution, undiminished in its intensity. In his formidably inspiring and prescient address, Syama Prasad Mookerjee had expressed a certainty that ""the proposed university will symbolise the world's urge for a new spiritual rebirth; it will stand out as an oasis amidst the barren tracts that breed jealousies, suspicions and petty conflicts"".

To free India's government, Syama Prasad's advice was that it follow a policy that would ""encourage experiments of the type being made here (at the ashram) so that the work may be carried on without hindrance or difficulty"". Over seven decades that oasis continues to remain intact, and to nourish and shape new minds and to fulfil a higher national destiny.

As reported by TOI earlier, excess teachers in Nagpur district have been transferred to different schools, within the district, where vacancies exist. But not all teachers have joined their new postings.

The education department has sent a letter to all such teachers, warning them of salary loss. A separate letter was sent to principals of those schools that have refused to allow these teachers to join their new postings. The principals have been told that their post will be de-recognized which ultimately will lead to stoppage of salary from government coffers.

There are just over 700 excess teachers in Nagpur, who have been now given new postings at least on paper. The department has not yet shared details of how many teachers are yet to join, as it is giving some time to everyone to complete the formalities.

The separate letters to teachers and principals were needed because in some cases it is the teachers who do not want to shift to a new school while at other places it is the school that does not wish to appoint them.

Some of the teachers do not want to join other schools either because of distance or unfamiliarity. In some cases, school management feel the government is infringing on their right to appoint teachers.

A principal, on condition of anonymity, said, ""The education department's letter seeks to deal with us like Hitler did in Germany. This dictatorial attitude will not work and I am sure our management will take this matter to court."""

Officials preparing for the ceremony on Saturday. - Santosh Sharma, DNA

The oath taking ceremony of chief minister-designate Ashok Gehlot and his deputy, Sachin Pilot, will be held against the backdrop of the majestic Albert hall. This will be for the first time that a new government would be sworn-in at the Albert Hall.

Sources inform that decision regarding the venue was taken after a meeting held at the residence of chief minister designate Ashok Gehlot in which the senior bureaucrats and party officials were present.

The decision was taken after the highcourt gave permission to the government to hold the ceremony at Janpath, albeit with some conditions. It has, however, given an option that the ceremony could be conducted at the Amrudon ka Bagh which is off-limits for public events.

Preparations have been started by government departments on a war-footing at the Albert Hall since late evening. It will be a big task for PWD and other departments to prepare for the ceremony at such a short notice. This will be a historic oath taking ceremony and congress president Rahul Gandhi is expected to be a witness the event.

Hence, the officials are not taking any chances and are making elaborate plans for the formal ceremony. Supporters of both Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot will be coming to Jaipur to witness this grand event. Large number of Congress workers are expected to arrive in Jaipur.

On previous two occasions, Gehlot had taken oath at ceremonies held at the Rajbhawan. However, till Saturday evening, the matter was being heard in the court where the government pleaded for permission to hold the ceremony at Janpath.

Notably, the High Court had a few months back, banned all such public functions and political events at Amrudon ka Bagh and nearby places after the teachers felicitation programme, which was held on September 5, led to massive inconvenience to the public.

In a suo-moto decision, the division bench of justices Manish Bhandari and DC Somani had issued notices to the government and the police directing them to stop organising public programmes at the Ambedkar Circle, including the Amrudon Ka Bagh.

The trend of celebrations at the Janpath was started by the former chief minister Vasundhara Raje government when she took oath on the assembly premises in front of a swell crowd. Visitors were then seated along the Janpath that leads to the Vidhan Sabha where an entire battery of BJP leaders, including Narendra Modi and outgoing chief minister Ashok Gehlot was also in attendance."
