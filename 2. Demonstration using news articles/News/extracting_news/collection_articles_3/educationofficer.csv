The notification issued on Friday stated, ""It is important for students to be taken for educational purpose be it excursion, place visit, personal meeting, organisation visit, museum travel and picnic. But schools need to follow the rules framed by the state government.""

As per new rules, schools will have to form a panel or committee to discuss the desired destination/place, route, time-table, estimated time and cost. Apart from this, schools will also have to take an agreement letter from parents for the visit. It has also been mandated to have female teachers for female students as a guide. For every 20 students, one teacher should be assigned the duty.

To curb the menace of private tuitions run by teaching and non-teaching staff, the state government on Saturday issued a notification that prohibits such activities. The government has come down heavily on schools and have asked the schools to send a certificate (monthly) stating that no employee is running private tuitions. The notification stated: The department has received oral and written representation from student organisations complaining of teaching and non-teaching staff running private tuitions. If anyone is found breaking the rules, steps would be taken against the school."

In a letter to Podar International school in Nerul, the education officer has asked the school to take a decision on a change in the school's uniform only after the consent of the Parents Teachers Association (PTA).

The letter was sent to the school on April 23 by Sandeep Sangve, education officer of the education department of Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC). Parents of students attending the school's Nerul campus held a silent protest asking to roll back the new uniform decision. They have written a letter to the school's management stating, ""We, the parents of Podar International, totally and unanimously oppose the new uniforms on the basis of the following: Uncomfortable full sleeves shirts for the boys, light coloured bottoms for boys which are impractical for a place like Mumbai which is dusty, the light coloured skirts are a problem for our girls as they will easily stained, the Physical Training (PT) uniforms are gender discrimination that is pink tops for girls and blue for boys.""

It seems the education department issued the letter after the parents complained to the education officer. The letter also states that the school should not force parents to buy stationery from any particular shop. The school has also been asked to follow the government's school bus policy.

In an email, Hina Shah, CEO, Podar Education Group, said, ""A letter received by the school from the NMMC Education Department is being studied for further action. The School has already informed parents that feedback with regards to the new uniforms will be sought from the parents and appropriate changes made for the coming years. Parents have also been informed that during this transitional year, students can continue to wear the old design of uniforms for the first term. The school authorities have had multiple meetings with the PTA members and school parents directly to clear any such doubts. Podar International School - Nerul has provided parents with multiple options to purchase books and uniforms for the 2018-19 academic session. Parents are free to purchase the required items from online vendors and physical shops. There is no compulsion from the school side to purchase from any one vendor. The same has been clearly communicated to the parents. ""

Some of the reasons for the parents' opposition are uncomfortable full sleeves shirts for boys, light-coloured bottoms for both girls and boys. They also claim the PT uniforms discriminate based on gender."

Union Education Secretary Anil Swarup, an IAS officer who was previously the Coal Secretary, told NDTV, ""In coal, the mining was underground and the mafia was above that. In education, the mafia is underground. We are grappling with that.""

Mr Swarup defended the chief of CBSE, Anita Karwal, who has been facing flak ever since the question paper leaks were reported. ""People were baying for her blood without understanding the facts of the case... At least prima facie, she did not have any role to play,"" Mr Swarup said.

He denied the role of any CBSE official. ""So far, there is no complaint of collusion... action will be taken against anyone who is found guilty,"" Mr Swarup told NDTV.

A CBSE official was suspended and three men in Delhi were arrested last week over the leak of Class 12 Economics board exam papers. The suspended CBSE official was in charge of the exam centre where the leak took place

While Class 12 students will have to sit for a re-exam of the Economics paper on April 25, the government last week said Class 10 students will not have to take an exam again for the CBSE Mathematics paper that was leaked before the exam last month.

The CBSE had announced that the re-examination for Class 12 Economics would be held on April 25. On Saturday, three people were arrested in Himachal Pradesh for allegedly leaking the Class 12 Economics paper."

Images of the 'question paper' purportedly went viral on WhatsApp one hour after the official time of the exam from an exam centre at Barshi in Solapur district.

Barshi education officer Vishnu Kamble, who filed a report after conducting an inquiry, stated that the question paper did not go viral from the Barshi exam centre. WhatsApp images of the 'question paper' that a section of the media alleged to have gone viral, and the video clips circulated must be investigated by the cybercrime department, he added.

He said there were adequate security measures at the centre and the exam centre head had on statement said no malpractice had happened on their premises. Board officials received information that the paper went viral from Barshi in Solapur district from exam centre number 0440, Dnyanadeep Ashramshala.

B K Dahiphale, chairman of the Pune division that includes Solapur sub-division, ordered an inquiry. Dahiphale said, ""The education officer in Barshi was told to check about the paper going viral and another video that had gone viral on WhatsApp.""

Kamble arrived at the exam centre at 2.05pm after receiving instructions from Dahiphale. After a day-long inquiry with the centre's officials and the police officers present there, Kamble submitted a report to the Pune division stating that the English paper had not gone viral from the Barshi centre.

Dahiphale said, ""In his report received late on Wednesday, the education officer listed eight points that he gathered after inquiry and inspection of the exam centre.""

The exam centre head, Uttam Dhotre, was present on the premises from 10.45am and has given a written statement to Kamble that no exam malpractice such as copying occurred at his centre.

To add to the surprise of many in the department and people visiting the office, he has also got the directive pasted on the notice board. Pamphlets displaying charan sparsh nishedh (touching of feet prohibited) have also been put up at prominent spots in the office.

The incident was reported from the office of the district inspector of schools (DIOS) in Bahraich. Rajesh Kumar Pandey passed this written order about two months ago.

However, the practice did not stop, forcing the officer to put the instructions on the notice board. No sooner I reached the office, there would be hoards of people waiting there just to touch my feet. It took me a lot of time just to get to my chamber and another group of people would be waiting for me there, Pandey said. The practice was not only limited to the DIOS, but extended to other influential officers of the department.

I agree that it is an age-old tradition of our Hindu culture, but does it look nice if a teacher who is sometimes elder to you touches your feet? This could also be termed as an extreme example of smarminess, or chatukarita, where people bow down to you and even touch your feet to get their work done, Pandey explained.

Though he refused to divulge the exact nature of favours, a visit to the DIOS office throws up enough hints.

I am a teacher posted in a senior secondary school in the outskirts of the neighbouring district. Agar Pandeyji ki kripa drishti ho jaegi toh mera transfer yehaan ho jaega (It is in the jurisdiction of the DIOS and he can transfer me to Bahraich swiftly), said a teacher present at the office who did not wish to be named.

I know this is ridiculous (passing such an order) but can you suggest any other remedy to avoid this? I am well aware that some teachers have also made it public on social media but I could not find a better solution to end this menace, Pandey said."

However, the district collector on 18 January ordered for withdrawal of the circular with immediate effect and said a show cause notice was being served to the officer concerned to explain his action.

In the circular issued yesterday, Dewas district education officer (DEO) Rajiv Suryavanshi directed the principals and headmasters of all government and private schools to stop using the film's song, titled 'Ghoomar', during cultural programmes in their respective institutions.

""Shri Rashtriya Rajput Karni Sena has submitted a request letter in the honour of Maa Padmavati. It was requested that Hindu sentiments should not be offended by playing Ghoomar song in the cultural programmes being organised in schools. So, do not use 'Ghoomar' song in the cultural programmes in schools,"" reads the circular.

However, Dewas Collector Asheesh Singh said he has asked the education officer to withdraw the circular with immediate effect.

""I came to know about the circular this morning. Only the state government can issue such circulars. The DEO is not entitled to pass such an order. I have directed the DEO to immediately withdraw this order,"" Singh told PTI.

He said the DEO is also being served a show cause notice to explain his action, within three days. The 'Ghoomar' song, featuring actor Deepika Padukone and Shahid Kapoor, was released by the makers of the film recently.

Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan earlier opposed the screening of the film Padmaavat and also instituted an award in the name of the Rajput queen.

Chouhan yesterday announced that the life saga of the queen would be made a part of the state school curriculum from next year so that students learn ""correct history"".

Padmaavat, featuring Padukone, Kapoor and Ranveer Singh in the lead roles, has been facing the wrath of various Rajput groups and political leaders, who have accused filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali of distorting history.

Historians are divided on whether Padmini actually existed. She finds mention in the 16th century epic poem Padmavat.

Earlier scheduled to arrive in cinema halls on 1 December, the release date of the film has been postponed by the makers until further notice."

The inspections will start next week.

The education department has also decided to go lenient on the unrecognised schools in terms of area and facilities. However, they have decided that safety will be the top priority that has to be fulfilled by the schools if they want recognition. Department will also not allow any school running from a residential and rental building.

The leniency have been brought in as the government schools, too, will not be able to adjust all the students studying in unrecognised schools.

Nearly, 15 unrecognised schools have given representations after TOI mentioned about the four committees recommending only seven out of total 65 schools who had applied for recognition. Some of the schools that have submitted representation have been running for more than two to three decades.

An official from the education department informed that the schools in their representation had shared that their schools were better than many of the seven schools, that the four committees have mentioned. ""The DEO has inspected the seven schools and has also found that some of them do deserve recognition. DEO, being the nodal officer for schools, has decided to inspect all the schools personally and make a decision,"" an official told TOI.

""There are some schools, we got to know about, which have been allotted land in the name of education trust and have been doing very well. They have CCTV cameras and smart classes. We feel such schools deserve a chance as they are teaching only till primary and are imparting quality education,"" an official said.

The four committees formed to inspect the schools had in their report recommended only 7 out of 65 schools for the grant of recognition. There are more than 15,000 students studying in 57 unrecognised schools.

As per the report, no government school in areas like Manimajra, Mauli Jagran, Hallomajra and Industrial Area, was asked to accomodate students from unrecognised schools as they are already overcrowded. None of the schools in these areas was recommended for granting recognition. However, the department has found some schools that are better than the seven schools which were recommended by the committees.

Also, the officials of education department are planning to go to Delhi to study the rules followed by Delhi government in granting recognition. ""They have granted recognition to schools operating in just 16 marlas. They have become lenient. We will study their methodologies and see, what among those can we implement here,"" said an official.

The education department has also decided to give a chance to the deserving (those fulfilling most of the norms) schools to fulfill norms.
