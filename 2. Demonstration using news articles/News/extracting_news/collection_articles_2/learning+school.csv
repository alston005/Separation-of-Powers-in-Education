It is a workspace where students, teachers and parents can tinker with tools and technology to explore, learn and create prototype solutions to solve problems, related to their passion. With an area of over 2000 sq. ft, the space hosts an array of emerging technology such as 3D printers, laser cutters and augmented reality equipment.

The school's existing expedition or project based curriculum will now have components of engineering, product building and design thinking through the HXLS Makerspace. It will introduce learners to tools and technologies pertinent to the 21st century and transform them into creators rather than mere consumers. Students will be introduced to the art of creative coding and digital fabrication.

In creative coding, students will be empowered to create programmable solutions with computers by engaging in real world problems and working on design challenges in which they learn to innovate using emerging tools and techniques. Digital fabrication will be introduced with the help of 3D printing, enabling students to learn through physical representation and exploration with multiple design challenges.

Manit Jain, Co-Founder of The Heritage Group of Schools said, ""The addition of the HXLS Makerspace is an important extension of our experiential learning curriculum. As a school, our constant endeavour is to prepare our students for the 4th industrial revolution. HXLS Makerspace will be an important step towards building our students' problem solving and critical thinking skills that are necessary for them to thrive in the 21st century.""

Working on Makerspace projects will equip students with abilities such as decision-making and accountability, foster sensitivity and creativity through design thinking, tinkering, breaking and creating. It will help them master ambiguity through problem solving and adapting to change and help them embrace failure by advocating the idea of ""learning by doing"". (NewsVoir)"

The alarm bells sounded in the economic survey over quality of education and the need for skill enhancement haven't gone unheard. Arun Jaitley has launched 'revitalisation of infrastructure and systems in education' (RISE) scheme with a targeted spend of Rs 1 lakh crore till 2022.

Under 'Operation Digital Board', the government aims to replace blackboards with elearning platforms by 2020. Two new schools of planning and architecture and 18 other IITs and NITs will also be set up.

Budgetary allocation for school education and literacy recorded a 7.86% increase as the government committed to treat education ""without segmentation"" from pre-nursery to high school.Stating that education accounts of 5% of budgetary allocations, HRD minister Prakash Javadekar said: ""The government is planning a non-segmented school education scheme to replace SSA and RMSA, which will include children from pre-nursery to Class X.""

Funding for Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan -- strategic funding to higher educational institutions -- has been hiked by Rs 100 crore, and Higher Education Funding Agency gets Rs 2,750 crore more.

The hikes are, however, seen as insufficient by activists. ""The 11.6% increase for SSA is insufficient for realisation of RTE. Even secondary education has been neglected. The promised allocation of 6% of GDP has not yet been achieved,"" said Ambarish Rai, national convener, RTE forum.

Despite the digital drive, allocation for Digital India e-learning for school and higher education has decreased from Rs 0.14 crore to Rs 0.01 crore. The Rs 125 crore for language teachers in the last Budget is missing."
