In yet another case of teacher's tyranny against students, a school in Andhra Pradesh is making headlines after a video revealed five students standing naked under the scorching Sun.

The horrifying incident took place on Wednesday after the class 3 students of Chaitanya Bharati English Medium School at Punganur in Chittoor district came late to the class.

The students were forced to strip naked by teacher Bhuvaneshwari as an act of punishment.

The angry parents have staged a protest along with Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) party workers and demanded the authorities to cancel the registration of the school for such abusive acts.

Child rights activists have also taken the case to the local authorities to take strict action against the school. A complaint has also been filed by Mandal Educational Officer (MEO) against the school management with Punganur police station.

The District Educational Officer (DEO) of Chittoor, Dr K Panduranga Swamy, told International Business Times, India: ""An investigation is underway and as the school management has violated the child rights, the registration of the school will be cancelled from the year 2019-2020.""

""The district collector has also been informed about the seriousness of the issue and stringent actions will be taken against the management and principal of the school, Nagaraju,"" he added.

This is not the first such incident in the state. In 2015, a teacher of a private school in Eluru in West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh had thrashed a girl student of class 1 and made her sit on a stone, naked in the hot sun, as a punishment for not doing homework.

In the same year, another teacher from a government school in Bheemunipatnam Mandal, Vishakapatanam, asked two students to remove their shirt and stand under the sun for three hours, as a punishment for not doing the homework."

In order to favour a girl student, an Una-based teacher allegedly leaked the CBSE Class XII economics paper in March this year, stated the chargesheet filed by the Delhi Police in the paper leak case, a senior police officer said on Friday.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) G. Ram Gopal Naik confirmed that a chargesheet was filed on December 20 in a city court. The police has filed a chargesheet of 482 pages against 10 persons in the paper leak case.

The chargesheet has cited 78 witnesses including the girl student, for whom her teacher leaked the paper and some students who had received the papers through WhatsApp, said another officer.

Recovered mobile phones, handwritten notes, question paper written by the girl student and other data retrieved from cell phones have been cited as evidence.

""The teacher, Rakesh Kumar, wanted to favour a girl student and with the connivance of bank officials, he got the economics paper and brought it to his residence. He called the girl home and she copied the paper. He then clicked pictures of the paper and circulated it. The girl is one of the witnesses in the case,"" said the officer. Since the teacher had access to the papers, he also leaked Class 10 mathematics paper in the same way to favour a relative in Ferozpur whose son was appearing for the exams.

Along with Mr. Kumar, branch manager of Union Bank of India Sheru Ram, head cashier of the same bank Om Prakash and a 40-year-old woman, who had circulated handwritten question papers of Class XII economics and Class X mathematics through WhatsApp from her mobile phone, were also arrested and have been named in the chargesheet as accused.

Two others -- Amit Sharma and Ashok Kumar -- who worked at the DAV School along with Mr. Kumar, have also been named in the chargesheet. In another development, the police had also busted another module being operated by two teachers of Mother Khazani Convent School in Bawana.

In the Bawana module, three men, including two teachers of the private school, were involved. The teachers -- Rishabh and Rohit -- had taken photographs of the economics paper and sent it to Tauqeer, who used to give private tuition. Tauqeer circulated the paper among his students about an hour before the examination commenced, the police had said, adding, he had received the paper via WhatsApp from Rishabh and Rohit.

The principal of Mother Khazani School, Praveen Kumar Jha, was arrested in July and his name also figures in the chargesheet, the officer said. The economics paper leak was exposed after an envelope containing four images of a handwritten copy of the question paper was delivered to the CBSE headquarters in Delhi on the evening of March 26, the day of the exam.

On March 30, the Central Board of Secondary Education announced it would reconduct the Class 12 economics exam across the country on April 25. Besides the Class XII economics paper, the mathematics paper of Class X had also surfaced online before the scheduled examination.

The police had registered two cases in connection with the paper leak. The first case related to the leak of economics paper was registered on March 27, while the other pertaining to the leak of mathematics paper was filed on March 28."

On Sunday, a man complained to the cyber cell that his daughter, a class X student, was being bullied by an unidentified person on social networking site Facebook for a week.

The offender had posed as a mathematics teacher and after some conversation, had started sending her vulgar posts. He also tried to engage her in similar conversation.

""When my daughter blocked him, he started harassing her through Facebook messenger. He bullied my daughter for blocking him and threatened her that he would morph her pictures and make them viral. Hence, we approached the police,"" said the complainant.

Two other cases were reported from Hassanganj and PGI police stations on Saturday. In the first, a miscreant impersonated the profile of a girl and started uploading sleazy posts. The victim lodged a case at PGI police station and also informed the cyber cell. In Hassanganj, the parents of a schoolgirl lodged a complaint against their neighbour for sending her lewd messages continuously.

According to the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE), candidates scoring 50% and above in secondary or an equivalent exam can seek admission to ITEP, generally described as a four-year BEd course. ITEP proposes awarding the aspiring teachers Bachelor of Arts or BSc degrees based on the subject of their choice at the end of the programme.

Unlike the current BEd, the programme will include two different courses: ITEP primary education and ITEP upper primary to secondary education. Currently, an undergraduate degree in any stream is the minimum eligibility criterion for BEd.

The new programme integrates general studies comprising mathematics and science and social sciences and humanities with professional studies which includes perspectives in education, other core education courses, curriculum and pedagogy of school subjects and practicals related to the tasks and functions of a school teacher.

It is expected to equip aspiring teachers with the requisite attitude, pedagogical skills and knowledge to address the challenges of becoming an effective school teacher, with the help of best practices in the field of teacher education, according to a related circular gazetted by the Centre last month.

NCTE, which is a statutory body of Government of India, and works on curriculum related to teacher education, kickstarted the application process for running ITEP from December 3. Higher education institutes offering UG and PG courses in the fields of liberal arts and humanities, social sciences and sciences can apply for permission to offer the course. Those who already have teacher education programmes are also eligible for seeking sanction, the notification said.

Institutions will be granted permission for the course for 2019-23 in the first phase; the last date for submitting applications is December 31, 2018. Call NCTE's helplines 011-23270176 or 23379186 for more information."

The Bombay High Court recently held that ""ghastly and heinous"" crimes, such as rape, when they take place in villages, have a serious impact on the minds of villagers and also place question marks on the future of minor victims in view of the socio-economical backwardness of the areas.

A division bench of Justice S S Shinde and Justice A S Gadkari refused to enhance the sentence sought by the state of a male class teacher and the headmistress of a primary school for raping a Class VII girl and abetting the crime, respectively. A sessions court in Raigad, Alibaug, had convicted the class teacher and the headmistress under rape and abetment charges, along with charges under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, and sentenced them to 10 years in prison.

When the girl went in, the headmistress locked up the room from the outside. The class teacher then removed her clothes, took photographs of her and raped her.

She informed her mother about the incident but got no support to file an FIR. On January 22, 2013, the girl went to a police station and filed a complaint.

The bench observed that after considering the evidence, it was found that the evidence of the student is ""consistent, reliable and trustworthy"". She specifically said that the class teacher committed the crime and the headmistress abetted it, the bench noted.

The court also considered the statement of a witness, who said that when the class teacher's mobile phone was checked, it was found that it had as many as 15 obscene photographs of girl students.

The court said: ""The accused No. 1 (the class teacher) being in the profession of a teacher of the school, was having no reason to have such photographs in his mobile phone.""

The bench added that the trial court has awarded ""appropriate"" sentence and ""no case is made out for enhancement"" of sentence."

Conceived in 2013-14 by Shyamkant Anwane, the professor has trained 150 students in the last five years. As many as 140 have joined the one-year programme this time.

The professor believes the tutorials will help students in scientific fields, competitive exams and make the routine BSc course meaningful and technically sound. Explaining about the 'flipped classroom', he said he borrowed the idea from IIT-Bombay which has been providing lectures before holding class. ""When students come to class after hearing lectures, it triggers the process of thinking on the subject,"" he said.

According to the professor, flipped classroom allows them to do away with monotonous theoretical part while students explore their creativity in the 'Maple' lab during their free time in college. During the certificate/diploma course, students are taught the mathematical software named 'Maple' which is used in computing complicated equations, data analysis and plotting 2D or 3D graphical functions.

""Understanding of the subject becomes clear and students start ideating. Generally, students need to take up additional course after or during their degree programmes to learn the software. The syllabus is approved by the Nagpur University. However, students are encouraged to be innovative by applying ideas coming in their minds,"" Anwane said.

He added that the initiatives by college's department of Physics is limited to its students but from next year, the doors would be opened for outsiders as well.

""Learning physics along with Maple is certainly mould young minds to be innovators. We have been encouraging students to execute new ideas and never hesitate to open up for discussions,"" he said.

""In the academic session 2018-19, we plan to reach to maximum students through this CoC in the form of flipped e-classroom. We have uploaded six video lectures on Maple on YouTube which the students should listen to before reporting to the Maple Laboratory for hands-on experience. Some PDF worksheets on Maple are also made available on Google Drive.

Talking about teaching method, Anwane said students need to register online and subscribe the YouTube channel. Those not having access to smartphones or Internet are given hard copies.

""Whenever students have free slots or off lectures, they hear the lectures. So, there is no need to follow a timetable. We are maintaining the attendance in the lab along with their YouTube activity to ensure they go through the study material,"" he said.

How the course is run

In flipped classroom, online lectures are provided before the actual class is held. Students can go through them as many times as they need unlike a traditional classroom where the teacher delivers one lecture on a topic. Pre-hand involvement of students ensures meaningful interaction with the teacher later. Discussion on various points as well as problem solving is done. This opens scope of bringing out students' innovation and creativity.

A woman teacher has lodged a complaint in this regard.

According to the police, the incident came to light through the good touch bad touch programme launched by the school to create awareness about molestation and sexual harassment cases. The FIR under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act was lodged on Thursday.

According to the Hinjewadi police, the 40-year-old teacher who molested the 12-year-old has been arrested. The victim along with her friend was sitting on the bench when the perpetrator asked her to get up and forced himself on her.

The girl being young and naïve to such adult overtures did not realise it initially, but through the good touch and bad touch programme became convinced that she was molested. According to the police, there is a strong possibility that the child molester has done similar type of offences and his background check is being done.

The said teacher was transferred to Hinjewadi due to some bad character related issues, police said.

Meanwhile, former corporator and activist Maruti Bhapkar has petitioned to chief minister's office (CMO) pointed out that the series of Pocso related offences and ineffectiveness of the police to rise to the occasion and provide relief to the citizens demanded strict action against the police officials.

Mere attaching the police officials of the lower rung will not yield results as punitive and disciplinary action against the supervisory officers is the immediate need of the hour failing which the fear of law and order and police will slide further in the days to come, Bhapkar stated in a written complaint to the CMO.

Meanwhile, Vijaya Rahatkar, Maharashtra state commission for women chairperson also visited the families of the victims and heard their grievances. The Pimpri Chinchwad police are facing severe criticism from several quarters for their inept handling of the cases related to molestation and Pocso from the area residents and activists.

Recently, the Hinjewadi police came in for sharp criticism after they kept a young IT professional waiting for four hours and refused to lodge an FIR.

The roll revision drive is taken up by the Election Commission of India for next year's General Election, and Gandevi taluka's mamlatdar S D Chaudhary asked the police on Monday to pick up the three teachers and present them at his office on Tuesday.

Three BLOs -- all teachers at village primary schools -- had failed to turn up when the exercise was carried out in Gandevi on Monday: Manisha Raman Patel of Undach village primary school, Nidhi Bharat Patel (Antaliya), and Geeta Arun Patel (Gadat).

Calling it a ""humiliation by the mamlatdar"", Geeta Patel, 50, said, ""I am teaching for the last 20 years at Undach village. I was given election work at Salej village, which is far. I had earlier requested the mamlatdar to give election-related work in Undach. We are not against work but one should think before assigning such responsibility. We are upset that they sent a police team to our workplace to arrest us.""

On Tuesday, Gujarat chief electoral officer S Murali Krishna said, ""The officials are not supposed to take such action. There were no directions from this office (Chief Election Office), neither was this office informed about this (arrest warrant). I have instructed the district officers concerned to ensure such incidents are not repeated.""

Defending his action, mamlatdar S D Chaudhary said, ""These three teachers failed in doing their duty, so we issued arrest warrants and instructed police to take action.""

The police, he said, ""brought them and they gave us in writing that they will do election-related work"" in future.

Nidhi Patel, 32, was arrested while she was teaching students of class VII, leaving the children shell-shocked, according to those present. Nidhi was taken to the mamlatdar office, where she had to give written assurance that she will finish her election-related work before October 15.

The two other teachers, Manisha Patel, 45, and Geeta Patel, 50, were at a science fair in Vadsarang village of the district. When the police reached there to arrest them, two BJP MLAs present at the venue -- Naresh Patel (of Gandevi constituency) and Piyush Patel (Navsari) stopped them from arresting the duo. They told the police team that the teachers would go to the mamlatdar office on Monday evening, once the science fair wound up.

Both went to the mamlatdar office in the evening and gave a written undertaking that they would do all election-related work assigned to them.

Navsari District Teachers' Association president Dilip Patel, who reached the office to support the teachers, said, ""Arrest warrants are not proper; they create a poor impression of teachers on students' minds....

""We also approached the school but the principal has asked us to come on Monday,"" he said. The parents have taken the issue to Balala Hakkula Sangham, a child rights body.

In an audio recording doing the rounds on WhatsApp, attributed to the accused Paritala Sunitha, the teacher confesses to punishing the child and seeks the apology of the parents. According to the parents, the teacher also called them up and admitted to beating their son and a few other students. ""She said that she was only disciplining the children and did not hit them hard. She also added that my son's bruises are prominent only because he is fair,"" the father said.

Express, however, could not independently verify the teacher's version as she was not available on phone despite several calls. Meanwhile, though the parents claimed to have lodged a complaint with Jeedimetla police, a police official recounted a different version. ""We insisted that they lodge a formal complaint, but they did not. Until there is an official complaint, we can't take any action against the school or the teacher,"" he said. Child rights activist Achyuta Rao said that the growing incidents of corporal punishment are happening in the city because of the flippant attitude of the Education department in dealing with such pressing issues."

It is really shocking that such incidents are taking place in schools. Last year in December, a complaint was filed against a four-year-old boy for allegedly raping his classmate in a Delhi school.

The issue is truly worrisome and calls for serious attention by parents and school administrators.

The boys are students of Class 7, 8 and 10. The victim is a student of Class 4. The case was registered on August 6, reported HT.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) G. Ram Gopal Naik confirmed that a chargesheet was filed on December 20 in a city court. The police has filed a chargesheet of 482 pages against 10 persons in the paper leak case.

The chargesheet has cited 78 witnesses including the girl student, for whom her teacher leaked the paper and some students who had received the papers through WhatsApp, said another officer.

Recovered mobile phones, handwritten notes, question paper written by the girl student and other data retrieved from cell phones have been cited as evidence.

""The teacher, Rakesh Kumar, wanted to favour a girl student and with the connivance of bank officials, he got the economics paper and brought it to his residence.

Two others -- Amit Sharma and Ashok Kumar -- who worked at the DAV School along with Mr. Kumar, have also been named in the chargesheet. In another development, the police had also busted another module being operated by two teachers of Mother Khazani Convent School in Bawana.

In the Bawana module, three men, including two teachers of the private school, were involved. The teachers -- Rishabh and Rohit -- had taken photographs of the economics paper and sent it to Tauqeer, who used to give private tuition. Tauqeer circulated the paper among his students about an hour before the examination commenced, the police had said, adding, he had received the paper via WhatsApp from Rishabh and Rohit.

The principal of Mother Khazani School, Praveen Kumar Jha, was arrested in July and his name also figures in the chargesheet, the officer said. The economics paper leak was exposed after an envelope containing four images of a handwritten copy of the question paper was delivered to the CBSE headquarters in Delhi on the evening of March 26, the day of the exam.

According to the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE), candidates scoring 50% and above in secondary or an equivalent exam can seek admission to ITEP, generally described as a four-year BEd course. ITEP proposes awarding the aspiring teachers Bachelor of Arts or BSc degrees based on the subject of their choice at the end of the programme.

Unlike the current BEd, the programme will include two different courses: ITEP primary education and ITEP upper primary to secondary education. Currently, an undergraduate degree in any stream is the minimum eligibility criterion for BEd.

The new programme integrates general studies comprising mathematics and science and social sciences and humanities with professional studies which includes perspectives in education, other core education courses, curriculum and pedagogy of school subjects and practicals related to the tasks and functions of a school teacher.

It is expected to equip aspiring teachers with the requisite attitude, pedagogical skills and knowledge to address the challenges of becoming an effective school teacher, with the help of best practices in the field of teacher education, according to a related circular gazetted by the Centre last month.

NCTE, which is a statutory body of Government of India, and works on curriculum related to teacher education, kickstarted the application process for running ITEP from December 3. Higher education institutes offering UG and PG courses in the fields of liberal arts and humanities, social sciences and sciences can apply for permission to offer the course. Those who already have teacher education programmes are also eligible for seeking sanction, the notification said.

Institutions will be granted permission for the course for 2019-23 in the first phase; the last date for submitting applications is December 31, 2018. Call NCTE's helplines 011-23270176 or 23379186 for more information."

In the CCTV footage, the teacher can be seen aggressively approaching the two four-year-olds before taping their mouths with what seems like cello tape. While the boy and the girl did not protest at the time, their parents caught wind of the incident on the same day and registered their displeasure with the school in the form of an official complaint.

An official statement issued by the school principal, Gururaj, read that strict action was taken against the faculty member in question based on a complaint by the parents of the two lower kindergarten students. In her defense, the teacher claims that the students were disturbing the entire class with their conversation and were using 'filthy' language, a claim which is yet to be confirmed.

Following a complaint by the guardians, an inquiry was ordered into the matter which led to the suspension of the teacher.

According to the report, the languages teacher was unhappy ever since the unwell 13-year-old boy named Zhou was transferred to Liancheng Primary School in Quanzhou in Fujian province in September so that he could stay closer to his parents even while receiving chemotherapy treatment for Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The teacher though that the child's health condition could be contagious. In fact, apart from him, several other guardians decided to withdraw their children from the school following the boy's transfer. This made the teacher take the extreme step of isolating the boy from the rest of the class and put him at the back and even stopping him from appearing in examinations.

Zhou initially did not tell his parents about his ordeal thinking it would worry them but after missing three exams, when he returned home with no mark, his parents asked what was the matter and the boy had to reveal the truth.

Pushkar came back home and narrated the incident to his parents when they started asking him why his knees were swollen. He was taken to the hospital first and then to the local police station.

A sessions court in Raigad, Alibaug, had convicted the class teacher and the headmistress under rape and abetment charges, along with charges under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, and sentenced them to 10 years in prison.

When the girl went in, the headmistress locked up the room from the outside. The class teacher then removed her clothes, took photographs of her and raped her.

She informed her mother about the incident but got no support to file an FIR. On January 22, 2013, the girl went to a police station and filed a complaint.

The court also considered the statement of a witness, who said that when the class teacher's mobile phone was checked, it was found that it had as many as 15 obscene photographs of girl students.

The court said: ""The accused No. 1 (the class teacher) being in the profession of a teacher of the school, was having no reason to have such photographs in his mobile phone.""

Conceived in 2013-14 by Shyamkant Anwane, the professor has trained 150 students in the last five years. As many as 140 have joined the one-year programme this time.

The professor believes the tutorials will help students in scientific fields, competitive exams and make the routine BSc course meaningful and technically sound. Explaining about the 'flipped classroom', he said he borrowed the idea from IIT-Bombay which has been providing lectures before holding class. ""When students come to class after hearing lectures, it triggers the process of thinking on the subject,"" he said.

According to the professor, flipped classroom allows them to do away with monotonous theoretical part while students explore their creativity in the 'Maple' lab during their free time in college. During the certificate/diploma course, students are taught the mathematical software named 'Maple' which is used in computing complicated equations, data analysis and plotting 2D or 3D graphical functions.

""Understanding of the subject becomes clear and students start ideating. Generally, students need to take up additional course after or during their degree programmes to learn the software. The syllabus is approved by the Nagpur University. However, students are encouraged to be innovative by applying ideas coming in their minds,"" Anwane said.

""Learning physics along with Maple is certainly mould young minds to be innovators. We have been encouraging students to execute new ideas and never hesitate to open up for discussions,"" he said.

""In the academic session 2018-19, we plan to reach to maximum students through this CoC in the form of flipped e-classroom. We have uploaded six video lectures on Maple on YouTube which the students should listen to before reporting to the Maple Laboratory for hands-on experience. Some PDF worksheets on Maple are also made available on Google Drive.

Talking about teaching method, Anwane said students need to register online and subscribe the YouTube channel. Those not having access to smartphones or Internet are given hard copies.

""Whenever students have free slots or off lectures, they hear the lectures. So, there is no need to follow a timetable. We are maintaining the attendance in the lab along with their YouTube activity to ensure they go through the study material,"" he said.

How the course is run

In flipped classroom, online lectures are provided before the actual class is held. Students can go through them as many times as they need unlike a traditional classroom where the teacher delivers one lecture on a topic. Pre-hand involvement of students ensures meaningful interaction with the teacher later. Discussion on various points as well as problem solving is done. This opens scope of bringing out students' innovation and creativity.

A woman teacher has lodged a complaint in this regard.

According to the police, the incident came to light through the good touch bad touch programme launched by the school to create awareness about molestation and sexual harassment cases. The FIR under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act was lodged on Thursday.

According to the Hinjewadi police, the 40-year-old teacher who molested the 12-year-old has been arrested. The victim along with her friend was sitting on the bench when the perpetrator asked her to get up and forced himself on her.

The girl being young and naïve to such adult overtures did not realise it initially, but through the good touch and bad touch programme became convinced that she was molested. According to the police, there is a strong possibility that the child molester has done similar type of offences and his background check is being done.

The said teacher was transferred to Hinjewadi due to some bad character related issues, police said.

Meanwhile, former corporator and activist Maruti Bhapkar has petitioned to chief minister's office (CMO) pointed out that the series of Pocso related offences and ineffectiveness of the police to rise to the occasion and provide relief to the citizens demanded strict action against the police officials.

Mere attaching the police officials of the lower rung will not yield results as punitive and disciplinary action against the supervisory officers is the immediate need of the hour failing which the fear of law and order and police will slide further in the days to come, Bhapkar stated in a written complaint to the CMO.

Meanwhile, Vijaya Rahatkar, Maharashtra state commission for women chairperson also visited the families of the victims and heard their grievances. The Pimpri Chinchwad police are facing severe criticism from several quarters for their inept handling of the cases related to molestation and Pocso from the area residents and activists.

Recently, the Hinjewadi police came in for sharp criticism after they kept a young IT professional waiting for four hours and refused to lodge an FIR.

The woman had filed a complaint through her lawyer and sought damages from the police commissioner for unprofessional and inhuman conduct of Hinjewadi police."

A teacher was arrested while she was teaching a class full of students and the local police were stopped from arresting two others by the local MLA in Gandevi taluka of Gujarat's Navsari district on Monday after the mamlatdar (chief officer of the taluka) issued a warrant for the trio's arrest for missing electoral roll revision work assigned to them.

The roll revision drive is taken up by the Election Commission of India for next year's General Election, and Gandevi taluka's mamlatdar S D Chaudhary asked the police on Monday to pick up the three teachers and present them at his office on Tuesday.

Government school teachers have been appointed booth-level officers (BLOs) in the electoral roll revision drive, and Navsari district administration had asked all BLOs on Sunday to verify and correct them. Three BLOs -- all teachers at village primary schools -- had failed to turn up when the exercise was carried out in Gandevi on Monday: Manisha Raman Patel of Undach village primary school, Nidhi Bharat Patel (Antaliya), and Geeta Arun Patel (Gadat).

Calling it a ""humiliation by the mamlatdar"", Geeta Patel, 50, said, ""I am teaching for the last 20 years at Undach village. I was given election work at Salej village, which is far. I had earlier requested the mamlatdar to give election-related work in Undach. We are not against work but one should think before assigning such responsibility. We are upset that they sent a police team to our workplace to arrest us.""

On Tuesday, Gujarat chief electoral officer S Murali Krishna said, ""The officials are not supposed to take such action. There were no directions from this office (Chief Election Office), neither was this office informed about this (arrest warrant). I have instructed the district officers concerned to ensure such incidents are not repeated.""

Defending his action, mamlatdar S D Chaudhary said, ""These three teachers failed in doing their duty, so we issued arrest warrants and instructed police to take action.""

The police, he said, ""brought them and they gave us in writing that they will do election-related work"" in future.

Nidhi Patel, 32, was arrested while she was teaching students of class VII, leaving the children shell-shocked, according to those present. Nidhi was taken to the mamlatdar office, where she had to give written assurance that she will finish her election-related work before October 15.

The two other teachers, Manisha Patel, 45, and Geeta Patel, 50, were at a science fair in Vadsarang village of the district. When the police reached there to arrest them, two BJP MLAs present at the venue -- Naresh Patel (of Gandevi constituency) and Piyush Patel (Navsari) stopped them from arresting the duo. They told the police team that the teachers would go to the mamlatdar office on Monday evening, once the science fair wound up.

Both went to the mamlatdar office in the evening and gave a written undertaking that they would do all election-related work assigned to them.

Navsari District Teachers' Association president Dilip Patel, who reached the office to support the teachers, said, ""Arrest warrants are not proper; they create a poor impression of teachers on students' minds.... Why are only teachers selected for election and other work? There are other officials in different government department who can do the same work.""

Calling it a situation of ""pressure created by the mamlatdar"" that forced the police to act ""immediately"", Navsari's Deputy Superintendent of Police S G Rana said, ""Our staff were given the arrest warrant by the mamlatdar and they acted on it. The police did their duty; they have not done anything illegal. (But) I think the police team should have waited until the school hours got over before arresting teacher Nidhi Patel.""

Naresh Patel, MLA from Gandevi and Navsari district BJP president, said, ""I stopped the police from taking action against Geeta Patel. She was busy with students, showing the science project. I spoke with the mamlatdar and the (district) collector. The police action is not good -- they came to arrest a teacher in the presence of students and other dignitaries.""

It is really shocking that such incidents are taking place in schools. Last year in December, a complaint was filed against a four-year-old boy for allegedly raping his classmate in a Delhi school.

The issue is truly worrisome and calls for serious attention by parents and school administrators.

The boys are students of Class 7, 8 and 10. The victim is a student of Class 4. The case was registered on August 6, reported HT.

The victim's sister said that the three senior boys who molested her brother were seated in the rear seats of the school bus.

The girl had refused to go to school and apparently locked her self inside the doors when her parents insisted.

In order to favour a girl student, an Una-based teacher allegedly leaked the CBSE Class XII economics paper in March this year, stated the chargesheet filed by the Delhi Police in the paper leak case, a senior police officer said on Friday.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) G. Ram Gopal Naik confirmed that a chargesheet was filed on December 20 in a city court. The police has filed a chargesheet of 482 pages against 10 persons in the paper leak case.

The chargesheet has cited 78 witnesses including the girl student, for whom her teacher leaked the paper and some students who had received the papers through WhatsApp, said another officer.

Recovered mobile phones, handwritten notes, question paper written by the girl student and other data retrieved from cell phones have been cited as evidence.

""The teacher, Rakesh Kumar, wanted to favour a girl student and with the connivance of bank officials, he got the economics paper and brought it to his residence.

Two others -- Amit Sharma and Ashok Kumar -- who worked at the DAV School along with Mr. Kumar, have also been named in the chargesheet. In another development, the police had also busted another module being operated by two teachers of Mother Khazani Convent School in Bawana.

In the Bawana module, three men, including two teachers of the private school, were involved. The teachers -- Rishabh and Rohit -- had taken photographs of the economics paper and sent it to Tauqeer, who used to give private tuition. Tauqeer circulated the paper among his students about an hour before the examination commenced, the police had said, adding, he had received the paper via WhatsApp from Rishabh and Rohit.

The principal of Mother Khazani School, Praveen Kumar Jha, was arrested in July and his name also figures in the chargesheet, the officer said. The economics paper leak was exposed after an envelope containing four images of a handwritten copy of the question paper was delivered to the CBSE headquarters in Delhi on the evening of March 26, the day of the exam.

On March 30, the Central Board of Secondary Education announced it would reconduct the Class 12 economics exam across the country on April 25. Besides the Class XII economics paper, the mathematics paper of Class X had also surfaced online before the scheduled examination.

ITEP proposes awarding the aspiring teachers Bachelor of Arts or BSc degrees based on the subject of their choice at the end of the programme.

Unlike the current BEd, the programme will include two different courses: ITEP primary education and ITEP upper primary to secondary education. Currently, an undergraduate degree in any stream is the minimum eligibility criterion for BEd.

The new programme integrates general studies comprising mathematics and science and social sciences and humanities with professional studies which includes perspectives in education, other core education courses, curriculum and pedagogy of school subjects and practicals related to the tasks and functions of a school teacher.

It is expected to equip aspiring teachers with the requisite attitude, pedagogical skills and knowledge to address the challenges of becoming an effective school teacher, with the help of best practices in the field of teacher education, according to a related circular gazetted by the Centre last month.

NCTE, which is a statutory body of Government of India, and works on curriculum related to teacher education, kickstarted the application process for running ITEP from December 3. Higher education institutes offering UG and PG courses in the fields of liberal arts and humanities, social sciences and sciences can apply for permission to offer the course. Those who already have teacher education programmes are also eligible for seeking sanction, the notification said.

The 24-second footage, captured in a CCTV camera installed in a classroom at Narayana e-Techno School in Sector 37C, was watched by thousands of people after a ""former"" employee of the school posted it on his Facebook page in the morning. Around 800 students are enrolled in this private school, between nursery and Class IX.

The school authorities claimed that the incident had happened around one and a half months ago, and that they had suspended the teacher seen in the clip immediately after it.

Girish Pandey, who uploaded the video around 7am on Friday, said he was sitting in the school's security room where he watched the incident on one of the CCTV monitors. ""I was shocked to see a teacher pasting sellotape on the mouths of a boy and a girl, both 4 years old, apparently to silence them during a class. There were other students and another woman teacher, who were watching the whole episode in shocked silence.""

School principal Guru Raj said they had taken strict action against the teacher after parents complained about the incident in October. ""Some children come from rural background and use very filthy language. I'm not saying that she had not done it... she has been punished for that. The school handed her the suspension letter within two days,"" said the principal.

Raj said the school had also called parents and explained them everything -- what had happened and what action had been taken.

Surender Sharma, the parent of one of the two kindergarten students who were ""punished for talking in the class"", said, ""My kid is naughty, and the teacher had taken disciplinary action. She told me that she had put paper on the kids' mouths but there was no gum on it.""

Principal Raj blamed Pandey for deliberately triggering a controversy and maligning the school's image.

""The person, who posted this video on the social media, was our transport in-charge. But he has been absent from his duty since Diwali. We gave him two notices since then, and were planning to remove him and hire someone else in his place. He has taken revenge against the school for that,"" the principal claimed.

According to sources, Pandey was looking after six school buses. ""He was also given the responsibility of manning the security room on the campus. He used to monitor the CCTV cameras, and in case of any problem, he used to inform the principal. He had seen the incident (teacher putting sellotape) on the screen and apparently took out a copy.""

But Pandey said, ""I am still working with the school. But since my father is suffering from a tumour ailment, I'm currently in my home town."""

The teacher kept the rod on his table and started teaching. The boy then went to the teacher's desk and quietly managed to take the rod back and kept it in his bag.

Conceived in 2013-14 by Shyamkant Anwane, the professor has trained 150 students in the last five years. As many as 140 have joined the one-year programme this time.

The professor believes the tutorials will help students in scientific fields, competitive exams and make the routine BSc course meaningful and technically sound. Explaining about the 'flipped classroom', he said he borrowed the idea from IIT-Bombay which has been providing lectures before holding class. ""When students come to class after hearing lectures, it triggers the process of thinking on the subject,"" he said.

According to the professor, flipped classroom allows them to do away with monotonous theoretical part while students explore their creativity in the 'Maple' lab during their free time in college. During the certificate/diploma course, students are taught the mathematical software named 'Maple' which is used in computing complicated equations, data analysis and plotting 2D or 3D graphical functions.

""Understanding of the subject becomes clear and students start ideating. Generally, students need to take up additional course after or during their degree programmes to learn the software. The syllabus is approved by the Nagpur University. However, students are encouraged to be innovative by applying ideas coming in their minds,"" Anwane said.

He added that the initiatives by college's department of Physics is limited to its students but from next year, the doors would be opened for outsiders as well.

""Learning physics along with Maple is certainly mould young minds to be innovators. We have been encouraging students to execute new ideas and never hesitate to open up for discussions,"" he said.

""In the academic session 2018-19, we plan to reach to maximum students through this CoC in the form of flipped e-classroom. We have uploaded six video lectures on Maple on YouTube which the students should listen to before reporting to the Maple Laboratory for hands-on experience. Some PDF worksheets on Maple are also made available on Google Drive.

Talking about teaching method, Anwane said students need to register online and subscribe the YouTube channel. Those not having access to smartphones or Internet are given hard copies.

""Whenever students have free slots or off lectures, they hear the lectures. So, there is no need to follow a timetable. We are maintaining the attendance in the lab along with their YouTube activity to ensure they go through the study material,"" he said.

How the course is run

In flipped classroom, online lectures are provided before the actual class is held. Students can go through them as many times as they need unlike a traditional classroom where the teacher delivers one lecture on a topic. Pre-hand involvement of students ensures meaningful interaction with the teacher later. Discussion on various points as well as problem solving is done. This opens scope of bringing out students' innovation and creativity.

According to the police, the incident came to light through the good touch bad touch programme launched by the school to create awareness about molestation and sexual harassment cases. The FIR under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act was lodged on Thursday.

According to the Hinjewadi police, the 40-year-old teacher who molested the 12-year-old has been arrested. The victim along with her friend was sitting on the bench when the perpetrator asked her to get up and forced himself on her.

The girl being young and naïve to such adult overtures did not realise it initially, but through the good touch and bad touch programme became convinced that she was molested. According to the police, there is a strong possibility that the child molester has done similar type of offences and his background check is being done.

Meanwhile, former corporator and activist Maruti Bhapkar has petitioned to chief minister's office (CMO) pointed out that the series of Pocso related offences and ineffectiveness of the police to rise to the occasion and provide relief to the citizens demanded strict action against the police officials.

Mere attaching the police officials of the lower rung will not yield results as punitive and disciplinary action against the supervisory officers is the immediate need of the hour failing which the fear of law and order and police will slide further in the days to come, Bhapkar stated in a written complaint to the CMO.

Meanwhile, Vijaya Rahatkar, Maharashtra state commission for women chairperson also visited the families of the victims and heard their grievances. The Pimpri Chinchwad police are facing severe criticism from several quarters for their inept handling of the cases related to molestation and Pocso from the area residents and activists.

The police have arrested the principal and teacher of a private school in Patna for raping a Class 5 student repeatedly over the last one month.

The incident came to light when the victim complained to her parents of abdominal pain. Following this, the girl was taken for a medical check-up where it was confirmed that she had been pregnant for three weeks.

Police said that the victim was asked by the accused teacher to visit the principal's chamber on the pretext of evaluating her answer sheets. She was raped by both of them in that room.

The police have also disclosed that the principal had made a secret bedroom inside his chamber in the school, where he used to rape the girl.

When the accused principal and teacher raped the girl for the first time, they filmed the act and later blackmailed her.

Initial investigations by the police revealed that the principal and teacher had threatened to make the rape video go viral on social media if she raised the issue with her parents.

""We have arrested the principal and teacher of the school who are the main accused in this case. We have scanned their mobile phones and found pictures of the victim girl. We will get the medical examination of the girl done on Thursday"", said Qaiser Alam, SHO of Phulwarisharif police station.

A teacher was arrested while she was teaching a class full of students and the local police were stopped from arresting two others by the local MLA in Gandevi taluka of Gujarat's Navsari district on Monday after the mamlatdar (chief officer of the taluka) issued a warrant for the trio's arrest for missing electoral roll revision work assigned to them.

The roll revision drive is taken up by the Election Commission of India for next year's General Election, and Gandevi taluka's mamlatdar S D Chaudhary asked the police on Monday to pick up the three teachers and present them at his office on Tuesday.

Government school teachers have been appointed booth-level officers (BLOs) in the electoral roll revision drive, and Navsari district administration had asked all BLOs on Sunday to verify and correct them. Three BLOs -- all teachers at village primary schools -- had failed to turn up when the exercise was carried out in Gandevi on Monday: Manisha Raman Patel of Undach village primary school, Nidhi Bharat Patel (Antaliya), and Geeta Arun Patel (Gadat).

Calling it a ""humiliation by the mamlatdar"", Geeta Patel, 50, said, ""I am teaching for the last 20 years at Undach village. I was given election work at Salej village, which is far. I had earlier requested the mamlatdar to give election-related work in Undach. We are not against work but one should think before assigning such responsibility. We are upset that they sent a police team to our workplace to arrest us.""

On Tuesday, Gujarat chief electoral officer S Murali Krishna said, ""The officials are not supposed to take such action. There were no directions from this office (Chief Election Office), neither was this office informed about this (arrest warrant). I have instructed the district officers concerned to ensure such incidents are not repeated.""

Defending his action, mamlatdar S D Chaudhary said, ""These three teachers failed in doing their duty, so we issued arrest warrants and instructed police to take action.""

The police, he said, ""brought them and they gave us in writing that they will do election-related work"" in future.

Nidhi Patel, 32, was arrested while she was teaching students of class VII, leaving the children shell-shocked, according to those present. Nidhi was taken to the mamlatdar office, where she had to give written assurance that she will finish her election-related work before October 15.

The two other teachers, Manisha Patel, 45, and Geeta Patel, 50, were at a science fair in Vadsarang village of the district. When the police reached there to arrest them, two BJP MLAs present at the venue -- Naresh Patel (of Gandevi constituency) and Piyush Patel (Navsari) stopped them from arresting the duo. They told the police team that the teachers would go to the mamlatdar office on Monday evening, once the science fair wound up.

Both went to the mamlatdar office in the evening and gave a written undertaking that they would do all election-related work assigned to them.

Navsari District Teachers' Association president Dilip Patel, who reached the office to support the teachers, said, ""Arrest warrants are not proper; they create a poor impression of teachers on students' minds.... Why are only teachers selected for election and other work? There are other officials in different government department who can do the same work.""

Calling it a situation of ""pressure created by the mamlatdar"" that forced the police to act ""immediately"", Navsari's Deputy Superintendent of Police S G Rana said, ""Our staff were given the arrest warrant by the mamlatdar and they acted on it. The police did their duty; they have not done anything illegal. (But) I think the police team should have waited until the school hours got over before arresting teacher Nidhi Patel.""

Naresh Patel, MLA from Gandevi and Navsari district BJP president, said, ""I stopped the police from taking action against Geeta Patel. She was busy with students, showing the science project. I spoke with the mamlatdar and the (district) collector. The police action is not good -- they came to arrest a teacher in the presence of students and other dignitaries.""

The incident came to the fore on Thursday, when the five-year-old child's parents saw bruises on his arms, chest and back. ""When we asked our son, he told us that his math teacher had beaten him up with a stick in the class. He is a quiet child.

In an audio recording doing the rounds on WhatsApp, attributed to the accused Paritala Sunitha, the teacher confesses to punishing the child and seeks the apology of the parents. According to the parents, the teacher also called them up and admitted to beating their son and a few other students. ""She said that she was only disciplining the children and did not hit them hard. She also added that my son's bruises are prominent only because he is fair,"" the father said.

The senior students are said to have molested the younger boy thrice in the school bus earlier this month.

What is apalling is that a teacher who was travelling in the same bus is said to have ignored the complaint of the nine-year-old. The boy's family alleged that the teacher did not ask the child for details of the incident.

It is really shocking that such incidents are taking place in schools. Last year in December, a complaint was filed against a four-year-old boy for allegedly raping his classmate in a Delhi school.

The issue is truly worrisome and calls for serious attention by parents and school administrators.

The boys are students of Class 7, 8 and 10. The victim is a student of Class 4. The case was registered on August 6, reported HT.

The victim's sister said that the three senior boys who molested her brother were seated in the rear seats of the school bus.

""There were 16 students besides the teacher and bus staff on the bus. The three boys were seated in the rear. They called my brother and molested him. The other two boys did the same on July 30 and August 1,"" an HT report quoted her as saying."

It was reported on Tuesday that the Class 4 student was allegedly sexually abused by three senior students for three consecutive days in the school bus.

The matter came to light when the girl narrated her ordeal to her parents.

It has also come to light that the girl had already complained to the teacher-in-charge of the bus about the same, but no action was taken against the three senior students.

The girl had refused to go to school and apparently locked her self inside the doors when her parents insisted.

It was only then that the parents of the girl came to know about her alleged sexual molestation by her seniors.

After getting to know what had happened to their child, the parents immediately brought the matter to the attention of the school authorities. The parents alleged that they did not get a strong response from the school authorities and finally decided to take the matter to the police.

In their complaint, they alleged that their daughter was sexually abused and even hit by three of her senior students. The parents said that their child was completely traumatised by the events and was very scared.

On the basis of their complaint, the police have registered a case against the three accused students under the POSCO Act.

However, the school management is yet to take any action against the three accused students. Of the three one is a student of Class 10 and the other two accused study in Class 8th and Class 7th.

Incidents of sexual abuse and molestation have been highlighted even in the past with parents being urged to explain the concept of 'good touch, bad touch.' Psychologists and NGOs working with children have often said that such incidents are often not reported due to fear of possible social stigma. However, such incidents can take a massive toll, especially on impressionable minds of minors."

The incident took place at Hari Prasad High School in Nalhati in Bengal's Birbhum district, about 238 km to the north-west of Kolkata.

The school authorities have convened a meeting of the management committee on Monday to decide the fate of the student.

""Though no formal complaint has been lodged by the teacher, we have taken the matter seriously. Many of our teachers are in favour of expulsion of the student. The final decision will be taken at the meeting of the school management committee,"" said Abdul Kalam Mandal, head master of Hari Prasad High School.

Teachers of the school said the incident took place on Wednesday, when Swadesh Saha was teaching in the class. He noticed Kajal fiddling with his cellphone, which he was holding under the table to avoid the teacher's attention.

Saha asked the boy to keep the phone aside and pay attention.

The student, however, did not stop and continued to play with his phone after repeated warnings. At this point, Saha scolded him and boxed his ear. Kajal retaliated with punches on his teacher's nose.

The teacher started bleeding profusely and fainted. Other students in the class informed the headmaster.

Saha was admitted in Rampurhat Hospital and shifted to a private hospital on Thursday. ""I was shocked by the student's reaction. I am still in pain,"" Saha said from the hospital."
