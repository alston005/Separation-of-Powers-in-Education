Citing a Bombay High Court order, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) refused to provide buildings of shutdown municipal schools to private-aided schools for holding classes.

About 14 private-aided Marathi language schools had requested the municipal corporation to give the premises on rent, as their own buildings were in a dilapidated state.

In the last five years, more than 100 BMC schools have been shut down owing to dwindling student numbers.

""We got applications from 14 such aided schools, seeking municipal schools' premises on rent. Their own buildings are in ruins. However, there is a Bombay High Court order barring to rent out any municipal school building. Hence, we have refused their plea,"" said a senior official in the Education Department.

He added, ""Earlier, BMC had given some of the schools' rooms to non-government organisations and political organisations for educational purposes. But they started using them as offices and for non- educational activities. Due to these irregularities, somebody filed a petition in court. The court ordered the civic body to remove all such offices and keep the schools only for educational purposes.""

""The request from aided schools is genuine. Students in these schools are risking their lives. I will bring this proposal in group leaders meeting and come up with a solution,"" said Education Committee Chairman Mangesh Satamkar.

The civic body data showed that there are over 1,300 BMC schools across the city."

Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy has charged Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi with putting the government in an ""embarrassing and critical position"" by declining to approve release of funds for aided schools.

Mr. Narayanasamy told presspersons here on Thursday that the government had sent a file to Ms. Bedi seeking her approval for releasing funds to 35 aided schools in the Union Territory. But Ms. Bedi returned the file recommending the government to scrap the release of funds to the schools in a phased manner.

This was highly unacceptable, he said.

Stating that detailed guidelines had been framed by the government for release of grants-in-aid and the present rate of grants was fixed in 1957 in the Union Territory, Mr. Narayanasamy said the Lt. Governor did not have any right to interfere in the policy decision of the government.

A sum of ₹44 crore had been earmarked and approved in the budget tabled in the Assembly for aided schools. This included ₹2.92 crore as subsidy towards salaries to teachers and ₹58 lakh as pension for retired staff.

The Chief Minister said the aided private minority schools were providing quality education and catered to the needs of children from economically disadvantaged and middle class families.

The halting of grants-in-aid in a phased manner would affect over 26,000 children studying in these schools, he said.

On one hand, Ms. Bedi had been visiting aided schools and making assurances that salaries to teachers would be released immediately and on the other she has made recommendations to scrap the grants-in aid.

Alleging that the Lt. Governor had been misusing her official position and intervening without authority in the routine administration of an elected government, the Chief Minister said that he had drawn the attention of Ms. Bedi on several occasions to her overstepping the statutory limits. But Ms. Bedi had been going in her own way.

Mr. Narayanasamy said a committee constituted to go into the issues prevailing in the Anglo French Textiles (AFT) mills, Swadeshi and Bharathi mills had submitted its report with recommendations to the government. The Cabinet will soon take a decision on this report.

The government had sought the permission of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs to sell land belonging to the mill at Pattanur to carry out measures for smooth functioning of the mill.

Niti Aayog has planned an Investors' Meet in Puducherry in December. The government has a land bank at Sedurapet in Puducherry and Karaikal and will work to woo investors to the Union Territory, he said.

Education Minister R. Kamalakannan, Parliamentary Secretary to Chief Minister K. Lakshminarayanan were present."

A meeting with chief education officer, four district education officers and directorate of school education officials in Chennai would be held on Thursday through videoconferencing to discuss matters related to installing the biometric attendance system in schools.

""After the meeting we will get to know the schools selected in the first phase to implement the system,"" a school education department official said. On Monday, the office of Coimbatore chief education had sought details regarding changes and upgradations of government and government-aided schools in the respective education districts.

Of these, 3,688 are high schools and 4,040 are higher secondary schools.

The biometric attendance system is being implemented to centralise the attendance of school teachers and ensure that they maintain a regular clock-in time.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has revoked its decision of property tax exemption for several educational institutions. The decision comes following the failure of these institutions to meet certain criteria set up by the civic administration last year. The institutions, that fell under charitable organisations, were claiming benefits under property tax waiver scheme.

In the last two weeks, the BMC's assessment and collection administration has issued notice to several well-known aided educational institutions ordering them to pay their property tax. The issued cropped-up during the standing committee meeting wherein the civic body's decision was criticised.

In January 2017, the BMC had issued a circular demanding for aided education institutions to submit documents to support criteria -- from concession in fee for economically backward students to holding special programmes for needy students. However, around 80 per cent aided schools failed to submit required documents following which the civic body decided to revoke the tax exemption.

Asif Zakaria, Congress corporator from Bandra and standing committee member said the BMC's action is against the law. ""These institutions are registered with Charity Commissioner as charitable organisations and they are entitled to get exemption from property tax under section 143 (1) (a) of the Mumbai Municipal Act 1966. The circular raises various questions on the ambit of the corporation and the charity commissioner.""

Zakaria was backed by Rais Shaikh, SP leader, who said it is unacceptable to cancel the exemption. Father Frazer Masceranhas, manager of St Stanislaus High School, said, ""There is already an economic burden on the school that we are struggling with. The cancelling of exemption will make things worse and we might have to shutdown. We appeal to the BMC to continue with the earlier exemption for property tax."""
