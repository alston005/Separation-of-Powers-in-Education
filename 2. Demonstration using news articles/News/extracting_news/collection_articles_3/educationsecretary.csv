The Department of Education will cancel $150 million in student loans after losing a court battle against an Obama-era borrower defense relief program that allowed people a chance to seek debt forgiveness if their schools shut down and violated the law or misled students. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has been highly critical of the program, which she described in the past as giving students ""free money.""

In a statement, the Department said it has identified nearly 15,000 borrowers who are eligible to have their debt forgiven based on their attendance at a school that closed between November 1, 2013, and December 4, 2018. Around half of these borrowers, the Department said, had attended Corinthian Colleges, Inc. - a for-profit education company that shut down in April 2015.

DeVos, who in May effectively killed a government team that investigated for-profit colleges, wanted to see the borrower relief program terminated. Democrats took her to court after she announced in June 2017 that she would pause the program.

After the loan cancellation was announced, Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray said, ""this is a good first step, but it's not good enough.""

""It's disappointing that it took a court order to get Secretary DeVos to begin providing debt relief to students left in the lurch by predatory for-profit colleges, but I am pleased the Department has finally started implementing this rule,"" Murray said in a statement. ""I call on Secretary DeVos to abandon her attempts to rewrite the borrower defense rule to let for-profit colleges off the hook and instead fully implement the current rule and provide relief to more than 100,000borrowers who were cheated out of their education and savings."""

Earlier, some news reports had claimed the KTU headquarters would be shifted to Malappuram, the home district of Higher Education Minister K T Jaleel. However, Titus said the news reports were false and misleading.

She cited Section 3 (6) of the KTU Act which states the varsity's headquarters should be located in Thiruvananthapuram.

Supply of dollars comes from the export of goods and services and also by inflow of foreign investment, both FDI and portfolio investment. On the other hand, demand for dollar comes from import for goods and services and outflow of foreign investment.

This approach is fundamentally inappropriate, because if RBI absorbs dollars when FIIs bring money, why doesn't RBI supply dollars when they go out? What Can We Do? It is true that Government does not have any control on the factors causing the depreciation of rupee in the recent past. Rising oil prices are leading to increase in Current Account Deficit (CAD). On the other hand increase in interest rates by US Federal Reserves and reduction in income tax rates by US administration are encouraging reverse flow of investment by FIIs. However, in the long run Government has a role to play in reducing the outflow of money by FIIs by making efforts to disciplining them. It is notable that FIIs do not pay any taxes on their profits. Therefore, they don't have any obligation on transfer of money overnight. The government can impose a minimum 'lock-in-period' on the investments made by these FIIs, to keep them invested in India. In some countries tax is imposed on conversion of currency by FIIs, which is known as 'Tobin Tax'. This may also discourage the outflow of investment by FIIs.

In such a situation demand for dollars increase overnight and in view of generally low supply of dollars rupee depreciates. A small scarcity of dollars causes a big fall in value of rupee. However, if we see, India doesn't have any deficiency of dollars per se. Today India is sitting at huge stock of foreign exchange reserves to the tune of more than 400 billion US dollars. Since the beginning of the year 2018 foreign exchange reserves have declined hardly by 11 billion US dollars, despite huge outflow of portfolio investment and rising crude prices.

Justice Sidhharth Mridul asked the senior bureaucrat to appear and explain why he failed to abide with court direction to file an affidavit on status of funds available with government for schools.

It didn't help that Sisodia too put on record that his secretary is ""reluctant to file the counter-affidavit on some misdirected approach"", despite clear instructions. Taking note of this dissonance, HC issued the summons, though making it clear it is for failure to abide by court's directions and not Sisodia's orders that it wants an explanation.

HC had last month asked Centre to clarify why it has not yet disbursed its entire share of money to the Delhi government for improving infrastructure, while asking Delhi's education secretary to apprise it of the status of finances allocated for schools.

However, in his affidavit, Sisodia alleged that despite instructions the secretary hasn't agreed to file an affidavit, which is why he is outlining the status on allocation and disbursement of Centre and Delhi government's respective shares in relation to provision of funds for creating the educational infrastructure for the year 2018-2019.

Sisodia told court that as per budget approved by legislative assembly, LG and Centre, Rs 3,500 crores has been allocated for education department for 2018-19. Out of that, Rs 2,100 crore earmarked by the Centre for improving Delhi government schools as per 60:40 ratio. The Delhi government said it has till now been allocated only about Rs 258 crores from the overall corpus by Centre.

HC is hearing a batch of petitions filed by children from various government-run schools complaining about the absence of infrastructure and violation of their Right to Education. On behalf of the students', advocate Khagesh Jha submitted that some of them are forced to study in schools that run in shifts as the building can't accommodate children of the locality in single shift.

Jha argued that Delhi government had earlier assured it will construct 1,200 classrooms and 30 new schools in the current financial year, ""but the process is slow due to non-disbursement of funds by the Centre."""

Since 2013, we are working to make it a smart school and better than private schools. At least Rs 27 lakh were spent by NRIs and other donors to revamp the school building, make smart classrooms, install computers, education park and library. It wasn't an option to keep quiet and let NHAI raze our school. I had no other place to make 102 children sit , that too, after seeing a model school being razed. The land of our school is also donated by villagers, it is not owned by the government. So, villagers were also very angry and refused to provide any other piece of land for a new building.""

Former White House adviser Omarosa Manigault Newman claims in her new book, ""Unhinged,"" that President Donald Trump once referred to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos as ""Ditzy DeVos"" and said he would soon ""get rid of her.""

This allegedly occurred after a disastrous visit to Howard University in May 2017, in which DeVos was protested and booed by the student body. Manigault Newman, who studied at Howard, joined DeVos on her trip to the campus and said it was ""painful to experience.""Manigault Newman also accompanied DeVos the following day for an event in Florida, but was apparently ditched at the hotel by DeVos's motorcade.

The former White House adviser claims DeVos called and told her to take an Uber to the event, but she was livid and opted to take one to the airport instead.

Manigault Newman wrote, ""We'd been booed by the entire auditorium. People were angry. There were protesters. I'd been getting death threats daily. And she'd left me completely alone with no security?""

After she returned and gave the president a summary of what transpired, Manigault Newman claims Trump ""shook his head in disgust"" and suggested he would fire DeVos in the near future.

""[Trump] said, 'She is Ditzy DeVos, what do you expect? In a very short period of time, I will get rid of her. Believe me, believe me,'"" Manigault Newman wrote.

Manigault Newman then expressed dismay that DeVos is still secretary of education and said she's ""destroying the education system in this country.""""The depth and breadth of [DeVos's] ignorance is a travesty for the children. ... She's woefully inadequate and not equipped for her job. She is just as horrible as you suspect she is,"" Manigault Newman wrote.

The Department of Education did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment on the story.

The White House has dismissed Manigault Newman's memoir as the product of a ""disgruntled"" former employee and said it's ""riddled with lies."" Trump on Monday also referred to Manigault Newman as a ""lowlife.""

Manigault Newman has also already made public statements in the past week that have contradicted allegations made in her book, adding to questions surrounding the credibility of her claims."

In a rare move, the UT education department has served show cause notices, suspension and even termination notices to teachers due to poor Class X CBSE results in government schools. Teachers retaliated by staging protests against the ""unfair"" action and criticised the no-detention policy under the Right to Education Act and the Continuous Comprehensive Evaluation system.

With another year left for his tenure to get over, Education Secretary BL Sharma talks to Indian Express to explain why teachers should be more responsible and how the system can be strengthened from the inside.

Teachers have been up in arms against the education department of late for serving show cause notice, suspension and termination notices. Do you think it is feasible for this dissatisfaction to breed? After all, teachers directly deal with students.

Instead of looking inward and resolving to perform better, teachers are spouting absurdities. Their stand is illegal, immoral and harmful for the future of the students. A large number of teachers have failed miserably and because we took a symbolic action against poor performance, they are ready to spoil students' career.

This is a crucial year as the students who have been promoted to Class 9 have studied eight years under the Right to Education Act. They have never failed an exam before. What measures is the department going to take to improve the results in government schools?

We will be taking up a number of issues in the next 5 to 10 days, starting from rationalisation of manpower in schools. We have recently deployed 15 principals and heads where they were needed. We will put a full stop to the grace marks policy. Those teachers whose performance is not up to the mark are already holding remedial classes for students who have failed to clear the exam. I have strictly told principals and heads that they should perform and lead from the front. If a teacher is not performing well, then that should reflect in their ACR. We have also requested the State Council of Educational Research and Training to hold training sessions for subjects in which students have performed poorly.

Teachers have alleged that they were forced by the district education department to give grace marks to promote students to Class 10 as a ""one-time"" chance. Will there be any monitoring within the department to keep a check on the promotion of such practices?

If need be, we will transfer department officials who are not performing up to the mark. I have told my people too that they have to bear the responsibility as they are the link between the schools and the government. I will ensure performance-based action and keep officials on their toes.

Teachers have also blamed policies such as no-detention and CCE.

I agree that the no-detention policy is unhealthy and the government, I think, is making some amendments to that. But it cannot be an excuse for teachers who have performed poorly. There are those who have performed exceedingly well too, including teachers, in some periphery schools.

What are the landmark achievements in education policies that have benefited teachers and students in the last decade?

In my time, I sat on mats and walked 6 km to school daily. Our schools did not have free lunches or proper toilets. But our teachers were excellent. Things have changed for the better now. Policies such as the mid-day meal and free education have opened up new avenues. Focus on student-teacher ratio, scientific methods of teaching and holistic development have brought a revolutionary change even in areas where resources are limited.

You have another year to go. How has your experience been so far?

Teachers get handsome salaries compared to other states and UTs. The transport and civic facilities in school are excellent. We have some brilliant principals, heads and teachers too and a lot of talent among the students. But the only issue is of monitoring that we will take up to the best of our ability. Students will be tested internally and they will be trained to appear for the board examination. I also feel that students should work hard because nothing is insurmountable. With regular testing, they will be sensitised with how to appear for these exams. We will arrange for talks and seminars to motivate them"

UT Education Secretary B L Sharma demanded at least 75 per cent results in Classes X and XII from all the principals and school heads at a meeting on Thursday afternoon.

At the meeting, he ""admonished"" some for behaving like ""unionists"". Teachers of government schools in the city have been up in arms against the department for issuing termination, suspension and show cause notices for poor Class X CBSE results.

""A couple of people were admonished for being unionists. Unions are for labourers; principals and heads are at the level of officers. So, why are they behaving this way? For the system to improve, they too have to contribute and achieve certain targets,"" said Sharma. He added that heads were appointed to manage and improve their institutions and mobilise their resources.

Sources said the meeting went on for two hours and the department officials also congratulated those who had performed well.

They, however, claimed that officiating principals, in-charges and vice-principals were not invited to the meeting. A number of schools are functioning with them at managerial positions.

""I congratulated and praised people who have performed well. Some principals and heads have got above 90 per cent results, but below 60 per cent there were too many,"" further stated the education secretary.

People who have performed miserably need to be admonished, he added, and there was no point in raising such a hue and cry by those who have not done their job.

The department is planning to bring about structural and administrative changes, too. Teams consisting of principals have been formed to monitor schools at the ground level so that the deficiencies are clear. The principals of Government Model Senior Secondary School (GMSSS), Sector 46, GMSSS-10, 16, 18, 20B, 22, 27C, 33, 35, 37D, Dhanas, Khuda Ali Sher, and MHC Manimajra are members of these teams.

As for the show cause notices, Sharma said he could not do everything at once even though teachers, principals and heads should face some punishment.

""Teachers should be aware of the consequences; in the private sector, they would have been laid off overnight for poor performance. The number of poor performers is huge. The show cause notices will remain for now, but there will be no penalty as the idea is to reform,"" he added.

On July 10, the department held a press conference where it highlighted the poor Class X CBSE results and the teachers' protests against termination, suspension and show cause notices."

TEACHERS GET good salaries and all the benefits of a government job; the least they could do is teach instead of sloganeering, said Education Secretary B L Sharma. On Tuesday, officials of the UT education department held a press conference where they highlighted the poor Class 10 CBSE results and teachers' protests against termination, suspension and show-cause notices.

In the coming weeks, however, the UT education department will hold meetings with principals, school heads and teachers to come up with solutions to improve board examination results.

""How can we explain such poor results in a city like Chandigarh that has all the comfort, great infrastructure in the schools? Is a pass percentage below 50 per cent acceptable?"" asked Sharma. The department shared information on the ""disciplinary"" action taken against principals, school heads and teachers. One principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School (GMSSS), Karsan, was suspended for less than 20 per cent result in Class 12.

In Class 10, four school heads were suspended for less than 20 per cent. Show-cause notices were served to 26 school heads and three in-charges were transferred to periphery schools as ""punishment"" for less than 20 per cent result.

Show-cause notices were also served to 60 teachers who have recorded less than 33 per cent result. While two Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) teachers were served one-month termination notice, one contract teacher was terminated and another regular teacher suspended for less than 15 per cent result.

""If the government wants, it can take away all the departments from me. I am ready to suspend my own officials, but who's going to take stock of teachers' responsibility? Show-cause notices are just a means to get an explanation from them,"" said Sharma.

Sharma also criticised his own department for following ""wrong practices"" in the past. He added that despite a commendable performance in the National Achievement Survey, Chandigarh has been left behind in the board examination.

""I am strictly against grace marks and I have briefed my department officials that such practices will not be followed in future. Had I been aware of it, I would have done something. In an age where students are getting above 95 per cent, grace marks do not make sense,"" he said.

The Education Secretary added that the department was taking corrective measures to change the system. He said Chandigarh was a city of ""sifaarish"" and policies such as transfer, promotion and seniority were stagnating here.

""I am not at all in favour of permanent employment at one place. We will be looking into transfers with those who have stayed the longest at one place to be moved first. I made the draft seniority list that had been pending since 1990, but not a single person was finalised because even the criteria is disputed,"" he added."

The letter from both House and Senate members including Senator Marco Rubio, says Huawei's partnerships with more than 50 US universities ""threatens national security.""

""China is using Huawei to position themselves to steal American research through so-called 'research partnerships' with American universities to exploit the openness of our system of higher education,"" Rubio said.

Huawei and other Chinese state-directed telecommunications companies should not be allowed to operate in the United States. ""We should put them out of business by denying them the ability to buy US semi-conductors,"" he demanded.

Rubio along with Congressman Jim Banks raised several concerns with DeVos on Chinese state-directed Huawei Technologies' partnerships with US universities that may pose a significant threat to national security.

""Our intelligence community has warned about this exact type of national security threat for over a decade. Huawei is a state-directed entity that uses academic surveillance to spy and collect intelligence on America and our allies,"" Banks said.

""Make no mistake, Huawei cannot be trusted and the Department of Education should work closely with the FBI to address China's attempts to infiltrate America's intellectual institutions,"" Banks said.

In their letter to DeVos, the two lawmakers said that Huawei Technologies, a ""national champion"" of the China, has formed a series of research partnerships with over 50 universities in the United States that threaten national security.

The US intelligence community has warned for years of Huawei's links to the Chinese government and the People's Liberation Army. Huawei benefits from extensive government support, which has fueled long-standing concern that the company's equipment in the US could be used by the Chinese government for spying, cyberattacks or industrial and economic espionage.

""As Huawei describes it, the Huawei Innovation Research Programme (HIRP) provides funding opportunities to leading universities and research institutes conducting innovative research in communication technology, computer sciences, engineering, and related fields.""

Recently Christopher Wray, FBI Director, said he was ""deeply concerned about the risks of allowing any company or entity that is beholden to foreign governments that don't share our values to gain positions of power...it provides the capacity to conduct undetected espionage.""

Admiral Mike Rogers, then Director of the National Security Agency and Commander of United States Cyber Command, added that Government programmes need ""to look long and hard at companies like this.""

""We urge that you promptly request a complete and classified briefing by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Director of National Intelligence on Huawei and Chinese technology acquisition modalities in general (as the technology transfer problem set is bigger than Huawei),"" Rubio and Banks said.

Today, President Donald Trump met with Republican lawmakers after the Senate moved to block a White House plan to allow Chinese telecom giant ZTE Corp. to buy component parts from the US.

ZTE is accused of violating trade laws by selling sensitive technologies to North Korea and Iran. The administration announced an agreement with ZTE earlier this month but has run into opposition in Congress.

Rubio and Banks believe that both ZTE and Huawei as virtual arms of the Chinese government's overall economic aggression strategy should be banned from buying US technology components, even if that means they go out of business."

He must come forward and explain all that has gone wrong under his leadership even as his terms ends

The term of Anil Swarup, School Education Secretary, Government of India, is drawing to a close. We wish him all the very best in his next undertaking. However, at this juncture, one needs to revisit the highlights of his inglorious term which saw an incessant flow of fiascos in the school examinations, assessments and entrance examinations conducted by the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE). It is also disconcerting that the CBSE, which is meant to be an autonomous body, is increasingly becoming an extended arm of the Union Human Resources Development Ministry (MHRD).

No Discussions On New Education Policy; No Data On Achievement Survey

With much fanfare, in February 2018, Swarup announced that the National Council for Education Research and Training (NCERT) had conducted the largest National Achievement Survey (NAS) at the Class X level. This is a nationwide test to assess academic standards. One has not seen any public data or statistics from this assessment, well after over four months. It needs to be kept in mind that such surveys are conducted using taxpayer money, and it is bizarre that those conducting it did not find it worthwhile to release any detailed statistics into the public domain. There have been a few newspaper articles about some of the findings, but this is extremely sparse data. This kind of information needs to go directly to the public, instead of a few handpicked journalists.

Data was released for the NAS at the Class V and Class VIII levels. However, the analysis presented in the form of district- and state-wise report cards, was shoddy and did not offer any insight into how abilities differed by basic factors such as the examination board, which the school was affiliated to. A better route would have been to upload anonymised and bucketed data, without the school name (but including other details such as the board which the school was affiliated to, fee range and zip code among others). That way, the data would have benefitted from the eyeballs of statisticians and data analysts, who would have been able to glean out invaluable patterns and trends, in a manner which is perhaps too ambitious to expect from ill-equipped generalists employed as National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) and HRD officers.

Most worrisome is that there has been no concrete discussion around the New Education Policy (NEP) after the first draft of the NEP was scrapped in 2016. For a country with precious little beyond human capital, one hopes to see a greater sense of urgency around the NEP.

The Entrance Exam Debacle: JEE-Mains And NEET (2018)

The CBSE management should have been taken to task when it emerged that several questions in the JEE Mains (2018) question paper were very similar to those of a mock test conducted by the Narayana coaching chain in 2016. It raises serious questions about the paper setting process of the board and the originality of the questions. The board reacted by filing a case against the whistleblower website which first made this startling revelation, but this claim has also been validated by others, including Narayana students, as is evident in this Quora thread. A Narayana spokesperson did explain that the questions were common and similar to those asked in a practice test conducted by their chain in 2016.

Another Narayana head, speaking to 360, called the incident ""cheating"" by the CBSE board which had lifted Narayana's intellectual property. We don't know what exactly happened, but the public deserves a swift and conclusive explanation or investigation into such issues. If the questions did match, one plausible explanation is that questions were picked up from a common source or a popular book. That in itself should be a red flag, indicating academically unsound practices within the board.

National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) was eventful, once again, with several errors in the Tamil translation of the question paper. The same was the case with the Bengali version of the paper.

This is an extreme case of academic injustice given the amount of preparation which goes into these examinations.

Dismal Handling Of CBSE's Paper Leakage

The CBSE economics re-examination for Class XII was more of a face-saving exercise for the board. Well before the economics examination, the accountancy paper made headlines as it emerged that questions from the paper had circulated on social media, before the examination. CBSE was also aware of surreptitious attempts being made to gain illegitimate access to question papers and had warned examination centre-heads, to take precautions against the same, as early as 4 March.

While it is understandable that the possibility of a leak is not negligible in a country as large as ours, neither Swarup nor Anita Karwal, CBSE chairperson, were apologetic enough to offer the public clear insights into the origin of the leaked papers. Instead, Swarup interrupted and silenced a well respected educator, who was bold enough to broach the topic of the paper leaks at a recent conference in Kolkata. Till now, there has been no transparent explanation by the board, to inform the public about the findings from the investigations into the paper leaks. The dust has practically settled on the issue because we have almost forgotten the episode.

News 18 clearly showed their journalist standing outside a CBSE examination centre with printouts of a handwritten set of questions from the biology question paper (from her WhatsApp messages), before the examination even started. When the biology paper was over, it turned out that the questions matched with those which were in the journalist's possession. The board was informed, but they refused to engage on the matter. The leak of the biology paper was never discussed. Cases of paper leaks and cheating need to be taken with utmost seriousness because it destroys the faith of young and honest students in the country's institutions and systems.

Much Ado Over The Spiking Of Marks

Boards are trapped in a vicious spiral of inflating marks, largely because central universities such as Delhi University follow a bizarre admission process where 97 per cent in the Indian School Certificate Examinations (ICSE) board loses out to 98 per cent in Tamil Nadu board, but wins over 96 per cent in Uttar Pradesh board. It does not seem to appear irrational to any of those in power, that these are scores in different examinations, with different syllabi, and different standards of strictness in marking. Marksheets of Indian boards also fail at offering any insight into the relative standing of candidates. There is no indication of the percentile ranking of a student in the subjects for which he/she took the examination.

The specific issue with CBSE's result is that not only do they inflate scores, but data also indicates that they also favour specific zones such as Delhi and Chennai, and selectively inflate their scores more than others. In addition, they grossly distort the relative ordering, by pushing up everyone within a range of five to 15 marks, to exactly the same score of 95 in various subjects. This creates a spike at the 95 level in CBSE histograms for various subjects because students who actually scored marks as different as 86, 87, 88 and 94 have all been bumped up to 95. These histograms are becoming old now, but for those new to this controversy, this is the kind of inexplicable score distribution observed in many CBSE subjects, the most common characteristic being the astounding spike at 9

A histogram that shows the standard deviation in Math scores

Swarup presided over several meetings and discussions where he convinced several boards such as state boards to stop this artificial inflation of marks. The discussions were vague and lacked the level of statistical detail required in any deliberation over academic assessments. Many states such as Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka have indeed seen a drop rate in their pass percentage and scores, which indicates that they have made some attempt to deliver on their promise to stop inflating marks.

However, after all this, the CBSE itself has not delivered on its promise, in both 2017 and 2018. It has continued to tamper and falsify its scores, with the 95 spike still as prominent as ever. One cannot help wondering whether the fuss made about moderation was less of a systemic reform and primarily to get the state boards to reduce their scores, as there has been much hue and cry about students from southern state boards grabbing a disproportionate churn of coveted seats in Delhi University. It is passing extraordinary that after so much debate and discussion, the board, which functions right under the nose of the MHRD, has once again brazenly tampered with and manipulated its result, without as much as a comment from the School Secretary. This makes us wonder if there was any genuine concern about the academic consequences of grade inflation, or whether the brouhaha about spiking was primarily to get boards other than CBSE to stop inflating scores, to facilitate the smooth sailing of Delhi students into Delhi University.

ISCE has barely 10 per cent of its students scoring 90 and above in mathematics this year, while CBSE has 12.5 per cent of all its passed candidates scoring 95 or more. Similar trends are observed in physics and chemistry as well. These kind of variations penalise boards with rigorous standards of assessment, such as those of Maharashtra and West Bengal.

CBSE has again gone scot-free, without offering any insight into how their scores are transformed, despite strict instructions from a toothless MHRD to all boards, emphasising that they need to be transparent and should upload all details about how marks are changed, before releasing results.

One Set Of Rules For Delhi, Another For The Rest

What is also more serious is that CBSE follows one set of rules for Delhi students, and another set for the rest of the country. The histogram suggests that they inflate everyone's marks, but clear attempts are made to push more Delhi/NCR zone students into the high scoring band above 90. Notice the different shapes of the histograms for Delhi students and non-Delhi students. The latter resembles a distorted bell curve, slightly ajar, whereas the former bears no resemblance to the kind of distribution one would expect for test scores from a public examination. Even last year, the Indian Express had covered how the English scores were rigged to favour Delhi zone. Half of all the 95s in English Core were from Delhi in the 2017 examination.

Observe this 2016 table accessed by the Times of India. In most subjects, Delhi zone students received moderation marks, which were slightly less than the rest of the country, but in English they were bumped up by as much as 12 marks, while the rest of the country received none at all. For most of the popular subject combinations, such as English, physics, chemistry, maths and computers/economics, this kind of an inflation scheme will ensure that a student of Delhi scores at least five marks higher than a student from another zone, submitting exactly the same quality of answer scripts. This of course was before Swarup took over, but the 2017 data revealed similar anomalies in the English marks.

A histogram that explains the standard deviation in English Core scores for Delhi students A graph that presents the standard deviation for English Core marks for non-Delhi students

I think we can all agree that the Delhi University admission process is flawed and unreasonable, but it is reprehensible to address one wrong with another wrong (arbitrary manipulation of marks), when the latter destroys whatever semblance of meritocracy is left in the Indian board exams.

Swarup has rightfully made much ado about India's education mafia but in the absence of clear explanations and apologies about CBSE's paper leaks and anomalous assessment, it is hard to distinguish his accomplishments from the contributions of those whom he flays."

But at the hall, all of them said that they were ready to write the answers in the language of the questions they were given,"" Swarup said."

Speaking on the second day of the conference, RSS general secretary Suresh Bhaiyaji Joshi said that education not only imparts knowledge, there is purity in sacraments too. He said that while looking at the traditions of India, it is found that under decentralized arrangements, education was provided in Gurukul in ancient times. Gurukul not only refer to the school of residential and food system, but it is a tradition that provides sacrament-based education as a whole.

The education that is received on the internet is not education but only information. At present, there is a need to understand boundaries of modern things and move ahead. He said Dakshina is given to Guru and fee is sought from student which reflects the difference between current education system and Gurukul education system. Maintaining Gurukul education system is a challenge. It is necessary to move forward by preserving the spirit of values ??in education, he added.

During the session, principal secretary culture Manoj Shrivastava said that Ujjayini's old name was Mahakalvan. Similarly, Varanasi has been called Anandvan and Mathura as Vrindavan. Providing education in a free environment of the forest was among the ancient traditions. He said that the strategic activities of Gurukul education have to be implemented at the ground level. Shrivastava said that it must be seriously acknowledged that education has collapsed.

To overcome this, education in the open environment is required. Many countries such as Switzerland, Finland and England have worked on the concept of forest schools. The decisive attack on India's early education took place in the colonial era. Current schools neither have agricultural land nor sports ground. Playing with nature gives birth to creativity in a child. Many arts in 64 arts can be a part of skill development, he added.

In the session, Dr Shailendra Mehta said that during Mahabharata period Takshshila is mentioned as the seat of education. During that era, all scientific subjects were taught in universities like Nalanda, Takshshila and Vikramshila. Swami Sevit Somagiri Maharaj said that currently everyone is participating in a blind race in the name of development, nobody should be skeptical about the education of Indian philosophy and science.

Yoga exercise and fantastic presentations of art of war

On the second day, musical performances of Yoga Surya Namaskar, Mallkhamb, Yoga Shikhar etc were performed under physical presentations. Mallkhamb was exhibited by children of Karnwati Gurukul. Baba Saheb Nanal Gurukul Yoga (Ratnagiri, Maharashtra) students made Pyramid. Hemchandracharya Sanskrit School of Karnavati students presented pole mallkhamb and gymnastics. Children of Veer Lokashah Sanskrit Jnanpith (Jodhpur, Rajasthan) staged art of war called Kalaripayutu and Ujjain's Achyutanand Prasadik Jiwajirao Gurukul students presented yoga exercises. Presentations were made with Gayatri Mantra recital in the background.

Symposium on five faculty of Gurukul education

Discussions were held on five different topics of Gurukul education by topic experts. Gurukul's classical education system will again be heading towards mainstream education. At the venue of the programme, five faculty of Gurukul Education, respectively, the school (Knowledge fund), theatre (art), gaushala (agriculture), observatory (yoga) and laboratory (science) were created. In these five faculties discussions were held with experts of different subjects and important information related to the topics that lead to student's all round development. After listening to the discussion in the five faculties, the discussion came to the fore that all gurukulas and their gurus affiliated with the great sage traditions of India have kept the tradition of Indian knowledge, art, agriculture, yoga etc alive. In the life of human beings there should be knowledge of methods of these faculties. The origins of Indian life philosophy should be based on spiritual contemplation, immortality of soul-divineness and life-based truth.

Tejaswakul Kulkarni, Ratan Vasisht, Kapildev Mishra and Anil were the speakers in the laboratory faculty. Speakers in theatre included Dr Sachchidanand Joshi, Amirchand, Acharya Vasudev Krishna Shastri (Nepal) and Acharya CM Krishnaashastri. In Gaushala faculty speakers were Dinesh Marothiya, RP Tiwari, TV Kattimani and Girish Prabhune. Vedhashala faculty speakers included Anirudh Deshpande, Dr Pratima Joshi, Dr Mohanlal Chhipa and Acharya Vednishth. The speakers of school's knowledge fund faculty were Acharya Hariprasad Adhikari, Dr Hemchandra and Acharya Nilkandan who shared various important information related to their respective subjects. During the discussion, the experts of the subjects satisfied queries of attendees and convinced them to take action to implement their suggestions.

Intense discussion on education system

Discussions were held on five pillars of Gurukul. These pillars were the role of parents, ideal students, acharya's responsibilities, contribution of operators and academic discussions. Five parallel sessions were held and attendees were informed about different aspects of gurukul education. On the first subject Ujjawala Patil on behalf of the Indian Education Board, Nagpur, said that parents are the first Guru of a child. The child receives initial education at home. In today's modern era parents do not have enough time for children. Due to lack of time, conceptual distance between children and parents is increasing and Gurukul education is the only system in which children are better understood. Student's every question is answered and their curiosity satiated. Aruna Saraswat said that whether children get education in Gurukul or in any school the role of guardian remains the same.

Arundhati Kawadkar as the speaker in the discussion on ideal student in Gurukul Education, talked about qualities of ideal student. She said that an ideal student desires to be full of sensual and victorious life. Acharya Mahabaleshwar Shastri presided over the session.

Mesmerising cultural presentations

On the second cultural evening, attractive presentations were made by students from different gurukuls. In this cultural evening, different sheds of art was presented. Classical music was presented through various devices by students of Hemchandracharya Gurukul. There were sounds like Naad, Pakhavaj, Sarangi, Santoor, flute, sitar, tabla and drum. After classical music students presented folk songs and rendered melodies which received huge applause from the audience. After this, Lord Ganesha's prayer was recited by Sarvottam Bhakti Gurukul of Ujjain students.

It was followed by attractive dance presented on the Shiva Tandava by students of Gotirtha Vidyapeeth Karnavati. Through the teachings of Lord Krishna, students of Sri Brahma Ved Vidyalaya Sansthan of Varanasi tried to explain that one should not be afraid of problems of the world but wage a war against them. The presentation of this dance was done on popular poem ""Arambh hai prachand"". Udipi dance was staged by Nivratti Gurukul of Karnataka. Kavyavali was presented by Ujjain's Kanva Gurukul."

Anju Sharma, Principal Secretary (Higher and Technical) Education, in an interview with The Indian Express, shares the reforms that the state education department has adopted for better performance of the state's higher and technical educational institutes

In view of the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) rankings, what areas does the Gujarat government need to focus on or improve in higher and technical education?

The government is focussing on reworking the syllabus and the examination system, promoting start-ups, research and innovation, skill based education and use of Information and Communications Technology, among other things, to increase the quality of institutes of higher education.

What steps are being taken to fill posts of professors in government colleges?

The Gujarat Public Service Commission (GPSC) is in the process of filling up posts of principals and professors. In the last five years, more than 2,700 faculty positions have been filled.

What could be the possible reasons for as many as 50 per cent of seats in engineering colleges lying vacant? Have any corrective measures been planned?

The intake capacity of engineering colleges has increased over the years, while the preferences of students have changed. In case of institutes not performing well, or students not opting for some courses or institutes, steps for the closure of the programme or the institute are being taken by All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), and in some cases by the colleges themselves.

What measures are being taken to monitor private colleges flouting University Grants Commission (UGC) norms on infrastructure, faculty and other areas of operation?

Universities closely monitor their establishments and affiliates regarding UGC norms and their compliance. A college's affiliation is renewed only after inspection by a committee.

What are the reasons for the increasing unemployability of Gujarat's youth, especially across technical sectors? Can the course structure or poor quality of education be blamed?

The growth of industries and increased flow of investment to the state, in the recent years, has improved employment prospects for the youth. A fund of Rs 200 crore has been created to convert the concept of job-seeker to job-giver. A 'Student Start-up Policy' has been launched. The Education Department is making continued efforts to revise the curricula to meet the industry standards. Most colleges have set up finishing schools to enhance employability. Every university is now conducting campus placements. Internship programmes have been given a boost. The 'Mukhya Mantri Apprenticeship Yojana' was recently launched to provide job training to about one lakh youths.

SHRC chairperson Justice T Meenakumari passed the orders on Thursday directing the school education secretary to issue instructions to all schools in TN to take steps to save lives of children by conducting pre-tour drills.

The order said the education department should frame guidelines for school authorities while taking children on tours.

As per the report of the education department, the group comprised students from Class VIII to Class XII. Danish Raja, who drowned, was a Class VIII student.

The team had left from Chennai on the night of April 23 and had reached Pune on April 25 morning. The camp was to be held from April 25 to May 2, said officials. One teacher from the maths department of the school had accompanied the students while two other guardians were from the NGO. Representatives from the NGO 'Teach to Lead' along with the principal of the ECI Matriculation School, also met with corporation officials on Thursday.

""You cannot just sack somebody because something went wrong somewhere,"" he says. Such a sacking would certainly make news, he says, but would not solve the problem.

Anil Swarup, the school education and literacy secretary who was the face of the government during the recent Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) paper leak controversy, feels that demands to sack the board chairperson are not justified. Such a sacking would certainly make news, he says, but would not solve the problem. If not found guilty of wrongdoing, the person at the helm should be given a chance to fix loopholes in the system than be asked to walk away, the 1981-batch Uttar Pradesh-cadre IAS officer, who retires in June, tells The Sunday Standard in an exclusive interview.

The government has started an internal inquiry following the CBSE Class X and XII paper leak controversy. What is its status?

The internal inquiry is more to look at the system rather than fixing responsibility. Fixing responsibility is done through police investigation to check whether there is any collusion. So far there is no indication of any collusion of any CBSE official. There was only a finding that a particular official was lax in supervision, though there was no evidence of collusion yet, he was suspended and a formal departmental probe was started.

There is a process of a formal inquiry in the code of conduct rules. So you appoint an inquiry officer and then an inquiry happens and action is taken against the concerned officer. This should not take very long -- maybe in a month they will come to a conclusion on the extent of fault of that official.

Will we see more heads rolling in this case?

You cannot start by saying that heads should roll for the sake of it. We live in a country where law prevails. Under the law, you take action only if there is responsibility. Under the code of conduct rule, you can't take action on the basis of moral responsibility. There has to be a specific responsibility -- what has that person done wrong? Moral responsibility is not a consideration for civil services. Civil servants are either right or wrong -- there cannot be a grey area in-between.

So far, the police probe has not shown that there was collusion on the part of even a lowly CBSE officer. If that were the case, action will be taken against any officer but you cannot say initiate action just because of moral responsibility. If a wrong has happened, we have to find out what is the extent of involvement of an individual in that wrong.

Everybody has been talking about the role of the CBSE chairperson (Anita Karwal) but what is her fault? She received a mail at 1 am (a tip-off on the Class X Maths paper leak) but saw it only around 8.55 in the morning and immediately informed the Controller of Examinations.There were hordes of fake leaks floating around - you cannot stop or do something about a purported leak without verifying it. Every leak was verified -- but only two were found to be true (the other being the Class XII Economics paper leak). But after the examination had begun (on March 28), she could not stop it midway as it would have created chaos. At every step, a calculated decision was taken as per the available information keeping the best of students' interests in mind.

So what did she (Karwal) do wrong on her part? I am of the view that if a civil servant is wrong, he or she should be sacked but if they are not, they should be asked to stay and correct the system. Theoretically, if she were to be removed, a new chap will come and take several months just to understand things. Now if she is not directly involved as the evidence so far suggests, she is in the best position to understand and improve the system.

Are we interested in improving the system or are we baying for somebody's blood? It may not make news, but if I want to improve the system, the person who is sitting there is in a better position to come up with solutions than a new chap.

Many feel that after the CBSE leak controversy, the chairperson is being defended...

You see, if somebody has done something wrong, there is accountability; otherwise, just because people demand that somebody be hung, so the highest person is hung -- will that be justified?

She (Karwal) is at it and trying to bring in changes. And her credentials prove that. She has been one of the most outstanding officials. What she has done in the HRD ministry (as a joint secretary) even before she became CBSE chairperson is quite remarkable. She was responsible for successfully carrying out the National Assessment Survey, 2017, to assess the learning outcomes of school children across the country -- which was the biggest such survey where 22 lakh children were tested to see what they are learning in government schools.

This was the biggest-ever exercise to correct the education system in the country because we are making district-wise plans on what is wrong where and how to fix it. She was the pivot around whom the NAS was carried out even though it was done by the NCERT. That was phenomenal work.

One has to look at antecedents of an individual before taking any action. You cannot just sack somebody because something went wrong somewhere.

Over the years, CBSE had made a name for itself in conducting exams. Have the recent leaks led to a credibility crisis?

CBSE is a very credible organisation and will continue to be so. This was an exception and could have happened anywhere. Things like these definitely impact credibility to some extent but it cannot erode credibility completely.

Reputations are not made or unmade in a day. If there is a genuine effort to plug some loopholes, what is the problem? Yes, it's a wake-up call; yes, something very wrong has happened. It has been admitted and, therefore, a committee has been set up under the chairmanship of ex-HRD secretary V S Oberoi on use of technology in conducting CBSE exams and it will submit its report by May 31.

In the meanwhile, all efforts are being made to understand how the system could improve and I have no doubt that next year we will have an even better system in place.

Of late, you have been talking about an education mafia in the country. What exactly do you mean?

There are a lot many factors that impact education -- for me, the focal point is teachers and that is impacted when I say mafia. By and large, most people are fine but there are a set of people who are trying to destroy the system and trouble the future of this country.

I will give you a couple of examples. There are 16,000 B.Ed colleges in the country but it is a known fact that many of them do not function at all. When we asked them to furnish affidavits, about 4,000 did not and when we initiated action against them, they went to court. But we took them on -- the first time that such notices were issued on such a large scale.

The other set of mafia relates to some set of private schools. There are some schools which escalate fee without any rationale and we keep getting complaints against them. We have been in touch with state governments, and I am glad to say that the Uttar Pradesh government has come up with a legislation (on regulation of private schools) two days back, which have been welcomed even by private schools' association, meaning thereby that a majority of them are not opposed to some sort of a regulation.

This I would say is another step to bring mafias under control.I hope other states will also follow. Gujarat has already done something similar and Andhra Pradesh is actively considering it. So, there are initiatives being taken to rein in education mafias who are in small numbers but are well-connected and powerful."

There has been a debate over the National Medical Commission Bill in which one clause permits the bridge course for ayurvedic and homoepathic doctors to prescribe allopathic medicines. Maharashtra permits cross-pathy, even as the Centre is supposed to decide on it. Are we thinking of modifying it?

Maharashtra has already come out with a law that ayurvedic doctors can practise allopathy to the extent of knowledge they have applied. These doctors are basically for primary health care, so the ""extent of knowledge"" would mean basic medical intervention. For homoepathy, there is a six-month bridge course of pharmacology. That combined with their basic graduation will allow them to practise as per what they learn in these courses. This is already in force in Maharashtra and we don't intend to change it. Some 600 homoepathy doctors are already being trained for mixed-pathy.

While Maharashtra has enough medical colleges, the issue of shortage of doctors has not been addressed. How can this problem be resolved?

We are coming up with one more medical college in Jalgaon, and next year we will have one in Baramati. In Nandurbar's medical college, there is an issue of infrastructure. We are in the process, but construction of a new building will take time. We are also increasing seats for post-graduation students. Last year, we increased 200 seats, and this year we increased 77 seats. Now there is a proposal for an additional 50 medical seats. We already have 16 medical colleges and five colleges under the municipal corporation apart from these. In addition, in medical colleges, we are in the process of filling vacant positions of teachers. We have advertised for almost 400 posts. Interviews for 300 teachers have been conducted and 100 posts have already been filled.

In Maharashtra, we have been facing issues with candidates under a bond to serve in government hospitals.

Earlier we used to give doctors three years of grace period to complete the bond. From next year, this practice will be stopped. After MBBS, graduates will asked to serve a bond and then taken for counselling. They will not be allowed to appear for the post-graduate exam if they have not served the one-year bond in government hospitals. Doctors may protest against this, but we will stand by our decision.

Maharashtra took some measures to ensure doctors' security last year after massive protests. Do we plan further measures?

We have handed over security to the Maharashtra State Security Corporation that comes under the home department. The security appointed by them has the power to arrest. Private security agencies do not have power to arrest. The government of Maharashtra has improved the security situation substantially in hospitals.

But while there is Maharashtra Medicare Service Persons and Medicare Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage of Property) Act, 2010, there is not even a single conviction under it against those booked for attacking doctors.

About that, we need to take information from the home department. We do not know about the conviction numbers.

The Maharashtra government is opting for privatisation in different programmes. The health department released a government resolution (GR) recently to tie up with private medical colleges. Do government medical colleges plan similarly?

In the medical education department, we still do not have any GR on public-private partnership.

A lot of streams in post-graduation go vacant like forensic science. How can government ensure we have takers?

Students will take specialisation where there is better scope. It is not that forensic science seats are going vacant. Even in anatomy we do not have that many takers. Orthopaedics and gynaecologists have scope outside government jobs. In forensic science medicine and anatomy, there is only posting as teaching faculty in government hospitals. Students are not keen to join and we cannot force them to."

Swarup, an IAS officer who was also initially the coal secretary, further told the channel, ""In coal, the mining was underground and the mafia was above that. In education, the mafia is underground. We are grappling with that"".

Swarup's comments come after Congress leader Kapil Sibal said that a ""mafia"" is controlling India's examination system. ""Till today, no step has been taken that would send the message that they would end this mafia in education. They saved the mafia in the Vyapam case. It seemed they are involved in this as well,"" Sibal said.

The CBSE came under widespread attack after the Class XII Economics paper was leaked, affecting lakhs of students. The government announced a re-examination on 25 April. But it ruled out any re-test for Class X Mathematics paper, which too was said to have been leaked. The Delhi Police is probing the leak following a complaint by the CBSE and has made numerous arrest in connection with the leaks.

The HRD ministry has also set up a ""high-powered committee"" to examine the process by which the CBSE conducts examinations, following the leaks. The panel, headed by former HRD secretary VS Oberoi, will suggest measures to make the process ""secure and foolproof through the use of technology"" and submit a report by 31 May.

Though present at the venue, which turned heated as several tough questions were posed, Karwal barely spoke. Swarup chose to answer the questions, even those which were addressed to her. While admitting that a ""system that had been working fine for last so many years, but did not work this time round,"" the secretary, in response to many questions, kept saying that ""there are no perfect decisions, but those taken mainly with students' interest in mind.""

Coming clean on the rumours of other re-exams, officials at the HRD ministry clarified that the exams for other allegedly leaked papers will not be held again.

We had a wealth of information misleading people to believe the papers were leaked,"" Anil Swarup, secretary of school education, confirmed on Friday.

""Without an inquiry, moral responsibility can't be fixed,"" secretary of higher education, HRD ministry, said on fixing the responsibility of leak on CBSE chief Anita Karwal. The nature of leak and its consequences of the exam that was held have decided the fresh dates for the exam, he explained.

Putting to rest the possibility of re-exams in other allegedly leaked question papers in class 12, Swarup explained that the CBSE officials have also received complaints and purported copies of leaked papers of other subjects but none of the circulated copies matches the original paper attempted by students. Stating that the so-called ""leaked papers"" were not leaked papers actually, he mentioned,""Even we received the purported copies and in the last few days, we have carefully examined all of them. Since they do not match the question paper set by CBSE board, it is clear that the question papers haven't been leaked in other subjects.""

""Now, both chairman and secretary of UGC are from DAVV. We are hopeful of getting advantage of that,"" said media in charge of DAVV, Chandan Gupta.

I will work with my full capacity and strength,"" he said.

Punjab's Principal Secretary (Medical Education and Research) Sanjay Kumar has taken strong exception to state's Home Department not taking his department in the loop in a proposal to set up chemical examination laboratories in all the three medical colleges at Amritsar, Faridkot and Patiala to ease burden on Kharar Chemical Laboratory, currently the only chemical laboratory of the state government.

In a hard-hitting letter to Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Dr Nirmaljeet Singh Kalsi on January 15, Kumar wrote, ""It is strange to note that certain decisions regarding Government Medical Colleges have been taken unilaterally without being brought to the notice of administrative department. It would have been appropriate had the matter been taken with the administrative department first.""

Enclosing a detailed report, Kumar said it indicated that ""it may not be possible to set up chemical labs in the medical colleges in Punjab"". ""I shall be grateful if suitable instructions are issued, so that in future such decisions are not taken unilaterally and initially may be referred to the administrative department so that the proper evaluation and arrangements are made. In the instant case, the detailed report attached be appropriately considered. If need be, I am always available to you for discussion.""

Neither Kumar nor Kalsi were available for comments on Monday."
