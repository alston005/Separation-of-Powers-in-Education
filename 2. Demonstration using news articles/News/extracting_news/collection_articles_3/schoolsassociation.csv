The APPSA also urged the government to cancel the CCE system completely, a long-pending demand of the association. The APPSA has written a letter to HRD Minister Ganta Srinivasa Rao, requesting the government to withdraw the GO.

Recently, the School Education Department has changed the evaluation process for class X exam. According to the new system, 10% of the formative assessments and another 10% of the summative assessment-1 will be added to the final mark in each subject.

APPSA chairman KSN Murthy termed the changes in the exam pattern ""ineffective"". ""We have written many letters to the State government in the past seeking cancellation of the CCE pattern. The minister has even assured us that the government will cancel the CCE pattern and bring back the earlier examination process, in which the final exam will be conducted for a total of 100 marks. However, the officials made some cosmetic changes in the existing examination pattern now, which is ineffective.""

As per the current CCE pattern, a maximum of 20 marks will be allocated to a student as internal marks based on the average from four formative and one summative assessments and it will be added to the marks out of 80. The officials have changed the exam pattern after noticing that a few private school managements are giving more internal marks to students to manipulate their GPA."

The association's West Bengal unit general secretary Nabarun Dey told PTI on Thursday that neither they did they receive any report about any student having received such messages, nor had the association been given any 'advisory' by the CID or the police till date on the issue.

However, going by media reports: ""two days ago we have asked the member schools to undertake sensitisation drive among children and their parents about the danger, inherent of certain online games like 'Momo' and 'Blue Whale'.

""We are acting on our own and this is aimed at sensitising the guardians and the students about the menace of certain online games -- earlier 'Blue Whale' and now 'Momo',"" he said.

Asked to elaborate on the sensitisation drive, he said, ""we have asked the schools to tell the students during the assembly before classes every day that they should keep away from certain online games.

""We have also asked the schools to ask the parents to ensure they keep a tab on what games their wards are playing at home,"" Dey said. Dey, also the Principal of Central Modern School, Baranagar, said the sensitisation programme had already started in his institution. There are about 150 ICSE-affiliated schools in the plains and 30 schools in Darjeeling, Kurseong and Kalimpong in the hills.

The state CID had earlier said all the numbers from where the messages were sent to the people in the state to play the Momo Challenge were based abroad and an investigation had been initiated into it.
