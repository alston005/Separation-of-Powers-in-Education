File pic

The charity commissioner has asked Mumbai police to conduct an inquiry into the abrupt closure of the 180-year-old Robert Money School at Grant Road. The school was run by a charitable trust offering affordable education, and has now been replaced by an international school with comparatively exorbitant fees. While activists have alleged that the Bombay Diocesan Trust Association leased the school plot illegally, the trustees claim it is all above board.

The school had been under a cloud for the past few years, after it started shutting down one class each year by stopping admissions. Each time, the administration spoke of closing the school, but continued to operate after protests by parents and locals. However, 2016-17 was the last year it functioned, finally closing its doors in 2017-18.

The charity commissioner's request for an investigation follows a complaint by the Christian Reform United People Association, which has been fighting to keep the school running since 2013. Cyril Dara, secretary of the association, said, ""This school has been here for around 180 years. It was also the first technical school in Maharashtra in the 1950s, at which time the state government had allotted considerable grants to the trust. Moreover, the school was named after the then education secretary, to provide affordable quality education to local children. Now, the trust has handed over the land to a third party to run a new school.""

Melwyn Fernandes, secretary of the Association of Concerned Catholics, Mumbai, said, ""Portuguese and British settlers had donated land to the Christian community to set up educational and religious institutions. The police should take action against culprits for illegal dealings of the school plot.""

On the other hand, Rev. Amolik, secretary of the Bombay Diocesan Trust Association, said, ""The school shut down gradually because there was no demand and the number of students taking admission kept dropping. Now another school is running there. There is absolutely no irregularity, as the transfer was done following all regularities and was registered at the collector's office. Some people with vested interests are maligning the trust.""

Copspeak

Pandharinath Patil, Inspector (Crime) from D B Marg police station, said, ""We have not received any intimation on the matter yet. Once we do, we will see what needs to be done. However, since it is about a transfer between schools, the education department should look into it and then file a formal complaint.""

Government withdraws e-trading bill

The state has withdrawn the bill that seeks to amend the Maharashtra Agricultural Produce Marketing (Development and Regulation) Act from the Legislative Council. The bill was passed in the Legislative Assembly on Tuesday. All five markets at Vashi's APMC were shut yesterday over the indefinite strike call by traders over the bill. APMC's fruit department head, Sanjay Pansare said, ""If implemented, it would have been unjust to lakhs of workers here."""

Passing interim orders, Justice S Vaidayanathan noted that toilets in the school were open to sky and did not even have doors and said since high-rise buildings were close-by, miscreants may take photographs of girl students using the toilets and circulate them on the internet.

The judge said he was not inclined to grant permission for continued functioning of the 'Sri Saravana Vidhyalaya Nursery and Primary School' at suburban Puzhal for a period of one academic year to carry out the rectifications.

He ordered that all the students studying in the school be accommodated in the nearby schools.

Accepting the direction, the special government pleader submitted a list of eight schools located in the vicinity.

The matter relates to a petition from S Sasikumar, who submitted that the management of the school functioning in his property, had obtained approval and renewals from educational authorities by fraudulently misrepresenting the actual safety and infrastructure and sanitary conditions.

He sought a direction to authorities for inspection of the school.

Following an earlier direction, Director of Elementary Education A Karuppuswamy and other officials were present before the court today.

The judge said there were also other deficiencies like asbestos sheet roof and thatched huts and asked the government pleader as to how permission was granted to such a school.

He wondered if authorities will act only if an incident like the 2004 Kumbakonam school fire, in which several children died, occurred.

Pulling up the educational officials for not taking steps, the court said though a show cause notice was issued in 2015, no further action was initiated.

""It is very unfortunate that the authorities are careless and they have proceeded on the basis that the work comes to an end after the issuance of show cause notice. Prevention is better than cure,"" the judge said.

He directed the government to initiate departmental action against the officials who were in service at the time of issuance of show cause notice.

The petitioner, whose attempts to terminate the tenancy agreement with the school had failed, submitted he had already made representations on March 2 this year to the educational authorities to inspect the premises in view of violations of regulations."

Thanks to the collective efforts by villagers of Karenki, the Daddalakadu Government Higher Primary School is now up and running. The turnaround came through after the Kannada medium school decided to offer education in English, totally free of cost, to nearly 500 children.

According to Prakash Anchan, a textile merchant and the man who spearheaded the turnaround along with other villagers, the school headmaster apprised village elders in 2015 that the school was on the verge of closure as the enrolments were down to a trickle. ""In a rare gesture, members of Sri Durga Friends Club in the village decided to save the school by pulling out their children from English medium schools. The students were then admitted to the Kannada medium school, taking the total number of students to 56 from 36. It increased to 230 the following year, and in 2017, there were 350 children studying in the village school. In 2018, the number rose to an unbelievable 500. The school had to cap the admissions at 500 because of infrastructural limitations,"" said Anchan.

""I bet no other Kannada medium school would've ever sent back children stating shortage of seats. Villagers who believed that real change begins from one's own home are to be credited with the success of the school,"" he added.

According to Anchan, the perception that English medium schools are meant for the rich should be challenged. ""We are changing that perception by providing everything free of cost to the children in this school,"" he said. Daddalakadu Government Higher Primary School has classes from LKG to 8. The free service includes books, uniform, education and concessional transport.

In the past three years, the faculty added about 15 teachers, besides the government-appointed five. The village club pays all the 15 guest teachers. Apart from academics, children are being trained in singing, dance, yoga, computer and other extra-curricular activities. There are three buses for transportation. ""We pay them salaries from our earnings and donations. No government fund has been taken so far,"" said Anchan.

In a nine-kilometre radius of the government school, there are about nine private English medium schools. ""There was stiff resistance from them initially. We were denied permission to start an English medium but still we are fighting for it,"" says Anchan who is confident that the state government would back them.

Infrastructure call for an upgrade

Daddalakadu Government Higher Primary School, started in 1979, is crying for repair and refurbishment. Work on Rs 2.5-cr infrastructure upgrade is progressing fast. ""We began construction work without worrying about the funds. However, with generous donors around, funds flowed in for the work. The new building will be completed soon, and it would help us to raise the enrolments to 1000 students and add two more classes till SSLC,"" said Anchan."

Thousands of people have signed a petition to prevent the closure of one of the UK's largest independent Hindu faith schools, the Swaminarayan School in London. The Akshar Educational Trust, which runs the school set up in 1992, had announced its closure last month as part of plans to exit the education sector completely by July 2020. Parents of students associated with the school have now organised a campaign to save the ""school of excellence"" from closure.

""In a letter to parents, a spokesperson for the school blamed 'increasing regulatory requirements, difficulties in recruitment and retention of teachers, ready availability of free state-funded Hindu schools, and declining pupil numbers' for the move. This is simply not true,"" notes the Change.org petition, which has attracted nearly 3,500 signatures since last week. ""Sensitivity analysis of accounts by experts suggests that with restructuring it is possible for school to run for the foreseeable future,"" it notes.

The parents, who have coordinated into a save-the-school campaign, say that many Indian-origin families have moved, relocated and changed their way of life to enable their children to get an education within the ethos and culture of Hinduism at the respected Swaminarayan School in Neasden, north-west London. ""Parents are more than happy to consider taking over the running of the school by appointing new teams who will give due consideration to the communities and families that are being disrupted by this announcement,"" the parents said in a statement.

The school has been very popular within the large Indian-origin community based in the borough of Brent, many of whom are happy to pay the GBP 4,310 per-term fees to enrol their children. But the trust running it said that mounting pressures in recent years had hampered its ability to invest in the resources required to sustain the improvements needed in the school, both educationally and for its infrastructure.

The institution, opened by Pramukh Swami Maharaj alongside the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir to ""promote Hindu and British culture and values and way of life"", has around 400 pupils between the ages of three and 18 currently on its rolls.

The trustees had unveiled plans for closure in two phases in order to allow parents time to apply to other schools. However, parents are furious at the lack of consultation before the announcement was made. ""The school is not a business, where a decision like this can just be made and announced... the team of governors and trustees just seem to have had enough and this is now the easiest option for them,"" the parents said.

They have received the backing of Indian-origin Labour party MP, Seema Malhotra, who said she is ""saddened"" by the news of the closure. ""The Swaminarayan School has a strong reputation and has been highly valued by parents and the community. I hope that through discussions between parents, teachers, governors and trustees that a solution can be found and the school is able to stay open and continue to flourish,"" she said.

It blamed increasing regulatory requirements, difficulties in the recruitment and retention of teachers, ready availability of fee-free state-funded Hindu schools, and declining pupil numbers for the decision.

""It is indeed very sad, particularly for our pupils, staff and parents. We explored several options before arriving at this difficult decision. We have given all parents one year's notice to find an alternative school as well as a commitment to our staff that their employment is secure for the academic year 2018-19,"" said Jitu Patel, Chair of the Trust.

The Swaminarayan School, set up in 1992, is popular within the large Indian-origin community based in the borough of Brent in north-west London, many of whom were willing to pay the 4,310 pounds per-term fees to enroll their children.

The news of its closure has been received with surprise and disappointment by the parents, who will now have to look for alternatives from the next academic year.

But the trust said that mounting pressures in recent years had hampered its ability to invest in the resources required to sustain the improvements needed in the school, both educationally and for its infrastructure.

Nilesh Manani, Head of the Senior School since it opened, said: ""The children and staff are some of the very best I have had the privilege of supporting and we will strive to ensure that our education standards are maintained until the very end.""

The trustees have planned two phases for the closure of the school, associated with the Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Sanstha (BAPS) Swaminarayan Mandir in Neasden one of the world's largest Hindu temples outside India.

The closure timetable is intended to give a full academic year's notice in order to allow all parents time to apply to other schools.

The prep school and senior school will continue as normal from September 2018 until closure in July 2019.

This applies to all pupils, except those taking state-level exams known as the General Certificate of Secondary Educations (GCSE) or A-levels in September 2018, who will all be able to complete their GCSEs and A-levels at the school until July 2020, it said.

The Trust also said it had held discussions with the Avanti Trust, which is already looking for a suitable site to open a state-funded Hindu school in the area.

""If the Avanti Trust is successful in opening its school by September 2019, parents will be able to apply for places available at that school subject to meeting the school's admissions criteria,"" the Akshar Educational Trust said in a statement.

Umesh Raja, Head of the prep school, said: ""It is very sad, but the most important thing now is for everyone to work together over the next two years, especially for the pupils remaining at our school.""

After meeting the students around 10.45am and giving them a patient hearing, Kumaraswamy ordered officials to ensure that the school is not shut down.

The students said they were told by the authorities on June 16 that their 24-year-old school would be closed and they would be shifted to a school in Bharamasagara, which is 15km away. According to the children, classes for this academic year have already begun. While admissions for class 8 were under way, lessons for classes 9 and 10 were being imparted.

Officials cited the poor strength of students -- the Alaghatta school has about 50 of them -- as a reason for closing the institution and relocating the students to Bharamasagara.

Accompanied by villagers, the distraught students left their village around 11.30pm on Sunday night. Around 8.45am, the CM's officials collected details from them. When the CM was about to leave in his car around 10.45am, the students called out to him. Drawn by their 'CM Saar"" cries, Kumaraswamy stopped, met the kids and assured them that their demand would be met.

He also asked villagers why they had brought the children to the city. The villagers replied that they didn't have an option as no one paid heed to their grievances.

The CM has sought a report from officials on the number of students in the school.

Gram Panchayat member of Alaghatta, E Nagaraj, said education department officials were helping the private school lobby by shutting down the decades-old school.

Though the department was claiming that the schools were not providing the facilities as mandated by the Right to Education Act, Mr. Salam alleged that the schools were not given enough time to act on the requirements.

""When the Act came into force in 2013, the United Democratic Front (UDF) government had asked unrecognised schools to either fulfil the obligations or close down.

The Ayurvedic school was established in 1914 by noted Sanskrit scholar and Ayurvedic practitioner Sudarshan Das. In 1956, noting its popularity, the government took over the school management.

""The school's past is glorious. Many of the school's students have become Ayurvedic doctors, Sanskrit scholars, writers and poets,"" said Rabi Narayan Pati, a retired school teacher and an old boy of the school.

Three years ago, the Central human resource development ministry constituted an expert committee in its attempt to revive interest in Sanskrit and age-old Ayurveda practices, but such measures have not seeped into the prospective students of the town, said Pati. ""With the number of students thinning, the school has been struggling for survival for a while now,"" said the alumnus. He is echoed by Ayurvedic practitioner and former student Dr Balabhadra Das. ""It is hard to believe that a school that once bustled with teachers and students is now on the verge of closure,"" said Das.

Basudev Suar the only teacher of the school has - for all his life - been encouraging parents to send their children to this school. ""But nobody is interested to study Sanskrit. Ayurvedic science too is not a field towards which parents wish to push their children,"" said Suar.

Suar's comments come at a time when Ayurvedic science is seeing a renewed interest. ""In Kerala, Ayurvedic remedies attract so many. Yet an institution like this suffers for want of students,"" said Kali Prasan Nayak, a retired teacher. The only student of the school, Diptiranjan Barik, now studies in Class X.

Committee president Sriballav Kar alleged that the clarification of PPL management that they have no intention to shut down the school is false. He said the allegation by PPL regarding non-submission of road map to enhance the quality of education by DAV is fabricated as the school authorities have already submitted it. Similarly, the DAV school authorities have denied the other charges made by Chief Operating Officer (COO) of PPL Vishwajeet Kumar Sinha on February 5, Kar added.

After the PPL's 30-year agreement with DAV management expired in January, a meeting was convened hurriedly on January 17 where the COO had expressed unwillingness to run the school on PPL premises. Later, the PPL authorities levelled charges against the DAV over the issue. Even on February 7, officials of another private educational institution visited the school premises, he informed.

Kar said on February 10, the authorities of Bhubaneswer-based DAV Public School had conducted a meeting with principal of PPL DAV School SK Das over the matter. During the meeting, it was found that a draft copy of the proposed agreement for renewal was submitted to PPL by DAV in May 2017. The agreement was supposed to be renewed in May 2017, but it could not work out due to some unavoidable circumstances, he added.

Meanwhile, organising secretary of the committee Subrat Mohapatra and parents have threatened to intensify their strike demanding that the issue be resolved by February 16."

The report has also not been made public, triggering concern among retired educationists and activists. In fact, activists are of the opinion that the report should be made public at the soonest so that it is made open to scrutiny.

Mukund Kirdat, an education activist working against the decision to close schools in remote areas, pointed out that any document affecting the education of such a considerable number of children should be made public.

""It looks like there is a vested interest in not sharing the name of the NGO and making the report public. Secondly, there are also rumours that certain corporate entities will be allowed to run these schools a their corporate social responsibility (CSR) activity,"" said Kirdat.

Kirdat further went on to mention that for a government trashing reports of NGOs such as Pratham, taking such a big decision without any review process on its own also seems rather fishy.

""When the report came out, the government should have formed a committee comprising a civil society member or an activist, a retired judge and a government official in order to review the report and take samples to ascertain if the report is, in fact, true or not,"" said Kirdat.

Matin Mujawar, another education activist, explained that the top-down decision will only hurt rural Maharashtra in the long run. ""The problem with this model is that someone sitting in Mumbai has come to a decision whether the schools in these villages should be shut or not, without even knowing what is happening in villages. These decisions should be taken with utmost care and field officers must ensure that they recommend the name of the schools where an alternative is available to the seniors rather than vice versa,"" said Mujawar.

According to a zilla parishad teacher, the entire issue has created a fear among tutors as well as parents whose children attend these schools.

""Once the name of your school is on the list, we don't know what will happen next. Parents continue to ask us and we don't have an answer to their questions. Some schools were being spruced up and the process had to be stopped midway because what is the point of the renovation if the school is being shut down"" the teacher sought to know."

The entire station had been kept operational for three years, just for one passenger.

Back home in Maharashtra, the remote village of Kalakrai is now faced with the prospect of sending its young children on a two-hour trek through thick woods to another school after its only school was ordered to close.

Only 70 km from Pune, this village of 200 residents is almost cut off from the outside world. The nearest motorable road is two hours away on foot. The isolation is so acute that most women here have given birth at home.

A team from TOI had to carefully make its way through the forest to reach Kalakrai - two hours from Sawale village, where the new school is located. During the rains, numerous waterfalls and streams hide some massive boulders. The path, lined with thick undergrowth, is slippery and dangerous. When the school shuts, the children of Kalakrai will be forced to take this route to the nearest school, every day.

The government's order has been aimed at zilla parishad schools with student strengths of 10 or fewer. Kalakrai doesn't stand a chance.

""Class I has just one student; Class 2 has three; there are only four studying in Class III; and just two in Class IV. There are indeed 10 students, but in total,"" says Suryakant Talpe, one of the two teachers at the school.

Parents, stunned by the closure order, are furious. ""The only government facility we have is that school. How can they shut it? Don't we deserve some semblance of a system here?"" asks Shobhaji Kavale, whose grandson is one of the two children in Class IV.

The tiny one-room school was built 20 years ago. It has no functioning toilet and its roof is near collapse. Inside, however, there is evidence showing the teachers and the kids had tried to make the most of what they were given. Common English and Marathi words have been spelt out on colourful charts.

""Besides the 10 kids we have, there are young children - between the ages of 3 and 6 - turning up to just sit around here and play. Every school in a remote region of the state doubles as a 'Balewadi', or a playschool, if there's no alternative,"" says Talpe.

The villagers are worried about children losing out on early education. ""This school was helping our kids learn to read, write and calculate,"" says Sakaram Kathe. ""If it shuts, they will miss out on primary education. We do have just one student in a class, but that child must be given a chance.""

The alternative is the near-impossible trek through dense forest. ""But the students studying here are just 6 to 10 years old. We cannot send them alone through the hills. What if a child falls into a ravine or gets bitten by a snake?"" asks Chandrakant Kavale, a resident.

Kavale works in Mumbai - over 70 km away. Every Saturday, when he comes home to Kalakrai, he has to walk two hours to reach home. ""And then on Monday, I have walk to the bus stop again. You have to study to escape such circumstances. That's the reason why our school must stay open."""

In 2016, the state police registered a case against the principal and other trustees of the school under Sections 153A and 34 of IPC.

A probe conducted by the Ernakulam district education officer revealed that the school was teaching no secular content.

Even before this allegation, the school was in the eye of storm after two of its employees reportedly joined ISIS.

Abdul Rashid and his wife Merin Mariam were among the 21 people who went missing from Kerala and have reportedly joined ISIS. Abdul Rashid was working as the PRO and Merin was a teacher in the school. After marriage, Merin converted to Islam and embraced the name Mariam.

Peace International School that runs a chain of schools in the southern state faced a police probe after it was found that at least three of its staff were among the 21 people who left their homes in 2016 to allegedly join Islamic State.

""We were really shocked to see some of the content. They propagated extremist ideology and carried details of so-called atrocities against Islam,"" said a member of the panel that examined the school curriculum. The member didn't wish to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to media.

The school management criticised the government's decision, based on reports filed by the education department and Ernakulam district collector, as ""a vilification campaign aimed at tarnishing a well-managed minority educational group"".

The group has 10 schools in Kerala and one each in neighbouring Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.

Initially the school in Ernakulam will be shut down. Other branches would be closed after accommodating students in other schools, government sources said.

The probe panels found that though the schools were affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), they taught books compiled by Burooj Realization, a Mumbai-based Islamic educational institute.

CBSE schools typically use books published by the State Council of Educational Research and Training or the National Council of Educational Research and Training.

Some of the content was radical and promoted enmity on the basis of religion and race, the probe found.

Police had raided the Ernakulam branch in 2016 after they go to know that a teacher at the school, Merin Jacob alias Mariyam, was among the missing 21 and a case was registered against the group for promoting enmity on the basis of religion.

Five of the missing people were converts to Islam.

Similarly, Yasin Ahmed, who was arrested from Delhi airport allegedly on way to Turkey to join Islamic State, taught English at the Malappuram branch.

The alleged leader of the missing group, Abdul Rashid, was a public relations officer with the school chain.

The school chain was founded in 2006 by MM Akbar, a Muslim preacher, often referred to as Kerala's Zakir Naik, the Mumbai-based evangelist who is on the run now.

The directive was issued since the department found that it was necessary to ""prevent Muslims from joining IS activities.""

The educational institution, with classes up to middle-school, grabbed the government's attention after the district educational officer complained against the school for teaching objectionable content.

The letter said preliminary inquiries revealed that the textbooks being used at schools were ""aimed towards the propagation of ideas contradicting the secular policies of the country.""

Ernakulam's Peace International School's primary class students were taught lines like, ""He (Allah) is not one of a group of gods and goddesses who fall in love, marry and plot against each other or put silly curses on humans.""

The books said ""how we (Muslims) should never give up in any matter,"" stating that Allah is one and unique and there can't be any comparison in this case. The children's book even says that ""all other faiths violate this simple command, either explicitly or implicitly.""

The letter said the government had not issued an NoC to the school and it has no CBSE affiliation. The DPI has been requested to take immediate action under the RTE Act to close Peace International School, Kochi, and transfer the students to nearby schools.
