Delegations from the Jawaharlal Nehru University Teachers' Association and students' union Friday met MPs from across political parties who promised to raise issues related to the varsity in Parliament, the JNUTA said.

The delegation has felt encouraged by the promise made by the parliamentarians to raise the matter in Parliament and also outside, they said.

The JNUTA also informed the MPs that 37 teachers have approached the Delhi High Court on the MCQ-based computerised online JNU entrance examination.

The body said they have sought the attention and intervention of the MPs in protecting a public university that has acquired excellence in research and teaching nationally and internationally.

""We provided the MPs a comprehensive document that exposes the vice chancellor's role in destroying the teaching and learning process in JNU.

""The delegation pointed out to the MPs about the vice chancellor's violations of the JNU Act, statutes and ordinances by constant misuse of his power of authority,"" the JNUTA said.

The MPs were also informed about ""the drastic cut in the academic expenditure"" in the university, including alleged fund cut for the JNU library and for e-journals, it said.

Issues of harassment of teachers, penalising members of the faculty and denying them their legitimate dues and undermining students' safety and welfare were also raised, the body said.

The JNUTA claimed that the Delhi High Court has said no disciplinary actions can be initiated against teachers for criticising the online entrance exams.

""Finding merit in the petition of the teachers, who it recognised as having the best interests of the students at heart, the HC in an interim relief observed that no disciplinary actions can be taken against teachers for raising their dissent to the process and extended the JNU administration's deadline of December 21 for submitting their question papers to December 31,"" it said.

The papers which are so submitted shall be subject to the outcome of the petition, they added.

The writ petition challenges the decisions made by the JNU vice-chancellor and its executive council on procedural and substantive grounds, the JNUTA added.

The petition also challenges the tripartite MoU signed between the varsity, HRD Ministry and the UGC without the approval of the academic council.

""The petition raises several substantive issues about the unsuitability of an exclusively MCQ-based online JNUEE for disciplines in the social sciences and the humanities, the implications it is likely to have on disadvantaged sections and persons with disabilities, the quantum of costs involved, the fallibility of technology, and several other points.

""The next date for the hearing is January 11 next year,"" the body said.

The administration urged the JNU community to refrain from believing ""politically motivated statements"".

JNUTA has been violating the established rules and regulations of the university and issuing press releases with false information, said JNU Registrar Pramod Kumar.

The teachers association and the administration have been at loggerheads as JNUTA members are not in agreement with implementation of compulsory attendance. JNUTA has claimed that teachers are being denied leaves.

""Implementation of attendance rules is challenged by invoking emotions against the administration. Most of the leaves of faculty members are sanctioned by chairpersons and deans and only duty leave applications for foreign travel and leave applied by deans need the approval of the vice chancellor/rector,"" Kumar said.

He said the agitators against the attendance rule staging protests at legally prohibited areas on the campus and not at the designated place for demonstration Sabarmathi Ground.

He also said allegations are being made without credible evidence. ""Accusations against the administration for alleged massive cut in the library budget are a glaring example.""

The JNU students' union protested on Wednesday against the library fund cuts and closing of one of the reading halls of the library. The union has accused the administration of cutting down library funds from Rs 8 crore to Rs 1.7 crore.

Jawaharlal Nehru University Student's Union (JNUSU) and Jawaharlal Nehru University Teacher's Association (JNUTA) have questioned the institute's Executive Council's decision to install a life-sized statue of Swami Vivekananda in the campus, Indian Express has reported.

Sources who spoke to PTI informed that the statue will be installed towards the right side of the administration block. It will be placed opposite the statue of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.

The Executive Council had explained its position in a statement to Indian Express. ""For a more pleasing look, it has been decided by the competent authority that a statue of suitable height and size of a historically important person like Swami Vivekananda -- whose contribution to the nation building is universally acknowledged -- may be erected with proper elevated platform, stone pathways, benches, lights and interconnected works, including public utilities, etc,"" the council said.

JNUSU and JNUTA have argued that the university does not have money for library funds and disbursal of the merit-cum-means scholarship to students. They have criticised the proposal to have a statue in this scenario."

The newly elected JNU Teachers' Association in its first General Body Meeting condemned the ""ongoing efforts of the JNU administration to destroy the teaching and learning culture at the university and decided not to take the assault on the university lying down"".

The teachers decided on Tuesday that they would go on a 24-hour hunger strike on November 24 and go on mass leave on November 28 as issues raised by them were neither tabled or discussed by the Executive Committee meeting.

""Such indignity meted out to the collective wisdom of the teachers has anguished the teaching community of JNU,"" said the JNUTA.

The JNUTA alleged that in a circular dated November 13, the administration had announced that proposals for seminar participation, conference travel, project meetings, prestigious fellowships, including those scheduled during vacations will be allowed if teachers comply with the ""diktats"" of the university.

The teachers said that the circular goes on to say that they will be allowed to teach, conduct research and reimburse medical bills only if they ""fall in line"" and not question the ""diktats"" of the ""competent authority"", and that they condemn in strongest possible terms the punitive ways of enforcing these arbitrary decisions on teachers.

The JNUTA also passed a resolution at its GBM to oppose the announcement by the administration that JNU may now have a satellite campus for which private funding will be sought in which all policies of affirmative action and reservation can be flouted and allow for differential rates of remuneration for visiting faculty.

The JNUTA said that such announcements flow from specific clauses of the UGC regulations on graded autonomy that it rejects as it is a step towards privatisation.

The teachers said the administration has remained adamant on conducting an online entrance examination. It said that it was against JNU's unique interdisciplinary character that requires an entrance exam that is designed not just to test the domain knowledge across disciplines but also to test analytical capability through a combination of techniques. ""This pattern, and the fact that the entrance examination is conducted in 72 centres spread across 54 cities, through pen-paper mode and often answered in several regional languages, has ensured that the university has been able to fulfil the regional diversity and social representation mandated by the JNU Act,"" the teachers said.

They added that computer-based online tests at computer terminals in cities with poor power supply and erratic and unstable Internet connections will not only restrict access to students from remote areas and marginal sections of society but also prove as a great deterrent.

The JNUTA added that administration had also failed to explain satisfactorily the need to outsource the conduct of the test to a third party."

Out of these 10 teachers, four are from Mansa and rest from Patiala, while six are on regular pay rolls.

Among them, Amolak Singh, leader of Elementary Teacher Training (ETT) union, who was posted in Sadda Singh Wala village, about 10 km from Mansa city, has been transferred to the last village of the district, Beerewala Dogra, 60 km away from his last posting. Hardeep Singh Sidhu, ETT union district president, said the ETT teachers cannot be transferred out of the district and hence the last village was chosen. ""Amolak is on regular rolls."" Narinder Singh, district president of government teachers' union, Mansa, was posted in Raipur village of the district. He was earlier in Tarn Taran district. Karamjeet Singh, a science teacher of Dalelwala village in Mansa, has been sent to Amritsar. He is a committee member of democratic teachers' front, Mansa, said Sidhu.

Senior vice-president of government teachers' union Gurdas Singh has been transferred to Hoshairpur from Bajewala village of Mansa. All the teachers had participated in the dharna outside the Deputy Commissioner's office in Mansa. Sidhu said as all the union leaders are active in the ongoing protest, they have been targeted. ""It is an effort to weaken out protest. However, so far no one has joined.""

Villagers also locked schools and staged protest outside them on Tuesday, demanding that the transfers of the four Mansa teachers be revoked. Though District Education Officer Subash Chandra tried to pacify the villagers by saying that teachers on deputation will be sent soon, they refused to relent, saying that the transfers were uncalled for.

On the other hand, Atinder Pal Singh Ghagga, president of DTF, Patiala, has been transferred to Hoshairpur, while Bikram Dev to Gurdaspur, Davinder Singh Poonia, convenor of Sanjha Adhiyapak Morcha, said. ""Both are on regular rolls. A few SSA/RMSA union leaders have also been transferred out. Our protest started from October 7 and is continuing. We are supporting nearly 9,000 SSA/RMSA teachers who have been regularised, but their salary has been reduced from Rs 42,800 to Rs 15,000. We are waiting for a meeting with the Chief Minister on November 5 and will decide our next line of action after that,"" he said.

He added, ""So far our talks with education department officials have failed."" On the other hand, the dharna continued in Patiala and teachers from across the state are joining it.

The 9,000 SSA/ RMSA teachers had been appointed over 10 years ago and after annual appraisals, their salary had reached Rs 42,800, though they were not on government rolls. However, Punjab government recently regularised them and treated them as freshers and hence put them on Rs 15,000 a month salary slab."

The teachers would be entitled to increment. The increment would be calculated after including their work as ad-hoc as well.

However, the union has now raised their objection stating that if the tenure as ad-hoc can be added to calculated to increment, then the ad-hoc must also be entitled to increments and other health facilities.

""Ad-hoc teachers of the University feel that University administration is discriminatory in extending the benefit of the new UGC guidelines to the ad-hoc teachers. We demand that our past ad-hoc services should be counted for the purpose of annual increments like permanent teachers,"" asked Assistant professor Manoj Kumar in a statement.

The teachers claim that before 2007 the ad-hoc teachers were also provided increment, but after that the increment has been stopped, however 29 teachers are still getting the increment.

""Before 2007, Ad-hoc teachers were provided increment and still their are 29 teachers who get that, the teachers appointed after 2007 are not entitled to increment,"" added Kumar.

With about 50 percent of teachers in DU still working on ad-hoc basis, their payments are made at entry level pay scale from past several years without any other service benefits.

The teacher claim that since they are equally qualified as a permanent teacher, they must also get equal pay. ""We are as qualified as a permanent teacher and share equal duties and responsibilities. It also violates law of 'equal pay for equal work',"" added Kumar."

Long accused by critics of corruption, Elba Esther Gordillo was a powerful force in Mexican politics before her arrest in 2013, a day after President Enrique Pena Nieto signed into law a major education reform that she had opposed.

Earlier this month, a judge dismissed charges of money laundering and organized crime against Gordillo.

In a defiant speech to a hall packed with supporters, Gordillo described herself as the innocent victim of a political witch-hunt, and blasted Pena Nieto's attempt to shake up the education system.

""I have won my freedom again, and the education reform has been brought down,"" Gordillo told the news conference.

Pena Nieto faced resistance from teachers in implementing the reform, and his successor, President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, pledged to scrap the legislation in the campaign leading up to his landslide victory on July 1.

Gordillo's grandson, Rene Fujiwara, left the teachers' union's PANAL political party early this year to support Lopez Obrador's bid for the presidency.

Making her first public appearance since her arrest, Gordillo said she had been the target of ""political persecution"" that was used to tarnish the union.

At a news conference with Lopez Obrador later on Monday, Pena Nieto dismissed the notion Gordillo had been targeted for political ends.

Lopez Obrador, who following her arrest in 2013 had called Gordillo and Pena Nieto ""equally corrupt"", said little on her case save that the judge's decision should be respected.

Repeating his promise to ""cancel"" the education reform, Lopez Obrador said the 73-year-old Gordillo would not serve in his government.

Hundreds of members of the National Union of Education Workers (SNTE), one of the largest in Latin America with over 1.5 million members, crowded into one of the salons of the hotel in Mexico City where Gordillo delivered her speech.

""My loyalty and my place has always been, and always will be, alongside the teachers of Mexico, and the defense of public education,"" Gordillo said.

Gordillo led the teachers union for years and belonged to Pena Nieto's long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, until breaking with the party over a decade ago.

Mexico ranks last in education standards among the 35 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)."

The move came at its general council meeting held in the city.

A release from AUT said Gandhiraj was expelled for his 'unilateral decision' to support the 'illegal cause' of its Trichy zone secretary A Pasupathy, who was charged with sexual harassment of a fellow teacher. The decision to expel him was first taken at the AUT's central executive committee meeting held on July 1, the release said.

N Shettu, general secretary of AUT, told TOI that Pasupathy was removed from his post and the primary membership of the association on May 2, after sexual harassment charges against him were proved. ""As the association's president has been expelled, we have appointed an election officer, who would schedule the election to choose a new president,"" he said.

The association also urged the Centre not to replace the existing University Grants Commission (UGC) with the newly-proposed Higher Education Commission of India. Shettu said the decision would bring in problems in grants for educational institutions.

AUT said any attempt to replace UGC with a bureaucratic setup was a retrograde move. The association, meanwhile, thanked the state for implementing the seventh UGC scales of pay for college and university teachers and urged the government to release the benefits immediately.

It also expressed its gratitude to the state governmrnt for declaring 41 constituent colleges as government colleges."

The RTI had asked for information on state-wise break up of bogus teachers, their names and the colleges or universities these teachers were employed in.

Irrespective of the number of students on rolls, a primary school is sanctioned two teachers including headmaster. On an average, one teacher is sanctioned for 30 students.

In their desperation to retain existing students, teachers of some schools pool in money to engage extra hands through parent-teacher organisations.

""The university has announced dates for theory papers without giving enough time to colleges to conduct the practical examinations first. This means practical examinations will have to be conducted in May, which is unfair to teachers as well as students,"" said Madhu Paranjape, general secretary of BUCTU. While Allowed-To-Keep-Term (ATKT) exams are already underway, the first of the exams for fresh candidates will begin on April 3, with TYBCom examinations.

Many teachers are also angry about once again giving up on their vacation this year for assessment of papers. ""When the first and second year exams were still conducted by individual colleges, we could finish their assessment before starting work on third year papers. We've worked through Diwali and Christmas vacations last year and now the May holidays too will be usurped by the university,"" said a teacher on condition of anonymity.

Officials from the examinations department of the university said they haven't received the complaint as yet. ""We will look into their complaints,"" said an official."

The teachers said that the TYBSc exams are scheduled to commence from April 12, but the time-table for practical exams has not been declared yet. ""Since seat numbers were not generated for the final semester exams, the practical exams cannot be conducted before April 12. This will push the practical examinations to May,"" stated the letter addressed to the in-charge vice-chancellor Devanand Shinde.

Furthermore, the second year BCom exams are slated to clash with the second level of chartered accountancy (CA) exams on two days. The teachers also pointed out that the assessment period of the April exams will clash with teachers' vacation period, thereby making it difficult for the university to announce the results in the stipulated 45 days.

Lastly, the teachers have also said that examinations scheduled between 2 to 5 pm are inconvenient for students, both in the city and mofussil areas. ""While the students in the city are caught in the evening peak hours, the students in mofussil areas do not have adequate facilities to travel back home,"" said the teachers.

The teachers have not only requested the university to reschedule the dates without disturbing the vacation, but also to keep the exams in the morning slots for the convenience of students. A university official said that they will look into the appeal."

Over 1,000 teachers participated in the DUTA general body meeting held at Hans Raj College, after which they marched to the Vice-Chancellor's Office demanding permanent appointments.

The DUTA also plans to start an online signature campaign against the 30-70% funding formula, push towards self-financing through regulations on graded autonomy and autonomous colleges, loans through Higher Education Funding Agency (HEFA) instead of grants, and other 'retrograde' policies related to higher education.

The DUTA, along with the AIFUCTO and FEDCUTA, has called for a protest on March 12 at the UGC. It will be followed by a 'black week', during which college cluster-wise dharnas will be held.

""The DUTA will observe a five-day strike from March 19 along with various action programmes that will culminate in a citizen's march to Parliament on Marh 28,"" said DUTA president Rajib Ray."

Students have normally always been divided between the binary of Left and Right even on relatively neutral issues like hostel availability, fellowships and seat cuts. This is the first time that the Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), All India Students Association (AISA), Students Federation of India (SFI), Democratic Students Front (DSF), National Students Union of India (NSUI) and other groups have come together to oppose the administration.

What is at stake can be gauged from the fact that JNU Teachers Association (JNUTA), JNU Students Union (JNUSU) and all other organisations on campus are unanimous in opposing the decision of the administration to make attendance compulsory. For someone who has never been to JNU, all this fuss will certainly be somewhat strange. Regular academic courses are supposed to be taught through classrooms and hence, mandatory attendance is a logical consequence. Also guidelines provided to the universities by the UGC clearly lay down a minimum requirement of 75 percent attendance in classroom programs. At a first glance, it seems bizarre to even oppose the JNU administration.

Here, one should understand that attendance registers were never used at JNU. Since its inception and until this year, there has been no system of marking the attendance of a student in any course. That said, during my stay at the university, I have never met any student missing class without any reason. Students attend class not out of fear, but for the high quality of lectures on offer and the interesting structure of courses. It is a pity for the Indian education system that rather than following the successful model of JNU, which kept its high ranking over the years, UGC has always had to force attendance on students. This, even though forced attendance has given us nothing but a deteriorating higher education system. For instance, Aligarh Muslim University, Banaras Hindu University, Allahabad University and others have seen a steady decline in academic quality after this attendance system came into place.

The news caught the attention of the national media last week when students marched to the administrative block and held a protest rally. The administrative block or 'Freedom Square' has been the site of many protests before the administration banned any protests within a 100-metre radius of the block. Even though the JNUSU, JNUTA and other outfits called this ban an attack on political freedom on campus, for over a year, nobody dared to violate the order.

It was the almost non-existent NSUI that held a 'Pakoda Protest' last week within the 100-metre radius, to protest against the Narendra Modi government's policies and the attendance issue. The Left-led students union as well as the ABVP went into a crisis of legitimacy. NSUI with a handful of cadres dared to challenge the administration, while the bigger outfits paid lip service. As four members of the NSUI were slapped with huge fines, all the parties decided to launch a civil disobedience movement to show that they too could challenge the administration.

This internal political battle of JNU has again made it a hot topic of debate in the country, but it took us away from the real issue.

While debate should be around the legitimacy of forcing adult students in general, JNUSU and JNUTA are making it a battle between the BJP/RSS and JNU. Slogans that are being raised in the campus and the articles being produced in the media reek of elitism. JNU students and teachers seem to believe that their university deserves special treatment. Compulsory attendance is a feature of UGC guidelines to the universities. It should have been pointed out by national outfits like ABVP, NSUI, AISA, SFI etc that forcing students to attend the classes serves no purpose.

A working model of JNU shows that interesting course structure and good teachers can attract 100 percent attendance to classes. What is happening is that in various articles, pamphlets and slogans, they are pointing out that JNU is different from other universities and students here are special. It is another way of imposing a Brahminical class system. They want to keep their privilege of free environment to themselves, while being silent on the lack of freedom in other universities. Hence, maintaining inequality at the institutional level among the various institutions.

Many professors from JNU have rightly pointed out that research through field work surveys will suffer if student has to visit the centre everyday to sign the attendance sheet. Their movement would have been more credible had they raised the issue at the pan-India level. Why do they think students at Jamia Millia Islamia, AMU, BHU etc do not face these problems? Why do they think they are special? They are special because the model they are trying to save for themselves is not being implemented in other institutions.

Moreover, JNUSU leaders are equating this diktat as a Hindutva attack on a 'secular liberal institution'. They are calling classroom with forced attendance a shakha. For the sake of general knowledge, compulsory attendance is a feature of UGC guidelines that has never been opposed by any government. Taking shot at the past of the vice-chancellor Jagadesh Kumar (particularly, his stint at IIT-Delhi), students can be heard raising the slogans ""JNU ko IIT nahi banne denge (We won't let JNU turn into IIT)"". Any person with a basic reading of mass movements knows the importance of language to form public opinion. Do these students leaders really believe that Indian public will support them for not transforming into an IIT? Not going into the details, IIT remains an epitome of quality education in India.

It is high time that rather than showing their elitist narrow pride in JNU culture, these students leaders try to form a pan-Indian public opinion against compulsory attendance. After all, the people who are eligible to elect their government are responsible enough to decide on if they want to attend a class or not.

Excerpts from an interview with Union HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar

Q. Shiksha Mitras held huge protests in UP recently...

A. A large number of teachers were appointed under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and RTE. It's impossible to confirm all of them at one go. Since education is a state subject, every state has its own rules. However, the Centre had mandated TET as a qualification. The appointment of those who did not clear TET has now been reversed in UP. The government has organized a second TET exam. After RTE, teachers were given the option of getting a diploma in education. Some 4-5 lakh teachers did, but another 15 lakh did not. Now they have been given another chance, till 2019.

Q. Last December, you told Parliament there were close to nine lakh primary school teacher vacancies.

A. That is not true. The student teacher ratio should be 30, so there are enough teachers. The problem is in their deployment. No one wants to go to rural areas, so the shortage seems starker there. That is why we have instructed all states to ensure proper deployment.

Q. What concrete steps is the Centre taking on primary education? Is the RTE being reviewed?

A. We are not reviewing RTE, we are in fact strengthening it. We have defined learning outcomes. On the basis of these, a National Assessment Survey was done on November 13, which will henceforth be an annual exercise.

Q. The states complain that they do not have enough funds for primary education.

A. That is not so. In 2014, states used to get Rs 3 lakh crore, which has gone up to Rs 6 lakh crore now. The 14th Finance Commission had recommended that allocation for education be increased 10 per cent every year. States that aren't doing so are the ones now complaining."

However, the teachers are in no mood to give up the issue.

On Monday, several teachers under different teachers' unions gathered outside the office of the deputy commissioner and staged a protest. The teacher demanded action against the local political leader for misbehaving with teachers and also for backing out than taking responsibility to clean the school campus. They also demanded safai karamcharis under MC to do the job.

The teachers unions, following a protest, met deputy commissioner Pradeep Agarwal and submitted their memorandum to him. The teachers' unions have demanded FIR to be lodged against local BJP leader Anil Arora who videographed the students and teachers and uploaded it on social media. The teachers have demanded action against him for barging into school, misbehaving with the teachers and defaming them.

Besides this, the teachers have demanded funds to hire safai karamcharis or to ask safai karamcharis under MC to clean the school campus. Teacher Sukhdhir Sekhon said, ""The teachers have been reinstated. However, the issue is not over yet. The problem of cleaning schools will not be resolved until we get safai karamcharis. There is no post of sweepers in primary schools and therefore we have placed our demands for safai karamcharis under MC to clean school campus. We have submitted our demand to DC, who has assured us that he will pursue the matter.""

Another teacher Satvir Singh Rohni said, ""We have demanded action against the local leader who had misbehaved with our teachers, videographed them and uploaded the video on social medial to defame them. We want him to be booked under criminal charges.""

He added, ""If action is not taken against him in 15 days, the teachers will take to the roads and protest.""

In the meantime, Agarwal said, ""The demands of the teachers would be taken up with the concerned officials.""

On Monday, the district education office has issued orders to all block primary education officers in the district to ensure that no student is sent outside campus during school hours.

Talking about the absence of safai karamcharis in schools, DEO Jaspreet Kaur said, ""The problem is there in the entire state. But the issue can be resolved if teachers make some efforts. In different areas, some schools have managed to get sweepers with the help of councillors, sarpanches and school management committee. The teachers should have pro-active approach to deal with the situation."""
