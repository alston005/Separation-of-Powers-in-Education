This article is part of Inc42's special year-end series -- 2018 In Review -- in which we will refresh your memory on the major developments in the Indian startup ecosystem and their impact on various stakeholders -- from entrepreneurs to investors. Find more stories from this series here.

""The value of an idea lies in the using of it."" -- Thomas Edison

The cup of ideas runneth over in the Indian startup ecosystem. A good idea is the genesis for any successful startup, but sometimes just having a good idea is not enough.

According to the findings of a survey by the Institute for Business Value and Oxford Economics, 90% of India's startups fail within the first five years. It added that the lack of pioneering innovation is the major reason for the failure of Indian startups -- in essence, they are copycats of startup ideas of the West, the study said.

Turns out, almost half of the Indian startups are actually not needed at all.

It is the absence of scalable ideas that makes 9 out of 10 Indian startups sink like lead balloons, despite the best intentions of founders and investors. The lack of originality is clear from this caveat -- Despite being the third largest startup ecosystem after US and China, the number of international patents India has applied for in 2015-16 was only 1,423 whereas Japan's count stood at 44,235, China at 29,846 and South Korea at 14,626.

This shows the clear mismatch between the number of startups mushrooming and the extent of innovation in the country compared to others.

As per Inc42's The State of The Indian Startup Ecosystem 2018 report, more than 10K Indian startups have shut their operations so far.

While failure is a hard pill to swallow, it is also a great teacher. For a startup founder, there is no bigger disappointment than seeing the product of their efforts come to nought. However there is also the flipside -- if you've never failed, you'll never know what works.

With 2019 just a couple of days away, we at Inc42 have compiled a list of the biggest failed Indian startups of the year. As late-night talk show host, Conan O'Brien said, ""Through disappointment one gains clarity and with clarity comes conviction and true originality""

Just Buy Live connected retailers to buy goods directly from brands across multiple categories such as food, drinks, personal care, auto, smartphones, fashion, stationery, etc. The startup also offered an unsecured credit lending to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to facilitate the transaction on its portal and provide working capital to small retailers. In August 2017, the startup raised $100 Mn (INR 699.25 Cr) Series B funding from a Dubai-based investment firm, Ali Cloud Investments.

Why it failed

Various reports claim that Just Buy Live may have shutdown due to an unscalable business model and negative cash flow. As per Entrackr's report in March this year, Just Buy Live's cofounder said that the company has temporarily been shut down and would resume operation after raising fresh funding. Its website is currently down.

Shotang was a business-to-business (B2B) online marketplace that connected retailers, distributors and manufacturers to discover, transact and manage their business online using their platform. Its main products were mobiles and apparel. It earned revenue through commissions paid by distributors per transaction.

Why it failed

At its peak Shotang had a $40 Mn (INR 279.7 Cr) market valuation. It had last raised $864K (INR 6.8 Cr) from Patamar Capital in February this year, and $5 Mn (INR 35.94 Cr) from Exfinity Venture Partners in December 2015. Techcircle cited an anonymous person saying that the money it last raised was ""primarily meant to pay off creditors, employees, partners. It tried but failed.""

It is likely that the business was forced to scale down its operation amid fierce competition from the likes of Flipkart, Amazon and Paytm Mall.

PortDesk provided an e-procurement software solution for logistics management for port-related operations such as accounting, cash management, ports DA estimate and voyage, layout and contract management.

Why it failed

In June this year, it was reported that PortDesk has shutdown its business, however, the reason is still unknown. Only a year earlier, the startup had raised $2 Mn (INR 13.98 Cr) in a seed funding round from a Singapore-based maritime services company, Alphard Maritime Group. The startup's founder Pushpit Pallav was not reachable for comments.

Undoubtedly India's largest crypto exchange, Zebpay (till its closure) enabled users to buy and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Ethereum, and Litecoin, or to purchase airtime and gift cards. According to its website, it had over 3 Mn users.

Why it failed

Zebpay decided to down its shutters in the aftermath of the circular issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on 6 April 2018, restricting banks and regulated payments companies from extending any services to crypto exchanges and wallets.

Many Indian cryptocurrency exchanges, as well as crypto groups, soon knocked the doors of the Supreme Court which, after multiple hearings, has listed the matter for further hearing in January next year.

However, amid the lack of crypto rules and regulations in India, Zebpay, on September 28, 2018 announced its closure. In a statement, it said, ""At this point, we are unable to find a reasonable way to conduct the cryptocurrency exchange business."" The crypto exchange, however, continues to allow users to deposit and withdraw coins/tokens into their wallet.

Since then, the situation has only worsened -- the founders of Unocoin, another leading crypto exchange, were arrested on October 23 by Bengaluru Police over a Bitcoin ATM installation.

Not only Zebpay, a slew of exchanges including Coinsecure, BTCXIndia, MoneyTrade, Bitconnect and more shut down for various reasons this past year.

Online parenting app Babyberry helped parents of a newborn baby to provide the best possible care for their child's holistic growth and development from physical, cognitive, social to emotional growth. The app included features such as digital vaccination chart and reminders, health records management and access to the nearest doctors based on geolocation.

Why it failed

It is uncertain as to what lead BabyBerry to shutdown its operations. Its website is pulled down, it hasn't posted any feeds on its social media since October last year, nor any queries to the founders could elicit any response. In August this year, a report had cited its founder saying that the startup is currently looking to solve technical errors on the platform after many of its customers reported the glitches. Notwithstanding, the startup had raised $1 Mn (INR 6.99 Cr) in 2016 meant for product development and marketing.

MrNeeds offered consumers an online subscription-based service for the delivery of products such as milk, bread, eggs, and other grocery items. In June 2017, ET had cited Wadhwa saying that its ""per delivery costs are 50% to 70% lower than the industry standard,"" and was serving 36K monthly orders for 9K families across Noida.

Why it Failed

The startup has pulled down its website, and is mobile application is not found anymore on Google's play store. It is, however, not clear as to what lead the startup to shut its operations. It is likely that the startup closed down its shutters amid fierce competition from the likes of BigBasket, DailyNinja, and others. Inc42's efforts to reach out to the founders have gone unanswered.

Bike rental startup Tazzo was focussed on point-to-point commuting service and charged INR 5 per km. Its mobile application was integrated using GPS technology and tracked every movement of its entire fleet in real-time, including overspeeding, theft, etc.

Why it failed

TheDearth of the follow-on funding was the main reason for Tazzo to shut down its operation. In October 2016, the startup had raised about $225K (INR 1.5 Cr) seed funding from DSG Consumer Partners, but the capital-intensive nature of the sector it catered too, and the lack of funding, forced the startup to halt its operation in September this year.

Trucks and logistics platform Ezytruk connected carriers, shippers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), to enable systematic transportation of goods. It offered services such as price comparison between carriers, real-time information of the goods, warehouse space management, etc.

Why it failed

Ezytruk had raised a seed funding of $147K (INR 1.02 Cr) from Dubai-based investors Ajith Nair and Anish K in January 2017. However, the startup could not scale and grow further as it was unable to raise further rounds of funding, reported Techcircle, which ultimately led the founders to shutdown the operation this year.

B2B wholesale marketplace Wydr offered a range of products across categories like fashion, home, automotive and electronics to manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. The platform allowed sellers to customise their requirements, negotiate prices, and instantly close deals. As at February 2018, the startup claimed to have added over 10K manufacturers and distributors across cities in India.

Why it failed

A report by Entrackr on November 3 cited ShopClues cofounder Sandeep Aggarwal and an early investor in Wydr as confirming the shutdown. The report said that ""the company (Wydr) was scaling down for the past three months and finally pulled the plug a couple of days ago."" An email query sent to Wydr did not elicit any response. Its official website (www.wydr.in) is currently pulled down.

Monkeybox provided Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) - approved vegetarian meals for kids in the age group of 3-18 at school. As on July 2017, the company claimed to be supplying over 1,500 meals per day to more than 85 schools in Bengaluru, with over 2K subscribers on its platform.

Why it failed

The Blume Ventures-backed foodtech startup shut down its operations amid much surprise and speculation. On one hand, the startup had been making quite a few acquisitions -- such as food delivery company 75 In A Box, juice delivery startup RawKing -- and, on the other, there was speculation that it was shutting down as it had failed to garner the required revenue to stay afloat amid fierce competition. On March 23, Monkeybox published a statement saying that ""the operation will be temporarily terminated.""

However, the termination was final. Its official website (www.monkeybox.in) was pulled down.

Apart from Indian startups that shut shop, there are some companies that ceased their operations in India after facing stiff competition and declining revenue. Here are the top top international companies whose India operations were shut down this year.

Walmart-owned ecommerce company Flipkart acquired the Indian arm of global retail company eBay in March 2017 for an undisclosed amount. Like any other ecommerce platform, eBay facilitates consumer-to-consumer and business-to-consumer sales through its website.

However, the big difference between eBay and the others is it enables trading on its platforms both in an auction or a fixed price sale. In a buyer's auction, buyers bid for a specific product and in a seller auction, different sellers bid their fixed price for a single product and the buyer chooses the best offer.

Why it failed

In May this year, eBay announced that it was ending its partnership with Flipkart and also forbade the latter to use the eBay.in brand. As the partnership ended, Flipkart migrated eBay India sellers and customers to its platform. Although being among the first players in India's ecommerce space, eBay couldn't actually rake in much revenue and faced fierce competition from Flipkart and Amazon.

As the company slowed down, and before Flipkart took over, eBay India had fired more than 350 employees from its Indian arm.

The reasons for eBay's failure in India have been many: the marketplace model was ahead of its time (eBay launched in 2005); there was no guarantee of product quality for either the buyer or the seller, and Indians never really warmed up to the idea of online auctions.

The company CEO, Devin Wenig, has announced eBay will be relaunched with a new business model in India.

The Alibaba-backed Chinese dockless bike rental company, Ofo, offered bicycles for rent on campuses and gated communities across New Delhi, Indore, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, Pune, Coimbatore, and Chennai. At the time of announcing its India operations, the company claimed to have completed 1 Mn rides across seven countries.

Why it failed

Ofo's move to shut down its dockless bike renting service in India is part of company's strategy to scale down its operations in international markets, including countries such as Australia, Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, and Israel.

Ofo maintains that the move is aimed at remaining profitable. Techcrunch cited Ofo France general manager Laurent Kennel as saying that the company would focus on ""mature and promising markets"" such as Singapore, the US, the UK, France, and Italy. Moving forward, it is believed to be communicating with local markets about its plans.

Tapzo was an ""all-in-one"" app that used to aggregate more than 35 different apps in one place, across categories such as cabs, food, recharge, bill payment, news, cricket, horoscopes, and more. Tapzo's numbers were definitely impressive: 14,000 daily user base, 55K daily transactions, and an annual run rate (ARR) of INR 210 Cr in GMV/bookings.

Why It Failed

Tapzo's reduced valuation at its last funding round can be considered as a trigger towards its shutdown. Tapzo raised $1.9 Mn (INR 13.28 Cr) in December 2017 from existing investors RB Investments Pte Ltd and Ru-Net South Asia at a post-money valuation of $47.3 Mn (INR 308 Cr) -- nearly 50% less than its valuation in the previous round -- $85.54 Mn (INR 600 Cr).

Around mid of 2018, in August, the startup got finally acquired by Amazon. After the acquisition, Amazon has merged the entire Tapzo team with Amazon Pay, and it was working in the backend. Media reports said that Tapzo's founders are likely to get on board Amazon Pay's team in India.

HolaChef was a food aggregator that connected customers with chefs across the city, offering a new menu selection every day as per its website. Before shutting its operations three months back, the company was managing packaging, storage and delivery of the food.

Why It Failed

The startup was shut down around May 2018 amid a cash crunch. A media report in August has suggested that Kalaari Capital and India Quotient had already resigned from the board of directors of HolaChef earlier in the year.

With the increased dominance of players like Foodpanda, Zomato and Swiggy in the online food delivery market, investors lost interest in the startup. This was coupled with a market correction to make things worse. The last funding raised by Holachef was in February this year when it raised $28,602 (INR 20 Lakhs) in Series B round.

Foodpanda pounced on the chance, acquiring the startup for cheap -- the deal was said to fetch minimal returns HolaChef investors. For Foodpanda, the acquisition was an attempt to test waters in the cloud kitchen space, which its bigger rivals Swiggy and Zomato were already exploring.

A cursory glance at the startup shutdowns reported by Inc42 in the past three years shows that of the 32 startups that ceased their operations, most of them were from sectors such as consumer services, ecommerce, and fintech sectors. However, these sectors were among the top trending sectors in 2018, attracting investment, mergers, acquisitions, and new ventures. In fact, these are sectors that are expected to do better than all other sectors as well.

Goes to prove that it's not all about the idea, doesn't it?

What startups can learn from these stories is to buckle up their business strategy, take stock and identify even the most minuscule problems, and start rectifying them, immediately. They can also sleep on the fact that an idea -- or even market demand -- doesn't alone make a brilliant startup. It's also about execution and the right time, right place. As Edison also said, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.""

Update: Holachef and Tapzo have been acquired and not shutdown as was wrongly stated in an earlier version of this article."

Class 10 students in Kashmir's Pulwama & Shopian districts excelled with highest pass percentage, even though schools there were closed for more than 100 days.

New Delhi: Community schooling and continuous efforts by the locals is what led to excellent Class 10 results in south Kashmir's Pulwama and Shopian districts, the most disturbed region in the Kashmir Valley last year, say local residents and students.

The Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education (JKBOSE) announced the Class 10 results for Kashmir division on Saturday, and Pulwama and Shopian districts in south Kashmir recorded the highest pass percentage. While Pulwama recorded a pass percentage of 84.5 per cent, the pass percentage in Shopian was 83 per cent. Both these figures are higher than that of Srinagar, which recorded a pass percentage of 81.9 per cent.

The overall pass percentage in Kashmir this year was 75.44, compared to 62.94 last year.

According to the state government data, in 2018, schools in Pulwama district were shut for 170 days and, in Shopian they were closed for 118 days by the administration due to fear of disturbance. This shutdown was apart from the number of regular holidays that the students got.

During the 2016 unrest in Kashmir following the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani, 32 school buildings were burnt and most of them were in south Kashmir. In 2017, the HRD Ministry had devised a roadmap for Kashmir to improve the education scenario in the state. Construction of school buildings was also a part of the ministry's plan. However, no construction has happened so far in Pulwama and Shopian districts.

While the district administration credited the government's efforts for the results, school teachers said it was largely because of the intervention by the local residents.

""Schools were shut down for most part of the academic year and there was no way they could have completed their syllabus. It was largely because the locals ran community schools for students in several parts of the districts, that they were able to study,"" said Masood Taing, a teacher at a government school in Shopian.

Community schools are like coaching classes, where a couple of teachers gather to teach students either at somebody's home or a community centre, depending on availability. There are more community schools in rural Kashmir than in urban areas.

""We used to study at home most of the time because schools were shut. We used to write down all the doubts and clarify them with our teachers when schools reopened. Community schools also shut down during curfew in the town, (but) they were mostly open in villages,"" said Abid Hassan, a student from Pulwama district who scored 88 per cent.

Reham Mir, who scored 90 per cent marks, also said he studied at home and with the help of a community school.

Malik Mohammad, a resident of Pulwama, praised the efforts of the students in south Kashmir.

""Schools were closed for more than five months in Pulwama district. How can one expect students to finish their syllabus? Despite all these odds they have managed to study and not just study, get excellent results. All of this is because they are self-motivated and get help from locals who run community schools,"" Mohammad said.

""Students from south Kashmir are traditionally known to be excellent in studies because they know that they will not get support from schools, so they have to be self-dependent,"" he added.

G.N. Itoo, director of school education, gave all the credit to students. ""Despite all the problems students have shown excellent results in Shopian and Pulwama. They are all very hard-working students,"" he said.

Class X students in Pulwama & Shopian excelled with highest pass percentage, even though schools there were closed for more than 100 days

New Delhi: Community schooling and continuous efforts by the locals is what led to excellent Class X results in south Kashmir's Pulwama and Shopian districts, the most disturbed region in the Kashmir Valley last year, say locals and students.

Though 2018, young with expectations and hope for development, began on a slow and steady note with projects like the Kochi Water metro and Smart City receiving a boost, tragedy struck by the middle of the year, after a school van carrying pre-school children of a playschool fell into a temple pond at Ayani in Maradu.

This was to be the first among the many disasters Ernakulam would witness in the coming months.

Hardly a month later, Kerala woke up to another rude shock, the death of SFI member and Maharaja's College student Abhimanyu, which sparked state-wide protest and unravelled a story of political vendetta.

Migrant labourers were brought under the scanner after 22-year-old Nimisha, a native of Malayidamthuruthu, was hacked to death in Perumbavoor.

And even as Kochi prayed for brighter days, bad times came visiting again after Independence Day, when heavy rains led to flooding, rendering many homeless and looking for shelter in relief camps. Homes in Aluva, Paravoor, Varapuzha went underwater spiralling peoples lives out of control.

If that was not enough, the factional feud began rearing its ugly head in municipalities in and around Ernakulam. The nuns' protest demanding the arrest of Jalandhar Bishop Franco Mulakkal gained prominence at Vanchi Square in High Court.

Another nail in the coffin was the death of Ebin Paul an IT professional, a native of Kochi in October, who was killed in a road accident along the pot-hole ridden Kakkanad-Palarivattom route. Yet, despite the tragedies, Kochi did have its share of positive moments.

The Cochin International Terminal attained the one crore passenger benchmark this year while authorities also opened its renovated domestic terminal on a budget of Rs 240 crore. The water metro received a boost while eight small bridges connecting tiny islands under the Goshree Islands Development Authority (GIDA) at an estimated cost of Rs 38.40 crore were thrown open to the public.

The much-anticipated City Gas Pipeline project gathered steam. Adding to Kochi's bag of happiness was the 'conditional permission' granted by the city council to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL) for digging up roads to laying optical fibre cable(OFC) and drawing overhead lines for their ambitious project.

The Kochi Muziris Biennale also took off on December 12.

Student politics play spoil sport

The murder of 20-year-old Abhimanyu, a BSc Chemistry student of Maharaja's College, cast a pall of gloom on nearly all college campuses It brought to light the intrusion of fanatics into educational institutions. Debates raged over the validity of campus politics. This was also the year which saw two women vice chancellors stepping down from their offices after a successful and fruitful stint. J Letha of Cusat and Rose Varghese of NUALS, proved to tough nuts when it came to making their institutions premier ones.

The rains, bandhs and hartals wreaked havoc on the academic calendar in 2018. The playschool van accident at Maradu led to the death of three including two children. Guidelines to be followed by the schools with regard to school buses and vans were drawn. However, it was not all that bad for the education sector. The year saw a spike in the number of admissions in government schools. Around 1.85 lakh students had sought admissions in government schools all over the state and the numbers were significant enough in the district too.

Kochi metro gets a push

The Kochi Metro, which is now an integral part of City's transport sector, focused on brand building activities mainly in 2018 along with launching some key steps in connection with Water Metro, the formation of Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (UMTA) and second phase expansion of the Metro to Kakkanad. It also actively associated the flood relief activities. The KMRL conducted free services thereby helping the rescue workers to reach Aluva and supply relief materials. The agency also The reconstruction of Champakkara bridge was also launched along with the preparatory work at Petta- SN Jn stretch

Sorrow of motorists

City roads turned death traps this year. Ebin Paul's death along the pot-hole ridden Palarivattom-Kakkanad route shocked the collective conscience of the city. Officials, who were till then in a state of apathy, woke up from their slumber. The inaction of the authorities catapulted protests. It was the private bus owners, backed by organisations like the Kerala Private Bus Operators Association, who first threatened to suspend services in the route.

Fall of the football hype

A host of events kept Kochi busy in the year that passed by even though Kerala Blasters, the city's most high-profile team, endured a torrid time. Blasters suffered their worst run in ISL history, with popular coach David James facing the axe last week. It followed the fans' boycott of the last three matches. But the football fans were treated to some quality action earlier in the year when Spanish premier league club Girona and Australian Melbourne City played friendlies with Kerala Blasters.

Year of factional feuds

The Congress party has become synonymous with factional feuds. Local bodies such as Thrikkakara, Kochi Corporation, Kalamassery Municipality and Maradu Municipality witnessed a year of ugly politics too. In Kalamassery municipality, Jessy Peter had to step down after KPCC helped the Congress I faction oust her from the post and appoint Rukiya Jamal, wife of former chairperson Jamal Manakadan, as the new chair. At Thrikkakara municipality, the LDF once again came to the front with the Congress rebel Sheela Charu shifting to the LDF and becoming elected as chairperson. However, the factional feud in the Congress party at Corporation reached nowhere, though a section of Congress workers pushed for Shiny Mathew as the Mayor candidate.

Floods

Aluva, Kalamassery, Paravoor, Angamaly were the constituencies which bore the major brunt of the floods in Ernakulam. Lakhs of people were shifted to relief camps. The Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL) at Nedumbassery, was shut down due to flooding for several days. Approximately 2 lakh people were displaced in Paravoor alone, as 60,000 homes were inundated in the aftermath of the floods, said Paravoor MLA V D Satheeshan. The livelihood of agricultural and dairy farmers weavers, fishermen went for a toss. The Chekutty doll from Chendamangalam rose as the symbol of resilience.

Upbeat health sector

At least 300 cases of leptospirosis resulting in two deaths broke out in the district post-floods. H1N1 cases also reared its ugly head. The silver lining, however, was the introduction of the Ernakulam District Comprehensive Cancer Control Programme aimed at the early detection of cancer. On the infrastructure front, new blocks are under construction at the General Hospital, Ernakulam Medical College and Cochin Cancer Research Centre. The year also marked the fifth anniversary of the government takeover of Ernakulam Medical College. ""Despite the floods, the quality and availability of health care remained stable. This year, we also received a major boost in the implementation of Ardram project,"" said Dr N K Kuttappan, DMO, Ernakulam."

This is the first time the city's AQI has slipped to the 'severe' category in December.

While Delhi recorded the AQI at 415, it was logged at 406 in Faridabad, 426 in Noida, 441 in Ghaziabad and 427 in Greater Noida. In Manesar, the AQI was recoded at 263 (poor) on Sunday. The 24-hour average of PM2.5 in Gwalpahari was recorded at 184.87 micrograms per cubic metre.

This keeps the pollution level in the 'very poor' range,"" a SAFAR report said.

As per the forecast, the situation is expected to worsen in the next two days. ""Currently, the wind speed is very low and likely to go down further. The meteorological factors are already unfavourable as cold wave conditions are expected to continue for the next two days. The city, therefore, may not get any respite from pollution at least till Tuesday,"" said a Met official.

According to the SAFAR forecast, the city's AQI is expected to be between 460 and 523 (severe levels).

According to experts, there's an urgent need to implement all emergency measures. ""The situation is probably the worst this season. Also, the forecast states that it is going to be worse in the city. The authorities should, therefore, immediately put in place emergency measures so that the situation doesn't deteriorate,"" said Niranjan Raje, former member of EPCA and a resident of Gurugram. An official of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), ""As per the norms, the graded response action plan (GRAP) measures under the 'severe' category will be implemented if the air quality remains in the category continuously for 48 hours. However, all the measures under 'very poor' level are already in place."" He also said the schools were already shut for winter vacation.

Meanwhile, the deteriorating air quality in the capital reached the ""severe"" category on Sunday even as yet another cold day was recorded with the minimum temperature plunging to three degrees Celsius, four notches below normal. The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded at 415 and IMD has forecast that air will remain ""severe"" till January 2 owing to unfavourable conditions like high moisture content and low temperatures.

CPCB's task force, which held an emergency meeting on Sunday, asked agencies to be wary of firecrackers being burst on New Year's ordering strict action against violators. The emergency meeting was convened on the Graded Response Action

Plan (GRAP) after the average PM2.5 level crossed the 300 micrograms per cubic metre ""danger"" mark after 9am on Sunday. While measures already in force must continue, enforcement agencies need to step up action, particularly in hotspots in Delhi NCR, CPCB officials said.

Agencies in Delhi and the four neighbouring towns of Noida, Ghaziabad, Faridabad and Gurugram have been asked to be on high alert and carry out night patrolling. ""We have also asked them to take action on waste burning and construction activities. There must be strict compliance to the Supreme Court order regarding bursting firecrackers on New Year's Eve,"" said a CPCB official.

Sehrawan's students now travel 2km to village Dhani to reach the nearest school. Sat Singh, an elderly resident, said: ""I've myself studied in the GPS. It was running fine. I don't know why the government decided to shut it down."" Most parents in Sehrawan said they find it hard to send their kids to school now. Sukhvinder Singh said, ""Even though Dhani is not too far off, I can't send my son there, as the national highway runs between our villages, and it's dangerous to cross it every day with the kid. So he's sitting at home. This was the only school in the village, and they have closed it.""

The elementary education department at Panchkula has decided to close or merge 62 GPSs having ""zero student strength"" this year. Of these, four are in Gurugram, including the one at Sehrawan, as well as GPS at Daultabad, Government Girls Primary School at Garhi, GPS at Rampur. An education department official said: ""This decision was taken by the department. We had no say in it. Officially, the reason is low attendance.""

According to official records that TOI has sourced, at the time of being closed down, GPS Sehrawan had zero students and two teachers. Charan Singh, one of the teachers at the school, said: ""I don't know what the records say, but at the time the school was unofficially shut down in 2015, we had around 26 students."" Today, the four rooms in the school lay deserted. A poster in one room displays the midday meal schedule, that includes among others chaat on Monday and dal on Wednesday. One of the walls has a political map of Haryana, showing different districts.

A letter sent by the education department earlier this year reads: ""The government has decided that 62 government primary schools having zero student strength may be closed down or merged. Posts sanctioned and teachers working in schools which are to be merged may be shifted to schools with which it is proposed to be merged. However, at the time of rationalisation, posts of teachers will be rationalised on the basis of actual requirement at that point of time. All such teachers shall compulsorily participate in the next transfer drive.""

Officially, there are no students at GPS, Sehrawan, although the school has two teachers. Following the education department notification, the staff have been told they may be transferred to a school facing staff crunch. Tarun Suhag of Haryana Primary Teachers Association said, ""Primary schools should never be shut down. If at all, closures should happen based on data from three consecutive years, not from a single year."""

Dr T K Joshi, also a health expert, told TOI that in the latest task force meeting, the proposal was discussed but many questioned the move's effectiveness. ""I feel it is a pointless exercise. Children are anyway running around all day in and around the house. Even the indoor air is not much cleaner,"" said Joshi, who is also an adviser to the Union environment ministry.

On highly polluted days, government agencies like CPCB and SAFAR ask people to avoid all outdoor physical activities. According to experts, people with heart or lung ailments, senior citizens and children should remain indoor and keep activity levels low when air quality turns severe.

""Rather than shutting down schools, it will be wise to reduce exposure of those vulnerable. Those suffering from asthma or other respiratory illness should take extra care,"" Joshi said, adding that no decision was taken yet.

In the first week of November in 2016, Delhi shut all schools for three days as its residents struggled with a choking weeklong smog. In 2016, the air pollution in Delhi was the worst on record, and the city had experienced its thickest smog in 17 years, with the average air quality index (AQI) hitting a peak of 497.

Similarly, in the first week of November in 2017, all schools in Delhi were closed for three days. NCR went through an unprecedented pollution crisis last year when the air became unfit to breathe for a week, staying in the 'severe' category between November 7 and 14. The worst was on November 9, when AQI hit 486. Dust from the Gulf region was later identified as the main reason for the smog crisis, contributing slightly more than the crop burning in agrarian states surrounding NCR.

However, this is not the first time that the authorities have contemplated tough actions to protect children. Last month, the GRAP task force had discussed altering school, market and office timings on days when air pollution reaches alarming levels. The idea was to push back school timings from 8am to 10am and push up office and market timings from 10am to 8am, so that the peak pollution timings of morning and evening can be avoided. The proposal was opposed by some members citing logistical issues."

The Gujarat High Court on Thursday sought a reply from the state government and municipal commissioners of Ahmedabad, Surat, Vado-dara, Rajkot, Bhavnagar, Junagadh, Jamnagar, and Gandhinagar, after public interest litigation (PIL) questioning the poor infrastructure in the state for the urban homeless came up for hearing.

A PIL, filed by Vishwas Bhamburkar, was taken up by the division bench of Acting Chief Justice AS Dave and Justice Biren Vaishnav. The bench directed the authorities to file their reply by January 8. Citing the report submitted by Justice Kailash Gambhir committee to the Supreme Court, the petitioner claimed that the population of urban homeless in the state is around 84,822 out of the total population of 6.25 crore.

He argued that despite the considerably high number of urban homeless in the state, there are only 101 urban shelters for the homeless having a capacity to accommodate just 6,430 persons.

He claimed that the remaining 78,392 urban homeless persons are forced to live on streets and footpaths and are in great danger of losing their lives in this extremely cold weather.

Bhamburkar has also argued before the court that despite there being a clear shortage of shelter homes, the state government is sitting idle on Rs 47.85 crore available for the purpose under central schemes. He also claimed that many of the municipal corporations in the state are devoid of any infrastructure for urban homeless in clear violation of central guidelines.

While providing details of each city, the petitioner claimed that the population of urban homeless in the city of Ahmedabad is around 12,318 and the number of shelters in the city is around 46, having a capacity to accommodate just 2,840 persons. Similarly, the population of urban homeless in Surat is around 36,144 and the number of shelters in the city is around 27, having a capacity to accommodate mere 1,278 persons. The petitioner has also claimed that many of the shelter homes in cities across the state have been shut down, but are still shown on the record.

Bhamburkar has prayed to the court to direct the state government to construct adequate facilities for the urban homeless; carry out an independent survey for their identification; and allow them to stay in public buildings such as government schools and community halls during winter, among others."

The court was informed that the Centre funds BMC through authenticated NGOs under the National Urban Livelihood Missions for the welfare of street children and the committee headed by the secretary of the Maharashtra Government Nagar Palika Sanchalan regulates the distribution of funds to the NGOs and audits their functioning for ensuring that the money is ultimately utilised for the benefit of the street children.

Vijay Raghavan, the amicus curiae pointed out that the BMC approximately receives ₹8 crore in a year.

Salim spoke to Firstpost about why he continues to stay away from the public eye, why he values awards and what life is like, outside the many stories he is now known for.

A number of your protagonists are loners, the kind who live a lot in the head. You are seen as a recluse yourself, but that is in relation to literary festivals, ceremonies alone. What is Anees Salim in his own circle of friends and family like? Does he step out, 'catch-up' with friends as they say? What is a slow day for you?

I think I am a lot like my own protagonists. And that is indeed a difficult thing as most of them live in the head and suffer within. Irrespective of their age and social standing, my protagonists represent my angst and uncertainties, and sometimes I wonder if their misfortunes will befall me as well.

I have only a few friends and most of them are from my school days, but I hardly confide in them or catch up with them. In fact, my protagonists have more friends than I have. My world is mostly quiet, and I share my time between the office and home.

If I fail to read a page or write at least one hundred words, it is a slow day for me.

Anees Salim

You appear on social media in fits and starts, often with crisp one-liners about things in the news. How have you tackled this animal of social media in your life? You appear and then disappear, why? Does/has it affected your way of thinking, or writing at any level? Do you forward WhatsApp texts?

I use social media for two reasons. Firstly, to express myself when I am irked, pained, or angered. Secondly, I use it as a platform to showcase my books and the news around them. I don't have a website and I don't blog. So Facebook and Twitter come handy when I want to talk about my books. I disappear from social media when it gets on my nerves, and it often does. But being somewhat active on social media has made my writing neither better nor worse. And no, I don't forward WhatsApp messages.

You don't appear to receive awards, but you keep winning them anyway. For a majority of authors licking their lips at the sight of an award, it would be counter-intuitive. Surely, they mean something to you - what is that something? What do awards do for an author and what do they absolutely don't?

I value awards as much as most writers do. Awards are important for me, especially since I don't promote my work through book tours or attend literary festivals. I stay away from award ceremonies just because the mere thought of being among people unsettles me, and I always request my publisher to receive the award on my behalf. I know it is not the best way to respond to a recognition. But I feel powerless to change myself.

As someone who touches both tragedy and comedy in equal measure, how hard is it to not let your novels become political (given it has enough to feed both)? You do follow the news closely (clear from your one-liners on Facebook) and then there was that line about Pakistan in Vanity Bagh. Have you felt the need to address the present? If not, why?

Keeping my books away from the political space comes naturally to me, though I am a keen follower of current affairs. But you will still find a trace of politics in many of my books. The Vicks Mango Tree, for instance, has the Emergency as its backdrop, though it talks more about people than politics. Even in Vanity Bagh, which talks about the presence of a little Pakistan in every big Indian city, I have tried to focus on human angst and insecurities rather than the political issues because I enjoy writing about inner turmoil rather than political ones.

Every writer I have ever spoken to tells me writing is the loneliest task in the world. Do you feel the same - why? You've now had several books published within the space of six-seven years. Do you plan to slow down? What is the endgame for an author according to you, that point where you feel spent?

Yes, writing is indeed a lonely act. For me, that is the best part of writing. You can completely shut the world out, if only for a few hours, and lose yourself in a domain where you are the town planner, gardener, cook, sculptor and executioner, everything you want to be. I dream of doing it for 10-12 hours a day, but I have a day job and my writing hours are restricted to three or less. The moment I finish writing and shut the manuscript I miss the solitude. I hope I will be able to afford longer writing hours one day.

My pace of writing has considerably slowed down over the years. I don't see myself publishing another book before 2020.

There are two schools of opinion on the 'write what you know' paradigm - one for and the other that says it limits imagination. Which side are you on? You've set multiple novels in places you can relate to -- do you feel like writing something that you feel intimidated by? What is that thing - genre, style?

I subscribe to both theories, and actively practice them. I think writing should be a blend of both. Some of my books are about people and places I know rather well while others are purely based on imagination. The Blind Lady's Descendants and The Small-Town Sea are set in my hometown and they are about people I have grown up with. The Vicks Mango Tree and Vanity Bagh are set in a fictitious city called Mangobagh and they are not even remotely connected to anybody I know, though you will find shades of myself in all my books.

Is there a guilty pleasure you enjoy -- read or watch something that you feel embarrassed to share? Writers are often cast in rigid image of themselves - dark, serious types. Do people in your personal circle treat you as such?

No, there is not any kind of guilty pleasure I enjoy.

People complain about me being an introvert. Not that it matters to them, but they still complain. They fiercely criticise my reluctance to receive awards in person. Ironically, these are the same people who used to mock my academic background and crack jokes about my aspirations to be an author.

I don't see myself as either dark or humorous, but my works are generally referred to as dark and humourous, even when they are not.

From rejection to publishing to winning awards with each publication is there now a little pressure of expectation? You may not be visible but more and more people are looking for you - does that or will that affect you in the future?

Every recognition makes me wary of what I write. On top of that, people keep telling me that I am still to write my best book. That puts a little pressure on me.

They have built a school by pooling Rs 2.20 crore with 24 classrooms and imparting English education alongside Kannada, and it is all set for inauguration.

The 43-year-old Government Higher Primary School, Daddalkad, Bantwal taluk, was in a dilapidated condition in 2015 and had only 30 students. Now it has around 500 children, studying from LKG to class VIII, where English is taught along with Kannada.

It was all possible because of the efforts and foresight of Shree Durga Friends Club, Karenki, led by Prakash Anchan, a garment merchant from Bantwal.

""When most Kannada-medium schools across the state are closing down due to various reasons, we wanted to show the world that this school can be saved by adopting new teaching skills, and today we are successful in doing so. Our mission began three year ago when theschool had only 30 children. Even those who had joined nearby English-medium schools have quit, and have taken admission here,"" says an elated Prakash while speaking to TOI.

The first phase of the school with eight classrooms was inaugurated last April, and second and final phase will be inaugurated by governor Vajubhai Vala on January 5.

Anchan added that they collected all the money from generous donors, who included locals, parents and others. ""We have not taken a single penny from any government be it the Centre or state. When we proposed the same building plan, the government estimated a cost of Rs 6 crore, but we have completed the work by spending Rs 2.2 crore.""

The school has five government-appointed teachers, three guest teachers, three vehicle drivers, and Karate, dance and music teachers. About16 staff are paid by the Shree Durga Friends Club members. All the facilities are provided free-of-cost to children, including transportation.

Success story

In 2015, when the school was about to shut down, the Shree Durga Friends Club members swung into action. They made their own children quit from English-medium schools and admitted them to the school, due to which their number rose to 56 from 30. The members later sought permission from the department of public instruction to convert the medium of instruction to English. It has adopted teaching in the English-medium in a Kannada school, which is a model similar to what is followed in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The club is in a five-year agreement with the government to run the school in various capacities.

Earlier, the school had only three teachers appointed by the government. After taking over, club members have recruited additional teachers, and the club pays their salaries. It has transportation and other facilities."

He gave the example of the proposal to merge Municipal Corporation Primary School (MCPS) Pyare Lal Road 2 and MCPS New Dev Nagar Co-ed School. ""Keeping in view better management, saving of posts and the poor economic condition of north corporation, it would be feasible to merge schools in case of availability of accommodation,"" he said.

The proposal also argues that more and more parents want to educate their wards in morning-shift schools. ""MCPS Pyarelal Road has 202 kids while the Dev Nagar school has 265. After merger, a school with 467 kids and 12 sections will be formed,"" the official said.

He added: ""There are many vacancies in other schools and the staff from the schools being closed down can be sent there. At the same time, we will be able to use the buildings and other infrastructure for purposes such as sports academies.""

The merger of the two schools alone would lead to a surplus of a principal, five teachers and two Class IV employees who could be reassigned. The official also said that 29 schools with low enrolment had been similarly shut down two years ago. But education experts have been criticising the corporations for their failure to enrol more children.

Khagesh Jha, a Supreme Court lawyer and education activist, remarked, ""If the corporation has extra land, why not add to the capital's school infrastructure so that more kids can be brought in the school system? There are more than 20 lakh kids outside the school system in the city. Besides, children from unrecognised schools too need to be brought to government schools.""

The north civic body runs 714 municipal primary schools, in which children, mostly from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, study. Enrolment in all corporation-run schools, however, has been declining steadily. Around 70,000 students have opted out of north schools since the 2012 trifurcation. It then had 3,70,648 students in its primary schools. This figure slid to 3,50,611 in 2013-14 and 3,14,022 in 2016-17. At present, around three lakh students are on the rolls."

A new panic seizes the public imagination every few years. (Mohit Suneja/HT)

Mass hysteria breaks out in India every few years and is increasingly being fuelled by paranoia about the internet.

To the world, Manish Sarki was the perfect all-rounder.

A strapping boy of 18, Sarki worked hard in school during the day and sent fielders scurrying after his shots at the neighbourhood cricket ground in the evenings. He would never get home later than dinner time even when his friends were out chatting, his mother Chandra Maya remembers, and his closest friends joked about how he would blush talking to girls.

Everyone in the village of St Mary's Hill knew Sarki would grow up to be a policeman or join the army. Maybe because he was so well-behaved, no one noticed when he went quiet. They only noticed on the night of August 20 when he didn't come back home.

The village gathered around the Sarki house around 9pm. A chill was enveloping the small mountain village on the outskirts of Darjeeling in northern Bengal, but a small group of men and women trekked to the local police station a couple of kilometers away. Boys go missing all the time, they were told.

Undeterred, the villagers split into smaller search parties and fanned out into the jungles, determined to find Sarki. Their hopes were dashed around 1.30am when a search team stumbled on Sarki's body hanging from the ceiling of an empty pig warehouse on top of a hill.

Below, in spray paint, were the words ""half blood prince was here"" in what everyone recognised was Sarki's handwriting. On the wall behind was drawn a hangman with two victims, an older boy, and more chillingly, a younger one. Every wall of the building had been scribbled on - the words ""illuminati"", ""last king"", ""savage"", ""doped up"" and the number ""666"" appearing repeatedly.

In the light of day, some of the graffiti might have appeared benign - after all, some the walls displayed banalities like ""be the change you want to see"" or ""the thing you fear the most is fear itself"". But in the eerie quiet of a cold mountain night, the villagers were convinced Sarki's death was the doing of the satan. ""I was heartbroken for my son but also scared out of my wits. We were all scared about who the younger boy could be,"" said Chandra Maya.

By the time police arrived two hours later, a mist of rumours had cloaked the village. Wasn't Sarki always on his phone for the past few weeks? And, wouldn't he go out to the graveyard, barely a kilometer away, every night with his phone? ""I think he was going crazy. That's when I heard about the game,"" added Chandra Maya.

By sunrise, everyone had heard of the game: a shadowy application called the Momo Challenge that had apparently killed Sarki. Several explanations were offered. ""For the past few days, he was very sad and distracted. He would be lost in his phone. He never said anything to me, later I found out that he was playing the Momo game,"" said Sarki's friend Deekchen.

But how did he find out? Villagers say the local police first told them of the game, but the police deny ever saying anything. ""In fact, we have not been able to confirm any role of any Momo Challenge game. We never told the locals about the game. Maybe the graffiti made them think that,"" said Hare Krishna Pai, additional superintendent of police.

The next day, a second death, that of 26-year-old Aditi Goyal in Kurseong town, was also attributed to the Momo Challenge, turning the creeping fear into full-blown panic. By then, local politicians had put out statements about the supposedly lethal game, and everyone in the hills was talking about it.

""The whole area was in trauma and everyone was scared of their phones. We found young boys from Class 7 had started playing it. We started spreading awareness and seized phones from those who seemed vulnerable. Someone even sent a message to my daughter,"" said Raju Gurung, a local from Kurseong.

Hindustan Times spoke to at least 20 people in the area and everyone claimed to know a relative, friend or neighbour who had had a close shave with the game. But everyone had a different notion.

Some described the game, which supposedly sets self-harm challenges that finally end in suicide, as an app, some as a Whatsapp message. Some said they received texts, some described a phone number. Indeed, beyond the ubiquitous image of the oblong faced, bulbous eyed doll that has come to signify the game, every detail was foggy. ""Sometimes people are faking names and photos and sending messages 'Hi, I am momo. Let us play a game.' The fear of the game has hypnotised us,"" said Junita Rana, a schoolteacher in Kurseong.

It began with the braids. In June last year, a girl in Rajasthan claimed someone chopped off her braid while she was asleep. Dozens of women across Rajasthan followed up with similar claims. Over the following months, the pattern spread across north India like an epidemic: Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Delhi. By November, over 200 cases of braid chopping had been reported in Kashmir where the trend took its most vicious turn. Many women claimed to have seen Godmen, witches or cats before losing their consciousness. After finding their braids gone, many complained of aches and pains for days after. The police couldn't really find any culprits, so the people took the matter in their hands. In August, a poor woman was killed by a mob in Agra on the suspicion of chopping braids. In October, an old man in Anantnag was killed for the same reason.

Then there was the Blue Whale. In July, a schoolboy's suicide stoked the hysteria around the web-based game created by a Russian tech geek targeting teengers. The 50 challenges begin differently - from shutting yourself in or watching a horror film - proceed incrementally, and end the same way: suicide. Through 2017, more than 150 cases of young suicides across India - West Bengal, Delhi, Indore, Solapur, Dehradun - were blamed on the Blue Whale, often with no more proof that the young person was obsessed with smartphone and videogames. Every case was rife was contradictions and yet, websites were blocked, advisories issued, and in some cases, smartphones banned in schools.

Experts say that underneath the web-fuelled hysteria, something more sinister is going on with the mental health of young people. Samir Parikh, director of the Department of Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences at Fortis Healthcare, insisted that we cannot dismiss these phenomena, but the focus should be on greater media literacy, on making children understand what is right and wrong content, and on teaching people to seek help if they are feeling vulnerable.

""Is there a component of hysteria in all this? Of course, there are lots of stories in the media and they have an impact. But we cannot deny the fact that there are pressures and problems that young people go through silently. If help and access is not given, they can be misused,"" he added.

Parikh is clear that any approach that aims at shutting down access to the internet is wrong, mainly because it is impossible. ""We need to understand that be it Blue Whale or Momo, if you are vulnerable, you might be pulled towards it. So you give people skills and teach people to not bottle it up, tell parents, block or involve authorities.""

India has had a long history of public panic. From a half-man half-monkey roaming the streets in Delhi, sometimes wearing a helmet, to the Munhnochwa (face ripper) of Mirzapur, claimed to be a flying object emitting beams of green or red light, sending shock waves through anyone who came in its contact, and leaving them with bites and scratches on their faces, to the Rathakaatteri (vampire) of Gundalpatti who allegedly sucked the blood of the village cattle, a new panic seizes the public imagination every few years. Many of these have been analysed as incidents of mass hysteria. The patterns have been revealing. Women are more likely to end up as victims than men, children turn to be more vulnerable than adults. The trends pick up in regions or communities marked by oppression of women, economic uncertainty or social anxiety.

Yet, questions remain about why a particular fear grips a set of people at a given time. Did every woman who complained of braid chopping do it herself? Was every alleged case of Blue Whale suicide made up by the parents or the police to evade responsibility? What do the women whose braids were chopped say now? And, did a year of fear and panic leave us any wiser?

In Kanganhedi, a village of 700 houses on the Delhi-Haryana border, Munesh Devi's hair has grown back just enough to tie it in a ponytail. A lot more has changed in her life since last year besides her hairstyle. ""I can no longer work in our field. I hardly leave the house, except being taken to the doctor by my son every two weeks. Any exertion leaves me tired. Even going to funerals gets up my blood pressure. I lie in bed almost all day. Daughters-in-law press my feet.They also bring me rotis to eat in bed,"" said Devi, sitting on a double bed in the living room. Its doors remain shut and its light dimmed to prevent Devi's recurring headache.

They began in July 2017, immediately after she found her braid chopped at the neck. It was there when she finished feeding the cows in the family's farm, she said, but gone when she got back home and slipped back her pallu. ""Must have gone missing while I was travelling home on the back of my son's motorcycle,"" she added. She remembers fainting after the realisation struck. She continues to feel giddy. ""My head spins. My whole body aches. My feet go numb. My teeth hurt."" She doesn't know what ails her; neither does her doctor. He prescribes her pills for each of her symptoms. She shows off the stash to people asking her how she has been doing since ""the incident.""

Munesh Devi's was one of three braids found missing in the area in the course of one eventful day. The other two women don't know, either, who chopped their braids or why they continue to suffer. Sri Devi said she lost her braid while sitting on a couch in the courtyard of her house. One moment it was hanging down her waist, the next moment it was lying on the floor. She had heard of the braid-chopping phenomenon only hours before. ""My uncle, who was visiting us from Pataudi, had told me about a video he had seen on Facebook. I said, 'Mama, please don't say such things.'"" Her son had called 100 after she fainted at the sight of her severed braid. ""The police are yet to tell us if they found anything,"" she said.

Devi also visited a psychiatrist in Dwarka along with her son, at the urging of the police. ""He asked my son some questions. Gave us no answers,"" she said. Her braid was taken away by a forensics team sent in by the police for further investigations. ""We haven't heard from them."" Perturbed by three incidents in a week, people in the village even consulted a tantrik (mystic). ""He spoke about the presence of a mysterious cat in the village. But no such cat or dog has been found,"" she said.

For many women, the disappearance of braids has been transformative. It has allowed them rightful rest after a lifetime's slog at home and farm, won them the nurturing attention of their families, and given them the chance to talk about themselves for the first time. The third ""victim"" in Kangnahedi, Ombati, a daily-wage labourer who found her braid gone while working around the house, is still waiting for her life to change, however. ""No government compensation, no one has even come to offer me a glass of juice,"" she said, lying on a cot and complaining of a headache.

""We sent a team to that village for a couple of hours after a request from the concerned division of the Delhi police, but we haven't received any formal communication from the top brass,"" explained Nimesh Desai, director of the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences, which had investigated the phenomenon of Delhi's Monkey-man in 2001. ""From the preliminary impressions of our team, in all probability, the incidents in Kanganhedi fit into the pattern of mass hysteria, which tends to subside on its own.""

In Kashmir, the last region to be swept up in the storm, over 100 FIRs were registered over six months. Many women alleged masked men entered their homes when they were alone, sprinkled sedatives in the air, and chopped their braids while they lay unconscious. Separatist leaders accused the Indian government, and armed militants suspected the evil hand of intelligence agencies. As locals flooded the streets in protest, shutting down shops and schools, the police resorted to extreme measures, from announcing an award of Rs 6 lakh for information to unleashing riot-control tactics to disperse the crowds. Several vigilante groups armed with lathis and axes emerged to patrol the streets at night. A 70-year-old man in Anantnag died after being hit by a brick by a group of people who suspected him to be a braid chopper.

But now, police say the paranoia and panic was fuelled by nothing substantive.

""Almost all the cases turned out to be without any substance. There were a few cases where the women had cut their hair themselves. In one case, a maid had cut the hair of a girl,"" said additional director general of police (law and order), Muneer Khan. In Kulgam, where 21 cases had been registered, the state government had formed a special investigation team(SIT). Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP), Kulgam, Aijaz Ahmad, who was part of the SIT, said that most of the cases have been closed because the allegations had no factual basis.

""In some of the cases, the culprits remain untraced, while maximum cases turned out to be of hysteria,"" Ahmad said. He said the lack of a single eyewitness in all of the cases was particularly baffling.

Across the valley, the police arrested between 70 and 80 people, including members of vigilante groups, for ""raising false alarm about braid chopping and creating disturbances"".

""We felt that this [braid chopping] was being done by agencies. It was a matter of honour of our women. Everybody wanted this should end. Stone pelting was the only option with us. Surprisingly it did end abruptly after that,"" said a villager from north Kashmir who requested anonymity. Some of them are still visiting the courts for hearings.

It was around 5pm on July 29 last year when Manpreet Singh Sahani climbed on the ledge of his fifth-floor apartment. As he teetered on the edge, neighbours and witnesses on the street below called out to him but could only watch helplessly as he jumped. Initial investigations by local police and testimonies of his friends exposed talk of the Blue Whale Challenge. Several of them took to social media to blame the game and link it to Sahani's death.

In 24 hours, reports of the supposedly lethal game had inundated media, and reports of copycat cases were streaming in from all parts of India, ratcheting up paranoia about mobile phone and internet use among teenagers and their parents. Over the next two months, more than 150 deaths or injuries across the country were alleged to be linked to the game.

But while police initially suspected the boy was an avid gamer and could have been influenced by the Blue Whale Challenge, detailed investigation indicated more offline triggers.

""The boy was in love with a girl who had left him for some other boy. We had gone through his email accounts and mobile phone and found a draft on the phone which clarified his intention to commit suicide,"" said Navin Reddy, deputy commissioner of police Zone 10.

This might not be an isolated phenomenon. Earlier this year, Union minister of state for home Hansraj Ahir told Lok Sabha that a committee formed under the chairmanship of the director general of the Computer Emergency Response Team-India (CERT-In) couldn't establish the involvement of the Blue Whale Challenge in any case.

""The committee analysed the internet activities, device activities, call records and other social media activity, other forensic evidences and also interacted with rescued victims associated with these incidents,"" the minister told the lower house.

Of course, by then several other central ministries, a number of state governments, the Central Board of Secondary Education and even the Supreme Court had got involved, with the apex court calling the game a ""national problem"".

But experts say official agencies may have jumped the gun. ""It was definitely a hoax. We need to shift focus from these voyeuristic things and to suicides, which is a big problem that kills a quarter of a million people. Some of these hoaxes have a life of their own because media makes them into a big story. We need long-term institutional solutions,"" said Soumitra Pathare, director of the Centre for Mental Health Law and Policy.

Back in St Mary's hill, Chandra Maya Sarki has gone back to her old routine -- wake up at the crack of dawn to draw water, fix food for her husband before he leaves for his daily wage work, and then clean their small wooden house. She likes to keep the television on and stray dialogues from the afternoon soaps animate the living room. She stares not at the screen, however, but at the the small framed photo of Sarki hanging on the blue wall, wondering why the mysterious admins of the Momo Challenge chose her child as their prey.

She doesn't know yet that the cyber cell of the West Bengal police has completed its forensic probe of his phone and found no trace of any Momo Challenge. ""If any application is downloaded, the forensic machine would find a trace, even if it is an unknown application. But we have found no such application, or any message on WhatsApp motivating people to play the game. We have found nothing so far,"" said a senior official of the cyber cell on the condition of anonymity.

She doesn't know that police has ruled out any links between the game and the death of Aditi Goyal and that at least two other cases in the state have been found to be hoaxes traced back to mischief makers sending scary messages through WhatsApp. She doesn't know that Sarki's teacher Sarita Sharma has a simple explanation for why he and his friends would go to the graveyard at night -- the mobile network was the best at that spot.

All she knows is that her beloved younger son will no longer come back home at 8pm every day. That she will never make him his favourite meal of dal-aloo and dum-eggs. The money she had been saving with her husband to send him to Bengaluru for higher studies now seems meaningless. Sometimes she talks to Sarki's sister, now in college, about him and the day that took him away from her. She will probably never know what really happened to Sarki or what troubled him enough to withdraw from his friends. Momo Challenge or not, that is the biggest tragedy of all.

The practice, especially amid pre-primary admissions, has not gone down well among the city's parents. According to parents, the schools continue to violate rules laid out even by the government in this regard.

Despite a government rule against personal interviews with children during pre-primary admissions, many schools across the city continue with the process, activists working for educational reforms said.

Vijay Kanojia, a parent said, ""My children, who are twins, were interviewed in one of the schools for admission to the pre-primary section. On one hand, we instruct them to not speak to strangers or accept gifts or chocolates from unknown people and on the other hand, schools take them into separate rooms to interact. Kids, who follow parental guidance, might not perform well. Some kids may speak but, some may not. Despite a government ban on such a practice, schools keep on violating the norms.""

Another parent, Sabiha Ghiasi, who recently took her daughter to a school for admission to the pre-primary section, said, ""I wrote to the principal because I shed a few tears after the my daughter's interview. My daughter was ill and yet, was locked up in a room with four strangers. I asked in the e-mail, if they were teachers. They lured her in with the promise of chocolate. This was surprising because, no where did the notice mention that we were to bring our child along after applying for admission. No where did it say there would be an interview for a baby. We heard her wailing through the door, but the staff at the door chose to ignore our concern. This went on for the longest two minutes of our lives. My daughter is two years and four months old. She was sent out later, unceremoniously, like a play thing; and the door was shut again. So, I did a little research and asked my peers if I overreacted. I asked three mothers of school going children if this is the norm in this city. All three of them answered in the negative. I then decided to tell the principal that what they had done was not okay. There was no empathy for my daughter's distress.""

Education expert Swati Popat Vats, President of India's Early Childhood Association, said, ""Schools should have changed themselves by now. Many parents still wonder and worry why schools conduct interviews for young children even though they have an online form submission process."""

Ten is an awkward age. You're past the tantrum-throwing preschool years, but you're not quite an adolescent, so you don't get to slam doors and negotiate money and media. Somehow though, Swati Roy and Venkatesh Swamy do 10 years of Bookaroo well. The children's literature fest, India's first, started in 2008, when publishing for the 4-14-year-old age group in India was just coming into its own.

The seed of Bookaroo was sown at Eureka!, a children's-only bookstore (now shut down) that Roy and Swamy had begun as a little ground-floor venture in 2004, in Delhi's residential C.R. Park. Roy would painstakingly put together library lists for schools, 'return gifts' for birthday parties, and advise any child who walked in asking for help on what to read next. They soon moved to a more commercial space, where, one day, in walked Jo Williams.

Play and read

She'd been on the team of a children's book award back in the U.K., and worked with a kids' bookstore. They chatted for hours, did a few events together, and that's where the 'rough draft' of a children's book festival was tossed across the table. ""We put together a wish list of people we wanted,"" says Roy. The publishers were thrilled and said they'd support them by bringing in speakers from all over.

Today, they've worked with 35 to 38 publishers and art counsels, with close to 600 authors, illustrators, and storytellers. Remembering their first year, Roy says, ""We wondered: 'Who will come?' 'Will anyone be interested?' We wanted families, so we tapped into the 4,500-strong Eureka! database."" They aimed for 500 people in the first year and got 3,000. Williams put up a few authors; international cultural councils stepped in. Money didn't come easy: every year is still a struggle, with no long-term sponsorship commitment from any brand yet.

They chose the venue much like they made their other decisions -- on gut feeling, and with a commitment to the joy of reading -- when Williams once walked into Anand Gram in a green Delhi suburb, took one look at the large banyan there, and immediately called Roy and Swamy. It became the Kahani tree.

While the venue of the festival is fixed now at the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, the Kahani tree, with large durries spread underneath, is still the place for young children to listen to authors telling tales. Sometimes, they'll just play in the mud, or draw.

An outreach programme, called 'Bookaroo in the City' began, taking authors to schools, chiefly schools for the underserved. The goodwill generated through all their programmes is what has sustained Bookaroo.

Last year, the trio won the Literary Festival of the Year trophy at the London Book Fair International Excellence awards. ""We lost the money we'd put aside for our travel,"" says Swamy. But when they arrived in London, they were overwhelmed. Authors, illustrators, anyone whose lives they'd touched, trudged across town to meet them, drive them around, take them to tea.

Today, they take the festival to 11 cities across India, including Srinagar, and have a presence in Malaysia too. Each event is divided, much like any other literary festival, into different spaces, catering to various age groups, and spread out across all the elements of enjoying a book, with an illustrations gallery and workshops: storytelling sessions (with parallel sign-language sessions), writing workshops, meeting the author, book signing, shopping, and much more.

""We don't 'teach' children how to read; nor do we 'inculcate' the reading habit,"" says Swamy. The thrust is always this: books are fun, and Bookaroo is just a key to enjoying them. On a sunny lawn, with birds chirping, a milkshake in hand, it's just the space to do it."

Meanwhile, her cousin, whom the police suspected, has committed suicide.

Lalau, Agra: The last thing 15-year-old Sanjali Chanakya asked of her mother was that ""she continue to fight for justice"" for her.

""I couldn't fight in this life ma, but you don't give up,"" her mother remembers her saying, shortly before succumbing to full thickness burns that covered more than 50 per cent of her body.

Sanjali was set on fire by two unidentified men who arrived on a red motorcycle Tuesday afternoon, as the class 10 student walked home from Asharfi Devi Chidda Singh Inter-College in the Naumeel village of Agra district, which is located roughly five kilometres from her home in neighbouring Lalau. One of the attackers poured the petrol, while the other threw a lighter at her. The loose sand by the side of National Highway 39 still carries the mark of scorched earth.

After being rushed to S.N. Medical College and Hospital in Agra, Sanjali was transferred to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi the same evening. She died in the wee hours of Thursday.

At least three schools have been shut in Lalau and surrounding villages -- the girls say they are too scared to walk the streets.

DSP Namrita Srivastava, the circle officer of Agra, says ""the police are very close to arresting the culprits"". But it has now been four days since the crime, and Sanjali's family is beginning to lose hope that justice will be done.

""My daughter is gone, and she's never coming back. Now all I can wish for is that the men responsible for this are behind bars,"" Sanjali's mother, Anita, tells ThePrint.

Sanjali had big dreams. ""I want to grow up to be an IPS officer,"" she had told her father Harendra Singh, who smiles as he relives the memory.

""I told her that I'm not a man with enough means to fulfil that promise, but Sanjali didn't quit easily. She told me that 'one way or the other, we must figure it out',"" he says.

Sanjali's older sister Anjali adds: ""Do you know, she even won a bicycle once... I think it was an inter-college general knowledge competition in her school and she came first.""

Rajendra Singh, a fellow resident of the village, remembers Sanjali as a headstrong, independent and ambitious girl, ""who was an exceptional student"". She would even help her father and sister with sums.

Harendra recalls: ""Sometimes, it felt like she wasn't my daughter but my mother. She'd tell me to keep quiet when I wasn't making sense. She'd set the table and ask us all to come for dinner. She wanted to be so many things when she grew up,"" her father tells ThePrint.

Uttar Pradesh deputy CM Dinesh Sharma reached the grieving household early Friday afternoon, accompanied by an entourage of at least 20 police officers, as well as BJP MLA Hemlata Divakar, and former mayor of Agra Anjula Singh Mahor.

Sharma assured the family that the culprits would be brought to justice swiftly, and ""will not be spared"". Further he promised compensation of Rs 5 lakh, as opposed to the initial sum of Rs 2 lakh.

For Sanjali's father, however, the offer is meaningless. ""The deputy CM basically came to negotiate a payment... He was bargaining with us, saying 'Okay not 2, take 5',"" he says.

Asked if she has faith that UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath will take action, mom Anita says: ""Absolutely none.""

Anjali adds: ""If it was his daughter, he'd run barefoot to get this solved.""

Sanjali hailed from a Dalit family, but the police and the family both believe there's no caste angle to her murder. The family, in fact, said Dalit residents of Lalau don't face discrimination.

Members of parties across the spectrum -- the BJP, Congress, BSP, and the women's wing of the CPI(M) -- have made appearances at Lalau to offer their condolences and promise swift justice.

On the other hand, in a tweet Thursday, Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad put forth a challenge that ""if these miscreants aren't caught, then I'll shut the whole country down like what happened on April 2nd.""

A few hours later, he arrived with a group of at least 30 Bhim Army members at the family's doorstep.

""I have faith that they will be caught, but if they're not, then the entire Bhim Army is ready to take to the streets and protest. If someone is being protected, then we won't stand by that,"" Azad said as he addressed the locals and the press.

Another Bhim Army leader, Sikandar Boudh, says the Bhim Army demands swift justice, Rs 1 crore as compensation, a job for a family member, a CBI investigation, and death penalty for the perpetrators. He says these demands have been given in writing to the District Magistrate of Agra, Ravi Kumar.

Amid this political heat, one can hear the wails of Sanjali's aunt, 50-year-old Rajan Devi. A woman supports her as she walks, leading her to the congregation of mourners and bystanders outside the family's home Friday. One hour later, the white sheet-wrapped body of her own 25-year-old son, Yogesh Singh, is placed on the floor in front of her and her husband.

Less than a day after his cousin's death, Yogesh committed suicide in his room by ingesting poison. His mother does not know why, except that her son expressed considerable anxiety at having been summoned by the police as a suspect in the death of his paternal cousin.

""The police had taken him to the station for questioning, and when I went to meet him, he asked me if people in the village knew that he has been taken to the police station. I said they did,"" Rajan Devi says.

She adds that Yogesh was taken by the police to Delhi Wednesday, and even met his cousin while she was in critical care. He was released on return, and even made it home for dinner.

""Everything was normal. He woke up in the morning, had tea, and spoke to the family. I went to get ready to go to his uncle's (Sanjali's father) house, and he came out of his room after some time complaining of an unbearable stomach ache,"" she recalls. Yogesh was declared dead by doctors hours later.

He had completed his B.Ed. and hoped to be the principal of a school someday. In the meantime, he provided for his family by working at Torrent Power, the distributor of electricity in Agra city.

He is also not the first son Rajan Devi is mourning -- Pankaj, Yogesh's elder brother had lost his life under the wheels of a train three years ago.

Bhim Army's Boudh says: ""The police wants to frame the cousin brother because they don't have any leads. An effort to sully the nature of their relationship has been made in this regard.""

Rajan Devi adds: ""The things that people are saying aren't true, about Yogesh and Sanjali. He wasn't a boy like that at all. He was kind and good-natured.""

Yogesh's father, meanwhile, weeps in front of his son's body -- the solitary man on the floor amongst a sea of veiled women.

""We were happy,"" Anjali says, ""and now there is nothing."""

On Thursday (December 20), over 35 trade organisations in Kerala came together to announce that 2019 will be 'anti-hartal year'. The Cochin Chamber of Commerce believes that the frequency of hartals - otherwise known as bandhs - in Kerala is cutting Rs 7,200 crore from the state's GDP.

""There were 97 hartals last year. The traders, hoteliers, bus owners and other establishments were facing a loss of crores of rupees due to such flash hartals,"" Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samiti state president T. Nasarudheen told PTI. """"We want all the political parties to co-operate with us. Even a minister had said the political parties need to find an alternative to such flash strike calls.""

On December 14, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) called for a state-wide strike in Kerala, to mourn the death of an activist who allegedly self-immolated at the Sabarimala protest site in Thiruvananthapuram.

Although the commissioner of police said that the deceased had set himself on fire for personal reasons - not because of the Sabarimala issue - the BJP state leadership announced a protest hartal.

Economic loss

According to anti-hartal activists, December 14 was the 97th strike in the state this year, and the sixth shutdown the party has forced in just three months because of the Sabarimala row.

V. Venugopal, the president of Cochin Chamber of Commerce, said that if a hartal is considered '100% successful', it takes away Rs 900 crore from the state's overall Rs 7.76 lakh crore GDP.

""Hundred percent successful means the entire state comes to a standstill,"" Venugopal said. ""State-run public transport system and private vehicles are forced to stop operating in fear of hooliganism. Shops, schools and universities are forced to remain closed and exams are postponed.""

The ripple effects continue through the economy - through delays in shipments and transportation, supply chain interruption, and damage to inventory.

""Even with local hartals, transportation through that area is impacted, with knockdown effects on other parts of the state,"" Venugopal said.

Breaking the habit

Some leaders, however, are ready to free Kerala from the habit. Shashi Tharoor, Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram, told The Wire that he has been a consistent opponent of hartals.

""When I entered politics, I pledged to oppose all hartals, even if my own party called one,"" he said. ""While I support the right of workers to strike, I consider it a deeply anti-social act to compel others to do so. Hartals have kept students from exams, patients from hospitals and cost crores in lost economic activity. No one has the right to coerce others into giving up their work or other commitments, whatever the cause.""

""I have kept my office and home office open and worked on all hartal days, on principle. I would be in favour of an all-party consensus against hartals,"" Tharoor added. ""It surprises me that a people as hard-working and industrious abroad as Keralites are so willing to enjoy enforced idleness at home.""

A bandh by any other name

In 1997, a full bench of the Kerala high court banned bandhs. The Supreme Court shot down the then Left government's petition to get the order reversed.

Bandhs were promptly renamed 'hartals' to get around the law.

In 2000, the Kerala high court ruled that the enforcement of a hartal by ""force, intimidation - physical or mental - and coercion"" was unconstitutional. This has not discouraged Kerala's politicians.

In 2015, Venugopal said, ""The previous the Congress-led government introduced the Hartal Regulation Bill. The Bill was sent to a Select Committee for consideration but has not seen the light of day since then.""

Indian National Trade Union Confederation (INTUC) Kerala vice president C. Haridas, an ex-parliamentarian, clarified that hartals are not the same as workers' strikes.

""Hartals announced by the BJP in the state are unnecessary and create loss for the state's revenue and inconvenience for the people,"" he said. ""Workers' strike cannot be seen like that. They are forced to strike for their survival.""

Hinting at the upcoming bank employees' strike on December 21 and 26, the union leader said that such strikes are necessary when the government is privatising and liquidating public sector units, putting workers' futures at risk.

Signs of improvement

According to a document from the State Planning Board, 85,000 person-days were lost due to strikes in Kerala in the financial year 2017 (up to July), as against 2.68 lakh in the year up to July 2013.

A Times of India report indicates that Tamil Nadu fared worse: it lost the most number of days to strikes in 2017 - 5.74 lakh - followed by Kerala (1.37 lakh) and Gujarat (99,883).

Informal workers hit hardest

The tourism sector, a mainstay of the Kerala economy, is bleeding from the impact of frequent hartals.

According to Venugopal, some 50,000 domestic and foreign tourists were trapped indoors due to the state-wide shutdown on December 15.

In Kochi, ""Around 2,500 foreign tourists - mostly from the UK and Germany - who arrived by a chartered flight and four cruise ships were left in the lurch when Kochi shut down.""

As part of the announcement of the 'anti-hartal year', the Kerala Tourism Task Force said the tourism industry will vehemently protest shutdowns, PTI reported.

It is in the informal sector, however, that workers are hurt most.

In general, wages in the formal economy are not cut due to hartal absences; firms often ask for work on weekends or extended working hours to make up for the lost time. Informal workers are forced to stay at home, and lose their day's income.

Rahman M., a fish seller in Kothamangalam, a central Travancore town, said that every hartal is a nightmare for him.

""People like us, who depend on daily business, who do business on the streets, are the ones who are the most affected,"" he said. ""I need Rs 1,000 every day for survival. My parents need medicines worth Rs 600 daily. With the remaining Rs 400, my family survives. It's stressful and painful when we lose even one day's business.""

The schools, set up by local traders, had been operating to rake in profits by charging fees. Each of the schools had at least 100 students in them.

The schools that were shut down on Thursday and Friday were Jeevan Jyothi Public School in Dadha; Prayag Public School, Sai Public School and CBS Public School in Yakubpur; City Public School in Kasna; and JP School in Dankaur's Jatta village. The names of two more schools that were shut down are yet to be announced by the education department.

The drive follows the death of two Class I students last week after the wall of an unauthorised school in Sector 101 collapsed on children writing an exam in the open. KM Public School, where the accident took place, had been shut down last year. But it reopened after a few months under a different name.

Bal Mukund Prasad, the basic siksha adhikari, said the exercise to weed out illegal operators would continue over the next few weeks. The education department has formed two teams of four members each to inspect schools on a daily basis. Officials said there were many schools that were affiliated to some board or the other but did not have the permits to operate.

Officials in the education department said they had come across several schools that had reopened with a different name after being ordered to shut down, like the one where the accident happened.

""We have informed all departments concerned in the district that while schools operating without licences will be shut down immediately, those trying to reopen schools after being told to shut could face legal action,"" Prasad said."

However, when it comes to the mother language, the words and their method of communication become identity. The concept of mother tongue is a fascinating aspect of language that has transcended generations. Similarly, in Jammu Dogri is more than just a means of communication. It is a repository of Dogras collective history and heritage. It has provided Dogras an identity and a focus that binds the Dogras together. Over the past some decades, the language has drastically collapsed in which the language is howling for its existence.

Dogri and Punjabi are sister languages, before the 8th schedule, Dogri was considered as a dialect of Punjabi. Where Punjabi has become one of the most spoken languages in the world, Dogri is on the verge of extinction. Mostly spoken in J&K, it is also spoken in some parts of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and in some parts of Pakistan. The language has seen a certain decline among its speakers and is losing its importance gradually. There are many reasons behind its downfall, which needs to be worked upon or else the language may die in the coming years. One of the major reasons behind Dogri losing its importance is, lack of interest among youth, modernization, cultural intelligence and globalization are posing hindrance and have made the survival of such languages even more difficult. Children, prefer to speak languages which would strengthen them for the competition they would face in their respective fields. They face unprecedented pressure to adopt common languages that are used in Government, technology and entertainment.

The bedrock of a language depends on the folklore of the region, when the culture of a particular region is rich, it will never get suppressed by the modernization, furthermore it will fuse with it, leading to a phenomenal outcome, and will make it a delight for the people belonging to other cultures, they too will start developing an affinity towards it. Language dies, when inhabitants get detached from their culture, and embraces some other or might even develop a new one.

Our language is an expression of ourselves and to preserve it, is our responsibility which connects us to our culture. Once we start thinking that the language is no longer a need of us is a day when we are into a deep threat. We are living in a 21st century where westernization has started dominated us and escaping this whirlpool is impossible unless people don't grasp their culture firmly. Upcoming generations are well versed with other cultures prevailing, but at the same time they must be bracketed with their mother tongue.

Jammu, which was mainly a Dogra dominated region of Jammu & Kashmir has become so diversified, that it could be called as a cultural melting pot, where people have settled down from the different parts of the state. It is due to its stature of being a capital for six months and moreover acceptance among people towards their fellow citizens from all over the state.

We can easily find the linguistic diversity of Jammu and Kashmir where one can get the difference of accent. In Jammu region most of the youngsters are in illusion that if we get well educated, we can get anything but forgetting the fact that the without the knowledge of their own language, their existence ceases.

In Jammu, one can easily find the linguistic diversity and at the same time we are having many languages in our own state which include Dogri, Kashmiri, Pahari, Bhadarwahi, Ladakkhi, Kishtwari, Balti, Hindi, Gojri and Urdu but in Jammu which is known as the Duggar land have its language called 'Dogri' which was recognized in 8th Schedule of the Indian Constitution on 22nd of December, 2003 in which lots of efforts have been made by the stalwarts of Jammu who took Dogri to the International heights. Since the last couple of years we are finding that there is a sudden decline in Dogri language in which Jammu feels offensive to speak Dogri and think that it's insulting to speak it in a public domain.

Sharing his views on Dogri Language, President Dogri Sanstha, Jammu Prof. Lalit Mangotra said, ""we want to send our wards to the school where English is used as a medium of communication, everyone wants to compete with the world. Everyone is looking for the best school in Jammu, taking the children away from Dogri.

Govt. never pays attention towards the showcasing of rich sugar coated Dogri language. There is a Government order which was passed in 2002 and 2006 in which they have made Dogri mandatory in schools but nobody has paid any heed towards its implementation and promotion of Dogri Language. Today 11th and 12th classes are having Dogri subject which is also taught in Government schools only."" It is the responsibility of every individual to put in their efforts to promote their mother tongue. ""Language could be saved if people love it from the bottom of their heart, the way Bongs or Gujjus do. We have no culture of reading Dogri Literature, literature is considered boring perhaps. We need to give space to Dogri in our houses with love and affection as nobody will come from outside to teach us for the preservation of Dogri language. It was in 1940 when Dogri Literature came into existence; there were only some books at that point of time, but look at the volume of books now which are uncountable, moreover the writers themselves would never ask their children to go through them. We had a newspaper called 'Jammu Prabhat' which was published daily in Jammu region but unfortunately due to the negligence of the state as well as the masses, they had to shut it down,"" says Prof. Lalit Mangotra, a Sahitya Academy Awardee.

We have many Dogri writers who have given their life and contributed immensely for the promotion of Dogri language and its literature but unfortunately we have also those people who write for its publication with photo and self glorification leading to the mediocrity in Dogri literature.

Language is our identity and reflection of our coexistence and one must understand the fact that without engraving and promoting the Dogri language, we cannot change anything and stand nowhere and will have identity crisis one day as we all are leaving our roots which is our language.

A new panic seizes the public imagination every few years. (Mohit Suneja/HT)

To the world, Manish Sarki was the perfect all-rounder.

A strapping boy of 18, Sarki worked hard in school during the day and sent fielders scurrying after his shots at the neighbourhood cricket ground in the evenings. He would never get home later than dinner time even when his friends were out chatting, his mother Chandra Maya remembers, and his closest friends joked about how he would blush talking to girls.

Everyone in the village of St Mary's Hill knew Sarki would grow up to be a policeman or join the army. Maybe because he was so well-behaved, no one noticed when he went quiet. They only noticed on the night of August 20 when he didn't come back home.

The village gathered around the Sarki house around 9pm. A chill was enveloping the small mountain village on the outskirts of Darjeeling in northern Bengal, but a small group of men and women trekked to the local police station a couple of kilometers away. Boys go missing all the time, they were told.

Undeterred, the villagers split into smaller search parties and fanned out into the jungles, determined to find Sarki. Their hopes were dashed around 1.30am when a search team stumbled on Sarki's body hanging from the ceiling of an empty pig warehouse on top of a hill.

Below, in spray paint, were the words ""half blood prince was here"" in what everyone recognised was Sarki's handwriting. On the wall behind was drawn a hangman with two victims, an older boy, and more chillingly, a younger one. Every wall of the building had been scribbled on - the words ""illuminati"", ""last king"", ""savage"", ""doped up"" and the number ""666"" appearing repeatedly.

In the light of day, some of the graffiti might have appeared benign - after all, some the walls displayed banalities like ""be the change you want to see"" or ""the thing you fear the most is fear itself"". But in the eerie quiet of a cold mountain night, the villagers were convinced Sarki's death was the doing of the satan. ""I was heartbroken for my son but also scared out of my wits. We were all scared about who the younger boy could be,"" said Chandra Maya.

By the time police arrived two hours later, a mist of rumours had cloaked the village. Wasn't Sarki always on his phone for the past few weeks? And, wouldn't he go out to the graveyard, barely a kilometer away, every night with his phone? ""I think he was going crazy. That's when I heard about the game,"" added Chandra Maya.

By sunrise, everyone had heard of the game: a shadowy application called the Momo Challenge that had apparently killed Sarki. Several explanations were offered. ""For the past few days, he was very sad and distracted. He would be lost in his phone. He never said anything to me, later I found out that he was playing the Momo game,"" said Sarki's friend Deekchen.

But how did he find out? Villagers say the local police first told them of the game, but the police deny ever saying anything. ""In fact, we have not been able to confirm any role of any Momo Challenge game. We never told the locals about the game. Maybe the graffiti made them think that,"" said Hare Krishna Pai, additional superintendent of police.

'HI, I AM MOMO. LET US PLAY A GAME'

The next day, a second death, that of 26-year-old Aditi Goyal in Kurseong town, was also attributed to the Momo Challenge, turning the creeping fear into full-blown panic. By then, local politicians had put out statements about the supposedly lethal game, and everyone in the hills was talking about it.

""The whole area was in trauma and everyone was scared of their phones. We found young boys from Class 7 had started playing it. We started spreading awareness and seized phones from those who seemed vulnerable. Someone even sent a message to my daughter,"" said Raju Gurung, a local from Kurseong.

Hindustan Times spoke to at least 20 people in the area and everyone claimed to know a relative, friend or neighbour who had had a close shave with the game. But everyone had a different notion.

Some described the game, which supposedly sets self-harm challenges that finally end in suicide, as an app, some as a Whatsapp message. Some said they received texts, some described a phone number. Indeed, beyond the ubiquitous image of the oblong faced, bulbous eyed doll that has come to signify the game, every detail was foggy. ""Sometimes people are faking names and photos and sending messages 'Hi, I am momo. Let us play a game.' The fear of the game has hypnotised us,"" said Junita Rana, a schoolteacher in Kurseong.

AN EPIDEMIC OF FEAR

It began with the braids. In June last year, a girl in Rajasthan claimed someone chopped off her braid while she was asleep. Dozens of women across Rajasthan followed up with similar claims. Over the following months, the pattern spread across north India like an epidemic: Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Delhi. By November, over 200 cases of braid chopping had been reported in Kashmir where the trend took its most vicious turn. Many women claimed to have seen Godmen, witches or cats before losing their consciousness. After finding their braids gone, many complained of aches and pains for days after. The police couldn't really find any culprits, so the people took the matter in their hands. In August, a poor woman was killed by a mob in Agra on the suspicion of chopping braids. In October, an old man in Anantnag was killed for the same reason.

Then there was the Blue Whale. In July, a schoolboy's suicide stoked the hysteria around the web-based game created by a Russian tech geek targeting teengers. The 50 challenges begin differently-- from shutting yourself in or watching a horror film-- proceed incrementally, and end the same way: suicide. Through 2017, more than 150 cases of young suicides across India -- West Bengal, Delhi, Indore, Solapur, Dehradun-- were blamed on the Blue Whale, often with no more proof that the young person was obsessed with smartphone and videogames. Every case was rife was contradictions and yet, websites were blocked, advisories issued, and in some cases, smartphones banned in schools.

FACE-RIPPERS AND VAMPIRES

Experts say that underneath the web-fuelled hysteria, something more sinister is going on with the mental health of young people. Samir Parikh, director of the Department of Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences at Fortis Healthcare, insisted that we cannot dismiss these phenomena, but the focus should be on greater media literacy, on making children understand what is right and wrong content, and on teaching people to seek help if they are feeling vulnerable.

""Is there a component of hysteria in all this? Of course, there are lots of stories in the media and they have an impact. But we cannot deny the fact that there are pressures and problems that young people go through silently. If help and access is not given, they can be misused,"" he added.

Parikh is clear that any approach that aims at shutting down access to the internet is wrong, mainly because it is impossible. ""We need to understand that be it Blue Whale or Momo, if you are vulnerable, you might be pulled towards it. So you give people skills and teach people to not bottle it up, tell parents, block or involve authorities.""

India has had a long history of public panic. From a half-man half-monkey roaming the streets in Delhi, sometimes wearing a helmet, to the Munhnochwa (face ripper) of Mirzapur, claimed to be a flying object emitting beams of green or red light, sending shock waves through anyone who came in its contact, and leaving them with bites and scratches on their faces, to the Rathakaatteri (vampire) of Gundalpatti who allegedly sucked the blood of the village cattle, a new panic seizes the public imagination every few years. Many of these have been analysed as incidents of mass hysteria. The patterns have been revealing. Women are more likely to end up as victims than men, children turn to be more vulnerable than adults. The trends pick up in regions or communities marked by oppression of women, economic uncertainty or social anxiety.

Yet, questions remain about why a particular fear grips a set of people at a given time. Did every woman who complained of braid chopping do it herself? Was every alleged case of Blue Whale suicide made up by the parents or the police to evade responsibility? What do the women whose braids were chopped say now? And, did a year of fear and panic leave us any wiser?

LOSING BRAIDS, EARNING REST

In Kanganhedi, a village of 700 houses on the Delhi-Haryana border, Munesh Devi's hair has grown back just enough to tie it in a ponytail. A lot more has changed in her life since last year besides her hairstyle. ""I can no longer work in our field. I hardly leave the house, except being taken to the doctor by my son every two weeks. Any exertion leaves me tired. Even going to funerals gets up my blood pressure. I lie in bed almost all day. Daughters-in-law press my feet.They also bring me rotis to eat in bed,"" said Devi, sitting on a double bed in the living room. Its doors remain shut and its light dimmed to prevent Devi's recurring headache.

They began in July 2017, immediately after she found her braid chopped at the neck. It was there when she finished feeding the cows in the family's farm, she said, but gone when she got back home and slipped back her pallu. ""Must have gone missing while I was travelling home on the back of my son's motorcycle,"" she added. She remembers fainting after the realisation struck. She continues to feel giddy. ""My head spins. My whole body aches. My feet go numb. My teeth hurt."" She doesn't know what ails her; neither does her doctor. He prescribes her pills for each of her symptoms. She shows off the stash to people asking her how she has been doing since ""the incident.""

Munesh Devi's was one of three braids found missing in the area in the course of one eventful day. The other two women don't know, either, who chopped their braids or why they continue to suffer. Sri Devi said she lost her braid while sitting on a couch in the courtyard of her house. One moment it was hanging down her waist, the next moment it was lying on the floor. She had heard of the braid-chopping phenomenon only hours before. ""My uncle, who was visiting us from Pataudi, had told me about a video he had seen on Facebook. I said, 'Mama, please don't say such things.'"" Her son had called 100 after she fainted at the sight of her severed braid. ""The police are yet to tell us if they found anything,"" she said.

Devi also visited a psychiatrist in Dwarka along with her son, at the urging of the police. ""He asked my son some questions. Gave us no answers,"" she said. Her braid was taken away by a forensics team sent in by the police for further investigations. ""We haven't heard from them."" Perturbed by three incidents in a week, people in the village even consulted a tantrik (mystic). ""He spoke about the presence of a mysterious cat in the village. But no such cat or dog has been found,"" she said.

For many women, the disappearance of braids has been transformative. It has allowed them rightful rest after a lifetime's slog at home and farm, won them the nurturing attention of their families, and given them the chance to talk about themselves for the first time. The third ""victim"" in Kangnahedi, Ombati, a daily-wage labourer who found her braid gone while working around the house, is still waiting for her life to change, however. ""No government compensation, no one has even come to offer me a glass of juice,"" she said, lying on a cot and complaining of a headache.

""We sent a team to that village for a couple of hours after a request from the concerned division of the Delhi police, but we haven't received any formal communication from the top brass,"" explained Nimesh Desai, director of the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences, which had investigated the phenomenon of Delhi's Monkey-man in 2001. ""From the preliminary impressions of our team, in all probability, the incidents in Kanganhedi fit into the pattern of mass hysteria, which tends to subside on its own.""

MASKED MEN OR MAIDS?

In Kashmir, the last region to be swept up in the storm, over 100 FIRs were registered over six months. Many women alleged masked men entered their homes when they were alone, sprinkled sedatives in the air, and chopped their braids while they lay unconscious. Separatist leaders accused the Indian government, and armed militants suspected the evil hand of intelligence agencies. As locals flooded the streets in protest, shutting down shops and schools, the police resorted to extreme measures, from announcing an award of Rs 6 lakh for information to unleashing riot-control tactics to disperse the crowds. Several vigilante groups armed with lathis and axes emerged to patrol the streets at night. A 70-year-old man in Anantnag died after being hit by a brick by a group of people who suspected him to be a braid chopper.

But now, police say the paranoia and panic was fuelled by nothing substantive.

""Almost all the cases turned out to be without any substance. There were a few cases where the women had cut their hair themselves. In one case, a maid had cut the hair of a girl,"" said additional director general of police (law and order), Muneer Khan. In Kulgam, where 21 cases had been registered, the state government had formed a special investigation team(SIT). Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP), Kulgam, Aijaz Ahmad, who was part of the SIT, said that most of the cases have been closed because the allegations had no factual basis.

""In some of the cases, the culprits remain untraced, while maximum cases turned out to be of hysteria,"" Ahmad said. He said the lack of a single eyewitness in all of the cases was particularly baffling.

Across the valley, the police arrested between 70 and 80 people, including members of vigilante groups, for ""raising false alarm about braid chopping and creating disturbances"".

""We felt that this [braid chopping] was being done by agencies. It was a matter of honour of our women. Everybody wanted this should end. Stone pelting was the only option with us. Surprisingly it did end abruptly after that,"" said a villager from north Kashmir who requested anonymity. Some of them are still visiting the courts for hearings.

BLUE WHALES AND PHONE BANS

It was around 5pm on July 29 last year when Manpreet Singh Sahani climbed on the ledge of his fifth-floor apartment. As he teetered on the edge, neighbours and witnesses on the street below called out to him but could only watch helplessly as he jumped. Initial investigations by local police and testimonies of his friends exposed talk of the Blue Whale Challenge. Several of them took to social media to blame the game and link it to Sahani's death.

In 24 hours, reports of the supposedly lethal game had inundated media, and reports of copycat cases were streaming in from all parts of India, ratcheting up paranoia about mobile phone and internet use among teenagers and their parents. Over the next two months, more than 150 deaths or injuries across the country were alleged to be linked to the game.

But while police initially suspected the boy was an avid gamer and could have been influenced by the Blue Whale Challenge, detailed investigation indicated more offline triggers.

""The boy was in love with a girl who had left him for some other boy. We had gone through his email accounts and mobile phone and found a draft on the phone which clarified his intention to commit suicide,"" said Navin Reddy, deputy commissioner of police Zone 10.

This might not be an isolated phenomenon. Earlier this year, Union minister of state for home Hansraj Ahir told Lok Sabha that a committee formed under the chairmanship of the director general of the Computer Emergency Response Team-India (CERT-In) couldn't establish the involvement of the Blue Whale Challenge in any case.

""The committee analysed the internet activities, device activities, call records and other social media activity, other forensic evidences and also interacted with rescued victims associated with these incidents,"" the minister told the lower house.

Of course, by then several other central ministries, a number of state governments, the Central Board of Secondary Education and even the Supreme Court had got involved, with the apex court calling the game a ""national problem"".

But experts say official agencies may have jumped the gun. ""It was definitely a hoax. We need to shift focus from these voyeuristic things and to suicides, which is a big problem that kills a quarter of a million people. Some of these hoaxes have a life of their own because media makes them into a big story. We need long-term institutional solutions,"" said Soumitra Pathare, director of the Centre for Mental Health Law and Policy.

THE BIGGEST TRAGEDY

Back in St Mary's hill, Chandra Maya Sarki has gone back to her old routine -- wake up at the crack of dawn to draw water, fix food for her husband before he leaves for his daily wage work, and then clean their small wooden house. She likes to keep the television on and stray dialogues from the afternoon soaps animate the living room. She stares not at the screen, however, but at the the small framed photo of Sarki hanging on the blue wall, wondering why the mysterious admins of the Momo Challenge chose her child as their prey.

She doesn't know yet that the cyber cell of the West Bengal police has completed its forensic probe of his phone and found no trace of any Momo Challenge. ""If any application is downloaded, the forensic machine would find a trace, even if it is an unknown application. But we have found no such application, or any message on WhatsApp motivating people to play the game. We have found nothing so far,"" said a senior official of the cyber cell on the condition of anonymity.

She doesn't know that police has ruled out any links between the game and the death of Aditi Goyal and that at least two other cases in the state have been found to be hoaxes traced back to mischief makers sending scary messages through WhatsApp. She doesn't know that Sarki's teacher Sarita Sharma has a simple explanation for why he and his friends would go to the graveyard at night -- the mobile network was the best at that spot.

All she knows is that her beloved younger son will no longer come back home at 8pm every day. That she will never make him his favourite meal of dal-aloo and dum-eggs. The money she had been saving with her husband to send him to Bengaluru for higher studies now seems meaningless. Sometimes she talks to Sarki's sister, now in college, about him and the day that took him away from her. She will probably never know what really happened to Sarki or what troubled him enough to withdraw from his friends. Momo Challenge or not, that is the biggest tragedy of all.

The profile of the Dharavi slum in Mumbai, one of the most densely populated neighborhoods in the world, may have risen when it was showcased in the Oscar-winning movie ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" but my tour guide didn't particularly care about that at the moment. What concerned him more was the pejorative nature of the word ""slum"" and how outsiders perceived Dharavi, an area smaller than New York City's Central Park but where about a million people live and work.

""We don't want people to think slums are dangerous and full of lazy people,"" said Hitesh Vaidya, a guide for Reality Tours and Travel. The reality of daily life in Dharavi is sobering, however: Laborers work in unsafe conditions, and a lack of basic services like clean water and sanitation facilities endangers the health of residents. Mr. Vaidya and I spent the next couple of hours touring the many different industries and businesses within Dharavi, which included plastics recycling, textile manufacturing and food production. I left with a better knowledge of both the poverty and industriousness of Dharavi, as well as an understanding of Mr. Vaidya's point: that the two are not mutually exclusive.

Mumbai (sometimes called by its former name, Bombay) is an electric and complicated city, an extraordinary place, both uplifting and heartbreaking. Its eclectic composition of different groups and cultures makes it a difficult city to define, but for many, it's a city that represents possibility. Dharmesh Gandhi, a friend who lives in Mumbai, offered his take on India's financial center and one of the world's most populous cities: ""It's like New York,"" he said. ""Everything is happening here, so everyone wants to come here.""

After a four-day visit this past October, it was easy to see why: The shopping and entertainment options were excellent, and opportunities for great dining were second-to-none. And while the rupees flow freely in Mumbai, I was able to keep my spending under control.

A couple of logistical items: My flight, booked through Jet Airways, cost a bit over $200 for a one-way flight from Sri Lanka. As I was re-entering India, I had to produce my double-entry e-visa once more to passport control. My Uber ride from the airport was about 370 rupees, or a little more than $5. If you'd prefer not to use Uber, another popular service is Ola Cabs. I used both while in Mumbai, typically opening both apps and using whichever had a car closer to me. The ubiquitous tuk-tuk is conspicuously absent in much of Mumbai (""The traffic here is bad enough,"" Mr. Gandhi told me). In central Mumbai, you'll just see regular taxis. Fortunately, they're metered, with fares beginning at 22 rupees.

I was well-located in the Fort neighborhood of the city, close to the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus railway station, the huge Victorian landmark constructed in the late 19th century. My quarters at the Hotel Residency Fort, Mumbai, booked for $52 a night on Hotels.com, were modest luxury, roomy and air-conditioned, and with free breakfast.

A walk around the neighborhood was the first order of business: A stop by Mumbai's first Anglican church, St. Thomas Cathedral, established in 1718, was followed by a visit to the free Jehangir Art Gallery near Wellington Fountain. I enjoyed the Nayanaa Kanodia exhibition, ""The Quintessential Woman: A Celebration,"" which featured oil paintings and drawings celebrating feminism. Another exhibition, ""Rural Beauty,"" featured darker, more sensual pencil and pastel works by Parshuram B. Patil.

There are numerous fine museums in Mumbai, including Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (formerly known as the Prince of Wales Museum of Western India). Admission is 500 rupees, plus an additional 50-rupee fee to take cellphone photos. The main hall of the museum, which features Rajastani temple columns and wooden railings from a nobleman's home, is topped with a great Islamic dome -- a nod to Mumbai's diverse history.

There are some wonderful statues of Indian deities on the ground floor -- Shiva, Ganesh, Brahma and Vishnu, some dating as far back as the sixth century. I also enjoyed looking at a series of paintings from the late 17th and early 18th centuries, done in the Rajasthani Bikaner style, particularly one depicting a scene from the Mahabharata epic.

My favorites, though, were probably the later work of Jehangir Sabavala, a Mumbai-born artist who died in 2011 at age 89. His paintings, which intriguingly join East with West, have elements of both Cubism and Impressionism. I particularly liked ""The Eye,"" as well as his somber ""The Raven,"" 2010 works that were two of Sabavala's final pieces.

The most interesting museum I visited, however, proved to be the Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Mumbai City Museum, which claims to be Mumbai's very first, established in 1872 (100 rupees admission). The building itself is quite beautiful, and houses interesting artifacts like old model ships, ganjifa -- round playing cards that became popular under Mughal emperors in the 16th century -- and examples of pottery from the Sir J.J. School of Art near the turn of the 20th century. Particularly interesting was an exhibition documenting the movement of peoples to Mumbai over the years, from the Kolis fishermen of Gujarat in the 13th century to the Parsi, Surati and Khoja people that immigrated with the rise of the East India Company.

But it's not just the past that impresses in Mumbai -- the present is pretty happening, too. I headed to the club the Quarter one evening to catch a show with Azamaan Hoyvoy and his pseudo-funk trio (750 rupees for a standing ticket). They grooved through a number of pretty good covers, including ""How Deep Is Your Love"" and Allen Stone's ""Unaware."" Cocktails at the Quarter run in the 600 rupee range, but you can get a Kingfisher beer for 275.

I spent another evening at Shanmukhananda Hall, a large auditorium near the King's Circle train station, to take in a Lucky Ali concert (1,500 rupees, purchased through the website Book My Show). Lucky Ali, a Mumbai-born musician, went through crowd-pleasing soft rock favorites with a six-piece band. Between numbers, he took the opportunity to speak on various issues. ""If Ganga goes, where do we go?"" he asked, referring to the Ganges River. ""I think half of you probably haven't even been there. Go there! Plant some trees or something.""

About two-and-a-half miles to the southwest is Siddhi Vinayak Mandir, a beautiful temple dedicated to Ganesha and an essential place of worship for many Mumbai Hindus. I arrived just in time one evening for a puja, and after leaving my shoes at a counter outside, was ushered in to the sound of clapping, drums, bells and the smell of incense. A small, serene-looking Ganesha statue sat among orange and white flowers while a group of about 150 of us stood engaged in an intense, rhythmic call-and-response that changed tempos and melodies throughout the course of the next 30 minutes. For those looking to worship in a hurry, a ""quick darshan"" line can be entered for a payment of 50 rupees.

Any explorer of Mumbai will eventually need to try one of thousands of street vendors and restaurants that grace the city. Fortunately, there is no shortage of good options, and nearly every price point is covered. The Bombay street sandwich is one you'll see everywhere and, if you're feeling adventurous, certainly worth trying. A typical example features sliced cucumber, potato, onion, tomato and beetroot on toasted bread, served with a variety of spicy chutneys. At 25 or 30 rupees, it's an absolute steal.

Mumbai's reputation for street food par excellence is well deserved, and on Sheikh Memon Street, near the Juma Masjid mosque, I indulged in another treat: a plate of dahi puri (40 rupees), savory chickpeas stuffed into flaky puri shells, drenched in tart yogurt and dusted with spices and herbs. And no Mumbai street food discussion is complete without mentioning vada pav, the quintessential carbohydrate bomb that features a fried potato fritter squished into soft white roll (about 10 rupees, and it can be found all over).

The city does upscale dining with equal aplomb. Prateek Sadhu and Aditi Dugar own Masque, an elegantly repurposed industrial space that serves a 10-course tasting menu every day except Monday. The wine pairing alone, however, costs 6,000 rupees -- it's not exactly a place for penny-pinchers. Fortunately, Masque offers a bar menu for walk-ins like me looking for a lighter meal.

A very good sour eggplant toast (350 rupees), sweetened with tamarind and covered with caramelized onions, functioned as a kind of tangy eggplant pâté. A twist on pani puri, the classic street food, filled the thin shells with a cactus salad and corn mousse (350 rupees). Something described as pork okonomiyaki (500 rupees) really was like a sweet-glazed pork taco, competently prepared and served with a nice cabbage slaw. My server, Ayush, was particularly good and made me feel right at home.

Somewhere in the middle, you've got Gurukripa, an all-day casual vegetarian restaurant in the Sion neighborhood. There's an exceptionally good pav bhaji (96 rupees), a tomato-y mash of spiced vegetables served with a slab of rapidly melting butter. White rolls, crunchy papadum and a sharp onion salad round out the meal. Or there's Ling's Pavilion, a Mumbai institution, where the steamed pork with salted fish (500 rupees) and creamy fried corn curd (275 rupees) will help explain the country's love of Chinese food.

And don't forget the shopping. At the excellent Kitab Khana bookstore, I perused the sizable section entitled ""Books on Gandhi and by Gandhi"" before settling on Mohandas K. Gandhi's autobiography, ""The Story of My Experiments with Truth,"" for just 156 rupees. Another day, I set out in search of spices and ended up at Lalbaugh Market near Chinchpokli Station. Wandering down Dinshaw Petit Road, I followed the sound of loud, metallic pounding until I ended up at Vishwas, a specialty spice store where a shopkeeper was in the process of mashing a red substance into fine powder. I asked for haldi, or turmeric, and the man behind the counter spooned a 200-gram plastic bagful for 60 rupees.

But the best way to get a feel for the city might be to walk along Fashion Street on a weekend afternoon. Fashion Street is on the western edge of Fort, along Mahatma Gandhi Road, flanking a big public park, Azad Maidan, and branching off into Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil Road to the south. On the street, packed solid with shoppers, are hundreds of stalls containing anything you could possibly want to wear -- dresses, T-shirts, jeans and accessories.

I picked up a shirt for 250 rupees and, after a bit of haggling over the initial ask of 1,000, walked away with a pair of jeans for 600 rupees. Satisfied with my haul, I walked through the Karnatak Sports Ground, where organized teams were playing games of cricket. As the sun began to set, I crossed the street to Azad Maidan, past food vendors selling snacks and couples lounging on the grass while groups of boys played decidedly more casual pickup cricket games with tennis balls.

Over a good dinner at the Parsi restaurant Ideal Corner, I reflected on my time in a city that has so much to offer -- too much for one trip, certainly. Some trips are draining, but Mumbai left me feeling energized. I would have to return again to this dynamic city, and soon."

Officials of the Education Department in Gautam Buddh Nagar district said 174 illegal private schools are operational in villages without building approvals. Seventy of these 174 illegal schools are operational in Noida villages, the officials added.

The Noida Authority is responsible for regulating buildings of all kinds, including schools, in urban and rural areas.

After the twin building collapse in Greater Noida's Shahberi in July, in which nine persons were killed, the Noida Authority had conducted a survey to identify illegal buildings in all the villages.

On August 3, the Authority identified 1,757 buildings that were constructed without approval.

Noida Authority Chief Executive Officer Alok Tandon and Additional Chief Executive Officer R.K. Mishra remained unavailable for a comment on the issue despite repeated attempts to reach them.

""We had initiated action against illegal schools in 2017 and over 85 were shut down then. We are taking necessary action in this regard and schools which are illegal will face tough legal action,"" said District Magistrate B.N. Singh."

These names had become synonymous with smartphones in every household in India. But what happened to them? Why are these names not right next to Xiaomi or OnePlus in the sales records in India? With Micromax just having launched it's first smartphone with a notch, almost a year behind other smartphone makers, we delve deep into what really happened. In this article we find out, from various reports, previous interviews, sales reports, online user feedback and everything else, how these companies went from being at the pinnacle of smartphone sales to losing everything.

Back in the day, the US market was starting to move towards smartphones from feature phones. In 2007, the first iPhone was introduced to the world, and it revolutionised the mobile phone industry. India was still largely a feature phone market with very few devices from Blackberry and Nokia's Nseries phones that were called 'multimedia smartphones' being sold. These devices were expensive and were sold in high-end stores which almost always had a different section for the customers of such phones. Priced anywhere between Rs 25,000 to Rs 45,000, these phones were the envy of people who couldn't afford them, and pride of people who could. Feature phones were still a large part of sales for players such as Nokia, Sony and Motorola.

The dealers could make huge profits selling these phones. Now at that point in time, the market was open to any risk taker who could afford to get into the business of making their own brand. And so they did. Companies such as Micromax, Lava, Karbonn etc were all either dealers for smartphones, software companies or telecommunication ventures who wanted to make a mark on the emerging trends of smartphones. They, however did not have the production capability or the funding to start a production unit in India. This brings us to our next point, white labelling.

White Labelling

To understand white labelling, one needs to know what OEM and ODMs are. Original Equipment Manufacturers are companies that sell product made by other manufacturers under their own brand name. Original Design Manufacturers are companies that design and manufacture a product according to a different company's needs who sell them under their own brand. Brands like Lava, Micromax and Karbonn saw this OEM and ODM relationship as a great scope for a business model for smartphone manufacturing.

Chinese phones were already available in the Indian market, but they were not well received. No one wanted to invest in a 'Chinese phone' because these phones had no warranty and no after sales service. What the Indian companies did was ask manufacturers in China to design and build smartphones according to their needs and these manufacturers would build it and dump it in India. The Indian companies would then add their own branding to these phones and sell them in Indian markets with warranty and an after sales service promise. This was a great business model and these Indian brans gained ground quick!

Cost Effective

One of the several reasons for the success of these phones were their cost effectiveness. They were providing feature rich phones, dirt cheap, compared to their more expensive counterparts like Nokia and Blackberry. iPhones were also seen from time to time, but were rare. Motorola was a big hit with their RAZR and ROKR series models but these were also getting sloppy. At the time, 2G phones were reigning the market and calling and texting were quite expensive for Indian consumers. But with the introduction of 3G in and around 2008, Internet users suddenly blew up.

WhatsApp's introduction a year or two later was also a major shift. Most of the expensive international brand's phones wouldn't support WhatsApp, and many would not support 3G. A massive number of people had to shift and so a great opportunity opened up for all manufacturers. Indian companies cashed in on this by introducing smartphones with bright LED touchscreens, Android based OS and a host of other features. These were priced at around Rs 10,000 - Rs 15,000. There was also one more feature that these companies, along with the internet boom, made famous. Let's talk about that next.

Dual Sim

When we say that the Indian companies were the talk of the town back then, we really mean it. From students in high schools and colleges to working professionals, everyone was a consumer of these Indian brands. Many shops even raised their prices at one point of time for the Micromax Canvas series of phones because of the high demand and low availability. These phones, among other things, introduced a feature that has stuck on even now. That feature is Dual sim cards.

When companies such as BSNL and MTNL started providing cheap internet options, people wanted to use two sim cards in one phone.This was because porting phone numbers wasn't really something one could do easily. The Indian manufacturers went to the Chinese ODMs and asked for a phone that could use two SIM cards. Thus in 2010, Spice mobiles launched India's first dual SIM ( 3G + 2G) phone. Although Dual SIM isn't a technology the OEM or the ODM invented, it was definitely seen as a useful feature for a particular market and brought into use by these companies.

Faster Turnaround Time

White labelling also worked for these companies because of another reason. These phone manufacturers had a faster turnaround time, compared to Nokia, Sony or Samsung. They did not have to do their own research and development, neither did they have to design the phone, they could just bring a new model to a market much faster. A company like Nokia had to design, manufacture, market and sell these phones. These took at least a few months to achieve, from scratch. The ODMs meanwhile, did not have to worry about marketing and selling their products while an OEM did not have to worry about the design and manufacturing. This symbiotic relationship helped them bring newer models with the latest features to the market faster than many other established phone makers.

Chinese ODMs Started Their Own Branding

Many ODMs in China understood the fact that the real money was to be made in the distribution and marketing of phones in markets like India. Working with the Indian companies, they had already learnt a lot about the market and the distribution channels. Many other established Chinese companies like Xiaomi also set their eyes on India at the time. These ODMs and other smaller Chinese brands started shipping their own branded smartphones to the country with a promise of better after sales service. But in order to compete with the already established brands, they needed o keep the pricing to a bare minimum. This is where the next turning point in the market comes.

Online Sales

Flipkart had already set up a good service channel and delivery channel owing to it's online model of selling books and then later selling other items. Amazon entered the Indian market in 2013 when they realised the scope this market had. They also started with books and movies and slowly gained the customer's trust. Indians were sceptical of using online channels to buy expensive products, specially electronics. But as the online revolution progressed, Indians started to slowly indulge in online shopping.

One of the other factors for this was the introduction of 4G in 2012. This made internet services considerably faster and cheaper. These Chinese manufacturers saw the opportunity of cutting costs. Costs for establishment, delivery and distribution as well as a lot of other smaller expenses that the companies would've incurred if they sold through offline channels such as retail stores. Online selling allowed the Chinese players to bring phone prices down a lot.

Lack Of Vision

The Indian companies were heavily invested in marketing and advertising their products and failed to realise that time and technology was moving at a rapid pace. They did not expect that the Indian market would shift so drastically. India, at that time, had come out of recession and the industrial production was growing instead of slowing down. People were slowly getting back their jobs and many started earning more than they were spending. This caused online sales to grow as well. The introduction of 4G was a huge change, and it rolled out in a matter of just a few months. Reliance Jio rolled out 4G phones and 4G connectivity and 3G suddenly became a backdated technology.

Most Indian companies had a huge order booked for a lot of smartphone units. These suddenly became extremely hard to sell to the new customers who were looking to buy 4G phones. With 4G being extremely cheap, the Chinese manufacturers were ready for the 4G wave and they jumped in to sell their phones. This lack of vision for the future affected many companies and brought many more to their knees before their ultimate shut down.

The Indian smartphone companies were headed by strong businessmen but not technical or product people. They knew how to conduct a business with a given set of rules. But the smartphone market changes extremely rapidly and they couldn't catch up. The Indian companies had no proper R&D department put in place. They had no or very few factories and relied mostly on ODMs for their products. With ODMs going their own separate ways to create new models of 4G phones, all the while, marketing and selling their own smartphones. Meanwhile the Indian manufacturers were left stranded with a huge number of smartphones to clear. This was one of the many reasons why a huge corporation like Nokia also fell short. R&D is an integral part of smartphone manufacturing and big companies such as Samsung, Apple and Huawei have a lot of manpower as well as capital dedicated to this sphere.

Bad After Sales Service

There were several reasons for Indian consumers to buy Indian smartphones. But one of the top reasons was the guarantee of repair in case of any manufacturing issues. Most Indian companies failed on this promise. If you do a quick online google search, you will see that a majority of consumers were extremely unhappy with the after sales service. There are complaints of these companies taking the phone for months and not repairing or replacing it. Moreover, bad behaviour from the staff and a rampant complaint of overcharging were pushing customers away. This was the final nail in the coffin. Almost all smartphone users shifted to the newly launched Motorola, Xiaomi and OnePlus phones.

While the Indian companies are slowly dusting off their archaic ways and slowly investing in R&D, they have a long way to go. It would be best if they skipped a few of the popular trends right now. Instead, they should try to predict what trends are to come in the near future and work on that. We surely hope these companies get to play on a level playing field in the years to come, so that the Indian smartphone manufacturing market flourishes as a whole."

It's been 34-years since the pogrom took place where about 2,733 Sikhs were killed in the bylanes and roads of India's cosmopolitan capital. Human memory does get eroded with time. But even after decades, humans tend to recall the memories of riots with tremendous accuracy, I've learnt to talk to elders in the community.

Just the other day when a news item regarding a proposed Rath Yatra, was being played on TV screens, my father-in-law started recounting scenes of the day when India's Prime Minister was assassinated.

Without questioning the sudden correlation, I kept mum and just listened.

Based in Delhi, he was returning from his office in Lajpat Nagar. He had heard of the assassination just a few kilometres away and was advised by his colleagues to return swiftly to the safety of his home.

As he meandered the bylanes on his scooter, he heard an angry mob shouting slogans. He stopped to look behind. The mob was moving swiftly towards him. A few bricks and stones were already lying on the roads. A few were flying off from the behind.

He sped his scooter to the South Delhi colony where he lived then and was asked by his neighbours to duck in the house.

As the mob approached the bylanes of the colony, about 100-150 male members of Jat families who used to reside in the neighbourhood came out. They blocked the route of the sloganeering crowd.

The burning of the neighborhood would have also meant that their houses would also not have been spared. Most lived in adjacent houses or had a storey above or down where their Sikh neighbours resided since decades in harmony.

Police were nowhere to be seen. Parleys between the men and the mob lasted for almost 2-3 hours. But the mob sensed they would never be let in. It ultimately had to turn back.

As it left the colony, the mob broke windows of a house, which had inscribed two words - 'Guru Kripa', on its front wall. Ironically, it was owned by a Sindhi businessman. He has declined to change the nameplate, even decades after the riots.

""It was this unity of our neighbourhood that saved me that day,"" he tells me.

In empathy, I recalled to him what I had witnessed that day as a small boy.

The scene is still vivid. Partly because it has been recounted by my uncles and aunts whenever the issue comes up over dinner table conversations.

They had all ducked together inside this massive house we had in Lucknow back then.

A railway line crossed in front of our home. The main railway station Charbagh was just about 5 kilometres away.

Those were tense times for the nation. But it was fun days for me, as a child.

I could play with my young cousins, all of whom had suddenly arrived at our home.

And I was told they would stay with me in my room for some weeks. To top it all, schools had been shut.

During one of those mornings when we were engrossed playing, I heard shrieks of my mother and aunt. Both were standing glued to the window of our bedroom which faced the railway line. A mob had gathered on the tracks.

A train had just stopped, perhaps by pulling of the emergency chain. An Indian army jawan (who was in his green fatigues) had been pulled down to the track. He wore a turban which had been apparently kicked off to the track.

The mob started beating him incessantly.

My mother and aunt started howling. My grandfather instructed them to keep a low voice.

Ironically, two army jawans standing guard outside our house were watching this. They neither had the arms nor the order to intervene by my uncle who was posted in the Lucknow Cantonment back then.

The news from nearby Kanpur was not very soothing.

House and business of one of the families we knew were reduced to ashes. Another family had a narrow escape as they exited with a ladder in the nick of time when the mob arrived at their house.

My wife's classmate lost her father who was burnt alive by a mob in Delhi. Her mother was offered a government job as a 'compensation'.

It's interesting to note that the Sikh community around the world has kept the memories of the 1984-genocide as well as the holocaust of 1762 and 1746 alive through pictures and paintings. About 15,000-20,000 Sikhs were killed by the forces of Afghan invader Ahmed Shah Abdali in February of 1762. These included mothers and their children.

Across several Gurudwaras across the world, I've found these images present. Not everyone though agrees with their presence, when images of a recent genocide take a political overtone.

In some pictures, those who killed the Prime Minister in response to the Operation Blue Star are hailed (wrongly) as martyrs. And their images adorn some Langar halls along with those of the Sikh holocaust of 1762. Nevertheless, the community has taken to never forget the genocides it has faced.

During Ardas in every Gurudwara around the world, the memory of the holocaust of 1746 and 1762 is kept alive with a sentence. The sentence repeated after every morning and evening ceremony remembers those who willingly agreed to climb the Catherine wheel or be beheaded but did not bow down to tyranny.

It has also learnt its lessons. In a visit last year to a Gurudwara in Trilokpuri, I could not help but notice the huge walls that now surround it.

After reading this news item on ToI recently, I could empathise with Muslim families living in Ayodhya. I could feel the fear they would have felt.

Riots leave an indelible mark of fear which seldom gets erased, especially from the psyche of children.

A young colleague in my earlier workplace had witnessed Gujarat Riots when she was nine. She still remembers it vividly and even recounted to me during her recruitment interview.

It would be ignorant for those who indulge or lead a mob to violence to believe that genocide memories can wash away easily. They seep through the passages of time through tales of suffering or heroism.

Even after generations die, communities find a way to revive those memories afresh in young minds. It reminds them of times when the man left his humanity.

It gives them a lesson to fight against ideologies which can pit neighbour against neighbour.

Even decades after the genocide, the pictures still hang questionably in langar halls of some Gurudwaras, even after Congress party put out a Sikh as a PM.

It gives a lesson to us that scars of genocide or division sowed in a society rarely heal.

Even if a political party loses an election after destroying the harmony of a village, the social the fabric of the village will take years to heal.

Perhaps threads of shared past misery also keep communities together. Memories of such events and those who play a role in perpetrating them rarely fade, even after centuries."

""We have written to block education officers to ensure that the private agencies are selected in each village to demolish unsafe government school buildings and construct new ones. The private agencies that will build the new school buildings will be finalised through an open auction in the respective villages. Earlier, due to technical reasons, we could not hire private agencies to reconstruct government schools,"" Balmukund Prasad, BSA, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.

According to officials, there are several government primary and middle schools in various villages across the district that are operating in old, unsafe buildings.

The education department has also written to the block education officer in Dankaur to inspect private schools and shut them down if they are violating norms.

As per the education department, there are 174 illegal schools in the Gautam Budh Nagar district. Over two lakh students study in these schools, that are housed in illegal buildings with no safety measures in place, officials said.

""After a 2017-18 survey, we identified 174 illegal schools in district. Most of them were shut down. Now, to identify more illegal schools, we have formed two teams that will submit monthly reports. The allegations of parents that we were aware of all illegal schools operating in the district are false and baseless,"" Prasad said.

""The block education officer needs to inspect Children's Academy in Chhijarsi; Dayanand Public School, Bahlolpur; Vivek Vidyapeeth, Chhijarsi; Gyandeep School in Chotpur, HI Public School in Chhijarsi; Geeta Public School in Chhijarsi; Jagriti Public School in Chhijarsi and Naveen Gyan Hari Singh Public School.

The other schools that are to be inspected by the education department are CBSE Public School, Prayag Public School and Sai Public School in Yakubpur village; and Royal Public School, Gayatri Public School and Beena Public School in Sadarpur village.

Pradeep Yadav, whose son was killed when New KM Public School's wall collapsed on Monday, said,""If these 174 schools were illegal and unsafe for children, then why did the education department not act earlier. We demand that the UP government file an FIR against education department officials for laxity.""

Prasad said,""Parents are responsible for checking whether schools are approved or not before they admit their wards. We have decided to seek information from the public about schools they think are illegal as well. We will inspect them and take appropriate action.""

He had just about recovered from an Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury and his shaky feet raised self-doubts on his ability to make the cut. However, coach Stephen Constantine showed tremendous faith in him. Poojary slowly regained his confidence and played a crucial role in the team's run-up to the final.

It's been the case with Poojary since he first took to the beautiful game. Each time he decided to walk away from football, the universe conspired in a way to ensure that he was drawn right back to it. It's what has made him believe in something that he calls magic today, besides, of course, his own abilities.

For, without that little bit of enchantment, the dream of playing professional football would have remained just that, let alone turning out for the senior national side in the Indian blues.

A stroke of luck

Football entered Poojary's world quite by chance. At St. Augustines High School in Nerul in Navi Mumbai, he had readied himself to go for cricket selections but erroneously landed up at the football trials instead. One look at his ability to run with the ball at his feet earned him plaudits at that early stage.

""We had a good system in place with experienced coaches to guide us. The likes of Rahul Bheke, who went on to play professional football, were from my school. Once I got started, I never really stopped playing,"" Poojary says.

When it came to school football, competition was scarce in Navi Mumbai -- a far cry from the hundreds of teams that turn out in the league conducted by the Mumbai School Sports Association. So while his school were champions for a good eight years that he was there, the real challenge lay in locating a club to further his prospects. That opportunity came in the form of a team comprising boys from the Ryan International Group of schools, where Poojary was part of the squad the earned promotion to the first division of the Mumbai District Football Association league.

Education first

Back home, the conditions on him playing football were set even before he was out of school. Three years before Poojary was born, his father, Chandrashekhar, had moved to Mumbai from Mangalore in search of work and was employed as a waiter at a hotel in Chembur. Excelling at education was key to bettering his prospects in the future and in turn, easing the financial burden on the family.

""I come from a middle class household, so money matters for us. Aur life main security tab milegi, jab padhai karega. Mereko doctor, engineer banana that, lekin main to flop ho gaya (And you'll earn security in life if you studied. They wanted to make me an engineer or a doctor, but I simply flopped),"" Poojary says, smiling.

After performing reasonably well in his 10th grade, Poojary took to the science stream. Around the same time, someone told him about trials at Mumbai FC for their under-15 side. He made the cut and proved his worth at the Manchester United Premier Cup in 2011 that featured most junior I-League teams.

By the end of the tournament, Poojary had captained the side to the final where they lost to Salgaocar, though his performance still earned him the best player award. Coach Naushad Moosa was left impressed with the promise he had shown, and the following year, promoted him to the Mumbai FC under-19 side and asked him to train with the big boys.

Despite struggling with injuries and low on confidence, Poojary received the backing of India coach Stephen Constantine. Image courtesy: Nikhil Poojary

For three years, Poojary was part of a daily grind that started at 4.30 am, involved changing three trains and spending around 2 and a half hours travelling in each direction, to get to the training ground in Borivali from his home in Nerul.

""And this was if I managed to get onto the train, which used to be really crowded at times,"" he recalls.

The taxing routine, however, left little time for studies, and in turn, Poojary flunked his 12th-grade examination. His father made a quick call to coach Moosa and told him that his son would play no further part at Mumbai FC. It was to be a premature end to his football career, yet life handed him a lifeline when he least expected it.

A team called Mumbai Tigers FC, which was formed around the same time in Vashi -- a short distance from his home -- reached out to him with an offer of Rs 10,000. It was unheard of for an under-19 player at the time.

""It was a relief for me and motivation for my parents to allow me to continue playing. At a time when I was about to quit, a new club came my way. You can call it God's gift,"" Poojary says.

Under the watchful eye of coach Bimal Ghosh, who is known to have groomed a number of young players, Poojary was once again, handed the opportunity to train with the big boys -- the likes of Steven Dias, NP Pradeep, Surkumar Singh and Paresh Shivalkar, who had already made a mark at the national stage. Having lost a year at college, there was enough time now to train and Poojary slowly found his feet among the seniors. But even as he settled into the new set up, the club suddenly shut shop, leaving him with question marks on his decision to continue playing all over again.

The hunt begins

From Mumbai Tigers, Poojary moved to Air India, who had pulled out of the I-League but actively played other tournaments. The money was also good and his parents finally relented on their insistence that he chase an education. When the time to renew his contract came a year later, Poojary decided to hold his horses on the advice of an agent, who told him that he would soon sign for a bigger, better club. That offer never arrived and after Mumbai FC too declined to sign him, Poojary found himself relatively stranded midway through 2015, with no income at his disposal for over six months.

""That was a time that I thought I would give up on a career in professional football, join a call centre and see where my life would take me,"" Poojary says.

Even as he was finalising his decision to quit playing, an offer to try out at Mohammedan Sporting came his way in November 2015. There was no question of asking his parents on their opinion, for he knew their decision, so with a one-way ticket, he decided to take on a 36-hour, unreserved train ride to Kolkata and try his luck.

""It was around Durga Puja and I didn't get a seat, so I slept next to the toilet at the start of the journey. I soon met some East Bengal supporters on the train, and when I told them I was Bheke's friend (who was at East Bengal at that time) and was going for trials, they gave me some place to sit,"" he says.

With the finances hard to manage at home, Poojary arrived in Kolkata relatively penniless and walked to Mohammedan's training facility. He was soon directed to the dressing room, which was to be his home for the next week. Before leaving, he was handed a can of mosquito repellent by the club officials and shown a sofa that was to be his bed.

""And I did need it at night amid all the muck,"" Poojary quips.

In the week that followed, Poojary was at the trials and during his time off the field, he would go watch the first team play in the Calcutta Football League alongside the supporters.

""An entire truckload of fans -- I had never seen anything like it before, because who asks a footballer anything in Mumbai? I would join them to the ground and back, eat biryani with them and get to see what Kolkata football was all about. It was nothing like I had experienced before and when I spoke to my mother, I remember telling her that I wasn't going to find a team better than this one,"" he says.

Further dejection

But by the end of it, further rejection followed as he was denied a contract and he called his agent to give him an earful, distraught at his prospects after all the struggle. He then pleaded his father to book him a ticket, unable to hold back his tears, simply wanting to return home and hang up his boots.

""That evening, my agent called me again and said that East Bengal was offering me trials. I laughed at the prospect of such a big club calling upon me, when I had been rejected by Mohammedan. But he insisted so I went,"" he says.

Before Poojary was handed the opportunity to step on the ground, former player and now a part of the East Bengal management, Alvito D'Cunha, did a background check on him by calling his coaches. What followed were three of the most horrible days at trials, after which, he was duly informed that a practice game against Army XI would be his last stint before he was being sent back home. That in turn, switched the balance in Poojary's favour for the first time in his senior career.

In the Calcutta Football League that year, Army XI had handed East Bengal a shock defeat. As a result, the scheduled fixture was expected to draw a lot of eyeballs and was even broadcasted on local television. East Bengal had their revenge with a 2-0 win, but more importunately, the fans had a new hero in their midst in Poojary, who had scored both goals.

""You know how it is to score a goal in India -- it then doesn't matter whether you had a decent game or not. That evening, I was handed a three-year contract. And I didn't bother looking at the amount because playing for East Bengal was massive,"" Poojary says.

What Poojary didn't know then was that scouts from the national team had also made their way there and in a few days, he received his first call-up for the India under-23 side. However, a hamstring injury ruled him out for the rest of the year.

By the time the next season arrived, Poojary was a wreck. The pressure of playing for East Bengal had told time and again, and at the back of his head, self-doubts had crept in on whether he would be able to handle another intense season in Kolkata.

""The fans would watch every single game and would critically analyse your performance, whether in person or on social media. I thought of terminating my contract and staying back in Mumbai. But I had always looked up to Rahul Bheke, who was at East Bengal at the time, and when he called and insisted that I come, I decided to go,"" he says.

India debut beckons

That stint is what Poojary calls his breakthrough season. Under coach Trevor Morgan, he made rapid progress and after 14 appearances in the I-League, he received another call-up for the India under-23 side. And this time, he didn't disappoint.

After putting on a good show in practice games in Singapore and Qatar, Poojary found himself in the India squad for the Tri-Nations Cup in Mumbai in August 2017. It was his first senior call-up and one of the few occasions when his parents could come to watch him play, making his debut even more special.

""There couldn't have been anything bigger for me than my folks making it there. Though I came on as a substitute in the first game, I started the second. There were tears streaming down my face when the national anthem played. Even today, I find all this very hard to believe,"" he says.

Injury issues

After the tournament, Poojary received a call from FC Pune City who asked him if he was interested in signing for them. He decided to go back to Kolkata to talk to East Bengal about his future. But during the first few training sessions, he hit rock bottom after all the highs, picking up an ACL injury that ruled him out through all of last year.

""After my surgery, I went to multiple doctors but my rehab had some major ups and downs. One day I felt fit and then the next, I would have my confidence knocked out at training. I wasn't sure if I would play at a good level again,"" he recalls.

Though injured, Pune City stood by their man and signed him, taking over his recovery process. When it came to the national team, Poojary had been sounded out before his operation that he would be considered for the SAFF Championship in Bangladesh and his rehabilitation had been planned in a way, that he would be ready in time for the tournament in September this year.

Fighting back

During the first day at camp, he had the lowest score on the fitness test. The niggling pain was a constant source of torment and Poojary had serious doubts on playing.

""They pushed me so hard that I thought it would aggravate my injury. When I look back now, clearly I had no idea that they had a plan,"" he says.

""Coach Stephen Constantine showed tremendous faith in me. The rest of the support staff would conduct endless sessions, specifically for me, and I remember that the massage therapy would go on until midnight. It's their hard work and their confidence in me that gave me that little bit of belief in my own abilities,"" he adds.

After the 45-day camp which also featured games in Australia, Poojary made the cut to the squad for the SAFF Championship. The time on field had gradually helped him gain back his confidence and Constantine handed him his first chance as a second-half substitute against Sri Lanka. In the next tie against the Maldives, Poojary started the game and notched up his first international goal.

""That goal was a massive boost for me; more so, because I realised I had recovered, both physically and mentally. The goal was for the coaching staff who had worked so hard on me,"" he says.

Poojary considers himself to be a very different person after undergoing all that he had during the injury. He's back at his best now, with seven appearances for Pune City, as well as game time during the national side's friendly against China.

Having made the cut for the 34-member, preliminary squad for the AFC Asian Cup, he will be looking to prove his worth at the Indian camp. And though Pune City have had a turbulent season thus far, he certainly believes in a little bit of magic these days.

The aim is to detect unregistered schools as well as those not adhering to safety norms, officials said.

The move comes a day after two children were killed and six others injured in a wall collapse at a private school in Noida.

According to police, the school building in Salarpur was ""too old and deteriorated"" and its wall collapsed due to the impact of some construction activity that was going on ""without any official approval"" in the adjoining plot.

""Earlier we found 174 unregistered schools in the district, of which 93 were shut down immediately and 22 more were closed after imposition of Rs 1 lakh fine on each.

""We are now trying to detect more such schools which may be operating without valid permissions,"" basic sikhsha adhikari (BSA) Bal Mukund told TOI.

""Sometimes these owners reopen the unregistered schools by changing their names. So two teams with two officers and two junior staff each will do the inspection. And if we find such violators, we will lodge police complaints against them and register FIRs for illegal operation of business in the name of schools,"" he said.

""Schools will be given recognition only when they meet all educational and safety parameters,"" the BSA added.

However, Mukund also acknowledged the need for more schools in the district to cater to the educational needs of every child.

""We have 685 government schools in Gautam Budh Nagar. However, these are not enough to meet the needs of a huge migrant population. At the same time, we cannot allow safety to be compromised,"" he added."

But Maggie bit off a little more than she could chew Sunday when it got over a foot deep at our house.

As an amateur dog psychiatrist, I'd love to know what she's thinking when I let her out to pee in the morning and inexplicably the ground is coated with this cold, white powdery stuff that wasn't there when we were playing Frisbee the night before.

Since I'm the one who feeds her, gives her treats and brings her home new toys, I'd like to think she credits me with providing this amazing new frozen wonderland.

More likely, in her mind the concept of ""why"" doesn't exist. This is her new reality, yesterday is forgotten and there is no tomorrow. All that matters is enjoying the moment.

Sunday morning, Maggie was enjoying the moment at first, and she hit the snow with her usual explosion of enthusiasm.

In the 22 years since I moved below the Mason-Dixon line, I can't remember seeing that much snow accumulation in such a short period of time.

It was definitely the most snow I've seen since Maggie arrived five years ago, and it didn't take her long to figure out something was different.

She was sinking in deeper, and it was taking a lot more effort for her to get back out. Usually she hops and prances effortlessly through the snow like a bunny rabbit.

She was hopping and prancing Sunday morning, albeit with a lot less gusto.

At one point, she stopped shoulder deep in snow and looked at me with an expression that said, ""This isn't really working for me.""

Eventually she worked her way onto the front porch overlooking a sea of white that was growing deeper before our very eyes. She scanned her domain for a moment, looked at me with disgust and went to the door.

""Let me in, Dad. I've had enough.""

Believe me, Maggie, I can relate. As a young pup, I loved playing in the snow, too. Then I got more then I could handle in January 1979.

Exactly one month from today will mark the 40th anniversary of Chicago's infamous ""Blizzard of 1979"".

Only a week removed from the end of our two-week Christmas break, the Blizzard of 1979 dumped so much snow on the Lake Michigan shoreline it took three weeks to get it cleaned up enough for schools to reopen.

During a 48-hour period of Jan. 12-14, we got more than 21 inches of snow, and that was on top of the 7 inches we had left over from New Year's Eve that hadn't melted yet.

You just can't imagine living with that much snow until you've seen it with your own eyes.

Roads were more like canyons with 20-foot high cliffs of snow piled in people's front yards. When they plowed the school parking lot, it created a pile of snow the size of a two-story farmhouse.

School was canceled, but a lot of us ended up at school anyway building elaborate forts with tunnels and slides in the massive snow pile. We had three or four forts in the same snow pile and attacked each other's forts with snow balls.

Snow drifts were so high against houses you could literally go sledding off your roof.

It was kid paradise for about three days. Then came the big freeze.

It went subarctic on us, with a wind-chill factor of 70-below-zero blowing off Lake Michigan. We woke up one morning to find our house doors completely frozen shut, held tight by a thick layer of ice around the door frame.

You couldn't stand to be outside for more than a couple of minutes at a time. That wind would cut you to the bone.

It seems like winters used to be a lot rougher than they are today, but the winter of 1979 was a REALLY rough one.

According to the U.S. Department of Commerce Weather Bureau, Chicago's average annual snowfall is 33 inches and rarely exceeds 40 inches.

Since 1899, there have only been four Chicago winters when total snowfall exceeded 60 inches, but during the winter of 1979 we got 88.4 inches of snow.

By the end of January, there was an accumulation of more than 47 inches on the ground, most of which was compacted ice. We didn't even see the ground again until March.

It's hard to believe a 10-year-old would start missing school, but that's what happened.

A lad can only tolerate so much Campbell's soup, Monopoly, and Chutes and Ladders.

It's called Cabin Fever, and you can treat the symptoms with a steady dose of ""The Price is Right,"" ""The Gong Show"" and reruns of ""Gilligan's Island,"" ""The Monkees"" and ""Tom and Jerry.""

Within a week of confinement, you're going to crack up, and that's what started to happen to Maggie on Sunday afternoon. One day equals a week to her, but she was starting to crack up by lunchtime.

You can keep her occupied for a while with her stuffed cow or a ball, but eventually she's back at the door wanting to go out and play.

Then the same scenario plays itself out. ""Up to my chin in snow. This isn't any fun. Let me back in.""

Fortunately for Maggie, yesterday is forgotten and all that matters is enjoying the moment. And at the moment the snow has melted back down to a level she can enjoy."

There are 174 illegal private schools operational in villages without requisite approvals for the buildings, officials of education department in Gautam Budh Nagar district said.

The Uttar Pradesh government on April 23, 1976, had established the New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (Noida) and, according to the Master Plan 2021, the city is spread across 2,031 hectares, comprising 81 villages and 168 Sectors including residential, commercial and Industrial uses.

The Noida authority has the mandate to regulate buildings of all kinds, including schools, in urban and rural areas. It has the power to issue notices and seal illegal and unsafe buildings.

After the twin building collapse in Greater Noida's Shahberi, in July 2018, killed nine persons, the Noida authority had conducted a survey and identified illegal buildings in all villages.

On August 3, the Noida authority had identified 1,757 buildings, which were constructed without approvals.

""However, we did not count unsafe buildings, which are being used for schools in villages. The administration and education department should look into this issue,"" a Noida authority official, not authorised to speak to media, said.

Noida authority chief executive officer Alok Tandon and additional chief executive officer RK Mishra were unavailable for comment on the issue despite repeated attempts to reach them. The authority' officer on special duty, RK Singh, refused comment on the issue.

Over 70 of 174 illegal schools are operational in Noida villages, officials of education department said.

""We had acted against illegal schools in 2017 and over 85 were shut down then. We are taking necessary action in this regard and schools, which are illegal, will face tough legal action,"" BN Singh, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.

Officials of the district administration may also write to the Noida authority as to why it did not act against owners of buildings, where illegal schools are operational.

These illegal schools cater to over 1 lakh students. They do not have affiliations to the Uttar Pradesh state education board, the Central Board of Secondary Education or any other board. These schools mostly cater to the children of factory workers and daily age earners, who cannot afford to send their children to recognised private schools.

""Each school, on an average, accommodates over 1,000 students and the fee is in the range of ₹800 to ₹1,500 a month. All these schools are sheltered by the education department. These school buildings do not have any safety measure in place. Some schools have over 1,000 students studying in small and dinghy buildings that have no setback area or fire safety systems in place,"" a school teacher, requesting anonymity, said."

The government school in her home town, Chopasni village, can now give competition to city schools after it was upgraded with help from donors. Chanchal and her elder sister Pratibha study in the village school now.

Several people from the village who shifted to Jodhpur city just to provide better education to their wards have returned to the village. Some private schools in the area have shut down due to shortage of students, say villagers. The Chopasni Government School is getting students from nearby villages, too, said block education officer Manohar Singh.

The school's transformation began in 2015 when an alumnus, Himmat Singh Ratnoo, became its principal. The school has recorded 100% results since then. The school has a projector room, computer labs, CCTV cameras, library and RO water facility.

""My first aim was to bring the children out of the inferiority complex of studying in a government school. Along with the villagers, I wrote a letter to ONGC and HPCL requesting help to construct two separate toilets for girls and boys as part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR). The school thus got two toilets that cost Rs 3.5 lakh each,"" said Ratnoo.

""Several girls who dropped out after a certain age due to lack of toilet facilities in school returned to study here,"" said Tima Ram Dhandhu, a villager.

""The next step was ensuring sufficient number of teachers. At present, there are 17 teachers in the school. I contacted several philanthropists and wrote letters to many others requesting financial assistance. The Rotary Club donated a projector and we raised over Rs 4 lakh to construct gated boundary walls and a prayer ground. Several others, including the village panchayat, contributed to construct classrooms in the school and install CCTV cameras,"" said Ratnoo.

Jay Narayan Gehlot, sarpanch of Chopasni village, said that the entire village made it a vision to give a good school to the children of the village. ""Having a school like this in a village like ours where the health facilities could not reach is an achievement. The entire village made it a vision to get better education facilities for our children. The panchayat collected money to make four new rooms in the school,"" said Gehlot.

Suresh Ratnoo, panchayat shayak, said he went door-to-door along with the teachers of the school explaining the developments in the school to the villages and motivating children, especially girls, to join the school. ""We told the people that the school has better education facilities and toilets. Now the number of girls and boys who study in the school is almost the same. From a single village we managed to bring 50-60 new students to join the school, ""said Suresh.

Sarla Ratnoo, a student of class 12, said: ""I can dream big now as I can continue with my education. Had the school been far away or without facilities, it would not have been possible.""

The school has a strength of more than 350 students and provides Identity cards and uniforms. ""CCTV cameras have been installed in the classes. The teachers and I keep watch over every activity in the school. We keep organising sports and other extra-curricular activities from time to time to give boost students' exposure,"" said the proud principal."

The Urdu medium school has been operating from Eidgah premises since it was demolished during the Emergency. A petition had been filed in HC, which had ordered the government to build the school and DDA to provide the land.

""DDA had committed to provide 4,000 sq metre land for the school, which has been operating out of Eidgah since 1976 in Ballimaran. But now, it is saying it will allot just 1,600 sq metre and reduce the number of classes instead. It is planning to give just a lane for the school, which is not acceptable,"" said Sisodia. The 4,000 sq metre land is minimum requisition of master plan 2021 for building a school.

Sisodia said there was a direction from the lieutenant governor that classes XI and XII be shut down, and the government was not consulted on the matter. DDA comes under LG Anil Baijal. Sisodia lashed out at DDA for being ""anti-education"".

At a DDA meeting held on Friday, the proposal to give 1,600 sq ft for the school was moved, which the AAP MLA Somnath Bharati had opposed.

""Again, BJP has proved its anti-education stand. They want our country to remain illiterate. Prime Minister Narendra Modi (ji) why is your party against education? BJP has a plan to give it to the parking mafia,"" asked Sisodia.

CM Arvind Kejriwal also tweeted, ""Government land is not anybody's private property. The way LG is misusing government property is not correct. People need schools. LG is giving the land meant for schools to build office of BJP and for parkings. The land in Delhi should be the right of the people living here."""
