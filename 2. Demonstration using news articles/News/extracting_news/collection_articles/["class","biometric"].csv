Almost 30 lakh out of the 40 lakh people who found their names missing from the NRC had filed claims to be included during the claims and objections round that ended on December 31.

A senior government official said that the UIDAI would obtain the biometrics when the applicants appeared for hearings to be held by Class-I officers starting from February 15 onwards.

As per the standard operating procedure (SOP) submitted by the Centre in the Supreme Court last year, ""during the course of the hearings, the State government in collaboration with UIDAI will undertake the process of biometric enrolment of all the applicants of NRC. The biometric enrolment in respect of persons who are part of claims and those persons objected upon will be distinctive and separate ID will be generated.""

The fate of the 10 lakh applicants who had not filed claims was yet to be decided, the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.

""This means that they do not have documents to prove that they came to India before March 1971, the cut-off date to be included in the NRC,"" said the official, adding that the 10 lakh people had been identified and that their details were available with the authorities.

""Once the claims have been heard and the final NRC has been decided, only the eligible applicants will be given the Aadhar card. The authorities will have the biometrics of all the applicants,"" said the official.

The exercise conducted under the supervision of the Supreme Court gave opportunity to those excluded from the list to file claims and those who suspected that someone had been wrongfully included to file objections. The official said that only 600 objections had been filed so far.

As per directions of the Supreme Court, the Registrar General of India (RGI) published the final draft list of NRC on July 30 to segregate Indian citizens living in Assam from those who had illegally entered the State after March 25, 1971. That draft contained the names of 2.9 crore out of 3.29 crore applicants."

This year was a tumultuous one for a number of India's institutions. The year saw the country's biggest institutions, from the CBI to the RBI face a credibility crisis. But one institution proved rightfully why it has the word supreme in its name. The Supreme Court with its milestone judgments in several cases -- from granting the right to love freely to securing citizen's privacy, won citizen's hearts with its verdicts.

Here are some of the landmark judgments delivered in 2018:

Sabarimala verdict

The Sabarimala temple in Kerala, a shrine to Lord Ayappa, had an age-old tradition of not allowing women between the age of 10 and 50 years to enter the premises. The reason? The women, who fall in the menstruating age group, were considered to be ""impure"".

In a 4-1 majority decision, the Supreme Court on September 28, lifted the ban, which it termed as a violation of women's right to practice religion.

Top quotes: ""In the theatre of life, it seems, man has put the autograph and there is no space for a woman even to put her signature"", ""Patriarchy in religion cannot be allowed to trump right to pray and practise religion"" and ""To treat women as children of lesser god is to blink at the Constitution.""

Aadhaar verdict

A Supreme Court bench in September held the constitutional validity of the government's Aadhaar project. However, it set boundaries to the use of Aadhaar for verification -- Aadhaar can be used for payment of government benefits and taxation records but private companies were barred from accessing it. The judgment dealt a body blow to the government's ambitions to make the world's largest biometric project mandatory for a slew of services.

The landmark ruling sent banks, telecom operators and fintech companies -- who relied heavily on Aadhaar eKYC -- scrambling in search of other viable means of customer verification.

Top quotes: ""Education took us from thumb impression to signature; technology has taken us from signature to thumb impression, again"", ""Dignity and rights of individuals cannot be based on algorithms or probabilities"" and ""Aadhaar gives dignity to the marginalised. Dignity to the marginalised outweighs privacy.""

National anthem verdict

In January, the apex court modified a 2016 order which made playing the national anthem in movie theatres compulsory. By changing the word 'shall' to 'may', it decreed that the order was no longer mandatory. However, it clarified that should a movie hall choose to play the national anthem, it was compulsory for all moviegoers to stand up in respect unless exempted on account of disability.

Top quote: ""The national anthem is a tool for the integration of India, regardless of the many castes and religions.""

Section 377 verdict

Proving that love wins, the Supreme Court in a unanimous judgment repealed Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code -- the draconian law that criminalised same-sex relations as well as unnatural sex between consenting adults. The Supreme Court said due to Section 377, members of the LGBT community were forced to live in hiding, and as second-class citizens, while others enjoyed the right to sexual orientation. The landmark judgment held that sexual orientation was a biological phenomenon and not a mental disorder or something against the order of nature.

Top quotes: ""The human instinct to love was caged by constraining the physical manifestation of their sexuality"", ""History owes an apology to members of the LGBTQ community"" and ""I am what I am, So take me as I am.""

Euthanasia verdict

In a historic judgment, the Supreme Court in March broke new ground, giving legal sanction to the living will of patients by observing that ""Right to refuse medical treatment and die with dignity is a fundamental right; and a part of the right to live, as guaranteed by the Constitution"". The important observation came in a landmark verdict of a five-judge constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra which recognised the right of a terminally ill patient to execute a ""living will"" to refuse medical treatment for dying with dignity.

Living will is a written document that allows a patient to give explicit instructions in advance about treatment to be administered when he or she is terminally ill or no longer able to express consent.

Top quotes: ""Every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body..."", ""Life is seemingly lost and questions about our own mortality confront us in the twilight of existence"" and ""To deprive an individual of dignity towards the end of life is to deprive the individual of a meaningful existence.""

Adultery verdict

Furthering its championing of women's rights, the apex court struck down Section 497, a 158-year-old law that considers adultery to be an offence committed by one man against another, and has been criticised for treating women as possessions rather than human beings. Adultery is no longer a crime, but it will continue to be grounds for divorce. The judgment was a landmark for championing women's sexual autonomy.

Top quotes: ""It's time to say the husband is not the master of the woman"", ""A woman loses her voice, autonomy after entering marriage"" and ""Society ascribes impossible virtues to a woman and confines her to a narrow sphere of behaviour by an expectation of conformity.""

31,536,000. That's how many seconds there are in a year. But what do all these over 31 million seconds mean to us? They mean moments that have made up our lives. Moments that left us happy or melancholic or annoyed or even despairing. As 2018 draws to an end, here's a recap of some of the moments that grabbed headlines, impacted India, and left us shaken and stirred...

Enough is enough

The #MeToo movement may have been ignited with the accusations levelled against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein last year, but it became a storm now. It started with actor Tanushree Dutta accusing her then co-star Nana Patekar of sexual misconduct on the sets of the 2008 film 'Horn Ok Pleass.' The #MeToo storm has now seen several high-profile men from the entertainment and other industries being accused by women of sexual harassment. Prominent personalities like filmmaker Vikas Bahl, actors Rajat Kapoor and Alok Nath, artists Subodh Gupta and Jatin Das, comedians like Utsav Chakraborty and Gursimran Khamba, and BCCI CEO Rahul Johri were among those accused of sexual misconduct. Journalist-turned-politician MJ Akbar, who is facing several allegations of sexual harassment, even had to resign as Union Minister of State for External Affairs.

While the movement did force most companies to start taking the issue of sexual harassment at the workplace more seriously, it remains to be seen how long and how well these actions are implemented.

Free to love

The Supreme Court was in the spotlight regularly, mostly for the wrong reasons, but sometimes for all the right ones. In September, the apex court, in a landmark judgement, decriminalised homosexuality by declaring Section 377, the penal provision which criminalised gay sex, as ""manifestly arbitrary"". This was a big win for the country's LGBTQ community, coming as it did after decades of harassment and struggle. While Section 377, the regressive law introduced by the British in 1861, may have been struck down, LGBTQ activists and community has a long struggle ahead while trying to ensure the community gets dignity and acceptance in society and the workplace.

Unholy row

The Supreme Court struck down a ban that prevented women between 10 and 50 years of age from entering the famous holy hill shrine of Sabarimala in Kerala. The ban on women of menstruating age was based on the belief that the reigning deity, god Ayyappa, was a celibate. The ruling sparked off violent protests and clashes between opposing sides. Though a group of transgender women did enter the temple, no woman of the banned age group has managed to enter yet. And now the matter is back before the apex court after the SC agreed to hear a review petition challenging the earlier order.

Daylight robbery

Billionaire diamantaire uncle-nephew duo Mehul Choksi and Nirav Modi and their associates, colluded with a rogue employee at Punjab National Bank to obtain fraudulent guarantees worth $2.1 billion dollars over seven years -- the nation's biggest ever bank fraud. Nirav Modi and his family absconded days before the news of the scam broke in India. The fraudulent letter of undertaking worth Rs 14,356.84 crore, issued by the Punjab National Bank at its Brady House branch in Mumbai, makes the bank liable for the amount. Let's hope that absconders like Modi, Choksi and Vijay Mallya are soon brought back home for their date with justice.

Shocking judgement

The year started off with a bang with four senior judges of the Supreme Court holding a press conference to address what they perceived as a crisis in the judiciary in January. Justice Jasti Chelameswar described it as an ""extraordinary event in the history of any nation"". At the press meet, Justice Chelameswar, the second senior judge after the Chief Justice of India, was accompanied by Justices Ranjan Gogoi, Kurian Joseph, and Madan Lokur. The four senior judges mounted a virtual revolt against the chief justice, listing a litany of problems that they said are afflicting the country's highest court and warned they could destroy Indian democracy. The unprecedented move left the judiciary and observers stunned.

Ushering change

September saw the Supreme Court pass several historic orders. The apex court upheld the validity of Aadhaar in September and struck down Section 57 of Aadhaar Act. So while Aadhaar is constitutional, making it mandatory for availing government services is unconstitutional. So, while Aadhaar-PAN linking is mandatory, private entities are barred from using the biometric data for KYC authentication. Thus, it's not mandatory for opening of bank accounts or getting mobile connections.

In another historic judgement, the Supreme Court also quashed adultery as a criminal offence. While striking down the 150-year-old law, the court criticised the fact that Section 497 of the IPC treats women as possessions rather than human beings.

The Supreme Court also ordered live-streaming and video recording of the court proceedings, thus bringing its courtroom proceedings under public glare.

Hug hungama

In July, a raging debate on No-Confidence Motion was going on between the ruling National Democratic Alliance and the Opposition when suddenly Congress president Rahul Gandhi hugged Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Gandhi walked across the aisle and gave a reluctant PM a hug after a fiery speech. Before crossing over for his epic hug, the Congress chief concluded his speech by saying, ""You can abuse me, you can call me Pappu, but I don't have a speck of hatred against you...""

Known for hugging his international counterparts, the PM was left stunned by what came to be known as 'Pappu ki Jhappi'. The hug theatrics won him a lot of accolades and then he winked at his partymen. The wink signalled that the 'jhappi' wasn't spontaneous and heart-felt, but to gain political mileage. It marked the moment that 'Pappu pass ho gaya'.

Mysterious passing

Sridevi's untimely death in a foreign land left the entire nation shocked because of the mystery surrounding it and the unexpectedness of the tragedy. Did she have a cardiac arrest? Did she drown? Prying questions were asked about her and Boney Kapoor's marital situation. The tragedy of her passing turned into a media circus. But while the conspiracy theories were being thrown around, her family and the nation mourned the passing of a cinema legend who lit up the silver screen with her luminous presence.

The wink

Malayalam actor Priya Prakash Varrier became an overnight sensation thanks to her 'wink' in the song 'Manikya Malaraya Poovi...' from the film 'Oru Love'. The wink went viral, she became an internet superstar and according to Google India, she was 2018's most searched personality of the year.

Killer virus

In May, Kerala saw the Nipah virus outbreak, traced to fruit bats in the area. The outbreak was localised in Kozhikode and Malappuram districts of the state, with over 2,000 people in the two districts quarantined and kept under observation during the period of the outbreak. The outbreak claimed 17 lives.

Deadly floods

The gods weren't kind to their 'own country', when in early August unusually heavy rainfall triggered devastating floods in Kerala - the worst floods in the state in nearly a century. Nearly 500 people lost their lives in the floods with several hundred injured; about a million people were evacuated. According to the Kerala government, one-sixth of the total population of Kerala had been directly affected by the floods and related incidents. As per the initial assessment by the state government, the damage caused by the floods was at least Rs. 20,000 crore. Strangely, a few days after receiving one of the highest rainfall in a century, Kerala came under the threat of severe drought.

Triple win

A resurgent Congress won assembly elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, dealing a body blow to the BJP in the Hindi heartland. The results are sure to invigorate the party leadership and throw open the 2019 Lok Sabha elections which, till some time back, looked to be in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's grip.

Controversial deal

The deal of Indian Air Force getting 36 multi-role Rafale fighter jets for an estimated price of 7.8 billion Euros from Dassault Aviation has been in the news for a while now. But 2018 saw the Opposition reignite the issue alleging the union government reportedly favoured Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence at the cost of Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL). But in the last month of the year, the Supreme Court poured cold water on the Opposition campaign by dismissing all petitions seeking a probe into the alleged irregularities of the deal. SC gave a clean chit to the Centre on decision making, pricing and selection of the Indian offset partner.

Fiery agitation

India virtually came to a stop on April 2, when the Dalit organisations call for Bharat Bandh saw widespread protests across the nation against an order of the Supreme Court on the Atrocities Act. The protesters believed that the apex court's ruling diluted certain provisions of the act, which were put in place to protect the marginalised communities against atrocities and discrimination. The protests turned violent and at least 10 people died and hundreds were injured during clashes between protestors and police.

Violent clashes

Violence broke out during an annual celebratory gathering at Bhima Koregaon near Pune to mark the 200th year of the Battle of Bhima Koregaon. The gathering of Dalit community members on January 1 was to commemorate the 'Battle' that took place in 1818 in which the Mahar community, led by the British, had defeated the upper-caste Peshwas. Some right-wing outfits had objected to the gathering and allegedly indulged in arson and stone pelting that led to violent clashes. The violence spread to other parts of the state, including Mumbai, with Dalit organisations calling for a statewide bandh on January 3. The violence resulted in four deaths. Following the gruesome matter, Pune police conducted raids on residences of activists, several of whom were detained for having Maoist links.

Dussehra tragedy

They had gathered for Dussehra celebrations, but October 19 became a night of horror for many Amritsar residents. Over 60 lives were lost and 140 left wounded after a speeding train crashed into a crowd of Dussehra revellers who had gathered at the Joda Phatak area of the city to watch the burning of a Ravana effigy and had scattered onto the nearby railway tracks.

Farmers' march

Over 30,000 farmers marched to Mumbai on March 12 to demand loan waivers, fair prices for their produce and the implementation of the MS Swaminathanan Commission recommendations to safeguard their rights. The farmers, wearing red caps and carrying red flags, arrived in arrived in Mumbai after a six-day trek from Nashik, situated 165 km from India's financial capital.

The week-long farmers' march was unique in many ways since, unlike other marches, it was mostly silent and disciplined, non-disruptive and non-violent, and received the sympathy of middle-class city dwellers, food and water from bystanders, free medical services from volunteer doctors, and also support from politicians cutting across party lines.

There were two other mass farmer protests in Maharashtra this year. In July, dairy farmers protested seeking a hike in milk prices and then in November around 20,000 drought-affected tribal farmers from across Maharashtra marched to Mumbai from neighbouring district of Thane to press for their demands.Similar marches took place in Delhi later in the year.

Welcome ban

On March 23, Maharashtra announced a ban on manufacture, use, distribution, sale and storage of plastic and thermocol products, including bags, dish, cups, plates, glasses, containers, small PET bottles and decoration items. The State gave citizens and companies three months to dispose of the existing stocks. While the industry opposed the ban, environmentalists welcomed it. But six months on, implementation remains a worry.

Statue of contention

The world's tallest statue at 182 metres, honouring Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, was inaugurated in his home state. It is located in Gujarat's Narmada district, about 200 km from Ahmedabad. Double the height of the Statue of Liberty, the Statue of Unity, built at a cost of Rs 2,989 crore, left the nation divided. In a country where farmers are committing suicide and there are so many people struggling to make ends meet, the expenditure was described by many as a ""colossal waste of money"", but its supporters point out that the tourism the statue attracts will generate jobs and revenue.

Brutal killing

Tigress Avni or T1, a six-year-old mother of two cubs, was brutally and controversially shot dead by a sharp shooter, Nawab Asghar Ali Khan on November 2. The shooter allegedly shot down the tigress as she had allegedly killed 13 people since 2016. The killing of the tigress triggered a huge controversy.

Era ends

August saw the demise of two political legends - former Prime Minister and BJP stalwart Atal Bihari Vajpayee and DMK founder and five-time Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M Karunanidhi. Karunanidhi passed away on August 7 at the age of 94 in Chennai after battling prolonged illness. Vajpayee, who had been unwell for almost a decade, breathed his last at AIIMS hospital in New Delhi on August 16 at the age of 95. The country also mourned the deaths of Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar and former Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee this year.

Wedding wows

This was the year of big fat celebrity weddings. Bollywood saw three big ones. Priyanka and Nick's wedding was the most searched wedding on Google in 2018. But the #DeepVeer wedding too caused a buzz on social media. Sonam Kapoor's wedding to Anand Ahuja in May grabbed eyeballs, as did the surprise wedding of actors Neha Dhupia and Angad Bedi. Model-actor Milind Soman marrying his ladylove Ankita Konwar left many of his fans heartbroken. Badminton stars Saina Nehwal and Parupalli Kashyap also tied the knot in December 2018.

Flash galore

Isha Ambani, the daughter of Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, wed Anand Piramal on December 12 and the lavish wedding made news for an entire week. The event, which saw everyone from Beyonce to all of Bollywood taking the stage, even had some Bollywood celebs serving food to the guests.-"

The system will be in place for all examinations conducted by the MPSC for recruitment in police, forest and government departments, and to fill other vacancies.

The system was previously used on a pilot basis for three to four mains exams conducted by the state civil services.

In fact, the prelims exam conducted on December 23 for Class II officers of Women and Child Welfare department used biometric attendance system, Chandrashekhar Oak, acting chairman of MPSC, said.

All the prelims conducted from January 2019 will also have biometric attendance system in place. The MPSC conducts examinations for recruitment of various state government departments through direct, competitive, departmental or limited vacancy exams. ""The number of candidates appearing for direct recruitment and competitive exams is huge. The competitive exams are mainly held in three phases, including prelims, mains and interview, while in direct recruitment exams there are two phases consisting of prelims and interviews. The biometric system will help in eliminating bogus students appearing for any of these exams,"" said Oak.

Compared to the main exam, the number of students appearing for prelims is much bigger. Hence, the commission decided to implement the system on a pilot basis for mains exams. The exams conducted in November and December had biometric attendance, but for the prelims the system had not been used yet.

""At the time of filling of forms, the Aadhar details of every student are taken based on which the identity of the candidates is verified. On Sunday, the exam held for women and child welfare department was the first prelims exam for which the identification system was used,"" Oak said.

Before entering the examination hall, candidates have to press their thumbs in the machine following which their photographs are taken. They are then allowed to enter the exam hall."

Vivek Sharma, CEO, Piramal Pharma Solutions (PPS), predicts that outsourcing will be a central cog in the future pharma supply chain as it evolves from a transactional need to a strategic function

As pharma companies lever external capabilities to drive growth, outsourcing has now become a key component of the drug development and drug manufacturing supply chains. As customers demand scale, reach, and breadth in capabilities, Contract Development and Manufacturing Organisations (CDMOs) have begun to consolidate, to obtain both, proximity to clients and the end markets, through a network of global sites. This extended footprint has also allowed CDMOs to become full-service providers that offer end-to-end capabilities.

By establishing strategic partnerships with CDMOs, both large and small companies can now focus on their core competencies, lever external capacity and specialised expertise with no capital investment, control costs, while rapidly accelerating programmes towards commercialisation. These partnerships help mitigate the risk and costs associated with drug development, by extending the runway for the capital invested. With new drug approvals on the rise - the FDA approved 50 NMEs by November 2018, second only to 53 NME approvals in 1996 - signalling a robust clinical development pipeline, these external collaborations provide the bandwidth needed to drive these approvals to successful launch.

On the other side, by developing these preferred relationships, CDMOs are now migrating from a 'vendor-customer' model to a 'partnership' model, one that can be both sustainable and rewarding. CDMOs now are providing platform solutions that can assist customers in taking programmes from Concept (discovery) to Commercial launch. As the future needs of pharma companies evolve into personalised medicine, niche therapies, fast track programmes, and novel delivery systems, CDMOs are now investing in these future needs on the strength of these strategic partnerships. Other areas of collaboration include CDMOs taking over the manufacturing of late life cycle commercial products, by levering their superior scale and cost structure, allowing pharma companies to increase profitability while allocating their internal capacity to newer, higher-value drugs.

The comparison between small molecules and biologics is also an on-going discussion in the industry. A lot is happening in the biopharma market with the advent of cell and gene therapies. As compared to small molecules, biologics offer high margins and long term value to the companies. Manufacturing of biologics is a complex process and a multi-discipline activity. Therefore, most big pharma companies have invested in biologic manufacturing facilities to manufacture their biologic drugs in-house. This helps them retain full control over the supply chain and quality of the product while ensuring security of supply.

CDMOs are, in some cases, unable to fulfil requirements that demand flexibility and small volumes for biologic molecules. Therefore, one evolving trend is for pharma companies to virtualise their small molecule portfolio while retaining large molecule manufacturing in house. Small molecules continue to dominate the FDA approvals as almost 70 per cent of NMEs being approved over the last five years are small molecules. We expect that the small molecule outsourcing trend will continue to strengthen in the coming years as companies continue to streamline their manufacturing footprint.

In line with the focus on biologics, Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs) are now in the news again with the recent wave of third generation ADCs that are site specific and are homogenously conjugated. This has led to an increase in the clinical trial of ADCs with almost 600+ clinical trials on going worldwide. With close to 17 drugs, that are either approved, or are in late stages of clinical development, the ADCs therapeutics market is anticipated to grow at a CAGR to 19.4 per cent between 2017 and 2030 with an estimated value of $8 billion in next five years. The global market for antibody drug conjugates is expected to be driven by the advancement in medical technology, rising incidence of cancer, and an increasing demand for biologic therapies. Unlike conventional chemotherapies that also damage normal tissue, ADCs target only cancer cells and hence the majority of the antibody drug conjugates under development are for oncological indications propelled by the availability of monoclonal antibodies targeting different types of cancer. Some market players are also looking outside the oncology domain to develop antibody drug conjugates, though such drugs are limited in number and are in the preclinical stage of development.

An ADC manufacturing/fill finish facility is a substantial investment, which is why most ADCs are manufactured at CMOs. Most smaller companies, and even some larger companies, do not have enough of a pipeline to justify the level of facility investment needed for ADCs and/or cannot keep the facility fully utilised. In addition, the supply chain for manufacturing ADCs is complex, including linker/toxin manufacture, antibody manufacture, conjugation/QC/stability testing, and fill finish. As a result, most pharma companies have opted to outsource the manufacturing of their ADCs with approximately 70 per cent of all ADC manufacturing activities conducted by CMOs.

In summary, we expect outsourcing to be a central cog in the future pharma supply chain. It has become a 'must have' from a 'nice to have' as pharma firms seek to extend their capital runway, while focusing on their core competencies. Consequently, Outsourcing has evolved from a transactional need to a strategic function. Working with a limited number of supplier-partners helps firms optimise costs and management time, while ensuring that these partners focus on investing capital to meet their future needs. We at Piramal continue to invest in the future requirements of our customers, and now offer a customised suite of integrated solutions that can drive programs from Concept to Commercialisation. Our range of offerings, breadth of capabilities, geographical reach, and integrated network of sites has propelled us to become the 'Partner of Choice' for several pharma and biotech companies. We expect these trends to continue as the industry focuses on developing breakthrough medicines, rapidly and cost effectively, for the one person we are all focussed on the patient.

Future of pharma innovations and R&D in India

Dr Anwar Daud, Managing Director, ZIM Laboratories, gives an insight about the innovation trends to look out for in 2019 in the pharma sector

Innovation is the key to success for any business. Innovation and research in various business sectors is driven by factors specific to the business. In pharma, currently innovation is driven by following three factors:Firstly, competition in the generic market has become ferocious with the entry of many players, both, big and small. In the US, about 50 per cent of the market is controlled by three major retail companies and therefore they increase pressure on pharma companies to lower their prices. In developed countries, healthcare is provided through insurance companies and these companies are not ready to pay for premium for products without any tangible clinical benefits. In short, everybody is looking for affordable healthcare. So, pharma companies are required to direct their research efforts to develop the products that addresses unmet medical needs and provide them at affordable cost in order to sustain with high profits.

Secondly, in many of the otherwise lucrative markets for Indian pharma companies, government policies are changing to encourage local manufacturing and to promote generics products. This is causing massive disruption in the business. Pharma companies either need to set up their manufacturing plants in such markets or are required to bring highly innovative products with high technology barriers in order to survive through such government policies.

Thirdly, availability of pharma products on e-commerce platforms has shifted decision making power to patient from physician and supply chain push. Social media is additionally altering psyche of consumer through awareness campaigns and subtle promotional messages. In such scenario, only truly innovative products will sustain and grow. The crux of discussion is innovation is indispensable. Trends of innovation among global pharma companies

Biologicals

Biologicals and gene therapy based drugs are large molecules that constitute effective mode of treatment for complex diseases like cancer, HIV, arthritis, psoriasis or Crohn's disease etc. The first approved biological drug was biosynthetic human insulin in 1982. After that there was a long period before any new biological was approved. Overall, EMA has authorised more number of biologicals since 2006 than US FDA. In US recently the number of approved biologicals is increasing to about 25-35 per cent of the total approved drugs. Research in biologicals require a specific skills that are different from those required for small molecules. Therefore, number of global players in this category is limited.

New/additional indications

Use of existing drugs for new or additional indications is explored as a cost effective method for innovation and increasing lifecycle of a product. Since all such drugs have tested safety profile, therefore, the review process is also shorter. This option also provides patent protection in some cases. To quote examples, Amantadine, originally an antiviral drug was later approved for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, Montelukast, an established anti-asthmatic is being explored for its use in Alzheimer's patients and Tadalafil an ED drug is also approved for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

New route of delivery

Establishing new route of delivery for existing molecules brings about significant clinical benefits and provides an edge over the competitors. Generally, injectables are converted to nasal/buccal/sublingual formulations as non-invasive means of delivery or oral products are designed to be delivered by nasal/ buccal/ sublingual routes. Such products overcome some serious limitations of the existing products like poor bioavailability, slow onset of action, to get faster onset in case of emergency, reduction in dose etc. Zolmitriptan nasal spray, Midazolam nasal spray, Desmopressin sublingual tablets, diazepam buccal films are some of the examples in this category of innovation.

New dosage forms

Sometimes simply changing the dosage form brings significant incremental advantage to the product and extended patent protection. For example in the case of switch from Suboxone sublingual tablets to films resulted in reduced dose and better safety and in case of Cholecalciferol oral films it increases efficacy. Most of the times new dosage forms are developed to target special need patient population like paediatric and geriatric etc. These innovative features are received very well by both physicians and patients.

New technology for old products

Innovations are done to produce existing products with new technologies. These new technologies overcome limitations of existing products. Spritam orally disintegrating tablet is manufactured using 3D printing technology. The advantage of this technology is to prepare very fast dissolving tablets for high dose drugs. This is not possible with conventional lyophilisation or low compression processes. Another example is ""Melt dose technology"" that yields controlled release products with better bioavailability. With the help of this technology, poorly soluble drugs can be developed into extended release with predictable release profiles. Envarsus XR is based on this technology.

Innovation in packaging

Most of the innovations in this segment addresses the area of child resistance, senior friendliness, adherence, overuse/misuse etc. For some drug categories these issues are very serious therefore, such additional attributes to the package are absolute necessity and clinicians prefer them over the conventional products. There are products available in the market like blisters with child lock (ecoslide RX), unit dose pediatric products (Pedia Care), bottle caps that record the time between doses(RX Timer Cap) or sets the time for next dose and tablet dispensers with biometric facility (Zalviso).

New fixed dose combinations

Several fixed dose combinations are approved every year with the aim to reduce number of pills and increase compliance to treatment regimen. Ertugliflozin L-pyroglutamic acid/ Metformin hydrochloride; Aspirin/Omeprazole; Tezacaftor/ivacaftor are some of the recently approved combinations that established their efficacy in the clinical trials or could convince drug authorities for their utility.

Current trends and future of innovation in Indian pharma

Indian pharma industry holds a very strong position in the global pharma market since long time. With 304 ANDAs approvals in the year 2017, generic products are basic expertise of Indian pharma industry. The wave of price erosion of generic products has struck Indian pharma badly resulting in big loss of revenues. Many Indian pharma realised this in time and switched the gears to development of R&D based products. Having skills for development of generic products, developing niche and complex generics products is relatively easier for Indian pharma industry. Recently, there is increase in filings of complex generics by Indian pharma players. Table 1 summarises the area of pharma innovation and Indian companies focusing on these areas.

Indian companies have very strong future in developing products based on alternate route of delivery, new dosage forms, modified release profiles and fixed dose combinations. Some companies are working in the area of niche products and biologicals. Although, number of biotech companies is limited in India and currently these companies are focussing on development of off patent biologicals but, there is a huge scope of development in this sector. With very supportive Government policies, development of biotechnology parks and funding to novel ideas will strengthen the position of Indian pharma industry in the global biological market.

Top 10 Indian companies have filed about 45 complex generic products in 2017. These companies have very strong pipeline of complex products. Many medium and small R&D based companies are also working on focused R&D programs and offering their share of complex products to the global pharma market. Considering need of innovation, pharma companies are increasing their R&D spending and investing in systematic research based activities for development of innovative products. This will not only keep them ahead in the competition but also will set an example that timely change in the strategies is must to sustain and move ahead in the business.

Building human capital -- 2019

Sumit Kumar, Vice President, NETAP asserts that pharma sector cannot achieve the expected growth if it doesn't invest in building talent

Jonathan Haskel & Stain Westlake in their famous book called 'Capitalism without Capital' mentions about rise of phenomena in 21st century about investment by developed economies in intangible assets than in tangible assets for a long-term success. Countries, companies, investors and managers are exploring avenues to create intangible assets to grow their economies, businesses and portfolio. In 2004, Harvard Business Review came out with an influential paper stating that talent, capability and skills constitutes intangible assets and are far more valuable for an organisation than their tangible assets. Often, employees are considered as tangible assets as they can be seen in their physical form, but more than just the warm bodies, its actually their abilities, talent and skill that is an asset for an organisation. You can replace a talented employee by back filling the position; however the capability of that employee cannot be replaced. It needs to be created.

As economies are realising the value of human capital, pharma sector is exploring avenues to create such capabilities. Pharma sector is the sought after sector for employment. It currently employees about three million people and is expected to add over a million people in next four years. The fact that sector is backed by favourable regulatory amendments and economic improvement has put the sector on a fast growth trajectory. The sector is also witnessing adoption of technology in all aspects of business to bring in cost efficiency and productivity enhancement. As technology is overpowering the sector, the need for talent is also getting specific and specialised. Also, pharma retail which is predominantly unorganised is witnessing a paradigm shift as organised players are entering this segment and setting up pan India chain of pharmacies. With all this expected growth, sector which employs 2.6 million people currently is projected to go upto four million by 2022.

Pharma sector as a whole is witnessing a transformation and as the sector evolves it needs massive investments in human capital to cater to current needs and to prepare capabilities for tomorrow. While technology, regulatory reforms, foreign investments, etc. will support the growth, investment in human capital cannot be ignored. World over, pharma giants have invested in formal structured training to develop talent. Apprenticeships have been widely used by these giants for training as it gives on-the-job exposure which is best suited to create capabilities. It helps build cognitive skills which are essential at work place. In India, the trend of blended apprenticeship training is catching up which is a combination of on the job and off the job training programmes to create a productive work force. Customised curriculum is being curated as per the National Skill Qualification Framework to fit the organisation's needs. Under blended apprenticeships, trainees can be groomed as per the needs of the organisation and the industry. Performing real work under on the job training makes the person proficient in the craft.

For talent creation, apprenticeships works best in long rung as it is a cost effective way to build a consistent supply chain of talent which supports future growth of the organisation. Employers are realising its benefits as it supports their overall growth strategy. Organisations are investing in blending learning which is more output focused resulting in productivity enhancement. As jobs are becoming complex and job roles more specialised, it's the integration of different form of class rooms i.e. on the job, online, on site and on campus which makes the learning impactful and output productive. Technology is overpowering the learning form as well and is witnessing adoption by many organisations. Augmented reality, machine learning and web technology is being widely used for talent development and enhancement. The trend of blended learning is catching up for sure in last few years. There are has been an increment in of 60 per cent in apprentices' addition by the sector and the number of employers doing apprenticeships has more than doubled. The trend which was started by the large enterprises in the sector is now catching up with smaller and medium ones as well due to its success. The growth rate looks impressive but in times to come it will settle to around 35-40 per cent. The potential is huge for the sector to skill people through blended apprenticeship program and create much larger pool of employable candidates. Since some of the skills acquired are traversal in nature, the output could be employed in any related industry and job roles. Hence, apprenticeships can over the concerns of unemployability of the youth of the country and bridge the skill deficit in the industry.

As employers are preparing capabilities through blended learning, retention of talent is a mammoth task for employers. Hence talent engagement becomes an essential part of human capital strategy. Many employers are trying innovative techniques to engage with their workforce by adding value to their livelihood. Sponsoring or subsidising higher education is one such initiative which is catching up. Usually such benefits are offered to the upper cadre of the workforce; apprentices and employees at bottom of the pyramid are devoid of such benefits. Offering higher education connectivity to this segment fulfils their education aspirations and enhances earning power. Offering such benefits enable employers a continuous engagement with their workforce that leads to better business returns.

Role of human capital cannot be ignored when counting the assets, be it at a country level or at an organisational level. The mark of a successful economy is its skilled manpower. Similarly, talent creation, upgradation and retention are essential for any organisation's success. Pharma sector cannot achieve the expected growth if it doesn't invest in building talent. The process of upskilling and reskilling needs to be continuously explored to create a consistent supply chain of talent.

A mixed landscape in 2019

Pushpa Vijayaraghavan, Director, Sathguru Management Consultants, predicts that pharma in 2019 will be a mixed landscape of transformational innovation, value chain shifts and tapered growth with continued pricing pressure

Most regional Indian new year celebrations include a sweet, sour and tangy dish to denote multiple facets of life as we step into another year with optimism and hope. When viewed with a wider strategic lens, the pharma journey in 2018 and what we expect in 2019 couldn't be more poignantly reflective of this reality and how multi-dimensional the evolving dynamic is:

Transformational promise of next-gen healthcare

As a generation, we have the privilege of witnessing the transformation of healthcare into next generation of possibilities. Cost of sequencing being reduced to a fraction of erstwhile levels has opened up wide possibilities for pharma and diagnostic companies as well as healthcare delivery overall, but the true clinical and commercial potential is yet to be realised. 2019 will continue to witness great strides in personalised care - use of genomics and proteomics to deliver therapeutic solutions with higher efficacy though more targeted care for stratified population subgroups. We will continue to revel in the potential of immuno-oncology and other high impact areas of science that now have high level of scientific and investment depth. Finally, we are most excited about the transformative potential of pipeline innovations in gene therapy and gene editing. While 2018 was the landmark year for approvals, 2019 will be the landmark year for market adoption, evolution of more sustainable pricing models, and strengthening of global pipeline in this controversial yet highest potential pursuit within the healthcare domain.

Reality of cost burden and changes in value chain

While we push the boundaries on therapeutic possibilities, we continue to grapple with the burden of healthcare costs across the world. This is resulting in multiple tectonic shifts - a significant reshaping of power across the value chain as well as intensifying pricing pressure across product categories. The generics segment will have continued stress from such pricing pressures and the 'new normal' pricing levels are here to stay. Competition levels of the post-GDUFA regime will continue and will rationalisation is at least couple of years away. Greater emphasis on value-based pricing is expected around the world. Pricing and negotiation power is likely to tilt with re-scripting of the value chain in the most important target markets. Greater integration across stakeholders is expected to continue and the momentum triggered by the active M&A landscape (CVS-Aetna, Cigna-Express Scripts, United Health-Avella, Amazon-Pillpack) is only expected to intensify. Information islands will shrink with such integration across care providing and paying entities paving the way for more optimised healthcare delivery costs but also higher negotiation power in the payor ecosystem.

India Pharma Inc: Looking beyond generics

As the crowned pharmacy of the world, the Indian pharma industry has been reeling under the global pricing pressure, especially in the US, the largest target market by value. Leading generics companies have concentrated portfolio expansion focus on a smaller set of relatively complex formulations. As Indian companies court success in such turbulent times, we expect them to have higher selectivity on portfolio products, deepen appetite for partnerships and prioritise agility in path to market.

Simultaneously, the gradual shift to specialty pharma will further evolve. Several Indian majors have laid the foundation by identifying therapeutic areas for strategic focus (ophthalmology, oncology, dermatology, CNS et al) and are actively scouting for partnership opportunities. We anticipate these diversification investments to get more aggressive in 2019 and be the primary M&A driver for larger Indian pharma companies. 2019 will witness portfolio development for US specialty business and will also have precursor commercial investments to build front end capability to detail products to clinicians. We foresee big ticket M&A activity being limited and opportunistic, and deal landscape shaped largely by portfolio expansion dovetailing growth aspirations.

Other key trends

While the complex generics and specialty strategy is executed in regulated markets, we foresee the same overall mantra of quality over quantity being applied even in the RoW markets. In this segment, we expect geographic consolidation and more intense quest for success in fewer markets. 2019 also holds promise of being the year when Indian formulation exports to China could take centre-stage as the latter has relaxed import duties on several high value oncology formulations.

The domestic market has high promise of growth and chronic segments will continue to the kingpin. Appetite for brand acquisitions will continue to be high and growth will be driven by both organic market expansion and portfolio expansion. As aggregated procurement programs such as the Amrit pharmacies are expanded to support Ayushman Bharat implementation, 2019 could even be the year when a viable solution for healthcare access in the Indian context could emerge and price control could gradually be rendered redundant. The foundation of aggregated procurement model with direct bids from pharma companies could be the most significant change in the domestic turf pushing market boundaries and expanding access to care in a sustainable manner.

Lastly, we expect greater focus on operations rigor, quality, digitisation and data security across pharma companies focused on regulated markets. Business continuity risks associated with regulatory observations are the single largest threat still faced by industry; and significant management attention and investment is anticipated to be guided by the intent to better manage this risk. Health of the industry lies in the operational backbone and preventive focus will take centre-stage."

Knowledge and skills play an important role in the growth and development of the world. And it has been time and again emphasized by our state political leaders also that our children must receive education and must be able to engage with the world.

They say that we are caught in a big situation and its complexities are nowhere near a solution and education is one sector that can enable us to navigate the storm. Nothing else will.

The Honorable Governor Satya Pal Malik recently stated that the youth of the state hold key to Kashmir solution as they are ""very positive, talented and performing well in every field"". Sir, what about the field of education, where a big number is in stagnation with the infamous tag of contractual?

In October 2016, in an open letter by the then Education Minister Naeem Akhtar Saheb to Syed Ali Shah Geelani Saheb, states that the education should be kept out of any discord, not just given the reason from the common sense and the cumulative wisdom of human race but also from the fact of Prophet's (SAW) organizing teaching classes of his Muslim companions in the immediate aftermath of the battle of Badr.

Here, I am also repeating for the readers (especially those who referred to this to support their stand on education, that is, the state administration-past as well as present) that the non-believing Meccan prisoners who could read and write were released just for teaching the Muslims, who would obviously not be teaching them Islam.

Naeem Akhtar Saheb emphasized that education is the one thing that we need for political, economic and social empowerment. Further stating that mankind is yet to invent an alternative to this.

In the context of that letter, my question (to the state administration and the management) is what is the plight of the people who impart the knowledge in the educational institutions of our state?

As we emphasize implementing our Prophet's (SAW) command that seeking knowledge is the duty of every Muslim man and woman. Can we with our continued discrimination and exploitation against this vital human resource face Prophet (SAW) on the day of reckoning? These empowerment institutions also practice the system of injustice, discrimination, and exploitation that too with the torch bearers of the knowledge.

Experts explain that the competitive advantage of the higher education doesn't necessarily lie in the product and services that are offered by the institution, but in the employees of the institution who are managed through the human resource department.

Experts understand Human Resource Management to be the performance of all managerial functions in planning for, recruiting, selecting, developing, utilizing, rewarding as well as maximizing the potential of the human resources in an organization.

This is a specialized management task, which includes two main areas, namely human resource provision that is, acquiring employees and human resource retention that is, keeping employees.

According to the experts, the human resource function of an organization such as higher educational institutions requires constant and proper planning, because the number of personnel cannot be increased and decreased at random.

Further, stating that provisions can be made for changing circumstances by careful planning and consideration. So it must be the proactive management of people. It requires thinking ahead, and planning ways for an institution to better meet the needs of its employees, and for the employees to better meet the needs of the institution.

Higher Educational Institutions needs to recruit quality, competent staff in order to achieve the set goals.

Experts argue that staff recruitment must be seen as a form of business competition that is fiercely competitive, as organizations must compete to identify, attract and employ the most qualified and suitable persons, as this will allow the organization to deliver the best service, just as organizations compete and to develop and manufacture the best product.

The Business Dictionary defines recruitment as the process of identifying and recruiting the best-qualified candidate (from within or outside of an organization) for a job vacancy, in a most timely and cost effective manner.

The effectiveness of the Higher Educational Institutions depends on the effectiveness of the employees. An organization without high-power employees is destined to perform with mediocrity. In the case of Higher Educational Institutions it is very important to take the amount of practical experience (either in terms of research or teaching) that a lecturer needs into consideration, as an experienced person can add a lot of expertise to the mostly theoretical academic environment.

The organization's recruitment policy must reflect the diversity issues. There must be opportunities for the new comers but not at the cost of the old.

In our context, given the rising unemployment, the lack of alternatives and the rampant corruption among other factors, most of the highly qualified and competent candidates end up as contractual lecturers. The employment of fixed-term contract lecturers is a numerically significant part of the labour market in Higher Education.

According to the UK Higher Education Academy (2010), fixed-term contract lecturers (here infamously known as contractual lecturers) add value to the student learning experience as they have added practice-related experience, which is necessary in combining the theoretical with the practical side of the curriculum, and that the fixed-term lecturers are indispensible in the successful running of a complex educational and practice relevant operation.

Fixed-term contract lecturers are often more willing to learn new concepts as they hope that the additional knowledge and skills may give them an advantage when there is any opportunity for a permanent position.

According to an international study conducted by Tuckman during 1970's, many different individuals from various backgrounds are found to be interested in this staffing option at higher educational institutions, because lecturing adds to their professional as well as personal lives.

However, in our context these lecturers often express negative experiences that they are going through at the higher educational institutions, imparting knowledge but lacking in prestige.

Researchers explain that the ongoing trend in higher education institutions is the increasing dependence on fixed-term contract lecturers to lecture.

These lecturers frequently have the same amount of work but without benefits of additional training, encouragement or the sense to develop him-self or her-self. In our context these lecturers are not even considered as employees and at some institutions they are not even provided with suitable work space.

Fixed-term contract lecturers often experience a lack of support from the higher educational institutions that employ them. The management is unable to assist these staff members adequately.

Whereas, the state administration and the institutional management should not overlook the negative effects of their approach and practices because it has a negative influence on the stability of the higher educational institutions and the society at large.

Researchers are of the opinion that, although fixed-term lecturers can be a major asset to the higher educational institutions, this has gone unnoticed by these institutions.

Subsequently, these employees often feel like second-class citizens in the eyes of the administrators and the permanent contract academics.

These lower-paid employees are frequently denied regularity and predictability of employment. This, in turn, impacts negatively on employees with family responsibilities. These employees are often frustrated by the uncollegial and unprofessional treatment displayed towards them by fellow colleagues. The salaries received by these lecturers are much less than those received by their permanent counterparts.

Fixed-term contract staff is faced with limited, time-specific contracts that do not provide the benefit of a long term commitment from the administration and the higher educational institutions. All of these employees would prefer a permanent position, but, as these positions are very limited and they are faced with financial obligations, so these employees are forced to take fixed-term employment contacts.

The higher educational institutions expect a lower research and teaching output from their fixed-term lecturers.

Furthermore, fixed-term academics occupy lowest positions (infact lower than the IV-grade permanent non-teaching employee) regardless of their qualifications, experience and teaching in these institutions.

These lecturers are often vulnerable to exploitation, as they have no guarantees of continued employment, have no benefits, don't have developmental opportunities like permanent contract employees, and most important they possess no voice in the decision-making process that involve them, neither at the administrative level nor at the management level.

At the management level the condition is so worse that the management can't even afford the library facilities to these lecturers as provided to the permanent contract employees.

In some institutions the working hours are different, rigid for fixed-term contract employees whereas flexible for permanent contract employees upto the extent that the biometric attendance at departure is compulsory and specific for fixed-term contract employees only.

Fixed-term contract lecturers are concerned with the job insecurity, level of autonomy that they have, as well as the lack of freedom to make decisions regarding content of the courses, their salaries, lack of benefits, as well as how they are perceived by the students and their peers. Poor communication with the state authorities, authoritarian management structures and an overall indifferent and inefficient management structure has demoralized them.

In this context, fixed-term contract teaching jobs can be portrayed as work characterized by demoralization and demonization of the vital human resource that too even at the highest seat of learning."

Teachers headed for battle with 'undemocratic' VC

The administrative regime is simply following the government's policy of rampant privatisation of public resources. Such a process is anti-democratic in its imagination and punitive in approach.

Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) is now in a new phase of life. Known as 'comply or perish' to us insiders, not a day passes without the administration issuing some circular demanding ""compliance"" from the faculty or students of the university.

Since most of these demands range from the absurd to the counterproductive, like enforcing students and faculty attendance or arbitrarily rescheduling the academic calendar, most do not comply. Often the faculty, after protracted discussions in the general body meetings of the teachers association, resorts to different modes of protesting this compliance enforcement raj. These protests are then promptly followed by threats and punitive action meant to ""discipline"" the 'non-compliant' - much in the fashion of bullies and thugs. These range from petty and vindictive methods - like docking leave and not processing medical papers - to issuing legal instruments like show-cause notices.

Legal threats are usually issued to just a few, perhaps with the aim of frightening the many. More importantly, issuing more than 150 notices at any given time also exposes the well-known fact that most in the university are opposed to the administration and find laughable the constant threat of disciplinary action against those who refuse to cow down. Those not in JNU or any other university in the country do not immediately understand what is being undertaken here.

Some even wonder why the JNU faculty and students seem to continuously be in protest mode. There are two ways of responding to this. Let's begin with the counterfactual.

Why did the university not witness this kind of anti-administration protest prior to February 2016? The answer is simple: because such anti-academic and anti-university measures had never been attempted by the administration prior to 2016. The present VC and his administrative coterie are not simply undoing every functioning structure of JNU, they are vandalising the idea of the university.

Here, the second reason to understand JNU's protests becomes important. The faculty has consistently stated that the changes being made to the university's structure are not only unnecessary, but also in repeated violation of ordinances and the very Act of parliament that created it. The ongoing protests demonstrate the present administration's consummate disregard for democratic procedures and well-established conventions, which is deeply injurious to every aspect of the university.

Why are the demands - be it marking of daily attendance (soon to be biometric) or online entrance examinations, followed by threats and punishments exemplifying the worst kinds of managerial practices?

The answer, once again, is obvious. Privatising a public university requires that its very character be changed completely. JNU was created as a research university in 1970, and has always maintained a very special character. It has provided a very high standard of higher education to students from different regions of India, belonging to any social or economic strata, at minimal cost.

The decades following its creation saw at least two kinds of developments in the university. One was a very high quality of research output, both of the faculty and of young researchers. This also helped in creating many generations of teachers who are presently employed in colleges and universities in India and abroad.

The other was an organic emergence of an extraordinary university culture that synthesised the intellectual and the political - enabling students not only to find their feet as scholars, but also articulate their selfhood as citizens. Students in JNU have historically debated everything from American imperialism, the many failures of the Indian state, to what the university itself ought to be.

The ability to knit this criticality into the very fibre of the university, by creating a space for student engagement in institutional processes (through department level student-faculty committees, or students union representation in boards of study or the Academic Council meetings), is what made JNU a truly democratic university.

The new tightly-managed and privatised university will not have space for any of this. We can already get glimpses of this in numerous such universities that have mushroomed all over the country. At the outset, they have a prohibitive fee structure that will keep out hundreds of brilliant, though poor and marginalised students, for whom higher education will become unaffordable.

Even ordinary middle class families will not be able to afford such an education. Besides, many new private universities have a biometric attendance system in place; they also do not permit any of its members - faculty, students or the non-teaching staff - to form unions. Contract structures are also beginning to reflect how the private is different from the public - at its most worrying, differential pay scales are being put in place - which will eventually create salary-driven divisions between colleagues appointed at the same level. This will also occur between Indians and non-Indian faculty.

The carrot usually dangled in front of the faculty is that they will have the space to create their own courses. For those of us quite used to doing so for decades in a public university like JNU, the stick that accompanies this privilege seems more like a police baton.

Inherent violence in government-led privatisation of public resources

The present administrative regime is simply following the current government's policy of rampant privatisation of public resources. Such a process is perforce managerial and anti-democratic in its imagination. The JNU instance makes clear that compliance enforcement and punitive measures are knitted into its very approach.

The only unexpected element in this is how JNU's university community - its students and faculty - have resisted all attempts at this wanton destruction of a nationally important public institution. They have not succumbed to the management's speak of becoming ""stakeholders""; they know what the stakes are, and continue to fight back as a community of scholars.

The battle for JNU's survival matters not only to those who work or study there - it has grave implications for the intellectual and political future of the country. Public higher education is a democratic right of all Indians. It is precisely for this reason that all who care about India's future, and wish to make it safe from ugly corporatisation or bigoted cultural agendas, must fight for the survival of the public university."

A senior police officer said the incident took place on Saturday afternoon when, following the completion of the written exam, two sub-inspectors were caught by a policeman allegedly clicking pictures inside the examination centre in Wazirabad from their phones.

""They allegedly asked the staff of the biometric company to help them out. After catching them, the policeman raised an alarm. He informed his seniors and they were detained inside the centre for questioning,"" an officer said.

Several rules exist for police personnel on duty at examination centres. ""They have been asked not to carry their phones inside the centre,"" police said.

Police said that after scanning their phones, it came to light that they were sending pictures to someone on WhatsApp. ""The officer concerned informed his seniors at Delhi Police headquarters about the incident. It was decided not to take any legal action, but to ensure strict departmental action against them. A vigilance enquiry was initiated and it was decided that legal action will be taken if allegations against them are substantiated,"" the officer said.

The recruitment cell has already asked all units and district police to send their staff for exam duty. After the completion of the written exam, tentative answer keys will be released online, officials said."

Is it any wonder that Yuval Noah Harari is a popular man?

On 16 December, I was part of a media roundtable for regional language journalists meeting with the Israeli historian and best-selling author (Mint is not going regional. I have learnt from the PR industry that being persistent works miracles). After being published in more than 40 languages across the world, Harari has now been published in Marathi. That evening, Harari delivered the Penguin Annual Lecture in Mumbai.

Knowing that this was to be a relatively intimate gathering, I had a long list of questions; questions that might appear more befitting for an oracle than a historian. ""What is next in surveillance technology?"", ""Will the future be vegan?"", ""Will binary genders cease to exist?"", ""What is the future of beauty, now that it doesn't serve a biological purpose?""

Most of his work is synthesis, Harari clarifies at the outset. ""It's taking very well-known facts and developments and putting them together in a way that makes us see the past, present and future with a new perspective,"" he says. The perspective is key, as readers of his first two books Sapiens and Homo Deus would know (his third book is a safe skip). Harari makes history sexy. He had to. It was a survival tactic. A specialist in medieval history, he was a junior professor at Jerusalem's Hebrew University when a boring course on ""Introduction to History"" came his way because no one else wanted to teach it. He was studying the material two steps ahead of his students -- the beginning of agriculture, the invention of money. Sapiens was born out of the reaction of his students, who made him realize how eager young people were to understand history. ""It is the only way to understand the present and the future,"" the professor says.

Like grasping gender relations, for example. ""The way we understand relationships between men and women today are shaped to some extent by these developments thousands of years ago. If you want to understand why in most human societies even today women have a lower position than men economically, politically and legally... it's not enough just to rely on nature or biology. Historical processes play a major role.

""Probably the greatest political and social revolution of the last century is the feminist revolution,"" he adds. ""It altered the dynamics between men and women which hadn't changed for thousands of years... and the amazing thing about it was that very few people were killed. In contrast, think of how many people were killed during the Russian Revolution or the Partition of India and what those events ultimately changed. The feminist revolution is an example that we can have tremendous change without violence.""

Wheat has cultivated us. More people die of sugar than gunpowder today. The contradiction of oxytocin. The myth of a golden period in history. The ethics of a self-driving car. The importance of human stupidity in shaping history: An exchange with Harari is a thrilling, non-linear ride. It is also mildly frightening: the possibility of religious fanatics modifying human sexuality; totalitarian governments embedding biometric sensors in subjects; the rise of the ""useless class"". The producers of Black Mirror better be paying Harari royalties.

Novelists should love Harari. The most important argument of his first book, and the underlying argument of his other two, is that humans control the world because they can invent fictional stories and believe in them collectively. This helps them cooperate for missions bigger than, say, acquiring bananas. It is not because they are intelligent or rational. Money is the biggest fiction, it is a story everyone believes in -- there are exceptions, like the Andamanese featured on the cover of Lounge this week. ""Also football. How can all the nations gather in Russia to play the World Cup if they don't believe in the collective fiction of football rules?"" he says, flashing a rare smile.

The idea of believing in stories collectively is more important now than ever, cautions Harari. With advanced biotechnology and progress in future reality research, if we do not agree on a single narrative, things are bound to go in any direction. If we don't all agree, for instance, that gene-editing a baby is unethical. ""We are now acquiring abilities to change fundamental aspects of our objective reality that was not possible before,"" he says.

Harari is being generous. In the American linguist Charles F. Hockett's ""design features"" -- a mid-20th century 16-point-guide to what makes human communication unique -- a crucial differentiator is that humans are capable of prevarication. In other words, we can lie and deceive. That's what makes us special. But we could call ourselves storytellers and feel better."

As for the memory, the base model comes with 8GB of 2133MHz LPDDR3 non-removable (onboard) RAM, and up to 16GB if you need more.

Apple's lightest and slimmest notebook ever, Air, finally gets the retina update that Apple users have been waited long for. It was a decade ago when Steve Jobs shocked Apple fans after he pulled out the slimmest laptop out of an envelope on stage. That was the time when Apple fans applauded the Cupertino giant for creating a masterpiece. While the product made a mark in history, fans waited for really long till Apple finally gave this little baby the best update ever -- the Retina display.

A decade on, Apple's products have been receiving revolutionary updates on both fronts -- hardware and software. Every product that now comes out of Apple's kitchen speaks of class, elegant design, and all of them today are completely eco-friendly. The materials used are made from eco-friendly recycled matter that helps reduce the impact on the environment. These include mercury-free displays, arsenic-free display glass, PVC-free materials, 100 per cent recycled aluminium, and a lot more, which even shows in its packaging where the carry bags are also made from 100 per cent recycled paper. Well, the MacBook Air is no different, and all of the above stated is what Apple ensures to see its future as a responsible manufacturer.

The MacBook Air 2018 is now with a Retina display that spans 13.3-inches across the lid. Gone are those ugly border aluminium bezels and the notebook now greets you with an all-glass front which is easier to clean and rich to look at. Yes, no more spending time digging out that lint or dust between the bezels and the display. However, it still does not extend to the edges and we still feel that black borders could have been done away with. Apple has definitely made the entire chassis smaller than the earlier model but has stuck with the same display size.

The Retina display uses an IPS technology that shines 2560x1800 pixels (227ppi) with millions of colours on an aspect ratio of 16:10. No - that lid still does not do a Yoga and you will still be stuck with an angular design of the yesteryears. Reason -- probably the wedge-like design that tapers towards the font, but definitely an angle that is perfect for ergonomic and comfortable viewing. Apple has also brightened up the display, but we still feel it could do more. The display, on its own, is crisp, clear and produces vibrant images. The Retina Display is colour corrected by default and no other Windows-based laptops can compare to the displays used here. Sadly, the Retina Display does not sport True Tone technology, which is seen on the MacBook Pro or the iPad Pro, which would have been a value add-on as this is a portable laptop and will see a lot of ambient lighting conditions when you are constantly on the move.

The design is similar to the older Air, but with an upgrade. It now offers a reduced footprint by 17 per cent and becomes lighter than before -- almost 100g lighter. Sadly, smaller footprint means lesser battery, but Apple has managed to work something better to give you more battery life. The Air measures 1.56cm thick on the rear and tapers to a sweet 0.41cm at the thinnest end up front.

It is 11.97 inches wide and 8.36 inches deep and weighs in at a total 1.25kg, which is probably the lightest portable laptop around, and definitely the lightest notebook from Apple that is on sale today. The design is completely compact and sleek with no removable parts such as flaps or alike, that makes it extremely portable and travel-friendly. The build quality here is rock solid and robust -- you may not find anything as crisp-looking and structured solid out there. You may argue about the HP counterpart, but we have to give it to Apple who started it.

Beneath that eco-friendly recycled aluminium body is an Intel 1.6GHz dual-core i5 processor with 4MB L3 cache that can boost up to a good 3.6GHz when you need it. As for the memory, the base model comes with 8GB of 2133MHz LPDDR3 non-removable (onboard) RAM, and up to 16GB if you need more. Storage options available are 128GB or 256GB SSDs that can be opted for at the time of purchase. Need more, you can pull that up to a maximum 1.5TB in SSD storage.

As for the graphics, there is no discrete GPU here and you will have to make do with Intel's UHD Graphics 617. However, if you want more power on the graphics front, you could always plug in an e-GPU using any of the two Thunderbolt 3 ports that are provided on the left. These two Thunderbolt 3 ports are identical and you can use them for external devices as well as charge the Air through any of them too. They support native DisplayPort output over USB Type-C (up to 5K resolution) to connect HDMI or VGA monitors with a maximum resolution support of 5120x2880 pixels (60Hz) or 4096x2304 pixels (60Hz) with two displays out.

The Thunderbolt 3 ports support up to 40Gbps speeds, which makes it one of the fastest ports for data transfers out there. Sadly, Standard USB ports don't feature here, and you would have to use a dongle to have those ports serving your older USB hardware. Luckily, Type-C to USB/HDMI dongles are available for cheap and you can use them without any issues. We tried a regular Chinese third-party USB Type-C to HDMI/USB 3.0 USB priced at Rs 950 and it worked well. On the connectivity front, you get 802.11ac Wi-Fi networking, but Bluetooth takes a hit with just v4.2 -- we expected Bluetooth 5.0 to take debut here but were disappointed.

The audio area takes a better turn -- the onboard wide stereo speakers are now louder than before (by almost 25 per cent), and have a deeper bass than before. We tried a few movies flicks, games and the audio experience is simply outstanding from the tiny top-facing speakers that are placed aside the keyboard. The audio's performance is at its best when seated right in front of it, but your friends can also feel a similar effect if they are on either side beside you. Thanks to the audio engineering, the audio is clear, crisp and very effective. Note: You may not need a Bluetooth speaker along as these onboard speakers are rich and loud enough to fill up a small room.

Also, thankfully, the 3.5mm audio jack stays put. Microphones onboard get an additional pair -- three in total, which help with better voice capture performance, especially for calls and Siri. The three microphones form an array that can accurately capture voice for FaceTime calls, dictation, and talking to Siri. Speaking about Siri, you can now use hands-free Siri by simply talking to her -- no buttons pressed, nothing needed. However, Sadly, the FaceTime camera is still a 720p, which could have been 1080p or better, given that camera technology is fiercely ahead on their smartphones.

The keyboard gets a facelift from the earlier MacBook models -- it now sports a third-generation butterfly mechanism that is claimed to be better than the previous scissor mechanism seen on other models. The butterfly mechanism was first featured on the MacBook Pro earlier and now caters to the Air too. The new keyboard is a full-sized one and the new keys are meant for better stability, additional response and comfort while typing. The keys are well spaced and have a good travel making for a great typing experience. While most new users will have to get accustomed to the new flat design keys here, Apple MacBook users would find it 'better'. They are definitely soft, have a good tactility, but makes those odd clacking sounds which could be a put off for first-time users.

Nevertheless, once you start using the MacBook Air, you will definitely start loving it in a matter of time. Many would find moving from traditional vertical travel keys, like the ones on the conventional laptop/desktop keyboard, a bit cumbersome. The keyboard also gets an upgrade in terms of backlighting -- unlike other models, each key here is individually backlit with an LED each. This makes for better visibility in the dark and you can control the intensity to your requirement.

The keyboard also has a new member this time -- TouchID. This is a tiny key that is placed in the extreme top-right corner and features a fingerprint sensor (The TouchID sensor). Life is now easier with this addition as you won't need to type in your password each time you flip open that lid -- simply touch and go. The TouchID is very accurate and fast, and we had no chance of complaints here.

Apart from featuring a biometric sensor on their new lineup, Apple now also incorporates an additional hardware security layer -- the T2 chip. This chip ensures that all your fingerprints are locked within a secure enclave itself and resides on the notebook itself. The T2 Chip also makes sure that your laptop's bootloader is not tampered and your data is safe.

The touchpad gets a complete changeover -- as opposed to the older diving board type, this one is a complete Force Touch trackpad. It sports multi-touch gestures, is extremely sensitive and has Apple's Taptic engine below that senses pressure and gives you a feel of a physical clicking button. The trackpad is also larger than before and the combination of touch, Force Touch, and gestures ensures extreme control over the minutest movement on the screen. We still have to find a competing trackpad from any other manufacturer out there.

Lastly, all of the above hardware is powered by Apple's most powerful and latest macOS operating system Mojave, which is the base of the entire experience of what any Mac hardware can offer.

Lastly, the battery life here is a good 12-hour all-day powerhouse, as claimed by Apple. The built-in 50.3-watt Lithium-Polymer battery is said to serve you almost 12 - 13 hours of web surfing and movies and can stay on standby for almost 30 days at its peak.

As for the performance, this little baby wonder can be a workhorse when you want it to. While The MacBook Air is no match for the performance offered by the MacBook Pro in comparison, we are talking about using this notebook whilst on the constant move. We reviewed the 8GB/128GB model and must say that using the little beast was a pleasant experience. It can easily, very easily manage casual to mainstream tasks such as web surfing - that too with multiple tabs opened at once, spreadsheets (online), online movies and alike. However, when you need the Air for heavier tasks such as photo editing, you will feel it immediately that it takes a disliking to you. Yes, the onboard Intel i5 chip is not meant for extreme performance, and with a missing discrete graphics chip, this one can really try your patience at sometimes. You could definitely plug in eGPUs and get the performance upscaled, but at that cost, we would recommend opting for a MacBook Pro over the Air. So if you are looking for heavy graphics-based operations, we would advise you to skip the Air for another version.

Performance scores spewed out by synthetic benchmarking tests give a fair idea that the Air is not meant for power use, and rides behind the MacBook Pro. Novabench scored 462 points on the processor, 210 points on the RAM, 211 points on the GPU (Metal 3D running at 17fps and openCL giving 346Gflops), and 113 points on the SSD. AmorphousDiskMark manages to read at 2.8GB/s and write at 1.7GB/s on the SSD test. CineBench R15 showed an OpenGL score of 16.81fps, and a CPU score of 220cb, and lastly on GeekBench, the Air scored 4239 points and 7771 points in single-core and multi-core performance respectively.

The Air is purely for meant for the traveller who wants to go light, comfortable and needs just basic computing on the move with occasional heavy applications on am emergency basis. The Air is best meant for web surfing, movie binging, social media, and casual stuff where you need a laptop and not a smartphone. And yes, the Air does run hot -- not as hot as to panic, but we did notice the heat buildup when we opened a few too many browser tabs and tried multitasking with a few too many applications in the background. We did notice that the keyboard runs pretty warmer over the top, probably where the processor lies beneath. But, we definitely have something good to say here -- not once did we face a sluggish performance or any place where the applications gave up. The Mojave macOS and its powerful multitasking features with gesture support is a bliss and if you are that guy -- like most journalists need -- who uses a lot of apps and browser tabs to-and-fro for work, you will never regret the purchase. Occasional photo and video editing will work fine, but don't expect too much from it.

The processor, though not a workhorse as you want it to be, is a very efficient power-saving CPU. It actually manages to sip power only when required. Also thanks to the SSDs within, battery life is not wasted as seen on Windows-based laptops. Compared to the 15W previous MacBook Air, this one is a 7W chip and draws less power in comparison, helping you get maximum battery life out of your daily use. In our use, we managed to clock in at least 10 hours in total (best of the two weeks of use), but that is completely subjective to the type of functions.

Overall, the MacBook Air is definitely a good upgrade over the older one but is not a completely revolutionary product for 2018. What looks great on offer can be a hindrance and expense for the other. We must say that while the MacBook Air is definitely something that is highly recommended, a few nicks are what bothers us, at least for now. Most laptops today offer the basic ports such USB Type-A for conventional storage and I/O devices such as mice or printers, but the Air doesn't. Neither does it sport a memory card reader slot, which probably is one of the important I/O for photographers on the move. Additionally, there is no Ethernet port either. Apple does not provide the necessary dongle along, which is a put off as it is an additional expenditure as well as an additional headache to remember to carry it along with you. Probably Apple wants its users to move on ahead of the current time and technology but at the cost of the user himself. Nevertheless, the Apple MacBook Air 2018 is a worthy upgrade to all those holding on to the older generation Air but may make no sense if he or she is a power user. For those who travel a lot and are hunting for an ultra-portable notebook, the Air is definitely the right choice. The MacBook Air 2018 13-inch with Retina display is available for Rs 1,14,900 in India for the 8GB RAM / 128GB SSD variant, while the 8GB RAM / 256GB SSD variant will raise that bar to Rs 1,34,900. The Air is available in Gold, Silver and Space Grey colours. The price may not be as affordable, but the experience and the premium offering is definitely worth it."

According to the police, Sonia Dhawan, her husband and one more person had hatched the conspiracy to blackmail the company's founder, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, over a series of meetings in a Delhi hotel, the name for which was not disclosed. From the hotel room, they allegedly used to direct the fourth accused, Rohit Chomal, on how to make the extortion calls and what to tell Sharma.

Minister of Commerce and Industry and Civil Aviation Suresh Prabhu said that under the new regulatory framework, foreign investors will face less paperwork and get detailed information about the process. Prabhu added that currently global investors and companies are facing difficulties while investing in India. Due to this, the central government is considering a more transparent system to aid the global investment process.

The proposed changes include renaming the 'Institutional Trading Platform' (ITP) to 'Innovators Growth Platform.' The earlier platform ITP, established in 2013 as a place for startups to list, failed to take off because of unfavourable regulations, such as not allowing listing of startups that have raised external funding of $4 Mn (INR 28.5 Cr) or more.

The central government has reportedly sought an opinion from the Ministry of Law and Justice regarding the use of Aadhaar-based eSign services.

The supposition finds resonance in the general discourse in the political economy. The cause, though, is really the consequence of a larger malaise, and that is the big government approach to governance.

Political parties have erroneously come to believe, a la Mao or Mahalanobis, that big government is the cure for ills afflicting the political economy. Ironically, the best articulation of the antidote to big government was in the 2014 manifesto of the BJP, which promised Minimum Government, Maximum Governance.

The first budget of NDA II underlined the commitment ""to the principle of Minimum Government, Maximum Governance"". Mind you, minimum government is less about ministries and ministers and more about simpler, shorter processes. That is yet to be. The angst is not about intent but about implementation. The anger is about what was said and what was not done, what got done and how whatever was done got done. Big government has thwarted change.

The effect is visible across sectors. Consider job creation. The imperative of shifting the workforce from farm to factories, or indeed a more productive livelihood, has run out decades. Yet the political class is invested in an old shibboleth -- that laws, rules and regulations ensure job security.

Among the biggest job creators are micro, small and medium enterprises who produce a chunk of the GDP and deliver dollars. There is much lip empathy for MSMEs, on the ground, little has changed. The tragedy is that MSMEs find mention in political resolutions and are short-changed in economic policies. In a recent work, Manish Sabharwal, along with Sandeep Agarwal, presents the stark reality of ""regulatory cholesterol"" and inspector raj -- MSMEs face 60,472 possible compliances and 3,382 possible filings. Enterprises must also deal with over 40 labour laws.

Multiple layers result in manifold clearances, numerous filings, compounded delays and escalate costs. Yet governments loathe de-layering -- even in the face of evidence of failures in human and economic development.

India moved to 77 from 142 in 2014 among 190 countries in the World Bank's survey on ease of doing business. Reality resides beyond headlines. The first step to job creation is starting a business, wherein India is ranked 137.Notwithstanding the grand reform of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, India slipped from 103 to 108 in resolving insolvency, and despite GST slid from 119 to 121 in paying taxes. It also went down from 154 to 166 in property registration and is placed 163 in enforcing contracts.

Yes, the headline rank delivers optics to woo investors, but job creation requires an easier landscape for the entrepreneur. Ergo the focus on headline rank is part of the problem. The moot point is, has the number of clearances for power projects, factory, hotel or housing projects shrunk substantially? A flow chart of permissions across critical sectors would deliver some insights.

Big government is a big cause of the distress in the farm sector. The genesis of misery lies in the fact that over 50 per cent of Indians depend on less than 14 per cent of the national income. Farm loan waiver has been on every party's election manifesto, in every state election. Every party also agrees that it is not the solution to restore the viability of agriculture. In fact, politicised loan waivers shrink credit and badly designed MSPs worsen viability.

What farming needs is liberalisation -- freedom to enter contracts, leverage supply chain credit and access markets. The idea of a national market for perishables, Amul II, requires localised aggregation of produce and discovery of price. This is best done by e-commerce entrepreneurs who have successfully integrated producers and consumers but have been""governmentalized"".

The gap between articulation of ideas and action is a saga of pendency. Budget 2014 promised a review ""of allocative and operational efficiencies of government expenditure to achieve maximum government"". The Bimal Jalan Committee report is yet not public. Budget 2015-16 announced disinvestment would include ""disinvestment in loss-making units, and some strategic disinvestment"". It is now the Peter borrows to buy PSU to pay Paul scheme (http://bit.ly/27PSUs).

In May 2016, the urban development ministry asked states to ""convert 3,784 census towns into statutory urban local bodies"". It would have generated jobs but is stalled. The 2017 budget promised to revise labour laws into four new codes. The draft code is yet to be implemented. Budget 2017 proposed a model law on contract farming for states. The Niti Aayog draft finalised in May 2018 awaits adoption.

It is true that the onus of propelling change in many sectors rests on states. That ideas could not take off even as the BJP expanded its footprint from six to 21 states is a testimony to the power of rent secured by babudom and politicos. Pro or anti-incumbency rests on a state of expectations. The expectation is that this perch of pelf be dismantled. Big government is the problem, not the solution.
