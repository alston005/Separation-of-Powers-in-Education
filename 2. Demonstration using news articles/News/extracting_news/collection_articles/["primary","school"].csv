The move has drawn flak from opposition parties that said the government should rather work towards improving the ""deteriorating quality of education"".

As per notifications issued on Monday (December 31) by the Directorate of Primary Education and Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB), students of class 1-12 of the government, grant-in-aid and self-financed schools will have to respond to attendance call with 'Jai Hind' or 'Jai Bharat', starting January 1.

The objective of the new practice is to ""foster patriotism among students right from childhood"", the notifications stated.

Defending the move, Gujarat education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama said on Tuesday that the government should be open to accepting ""good suggestions"". ""'Jai Bharat' and 'Jai Hind' are much better than 'Yes Sir'. Saying 'Jai Hind' or 'Jai Bharat' creates a feeling of patriotism, which is why I have decided to make the change,"" he told reporters.

The minister said schools affiliated to the CBSE and other boards have also been asked to follow the new guidelines. ""Even local private schools have said that this is a good decision of the state government,"" he claimed.

Criticising the Gujarat government, state Congress unit president Amit Chavda said the new practice ""will not change the quality of education"" in the government and affiliated schools.

""The BJP government has made several efforts to instill patriotism among school students. Altering a certain practice will not improve the standard of education,"" he said.

Chavda alleged that the quality of primary education is going down in Gujarat. ""The quality is even worse than many other under-developed states,"" he said.

""The standard of primary education in Gujarat has gone down significantly over the last several years. The BJP government engages only in talks and programmes in the name of improving quality,"" the Congress leader alleged.

He asked the Gujarat government to focus on improving school infrastructure, recruiting teachers to fill huge backlog of vacancies and ""not forcing teachers to do non-teaching jobs for the government""."

US Senator Elizabeth Warren (in pic), a liberal firebrand who has taken on Wall Street and traded barbs with Donald Trump, on Monday became the most prominent Democrat to announce a challenge to the Republican president in 2020.

Warren said she had formed an exploratory committee, which will allow her to begin raising money to compete in what is expected to be a crowded Democratic primary field before the November 2020 presidential election.

She said on Twitter she would announce her decision on whether to run early in 2019.

Warren, 69, a senator from Massachusetts since 2013, became one of Trump's fiercest critics during the 2016 presidential race and they have continued to exchange biting insults during his presidency. Trump mockingly refers to her as ""Pocahontas"" because of her claim to Native American ancestry.

Warren has denounced Trump as an ""insecure money grubber"" with a platform of ""racism, sexism and xenophobia,"" while Trump has described the former Harvard Law School professor as ""goofy"" and a ""lowlife"" with ""a nasty mouth.""

On Monday, Warren released a video in which she outlined her vision of a path to opportunity for all Americans and charged that the US middle class was under attack from corporate interests. She later elaborated on the theme in an exchange with reporters outside her Cambridge, Massachusetts, home.

""America's middle class is getting hollowed out and opportunity for too many of our young people is shrinking,"" she said. ""So I'm in this fight all the way. Right now Washington works great for the wealthy and the well connected. It's just not working for anyone else.""

Trump, in a phone interview with Fox News, said he would love to run against Warren and again ridiculed her assertion of Native American ancestry. Asked if he thought Warren really believed she could defeat him, Trump said: ""I don't know, you'd have to ask her psychiatrist.""

The Democratic presidential field could eventually include Senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand, as well as former Vice President Joe Biden. Julian Castro, former President Barack Obama's housing secretary, formed an exploratory committee this month.

Warren welcomed the ""strong and growing group of Democrats"" making arguments similar to those she is making, saying: ""That's how we build a movement. We do it together.""

In searching for a candidate to run against Trump, Democrats will grapple with the tension between the party's establishment and liberal progressive wings that flared during the 2016 nominating primaries between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who ran under the Democratic banner.

A Warren candidacy can expect opposition from Wall Street. In the US Senate, she has been a strong voice on financial issues and a self-described defender of the ordinary American against powerful interests.

Following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, Warren emerged as a leading critic of Wall Street and continues to advocate for stiffer regulation and oversight, including reinstating a rule that would separate banks' retail business from their riskier investment banking activities.

Warren, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, has fought the Trump administration's efforts to weaken post-crisis financial rules, going as far as to attack moderate Democrats who backed a May rewrite of the 2010 Dodd-Frank reform law.

In a September interview marking 10 years since the financial crisis, Warren was asked about breaking up big banks. ""Oh yeah,"" she told the New York Times. ""Give me a chance.""

She also has opposed the administration's efforts to undermine the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency she helped create, and has pressured the Federal Reserve to take a tough line on scandal-hit lender Wells Fargo & Co.

Many of Warren's policy positions have focussed on economic inequality. She recently offered legislation calling on the U.S. government to manufacture generic drugs to reduce their cost. In 2017, she joined other senators in a proposal to extend the federal Medicare health insurance programme for seniors to include everyone.

Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel dismissed her as ""another extreme far-left obstructionist and a total fraud.""

Warren's 80 per cent name recognition does not translate into actual support, University of Virginia professor Larry Sabato said.

""Some Democrats swear by her and love her blunt style, while others are put off by her and fear she'd lose to Trump,"" he said. ""Warren has a lot of convincing to do,"" adding the same is true of many other Democratic contenders. Warren will begin campaigning soon in some of the states with early presidential nominating contests, a person familiar with her plans said.

Trump's use of Pocahontas, a 17th century Native American woman associated with the British colony in Jamestown, Virginia, was aimed at drawing attention to a controversy over her heritage raised during Warren's 2012 Senate race.

Warren in October released a DNA analysis she said supported her assertion that she had Native American lineage.

Trump's reference has drawn criticism from some Native American groups, while others criticised Warren for trying to lay claim to a tribal heritage."

The court made the observation while quashing a criminal case registered against Rajan, teacher of Narayana Lower Primary School, Nallur, Kozhikode, for jabbing on the shoulders of a Class II student.

Allowing the petition filed by the teacher, Justice Raja Vijayaraghavan observed that courts had taken a view that when a student was sent by his parent or guardian to a school, ""the parent or guardian must be deemed to have given an implied consent to the child being under the discipline and control of the school authorities and to the infliction of such reasonable punishment as may be necessary for the purposes of school discipline or for correcting him"".

However, the nature and gravity of the corporal punishment inflicted by a teacher would determine whether he/she could be proceeded under the penal provisions.

""If the teacher, out of unbridled fury, excitement or rage, inflicts injuries which are of such a nature as to cause unreasonable physical suffering or harm to the child, the same cannot be condoned on any ground or on the principle of express or implied consent,"" the court added.

The judge also pointed out that a school teacher, in view of his peculiar position, had the authority to enforce discipline and correct a pupil.

The courts had also taken the view that it could be assumed that when a parent entrusted a child to a teacher, he/she on his/her behalf impliedly consents for the teacher to exercise such authority over the student.

The position of a teacher vis-a-vis a student was peculiar in nature and only when he inflicted such harm which was unreasonable and immoderate that he/she would be liable to be proceeded against in a criminal court.

Studying at school, doing homework back home, playing in the evening and then taking a sound sleep. School days are called the best days of one's life because there is no stress and no responsibility.

As one grows up, the rat race takes a toll on teenager's life. Grim reality of getting a degree from a reputed institute, securing a job and grabbing a great financial package bogs them down. However, this Indian-origin boy has his priorities sorted.

At the age of eight, Arav Ajaykumar who lives in Leicester is already way ahead of his class. The boy is now one of the smartest people in Britain with an Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of 152. He entered MENSA, an international high IQ society which provides a forum for intellectual exchange among its members at a tender age of four.

Since his childhood, Arav had a knack for numbers. By the age of two he could count to thousand and by four he had been accepted into MENSA. Leicester UK reported that Arav, now eight years old has won Gold and title of 'Best In School' in the UK Primary Maths Challenge at Stoneygate school.

Arav and his family moved to UK in 2009. The boy spoke to Times of India and his response is as clever as him. ""I like maths because there is only one right answer."" he said in his northern British accent.

He has inculcated habits that feed his logical mindset. Apart from maths, he liked playing chess and even bike riding if the weather conditions were good. He aspires to be a Chess grand master one day.

While many of us dread mathematics examination, Arav perfects his formulae with practise. 'Practise a lot' he told TOI. Next time you want to beat someone while playing chess, take Arav's advice. ""Understand why your opponent does something"" he further added.

Varsha Ajayjumar, Arav's mother told foreign publication Leicester that he would look for numbers everywhere since he was very young.

While state Education Minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama on Tuesday said the step would ""instill a feeling of patriotism"", the opposition Congress asked the government to improve the ""deteriorating quality of education"".

Criticising the state government, Gujarat Congress unit president Amit Chavda said the new practice will not change the quality of education in state-run and affiliated schools.

According to a notification issued on Monday by the Directorate of Primary Education and Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB), students of class 1-12 of the government, grant-in-aid and self-financed schools will have to respond to the attendance call with 'Jai Hind' or 'Jai Bharat', starting January 1. The objective of the new practice is to ""foster patriotism among students right from childhood"", it said.

Chavda said the BJP government had made several efforts to instill patriotism among school students. ""Altering a certain practice will not improve the standard of education,"" he said.

The Congress leader alleged that the quality of primary education was going down in Gujarat. ""The quality is even worse than many other under-developed states. The standard of primary education in Gujarat has gone down significantly over the last several years. The BJP government only engages in talks and programmes in the name of improving quality,"" he said.

Chavda asked the state government to rather focus on improving school infrastructure, recruiting teachers to fill the huge backlog of vacancies and ""not forcing teachers to do non-teaching jobs for the government"".

Patidar leader Hardik Patel said, ""The children and youth of Gujarat should not be forced to express their patriotism, as that feeling runs in their blood"". He said the government should prioritise improving the ""significantly deteriorated"" quality of education in the state.

""Instead of improving the quality of education, the education minister is talking about teaching patriotism to Gujarat's youth and children. He should know that everybody here is born with the feeling of patriotism,"" Patel said.

""This is an attempt to deflect from the right issues. Schools are getting closed. Shortage of teachers is also an important issue,"" the Patidar leader added.

Even as the BJP and opposition parties engage in a verbal duel over the propriety of the move, students news agency PTI spoke with seemed to have no issues with the new directive.

""The concept (of saying 'Jai Hind' or 'Jai Bharat') is very good. Being an Indian, saying 'Jai Bharat' fills us with a sense of pride for our great country. It reminds me of the glorious history of our country's struggle for Independence,"" a student said.

""We are proud of our country's struggle for freedom. The concept is very good and should be accepted by all the schools in the country,"" said another student of a private school.

Meanwhile, the state education minister said the government should be open to accepting ""good suggestions"". ""Jai Bharat and Jai Hind are much better than 'Yes Sir'. Saying 'Jai Hind' or 'Jai Bharat' creates a feeling of patriotism, which is why I have decided to make the changes,"" he told reporters.

Chudasama said schools affiliated to CBSE and other boards have also been asked to follow the new guidelines. ""Even local private schools have agreed that it is a good decision (of the state government),"" he added."

Working with experimental tumor models, the researchers found that two chemotherapy drugs frequently used for patients, paclitaxel and doxorubicin, induce mammary tumors to release small vesicles called exosomes.

In those cases, the patients are very likely to remain cancer-free for life after surgery. But not all tumors shrink under chemotherapy. If the tumor resists neoadjuvant therapy, there can be a higher risk of developing metastatic disease, meaning that the tumor will recur in other organs, such as bones or lungs. This could be due to cancerous cells that resist chemotherapy and spread to other organs while the primary tumor is being treated.

Under chemotherapy, the exosomes contain the protein annexin-A6, which is not present in the exosomes released from untreated tumors. ""It seems that loading of annexin-A6 into exosomes is significantly enhanced in response to chemotherapy,"" explains Ioanna Keklikoglou, first author of the study.

After being released from a chemotherapy-treated tumor, the exosomes circulate in the blood. Upon reaching the lung, the exosomes release their content, including annexin-A6. This stimulates the lung cells to release another protein, CCL2, which attracts immune cells called monocytes.

This immune reaction can be dangerous, as previous studies have shown that monocytes can facilitate the survival and growth of cancerous cells in the lung, which is one of the initial steps in metastasis. ""In short, our study has identified a new link between chemotherapy and breast cancer metastasis,"" says De Palma.

Corroborating their laboratory data, the researchers found increased levels of annexin-A6 also in the exosomes of breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, De Palma cautions against jumping to conclusions: ""While this observation supports the significance of our findings, at the moment we don't know if annexin-A6 has any pro-metastatic activity in human breast cancer"".

Importantly, the researchers found that neutralizing annexin-A6 or blocking monocytes during chemotherapy prevents the experimental mammary tumors from metastasizing to the lung. These results may help to improve the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. ""Various monocyte inhibitors have been developed for clinical use, so they may be tested in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy to potentially limit unwanted side effects mediated by exosomes,"" says De Palma.

""Our findings must not discourage patients from receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy when it's indicated,"" adds the study's clinical team. ""It remains an essential and potentially curative treatment for many invasive breast cancers, as shown by multiple clinical trials.""

Professor De Palma' lab is part of the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research (ISREC) within the School of Life Sciences at EPFL. ISREC is deeply involved in the Swiss Cancer Center Léman (SCCL), a cancer research consortium that includes the University hospital of Lausanne (CHUV), the Geneva University Hospitals (HUG), the universities of Lausanne (UNIL) and Geneva (UNIGE), and EPFL.

US Senator Elizabeth Warren, a liberal firebrand who has taken on Wall Street and traded barbs with Donald Trump, on Monday became the most prominent Democrat to announce a challenge to the Republican president in 2020.

Warren said she had formed an exploratory committee, which will allow her to begin raising money to compete in what is expected to be a crowded Democratic primary field before the November 2020 presidential election.

She said on Twitter she would announce her decision on whether to run early in 2019.

Warren, 69, a senator from Massachusetts since 2013, became one of Trump's fiercest critics during the 2016 presidential race and they have continued to exchange biting insults during his presidency. Trump mockingly refers to her as ""Pocahontas"" because of her claim to Native American ancestry.

Warren has denounced Trump as an ""insecure money grubber"" with a platform of ""racism, sexism and xenophobia,"" while Trump has described the former Harvard Law School professor as ""goofy"" and a ""lowlife"" with ""a nasty mouth.""

On Monday, Warren released a video in which she outlined her vision of a path to opportunity for all Americans and charged that the US middle class was under attack from corporate interests. She later elaborated on the theme in an exchange with reporters outside her Cambridge, Massachusetts, home.

""America's middle class is getting hollowed out and opportunity for too many of our young people is shrinking,"" she said. ""So I'm in this fight all the way. Right now Washington works great for the wealthy and the well connected. It's just not working for anyone else.""

Trump, in a phone interview with Fox News, said he would love to run against Warren and again ridiculed her assertion of Native American ancestry. Asked if he thought Warren really believed she could defeat him, Trump said: ""I don't know, you'd have to ask her psychiatrist.""

The Democratic presidential field could eventually include Senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand, as well as former Vice President Joe Biden. Julian Castro, former President Barack Obama's housing secretary, formed an exploratory committee this month.

Warren welcomed the ""strong and growing group of Democrats"" making arguments similar to those she is making, saying: ""That's how we build a movement. We do it together.""

In searching for a candidate to run against Trump, Democrats will grapple with the tension between the party's establishment and liberal progressive wings that flared during the 2016 nominating primaries between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who ran under the Democratic banner.

A Warren candidacy can expect opposition from Wall Street. In the US Senate, she has been a strong voice on financial issues and a self-described defender of the ordinary American against powerful interests.

Restricting banks

Following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, Warren emerged as a leading critic of Wall Street and continues to advocate for stiffer regulation and oversight, including reinstating a rule that would separate banks' retail business from their riskier investment banking activities.

Warren, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, has fought the Trump administration's efforts to weaken post-crisis financial rules, going as far as to attack moderate Democrats who backed a May rewrite of the 2010 Dodd-Frank reform law.

In a September interview marking 10 years since the financial crisis, Warren was asked about breaking up big banks. ""Oh yeah,"" she told the New York Times. ""Give me a chance.""

She also has opposed the administration's efforts to undermine the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency she helped create, and has pressured the Federal Reserve to take a tough line on scandal-hit lender Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N).

Many of Warren's policy positions have focused on economic inequality. She recently offered legislation calling on the U.S. government to manufacture generic drugs to reduce their cost. In 2017, she joined other senators in a proposal to extend the federal Medicare health insurance program for seniors to include everyone.

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel dismissed her as ""another extreme far-left obstructionist and a total fraud.""

Warren's 80 percent name recognition does not translate into actual support, University of Virginia professor Larry Sabato said.

""Some Democrats swear by her and love her blunt style, while others are put off by her and fear she'd lose to Trump,"" he said. ""Warren has a lot of convincing to do,"" adding the same is true of many other Democratic contenders.

Warren will begin campaigning soon in some of the states with early presidential nominating contests, a person familiar with her plans said.

Trump's use of Pocahontas, a 17th century Native American woman associated with the British colony in Jamestown, Virginia, was aimed at drawing attention to a controversy over her heritage raised during Warren's 2012 Senate race.

Warren in October released a DNA analysis she said supported her assertion that she had Native American lineage.

Trump's reference has drawn criticism from some Native American groups, while others criticized Warren for trying to lay claim to a tribal heritage.

This is only to instill a sense of patriotism in their minds, yes, the Gujarat government definitely believes so.

That is why they have made it mandatory for students to respond with 'Jai Hind' or 'Jai Bharat' instead of the current 'yes sir' and 'present sir'.

A Government Resolution to this regard was issued in a circular by the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board, and Director, Primary Education and the new roll call comes into effect from January 1st.

According to PTI, the notification makes it clear that students of Class 1-12 in government, grant-in-aid and self-financed schools will have to respond to the attendance call with ""Jai Hind"" or ""Jai Bharat,"" starting January 1.

The objective of the new roll call is to foster ""patriotism among students right from childhood,"" the notification said.

The decision in this regard was taken by Gujarat Education Minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama in a review meeting took place on Monday.

Defending the decision, state Education Minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama told The Indian Express that it was a practice that was already followed in Gujarat decades ago but somewhere down the line, it was forgotten.

Incidentally, Gujarat is not the first state to replace 'Present Sir' with 'Jai Hind'. The first to come up with this idea was Sandeep Joshi, a History teacher at a school in Rajasthan's Jalore District.

In May this year the then Madhya Pradesh government led by Shivraj Singh Chouhan had ordered all school students to reply to attendance roll call with 'Jai Hind, the reason given was the same - to instil a sense of patriotism in them."

The feat comes as another feather in the cap of Bengaluru government schools, where science and maths are no longer dreaded by students, thanks to initiatives like setting up of STEM (science technology engineering mathematics) laboratories in the institutions by NGOs and volunteers.

""I have designed a smokeless train using solar panels. I am experimenting with wind energy to make it faster and more efficient,"" said Ravi Kumar D, a class 7 student from the Hebbal school. The other winners are Mithun from class 6, who came up with a waste management model, and Anil and Vasant Kumar from class 8, whose project was based on wind energy.

""Our students were on a par with their private school counterparts, who have access to good science labs,"" said Umme Salma, science teacher at the government school.

The school has had a science lab for long but it was not used due to shortage of time and logistics. Mobile science labs began visiting the school and teachers started holding classes at a science centre set up on the campus by an NGO. The enhanced quality of education reflected in the numbers -- admissions went up from 425 in 2017 to 535 in 2018.

""When we started mobile science labs for students in government schools, the excitement to learn was palpable. Some of the kids are quick learners. That's what made us set up this centre. Students from 10 nearby government schools can visit the centre, innovate and experiment,"" said Dilip Gowda, head of the science centre set up in the school by Agastya International Foundation.

The foundation runs about eight science centres in government schools in Immadihalli, Electronics City, Yelahanka, Sarjapur Road and Kengeri, among other places.

Ramesh Atloori, son of a construction worker and resident of a 100sq ft tenement in Viveknagar, has two foreign jaunts to his credit. In 2016, he represented a robotics team at Robocup International in Leipzig, Germany, and he visited Japan the next year to take part in the event's 2017 edition. He was accompanied by his schoolmates Aravind Reddy, Ramakrishna and Lawrence Aga, who have a similar background like his. ""It was a dream come true. It was our teacher's motivation which took us to these places,"" said Ramesh.

The quartet was from Seva Bharath Trust Government Telugu Higher Primary School, Viveknagar, and was drawn to robotics during their STEM education classes.

Sridhar P, an IISc graduate, who left his cushy job to train government school students in robotics, has taken students from six government institutions to international competitions. ""STEM labs help in students' overall development, instilling qualities like peer learning, leadership and creativity in them. They give students the confidence that they can make something work. They also connect science and maths to real-world problems. Unconsciously, the students become computer literate too,"" said Sridhar.

""Thanks to the robotics project we started on a pilot basis in Seva Bharath Trust Government Telugu Higher Primary School, students wanted to spend more time in class. They created LEGO robots, a humanoid and what not. Students are bright enough to grasp concepts; it's all about giving them access,"" said Sushmita Ananth from Akshara Foundation.

Vandana P, a teacher from RT Nagar Government School, said that lack of access to labs and rote learning of science with focus on theory make students fear the subject.

This upset her. She knew the importance of easy access to education for a girl child in a rural set-up, where distance would mean a higher dropout rate. That is when this young woman, aged 22, decided to do something about it. When the panchayat polls were announced, she knew this was her chance.

On Sunday, Sheshandeep became the youngest sarpanch in Bathinda district. This made her the second person to be elected as sarpanch from her family as her grandfather, Jarnail Singh, had remained the village head earlier.

Villagers celebrate Sheshandeep Kaur Sidhu's win at her house.

Sheshandeep had enrolled for one-year coaching for the civil services entrance examination in Delhi's after completing BSc (Agriculture) in 2017. Her mother Rupinder Kaur is a teacher while her father Jagsir Singh is a transporter. Her younger brother Swarnjit Singh is a law student.

Speaking to TOI, the bespectacled girl, a red dupatta with motifs covering her head, explained why she had decided to come back to her village and take the plunge into panchayat politics. ""I heard that the government primary school in our village was being shut down due to low enrolment of students. This would have resulted in small kids having to travel to adjoining Raikhana village even to avail primary education. Fighting the election seemed to be the most effective way to save the school.""

'Have high hopes from sarpanch'

As her family members offered sweets to visitors, she listed what else needed to be done in the village. ""The drainage system in our village is so faulty that the sewage keeps flowing into streets. The reverse osmosis (RO) plant in the village is also not working.""

The feisty young woman, who is preparing to crack the civil services examination, knows that the road ahead is not easy. ""I want to learn how to deal with government and other departments to get work done as well as involve the villagers in the decisionmaking proces.""

The villagers have reposed faith in her. She polled 247 votes, whereas her opponent Karamjit Kaur got 136 votes. ""The villagers believed me when I told them that I would set things right,"" said Sheshandeep. Mohinder Singh, aresident of the village, expressed total confidence in her saying, ""We have high hopes from this young woman and expect her to deliver.""

Sheshandeep may be one of the youngest sarpanches in Punjab at 22, but in neighbouring Haryana, Rekha was elected sarpanch of Chapla Mori village in Fatehabad at the age of 21 years and two months."

by Astead W. Herndon and Alexander Burns

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a sharp critic of big banks and unregulated capitalism, entered the 2020 race for president Monday, becoming the first major candidate in what is likely to be a long and crowded primary marked by ideological and generational divisions in a Democratic Party determined to beat President Donald Trump.

The competition for the Democratic nomination is poised to be the most wide open since perhaps 1992: The party has no single leader, no obvious front-runner for 2020, and no broadly unifying ideology as it moves away from a quarter-century of dominance by the Clintons and Barack Obama.

After a midterm election in which many women, liberals, minorities and young Democrats won, the presidential primaries and caucuses next year are likely to be fought over not only who is the right policy match for the party, but also which mix of identities should be reflected in the next nominee. The range of candidates will also force Democratic voters to consider which electoral approach is best suited to defeat Trump, balancing questions of ideological purity with how to appeal to a wide range of demographic groups like white rural voters, suburban women, college students, and black and Latino Democrats in the South and the Sun Belt.

Warren, 69, is among the best-known Democrats seeking to take on Trump, whom she has denounced in the past as ""a thin-skinned racist bully"" and a ""wannabe tyrant."" Trump, who has already announced his re-election campaign, frequently mocks her as ""Pocahontas"" because of her claims to Native American ancestry, a slur Native American groups have denounced as a racist epithet.

While Warren's stinging attacks on Trump and Wall Street have helped make her a favorite of grassroots liberals, she also faces challenges as a presidential candidate: controversy over a DNA test to prove her Native American heritage, skepticism from the party establishment and a lack of experience in a national race.

The editorial board of The Boston Globe, her hometown newspaper, recently urged her not to run for president, saying she had become ""a divisive figure."" And some in her party believe she missed her best chance to run in 2016, when liberal activists urged her to challenge Hillary Clinton.

Two potential top-tier candidates who have run before, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, are eyeing 2020 and are expected to disclose their plans this winter. Yet both men carry political baggage and would be in their late 70s on Election Day 2020, and many Democrats say they want a fresh face as their next nominee.

On Monday Warren called Sanders -- a fellow Senate liberal who is also popular with grassroots activists -- as a courtesy and had a brief, matter-of-fact conversation, according to a Democrat briefed on the call.

More than three dozen Democratic senators, governors, mayors and business leaders are also weighing bids -- most of whom have not sought the White House before. The race is expected to draw several women and nonwhite contenders, making for the most diverse field in history. Several Senate colleagues of Warren's are likely to enter the race soon: Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. A mix of liberal and more moderate politicians are also considering a run, including Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York City mayor, who has said he is prepared to spend well more than $100 million of his own money on the race.

Getting a jump on the competition, Warren plans to head to early voting states in the coming weeks, including Iowa, which holds its first-in-the-nation caucus in early February 2020. According to a person familiar with Warren's thinking, the timing of her announcement had been decided weeks in advance.

In an email to supporters Monday -- 13 months before votes will be cast in Iowa -- Warren said she was forming an exploratory committee, which allows her to raise money and fill staff positions before a formal start of her presidential bid.

On Monday afternoon outside her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, flanked by her husband, Bruce H. Mann, a professor at Harvard Law School, and their golden retriever, Bailey, Warren leaned into her stinging criticisms of wealthy financial interests as she ripped Trump and branded herself as a champion of the middle class.

""The problem we've got right now in Washington is that it works great for those who've got money to buy influence, and I'm fighting against that,"" Warren said. ""And you bet it's going to make a lot of people unhappy. But at the end of the day, I don't go to Washington to work for them.""

In her remarks before a pack of cameras, Warren shrugged at a question about how she had handled the release of her DNA test, reiterating that she had ""put it all out there"" and people could see the information for themselves.

She also took a revealing warning shot at the emerging field of presidential hopefuls. ""I don't think we ought to be running campaigns that are funded by billionaires, whether it goes through super PACs or their own money that they're spending,"" she said. ""Democrats are the party of the people.""

Among grassroots activists eager to highlight their message of a rigged economic system, there was particular excitement that a video released by Warren on Monday focused on issues like income inequality and corporate greed. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee said ""Elizabeth Warren meets the moment,"" and Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for the leftist group Justice Democrats, said Warren's ""message of multiracial populism is exactly the right way to take on Trump's divide-and-conquer agenda.""

In an interview set to air on Fox News on Monday night, Trump addressed Warren's entrance into the race.

""She did very badly in proving that she was of Indian heritage,"" Trump said, according to a partial transcript. ""That didn't work out too well. So, we'll see how she does. I wish her well, I hope she does well, I'd love to run against her.""

A longtime bankruptcy law professor at Harvard who never held public office before 2013, Warren became the first woman elected to the Senate from Massachusetts after defeating a self-styled moderate Republican incumbent, Scott Brown, with a populist message based on advocacy for strict Wall Street regulation.

Warren has both assets and possible drawbacks in a White House run. Strategists for several other likely Democratic candidates say private polling found Warren's political brand -- as a warrior against powerful corporate interests -- to be exceptionally strong with Democratic primary voters. Her signature initiative in recent months has been a sweeping bill to crack down on government corruption, effectively adapting her longtime focus on private-sector greed for the public-sector scandals of the Trump era.

But Warren has also become a favorite target of conservatives, who have sought to label her as an out-of-touch liberal from academia. In 2012, the political director for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said Warren represented a ""threat to free enterprise,"" and this year two Democratic senators -- facing difficult re-election races in states Trump won in 2016 -- took the unusual step of distancing themselves from Warren, their own colleague.

Sue Dvorsky, a former chairwoman of the Iowa Democratic Party, said Monday that it had been a mistake for Warren to spend so much time sparring in personal terms with Trump, and called that a losing path for her or any other presidential candidate.

But Dvorsky also said Warren's announcement video -- particularly her focus on ""how the middle class is being destroyed"" -- would resonate in Iowa.

""She has always done well in Iowa,"" said Dvorsky, who recalled hosting Warren when she campaigned there for Democrats in the 2014 midterm elections. ""She had people eating out of her hand, in tears, because her story is extremely powerful and she is a powerful teller of it.""

A Quinnipiac University poll in mid-December underscored Warren's strengths as a primary candidate, finding her better known, and better liked, by Democrats than any other candidate who had not run for president before. Three in 5 Democrats had a favorable opinion of her, compared with just 12 percent who viewed her unfavorably, a ratio outdone only by Biden and Sanders.

But the same poll pointed to Warren's likely challenges. Voters at large were far more divided in their views of her: Only about 30 percent viewed her favorably, with 37 percent holding an unfavorable view and the rest undecided.

To the extent that Democratic primary voters are inclined to cast their ballots tactically -- in favor of a candidate who appears likeliest to beat Trump -- Warren may have some serious convincing to do. She is regarded with anxiety by much of the Democratic political establishment, including some Senate colleagues who complain that she has pursued an inflexible agenda on matters like bank regulation at the cost of party unity.

During her Senate years, Warren has demonstrated the most influence as a member of the Banking Committee, aggressively questioning leaders of the financial industry about excesses and abuses, seeking accountability for the Great Recession and challenging the Obama and Trump administrations to take tougher lines on regulations and trade policy. In 2015, Warren sank the nomination of Antonio Weiss, the Wall Street banker selected by the Obama administration to serve as the third-ranking official at the Treasury Department, taking on her party on the grounds that Weiss, the former head of investment banking for Lazard, was too closely connected to the financial services industry to serve in public office.

The map of states with early nominating contests appears, at least on the surface, to be an inviting one for Warren: The race begins in Iowa, where Farm Belt populism long defined Democratic politics, before moving to her political backyard of New Hampshire. During the midterm elections, she got a rousing reception in Nevada, an early state that suffered grievously in the 2008 financial crisis, and where rhetoric lashing of Wall Street and major mortgage lenders tends to resonate.

Warren's prospects may also depend, in part, on which Democrats decide to run. Like other white liberals in a historically diverse field, Warren may have to work harder to win over black primary voters. African-American Democrats have played a decisive role in settling the last two open contests for the party's nomination, and Warren is expected to be competing against her party's only two black senators, Harris and Booker.

And several other fiery economic populists could join the Democratic field, including Sanders and Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jeff Merkley of Oregon, potentially splintering the voters most energized by Warren's core themes. Advisers to other top-tier candidates, who were granted anonymity because their campaigns are yet to be announced, said while they were surprised that Warren had announced her candidacy before the new year, it would have no influence on their decisions."

Aiming at bringing positive changes with fresh thinking, several villages of Punjab went for young and educated sarpanches this time. There are a large number of villages where sarpanches in the age group of 30 to 40 years got elected, while in several, people preferred much younger heads who are in their 20s.

Jatinder Singh Laddi (23), probably the youngest of the lot, is a graduate. The newly-elected sarpanch of Nathuwal village in Kapurthal district said that he was elected without poll after a meeting of villagers. ""I want to open a gym for youth to keep them away from all bad things, including drugs,"" said he, adding that there are, however, very few youngsters in the village who are into addiction. ""We have a sewer system, but not capable enough and I want to upgrade it now,"" said he, adding that apart from this there are a few more development works required in the village, including street lights.

Jovanpreet Singh (28) of Hazipur village, a diploma holder in engineering and a farmer by profession, said that his priority is to improve the infrastructure of the government primary school and support the poor students by providing books and other study material. ""Half of our village does not have a sewer system, which I would like to provide during my tenure, besides proper drinking water facility,"" said Jovanpreet who couldn't complete his BTech last year due to an accident.

Inderjit Kaur (29), a 10+2 pass, of Chanthu Brahmana village, said that there is hardly any sewer and water facility. ""Roads are in dilapidated state and there is no street light,"" said she, adding that she will work in this direction and also help poor students in their education. The village in Hoshiarpur district has 600 voters.

In Bolina village 28-year-old Kulwinder Bagha, elected as Sarpanch, is an MTech in construction engineering by qualification. He said that young brigade of his village encouraged him to contest this election. ""I contested against very senior candidates who had remained block samities and village panchyat members several times in the past,"" he said. Kulwinder dreams to keep the youth away from drugs and help those who have already fallen pray to the addiction. He wants to focus on the education of the poor by arranging extra classes for them and upgrading the village school. ""Education can bring prosperity in any field. So I want to focus on it,"" said he. The village has 1,400 houses and out of a total of 1,136 polled votes, he got 366.

In Seechewal village, 27-year-old Tajinder Singh, who got enrolled for his Phd and a gatka (Sikh martial art) player at national level, has become the Sarpanch. ""My dream is to create strong awareness against the drug menace and stop stubble burning. The village, with a population of 2,000, has already got sewer, water, school and college facility,"" said Tajinder, also an MA and MPhil in music (vocal) from Punjabi University, Patiala.

Rachpal Singh (25) of Pandori Khadd village in Hoshiarpur, a 10+2 pass, said that it was his dream to do something for his village.

""My focus will be on overall development of the village,"" said Rachpal who belongs to a Non-resident Indian family. Apart from this Nirvair Singh (25) of Khurda village in Kapurthala is also among the young sarpanches."

This year the school education sector in Punjab certainly saw some ups even as the last quarter of 2018 was marked by two-month-long protests by Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and RMSA teachers from October.

As the contractual teachers protested against the state government's decision to regularise 8,886 teachers, but with pay cut, as many as 2,265 government schools saw a facelift with world-class infrastructure. Also the students of several government schools set unprecedented examples of their IQ level. And last, but not the least, English, the subject, in which maximum number of students fail in the final exams of Punjab School Education Board, is no more dreaded in many government schools now.

The schools were given a facelift under 'Smart School Project' launched by the government. Crores have been spent on attractive clean buildings, smart classrooms, computer rooms, hygienic toilets, playgrounds, drinking water facilities and colourful premises. Government, however, has not spent from its pocket, but motivated individual donors, Non-government Organisations (NGOs), charitable trusts, firms, and Non-resident Indians to financially help the schools.

Even Director General School Education-cum-Project Director Parshant Goyal had written to several NGOs, charitable trusts and firms to contribute towards digital classrooms, laboratories and toilets, provide books in libraries, uniforms to the students, create infrastructure for Midday Meals and sports, install solar power plants and Reverse Osmosis system and any way that the donor or the school deemed fit.

Education Secretary Krishan Kumar confirmed the infrastructure in 2,265 schools have already been improved and by the end of this academic session, a total of 4,250 institutes will be covered. He said some 100 teachers of Punjab are supporting them hugely by motivating people.

""With the contribution of such people and organisations, it will become a sustainable model of community ownership and accountability,"" said he, adding the government will provide support on pedagogy, ways of teaching, resolving specific problems etc. ""It will enhance the performance of the government schools in every possible manner. We will cover all 20,000 government schools in a few years,"" said he.

Several government schools, including government middle schools at Rajgarh village (Ludhiana), Malwa and Nawanshahr, have already started getting applications from people in advance for reservation of seats for their wards for the next session, revealed the education secretary. ""Two government school teachers in Nawanshahr have got admitted their wards,"" said he.

""It is a dream come true for us as we belong to poor families and haven't even thought of having access to facilities like e-content, computer labs and libraries,"" said one Kamljit Kaur of Kishangarh village in Mansa district. Along with the infrastructure, the education standard has also started improving. The students of Government Primary School, Jhangerian, in Nurpur Bedi block of Ropar district, have set an example. Several students of this schools have memorised the names of all 117 Assembly segments, 13 Lok Sabha constituencies, names of several countries with their respective capitals, that of Punjabi and Indian English writers, Indian scientists, Indian festivals, national holidays and neighbouring countries. The Class I children of this school have memorised tables up to 20, while as per syllabus, they need to learn just up to 5.

Education secretary has also uploaded the videos of these children on social media. ""Under Parho Paunjab Project, we have designed several programmes and now our students are speaking in English without any hesitation and several schools have started conducting prayers in English now,"" said District Mentor of English, Chander Shekhar.

Even, a renowned missionary-run convent school, St Francis in Batala (Gurdaspur district) had invited the government school students during a Science and maths fair recently. ""The government school students explained maths and science equations in fluent English to their convent counterparts,"" said Principal of St Francis School, P J Joseph."

Arav Ajaykumar, from Leicester, whose parents moved to the UK in 2009 from Mumbai, also just got a gold award and the top marks in his school for the Primary Mathematics Challenge, a logical reasoning test organised by the Mathematical Association. At the age of two Arav could count to 1,000.

Arav, who was born in the UK, told TOI in a northern British accent: ""I like maths because there is only one right answer. I was shocked when I got the result and then I was really happy. I was pretty nervous when I sat the Mensa test, but I did not find that one difficult, it was quite easy.""

When asked what he did apart from maths, he said: ""I like to play chess and ride my bike if the weather is good. I would like to be a chess grandmaster one day.""

Arav plays in the U9 Leicestershire county chess team

The secret to being good at maths is ""practising a lot"" he said, and the secret to being good at chess is ""understanding why your opponent does something"". The only subject he said he does not excel at at school is sport. ""I like playing cricket. I just don't like football or rugby,"" he said.

His mother, Varsha Ajaykumar, who was raised in Bandra and used to work as a radiologist at the Advanced Radiology Centre in Andheri, said the Primary Maths Challenge is aimed at older kids in years five and six at school. ""He is in year 4 but because he is so advanced the school let him appear for it. We were not expecting him to get the highest score in school,"" she said.

Arav now has one-to-one tuition at his school to make sure he remains stretched.

Outside maths, Arav enjoys normal children's activities like playing video games, watching TV and Bollywood movies and reading. But he also has a penchant for solving puzzles and sums.

Once he had to say exactly where 0.5678 would be on a line in a maths game and he got it exactly correct.

""He has always had a liking for numbers,"" Varsha explained. ""It started when he was 15 to 17 months old. He would keep observing these toys with digits on them. Then he started counting very early. At 17 to 18 months he could count to 20. When he was three he joined pre-school nursery and the other children were learning to count to 10 and he could already count to 1,000. The teacher asked him to read from a book and he could read a whole passage. That was when we realised he was exceptional and we took him to an educational psychologist.""

The psychologist, Dr Peter Congdon in Solihull, who organised Arav's Mensa test, wrote in his report that when Arav was four he had the reading ability of an eight-year-old, the spelling of a seven-year-old and the maths ability of a 10-year old, that his IQ was in a ""very superior range at 99.5 percentile"" and that he was ""of very superior general intelligence"".

Varsha, who moved to the UK from Juhu because her husband, Ajaykumar Maliyakkal, landed a job in the National Health Service as a consultant radiologist, said she had mixed feelings to discover her son was a genius.

""Children like this need constant stimulation. He keeps us on our toes. We don't want him to become a geek. We will always encourage him but never push him,"" she said.

Fortunately, Arav has plenty of friends. ""He is witty and friendly and very humble and empathetic. He does not show off,"" Varsha said.

""We have no clue who he has inherited this from. I don't have anyone good at maths in my family so I have no idea what he can do with it in the future either,"" she added.

""Maybe he will be good at coding and algorithms."""

Warren said she had formed an exploratory committee, which will allow her to begin raising money to compete in what is expected to be a crowded Democratic primary field before the November 2020 presidential election.

She said on Twitter she would announce her decision on whether to run early in 2019.

Warren, 69, a senator from Massachusetts since 2013, became one of Trump's fiercest critics during the 2016 presidential race and they have continued to exchange biting insults during his presidency. Trump mockingly refers to her as ""Pocahontas"" because of her claim to Native American ancestry.

Warren has denounced Trump as an ""insecure money grubber"" with a platform of ""racism, sexism and xenophobia,"" while Trump has described the former Harvard Law School professor as ""goofy"" and a ""lowlife"" with ""a nasty mouth.""

On Monday, Warren released a video in which she outlined her vision of a path to opportunity for all Americans and charged that the U.S. middle class was under attack from corporate interests. She later elaborated on the theme in an exchange with reporters outside her Cambridge, Massachusetts, home.

""America's middle class is getting hollowed out and opportunity for too many of our young people is shrinking,"" she said. ""So I'm in this fight all the way. Right now Washington works great for the wealthy and the well connected. It's just not working for anyone else.""

Trump, in a phone interview with Fox News, said he would love to run against Warren and again ridiculed her assertion of Native American ancestry. Asked if he thought Warren really believed she could defeat him, Trump said: ""I don't know, you'd have to ask her psychiatrist.""

The Democratic presidential field could eventually include Senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand, as well as former Vice President Joe Biden. Julian Castro, former President Barack Obama's housing secretary, formed an exploratory committee this month.

Warren welcomed the ""strong and growing group of Democrats"" making arguments similar to those she is making, saying: ""That's how we build a movement. We do it together.""

In searching for a candidate to run against Trump, Democrats will grapple with the tension between the party's establishment and liberal progressive wings that flared during the 2016 nominating primaries between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who ran under the Democratic banner.

A Warren candidacy can expect opposition from Wall Street. In the U.S. Senate, she has been a strong voice on financial issues and a self-described defender of the ordinary American against powerful interests.

RESTRICTING BANKS

Following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, Warren emerged as a leading critic of Wall Street and continues to advocate for stiffer regulation and oversight, including reinstating a rule that would separate banks' retail business from their riskier investment banking activities.

Warren, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, has fought the Trump administration's efforts to weaken post-crisis financial rules, going as far as to attack moderate Democrats who backed a May rewrite of the 2010 Dodd-Frank reform law.

In a September interview marking 10 years since the financial crisis, Warren was asked about breaking up big banks. ""Oh yeah,"" she told the New York Times. ""Give me a chance.""

She also has opposed the administration's efforts to undermine the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency she helped create, and has pressured the Federal Reserve to take a tough line on scandal-hit lender Wells Fargo & Co <WFC.N>.

Many of Warren's policy positions have focussed on economic inequality. She recently offered legislation calling on the U.S. government to manufacture generic drugs to reduce their cost. In 2017, she joined other senators in a proposal to extend the federal Medicare health insurance programme for seniors to include everyone.

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel dismissed her as ""another extreme far-left obstructionist and a total fraud.""

Warren's 80 percent name recognition does not translate into actual support, University of Virginia professor Larry Sabato said.

""Some Democrats swear by her and love her blunt style, while others are put off by her and fear she'd lose to Trump,"" he said. ""Warren has a lot of convincing to do,"" adding the same is true of many other Democratic contenders.

Warren will begin campaigning soon in some of the states with early presidential nominating contests, a person familiar with her plans said.

Trump's use of Pocahontas, a 17th century Native American woman associated with the British colony in Jamestown, Virginia, was aimed at drawing attention to a controversy over her heritage raised during Warren's 2012 Senate race.

Warren in October released a DNA analysis she said supported her assertion that she had Native American lineage.

Trump's reference has drawn criticism from some Native American groups, while others criticized Warren for trying to lay claim to a tribal heritage.

This came about after an in-house study by the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee (SCLSC), that concluded that poor litigants on death row or facing harsh punishments are getting a raw deal on account of poverty.

While this mechanism could take time to set in, two recent judgments by the apex court, both given in early December, did factor the poor socio-economic condition of prisoners while commuting their capital punishment to life term. One such case was death row convict Antony alias Antappan who wiped out six members of a family in Kerala in 2001. The other was Rajendra Wasnaik from Maharashtra, who brutally raped and murdered a three-year-old in 2007.

Quoting from the report prepared by the SCLSC in its judgment, a bench of justices Madan B Lokur (since retired), S Abdul Nazeer and Deepak Gupta said, ""The poor are more often than not at the receiving end in access to justice and access to remedies available, as is evident from a fairly recent report prepared by the SCLSC which acknowledges, through Project Sahyog, enormous delays in attending to cases of the poor and the needy.""

For 2019, the judges resolved, ""Quality legal aid to the disadvantaged and weaker sections of society is an area that requires great and urgent attention, and we hope that a vigorous beginning is made in this direction in the new year.""

For impoverished prisoners in the country, the court's judgment must come as welcome relief. Statistics compiled by the National Law University, Delhi, in its Death Penalty India Report based on interviews with 373 death row prisoners across the country, found out that three-fourths of these prisoners (numbering approximately 274) were economically vulnerable, with most of them being the sole or primary earners in their families. Even educationally, almost 225 prisoners didn't complete secondary schooling, while 84 never went to school at all. As trials in their cases progressed, they were forced to borrow loans or sell valuable assets in order to engage lawyers. By the time their appeals reached the high courts or the Supreme Court, they were financially drained and relied on anything the court gave by way of free legal aid.

It is this legal aid that the Supreme Court has targeted to improve in the new year as part of a systemic reform in the criminal justice delivery system. Judges were cautious to add that consideration of convicts' socio-economic condition does not mean disproving his/her guilt, but to help in awarding an appropriate sentence.

Article 39A of the Constitution promises free legal aid to all citizens. But 'Project Sahyog', a pilot venture of the SCLSC, upon analysis of 1,188 cases relating to poor convicts pending in the Supreme Court, found that in about 48 cases, the convict's appeal couldn't be listed for more than a decade for want of legal aid. Similarly, about 165 cases are pending since 2006 on account of the convict's failure to get legal aid. Of these, 776 were criminal cases and 412 civil matters."

Excelsior Sports Correspondent

JAMMU, Dec 31: Former Minister and Congress leader Sh Sham Lal Sharma said that schools should focus on moral values rather than mere education to the students.

The former Minister was speaking in the Annual Day function of Chander Bhaga High School, Akhnoor as a chief guest.

The function started with the lamp lighting by chief guest Sham Lal Sharma (Former Minister), guest of honour Gopal Singh (S.D.M Akhnoor), special guests Nazneen Akhtar (Z.E.O Akhnoor), Kuldeep Kumar Badyal (Principal GHSS), Dr. Swaran Singh Chib (District Youth Services and Sport Officer, Reasi), Sher Singh (Ex. Z.P.E.O Akhnoor) and from the Management of School, Raman Gupta and Aradhana Mahajan.

Sharma in his speech strongly advocated for change in the present educational set up and suggested to introduce moral education subject in every school from primary level. He said parents and teachers have also greater role to play in this direction and they must instil the moral ethics and rich ethos of Indian culture in the students so that they become good citizens and contribute for the welfare of the society and nation. He said on the eve of New Year ""we all should take a pledge to save the Girl Child and raise our voice against the crimes against the females and to contribute for a healthy and prosperous society"".

He asked teachers that while nurturing the students to achieve new highs in science, technology and modern studies, equal attention is paid to outdoor activities like sports, travel, etc which enables physical and mental development of the child."

They got together, cleaned and repainted the school, and also installed new green boards in the classrooms.

Speaking about the initiative, V Kamalesh, 24, who studied in the school from 1999 to 2003, said they had formed a volunteer forum called 'Young Heartz' through which they do philanthropic activities every New Year. ""This year, we decided to help our school. About 25 old students from various batches got together and started collecting funds for the cause,"" he said.

The alumni members shared their initiative on social media platforms, which helped them connect with more old classmates. Eventually, they were able to collect about Rs 70,000, said Kamalesh.

The youngsters started the work on December 23 and completed it on Monday, said M Gopinath, 24, another alumni member.

Their main motive, the youngsters said, was to improve the student enrolment. ""While we were students, the school, which had Classes I to V, had two sections in each class. Now there is only one section and the strength has come down. We want to improve the situation,"" said Kamalesh.

Headmistress C Rajam said the school now has 121 students in five classes. ""The numbers have fallen by 50 to 60 after 2001, as this is a Tamil medium school and people are after English medium schools. But our school has a trackrecord of inculcating values along with education,"" she said.

Close on the heels of a fresh impetus for the Hello English programme to improve students' proficiency in the language, the Samagra Shiksha, Thiruvananthapuram, is set to roll out Surili Hindi, a project for improving Hindi learning, in all upper primary schools in the district from January.

Part of a Statewide initiative, the programme recently saw Samagra trainers guide teachers of one school in each block resource centre to implement the programme. Preparation of teaching-learning material for all upper primary schools in the block for supporting the study of the Surili Hindi module was held on Saturday and Sunday under the leadership of work education specialists.

On January 4 and 5, Hindi teachers of all upper primary schools in a block will come together in one school for a two-day try-out of the learning material. As part of the try-out, Samagra Shiksha trainers will use the teaching-learning material developed to teach Hindi to Class 6 students. The Hindi teachers will understand how to use the learning material, observe the children's response to it, and how they benefit from it.

On its basis, the teaching-learning material will be handed over the Hindi teachers of the schools in the block concerned so that they can implement it in their own schools. The module, in book form for Classes 6 and 7, and a CD with songs and videos will be handed over, B. Sreekumaran, District Project Officer, said.

The teachers will start using the teaching-learning material, module, and the CD to make learning of Hindi simpler for Class 6 students of their schools before January 20. They will be assisted by BRC trainers, if needed, to expand Surili Hindi to all schools by the month-end.

Here is a selection of five stories, each covering one of our focus areas, that made an impact in 2018 and hold out hope for India's future.

As the country braces for the 2019 general elections, the impact of good governance, or the lack of it, will be under the spotlight. We aim to increase our coverage of governance issues, and welcome your suggestions and feedback.

Climate Change

Challenge: Climate change can lower the standard of living of nearly half of India's population by 2050, the World Bank warned in a June 2018 study. Particularly vulnerable are farmers who are dependent on rainfall for a good harvest, especially in regions such as Karnataka that are prone to drought. In the 15 years to 2015, only three years -- 2005, 2007 and 2010 -- witnessed no drought, as per a 2017 assessment report by the Karnataka State Disaster Management Monitoring Centre. In 2018, 77 percent of the 30 districts were declared drought-hit, The Times of India reported on 14 September, 2018.

Action: A farmer couple, Shyamrao and Laximibai Patil, in water-scarce Kalaburagi in north Karnataka, have shown that a combination of state and NGO support, supported by grassroots innovation, can help farmers combat the effects of climate change.

The Patils practice organic farming, run a dairy and poultry farm, and are helping their fellow farmers experiment with new methods.

The couple have set up their own self-help group to sell produce such as pulses. From their mixed-crop farming and livestock produce, they make an annual income of Rs 5 lakh and a profit of around Rs 2.5 lakh, at a time when 70% of the country's agricultural households spend more than they earn on average every month.

Gender Parity

Challenge: In 2017, nearly 50,000 women died at the hands of intimate partners or family members, making ""home, the most dangerous place for women"", according to a November 2018 study by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.

India is perceived as having the worst record on sexual violence, harassment from cultural and traditional practices and human trafficking, and is considered the least safe country in the world for women, according to a Thomson Reuters Foundation poll, as IndiaSpend reported on 26 June 2018. Only 14 percent of Indian women who have experienced physical or sexual violence have sought help to stop the violence while 77 percent have neither sought help nor told anyone about the violence they experienced, according to the National Family Health Survey (2015-16).

Action: In Mumbai, health advocacy Centre for Enquiry into Health and Allied Themes has since 2001 been running support centres called Dilaasa, which are funded by the National Health Mission, to identify victims of domestic and sexual violence.

Using a model of care that can be replicated across government health centres nationwide, Dilaasa centres have provided help to more than 8,000 women.

Over the two years to 2018, Mumbai's 11 centres identified 5,647 women as potential victims of domestic violence. They got 2,554 cases registered for domestic violence and 809 cases for sexual violence, according to municipal records. Sikkim, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Assam and Uttar Pradesh are replicating and activating this model.

Health

Challenge: India has 46.6 million stunted children and is home to 31% of all stunted children under five--the highest in the world--according to the 2018 Global Nutrition Report, IndiaSpendreported on December 10, 2018.

Nearly 20% of Indian children under five are wasted (have low weight for their height) and 7% severely wasted, according to data from the National Family Health Survey of 2015-16.

The Society for Nutrition, Education and Health Action (SNEHA), an NGO in Mumbai's Dharavi, the third largest slum in Asia by population, is helping reduce the prevalence of child malnutrition by plugging nutrition awareness gaps and supporting local health workers.

Action: SNEHA's efforts have reduced wasting among children aged up to three by 23% and produced a 109% increase in the services received by children through the Integrated Child Development Services Scheme, a government programme covering health, food and primary education. It plugs gaps in nutrition-related knowledge in the community by training community volunteers, who spread awareness and inform anganwadi (daycare) workers about the status of pregnant women and families who are finding it difficult to feed a newborn.

Education

Challenge: India has been successful in increasing primary school enrolment to the extent that more than 83% of primary school-age children were enrolled in 2016-17, according to data from the District Information System for Education (DISE). But fewer than half (47.8%) of grade V rural students could read at least a grade II text in 2016, the Annual Survey of Education Report 2016 found.

Action: World Vision, a non-profit, runs a remedial education programme, Aparajitha, for 4,300 students in government schools in 130 villages in Lalitpur district in Uttar Pradesh. From a zero baseline, within a year 1.55% of enrolled students could read local content (such as newspapers) and understand it; 6.2% (up from 1.8%) could read a story and comprehend it; and 10.4% could read a story (up from 5.1%). World Vision expects to complete the project by 2020 and empower the community to take over.

Disaster Relief and Rehabilitation

Challenge: In the two decades to 2017, India suffered a $79.5 billion loss, ranking among the top five countries in the world to be affected by climate-related disasters, The Wire reported on October 11, 2018. India is taking baby steps towards disaster preparedness, the lack of which is becoming obvious in the wake of climate change-related extreme weather events. Only 7% of the 4,862 dams in the country have emergency action plans, a 2017 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India said, the Hindustan Times reported on September 3, 2018. Often, the armed forces are summoned to undertake rescue operations, such as during the recent Kerala floods in August 2018, despite the constitution of the National Disaster Response Force in 2006.

The Kerala floods affected an estimated 5 million people's lives and damaged infrastructure to the extent that the state needs nearly Rs 30,000 crore to rebuild.

Action: The Kerala state electricity board's quick response under Mission Reconnect restored electricity to nearly 2.5 million homes in less than two weeks. Kerala is one of the 15 states in India that have 100% household electrification, the Hindustan Times reported on November 28, 2018. It managed the task by improving coordination through a state-level task force and an army of volunteers comprising retired staff, students and private electricity personnel.

States in turn are to reimburse a certain amount of money for every RTE admission.

However, it turns out that the Maharashtra government is looking around for ways to not pay these schools the money it owes them.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Maharashtra, led by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, can claim credit for many successes, especially with the irrigation project Jalyukt Shivar and an impressive infrastructure upgrade topping the list. However, its record on one front has been abysmal, i.e., in fulfilling its responsibility under the Right to Education (RTE) Act.

According to Section 12 of the RTE, non-minority unaided private schools are required to reserve 25 per cent of the seats in entry-level classes (either primary level or Class 1) for students belonging to disadvantaged groups (DGs) [Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), etc] and economically weaker sections (EWS) [income less than a certain amount]. The state in return is supposed to pay these schools, for every RTE admission, an amount fixed by the government or the tuition fee of a school, whichever is less. Maharashtra has fixed an amount of Rs 17,000 a year for RTE students.

But it goes to great lengths to avoid reimbursing this amount to schools. Though the schools have been reserving seats under RTE since 2012, the government tried to get out of its commitment by simply agreeing to pay dues for only one academic year. Then, there was disagreement over the actual amount due and how it should be calculated. The government said it owed Rs 300 crore while the schools said the amount was more than 1,000 crore.

This mismatch in estimates came about because the government wanted to pay only for fresh RTE admissions while the schools were asking to be compensated for all RTE admissions (new and repeat/old students - explained in detail here).

Even to date, the dues of past academic years have not been fully released to all the private schools. Now, the Maharashtra government has come up with a new plan to avoid paying the money it owes to these institutions. In a government resolution released recently, it has modified the norms for RTE reimbursement stating that ""if a private school is using any government land and benefiting from the same then the school would not receive reimbursement for students who have been admitted in 25 per cent RTE quota,"" Mumbai Mirror reported.

Through this order, the government has effectively imposed a retrospective binding of sorts in an agreement that is in force for years and it has done so in a one-sided manner. This is a textbook definition of ""breach of contract"". When the government leased out land, it didn't impose a condition that schools will have to reserve 25 per cent seats for EWS/DG category students. Nor does the RTE Act mandate that those schools that have received land from the government at concessional rates will not be compensated for fulfilling the RTE quota. Hence, both from the RTE Act and the leasing agreement, the government's action is prima facie illegal. Less said about the ethical aspect of its action, the better.

Independent English Schools Association (IESA) secretary Rajendra Singh told Swarajya that ""the government's action is not just illogical but outright illegal. The RTE and land leasing are two separate contracts. In any case, under the RTE Act, the government gives reimbursement for only tuition fees and not for infrastructure costs the school has to bear. Land comes under the latter category. How can the two be clubbed? If the government was paying per student reimbursement for infrastructure costs also, then they had a case. In such a scenario, they could have deducted this from total reimbursement, but how can they not reimburse the tuition fees?""

Singh further explained that the government simply ""doesn't have the data to ascertain how many schools have the land leasing agreement with the government. Nor it has the manpower to determine this number. It will take anywhere between one to two years to collect the data. This is nothing but their latest attempt to delay payments to private schools."""

Dozens of police officers in Aligarh have offered to ""adopt"" cattle after facing protests against the menace of stray animals, reported The Times of India. Forty-one personnel will keep one animal each - mainly unproductive cows and calves - at their homes from January 1. District Magistrate CB Singh has also planned to urge around 15,000 administrative staff to follow suit to ""contribute to a social cause"".

""Every adverse law and order situation is to be faced by us, so we should be the ones taking the initiative in resolving the problems that ail the society,"" Senior Superintendent of Police AK Sahni told The Times of India. Sahni will keep the cattle ""forever"", while the other 40 officials will participate in the initiative till all government cow shelters become operational, he said.

The police personnel made the decision days after farmers locked up cattle on the premises of a government school and a primary healthcare centre, claiming that they damaged their crops.

The proposal came up during a meeting of district police officials called by Sahni. The 40 officials apart from Sahni who volunteered comprised four additional superintendents, nine circle officers and 27 officials in charge of police stations. Superintendent of Police (City) Ashutosh Dwivedi said he had no space to keep an animal at his house, so he will bear the expenses of its upkeep instead.

Dwivedi said the initiative would motivate people not to abandon their unproductive animals, which end up destroying crops and are a nuisance in the streets."

Simon Taufel is speculating in a hotel room near Newcastle, Australia, reminiscing about his career with Betway Insider's Tom Clee.

Having played the important role of an ICC umpire for a long span of time, with constant supervision over 74 Tests, 174 ODIs and 34 T20 internationals, Taufel was completely aware of the journey full of ups and downs.

But watching his daughter participate in an Under-12s regional tournament, filled his heart with euphoria. However, he was a semi-retired man now.

""When I pulled the pin on my international career,"" he says, ""I sort of thought that I'd lost a lot of my two boys growing up, and I didn't want to lose my daughter.""

Taufel had just touched 29 on the age bar when he played an umpire for the first time in his life in December 2000 in the match between his native Australia and West Indies. It was a moment of utmost pride.

He figures that during the entire duration of 13-and-a half years, 60-70 days on an average just flew by in fulfilling his duties as a devoted umpire and another 3 days away for every one that he was on the field.

On a whole, he remained detached from his family for more than five long years!

""It's not easy and it's not for everyone,"" he admits.

Taufel was about to begin University in June 1990. He had no intention of becoming an umpire until his friend insisted upon joining him in the umpire's course. He still looked at it only as an opportunity to earn some extra bucks!

As luck would have it, his pal Dave was unable to pass the test with the required percentage of 85 and Taufel, on the other hand, came out with flying colours.

""If anything, I was always probably a little guilty of over-preparing,"" he says. ""I'm a bit of a check-list freak.""

He was quickly progressing and before he knew it, his level of achievement highlighted the word 'International'. This clearly meant that he had to revise and summarise six diverse laws each day in order to incorporate the entire rulebook into his brain, every two weeks.

His retention power was at its peak. He did everything to polish his skills and increase his knowledge and thus observed with keen attention: bowlers, batsmen and previous series, way before being assigned any particular work. He even made it a point to grace net sessions with his presence and watch the teams prepare!

Previous tour notes would be his reference guide and he even kept himself updated about local airports and alternative hotels, just in case! This scenario is before the beginning of cricket.

""I think I probably went further than most, simply because I wouldn't describe myself as a natural umpire,"" he says.

""I had to work harder at my game to feel that I was ready and that I deserved to have a good day out there, rather than just turn up and it be OK.""

His winning the ICC David Shepherd Umpire of the Year award for 5 years consecutively came as no surprise because his hard work and sheer dedication were definitely commendable.

However, he kept no awards to himself, except for one, and gave it all away to the people whom he believed to be his pillars of strength throughout his journey.

""I did feel embarrassed and uncomfortable with those awards,"" he says, ""because umpiring is a team sport and we were singling out one person.""

Talking to Taufel, it became evident that the importance of teamwork between umpires is quite fundamental.

After his retiral from cricket in 2012, he upgraded to the position of ICC Umpire Performance and Training Manager, where he commanded the development and implementation of additional resources to assist those on the field and television booth, not to forget the stationing of umpire coaches to all the international level matches.

""If I did my career again, I would probably want to talk more about my mistakes,"" he says.

""To share my shortcomings more with my colleagues after a day's play, rather than keep them to myself and deal with them on my own in my hotel room.""

Introducing the DRS was definitely an assisting tool to review the decisions taken by on-field umpires, but Taufel, who had sailed through without its aid for 9 years, 4 years with its support did not make much of a difference to him. It did not change the dimensions of the game, in his perspective.

""I don't think DRS has necessarily made umpiring easier or more difficult,"" he says. ""It's just made it different.""

""Pre-DRS, you'd deal with the error later. With DRS, you've got to deal with it at the time.

""You hear your decision dissected in your earpiece, in front of millions of people, and then, after 90 seconds, two minutes, you have to publicly change your decision and somehow regather your thoughts.

""You can feel a bit embarrassed and humiliated. It's really tough to move on and focus on that next delivery.""

Technology is pretty influential. It not only affects the decision-making process but also toys with the behaviour of a player. A clear example is Australian batsman, Cameron Bancroft, who in March this year, was caught altering the condition of a ball using sandpaper in a Test match in South Africa.

""The third umpire, quite easily, has got the toughest job out of the whole umpiring team,"" explains Taufel.

""Their job is to watch the TV as their primary focus. There should be nothing that goes out to people in their lounge rooms but is missed by the third umpire.""

But, as this incident - which led to Bancroft, his captain Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner all being banned - proved, situations can be deceptive.

""I think it's fair to say that nobody would have expected what happened in Cape Town to unfold before our eyes as it did.

""As much as you try to simulate different scenarios in a training environment, sometimes there are things that you just think: 'Wow, is this really happening?'""

Taufel was in charge of the Australian team, officiating umpire selection and match referee management, at that time, and felt empathetic towards the officials put in that tight spot.

""The game of cricket is now more commercialised. It's a different type of animal at Test and international level.""

""There are a lot of people who cross their limits to try to mould the results their way.

""I've got no problem with players playing the game hard, no problem at all,"" says Taufel, who captained his first XI at secondary school before going on to play for New South Wales Schoolboys Under-19s alongside Adam Gilchrist and Michael Slater.

He laughs. ""I played the game pretty hard. I appealed for just about everything I could. I don't think I ever got into trouble with the umpires, but I do remember getting a bit of a bollocking from my coach for swearing on the field.

""For me, behaviour is a captain, a coach and a team issue. At the moment, people seem to abrogate that responsibility of managing player behaviour through code of conduct or umpires.""

Yet Taufel believes that the scene could change the entire game around! Nevertheless, he can proudly say that he was the only umpire who had ever been invited to give the MCC Spirit Of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture.

""I hold the spirit of cricket close to my heart. Results come and go, but who we are and how we play really defines us.

""We are guardians of the game of cricket. We have to leave it in good condition for the next generation.

""The only way that we can do that is through adherence to the laws and to the spirit of that game.""

This is where Taufel believes that players and coaches can learn from umpires.

""You can't change what's already happened, it's part of history now.""

""But, like a cricket umpire who can't change the ball that's already gone, you can certainly do your best to get the next decision right,"" he says.

""That's what I would say to Australian cricket and that's what I would say to the global game: learn from what's happened and use the opportunity to make the game stronger than it's ever been before.

""That's something that everyone can look at. Not just one country or one player or one captain, it's up to everyone to play their role."""

Over the course of 10 months, IGR has highlighted successful initiatives on issues including health, gender parity, climate change, education, and Kerala's post-flood rehabilitation. Here is a selection of five stories, each covering one of our focus areas, that made an impact in 2018 and hold out hope for India's future.

As the country braces for the 2019 general elections, the impact of good governance, or the lack of it, will be under the spotlight. We aim to increase our coverage of governance issues, and welcome your suggestions and feedback.

Climate Change

Challenge: Climate change can lower the standard of living of nearly half of India's population by 2050, the World Bank warned in a June 2018 study. Particularly vulnerable are farmers who are dependent on rainfall for a good harvest, especially in regions such as Karnataka that are prone to drought. In the 15 years to 2015, only three years--2005, 2007 and 2010--witnessed no drought, as per a 2017 assessment report by the Karnataka State Disaster Management Monitoring Centre. In 2018, 77% of the 30 districts were declared drought-hit, The Times of India reported on September 14, 2018.

Action: A farmer couple, Shyamrao and Laximibai Patil, in water-scarce Kalaburagi in north Karnataka, have shown that a combination of state and NGO support, supported by grassroots innovation, can help farmers combat the effects of climate change. The Patils practice organic farming, run a dairy and poultry farm, and are helping their fellow farmers experiment with new methods.

The couple have set up their own self-help group to sell produce such as pulses. From their mixed-crop farming and livestock produce, they make an annual income of Rs 5 lakh and a profit of around Rs 2.5 lakh, at a time when 70% of the country's agricultural households

spend more than they earn on average every month.

Gender parity

Challenge: In 2017, nearly 50,000 women died at the hands of intimate partners or family members, making ""home, the most dangerous place for women"", according to a November 2018 study by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.

India is perceived as having the worst record on sexual violence, harassment from cultural and traditional practices and human trafficking, and is considered the least safe country in the world for women, according to a Thomson Reuters Foundation poll, as

IndiaSpend reported on June 26, 2018. Only 14% of Indian women who have experienced physical or sexual violence have sought help to stop the violence while 77% have neither sought help nor told anyone about the violence they experienced, according to the National Family Health Survey (2015-16).

Action: In Mumbai, health advocacy Centre for Enquiry into Health and Allied Themes has since 2001 been running support centres called Dilaasa, which are funded by the National Health Mission, to identify victims of domestic and sexual violence. Using a model of care that can be replicated across government health centres nationwide, Dilaasa centres have provided help to more than 8,000 women.

Over the two years to 2018, Mumbai's 11 centres identified 5,647 women as potential victims of domestic violence. They got 2,554 cases registered for domestic violence and 809 cases for sexual violence, according to municipal records. Sikkim, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Assam and Uttar Pradesh are replicating and activating this model.

Health

Challenge: India has 46.6 million stunted children and is home to 31% of all stunted children under five--the highest in the world--according to the 2018 Global Nutrition Report, IndiaSpend reported on December 10, 2018.

Nearly 20% of Indian children under five are wasted (have low weight for their height) and 7% severely wasted, according to

data from the National Family Health Survey of 2015-16.

The Society for Nutrition, Education and Health Action (SNEHA), an NGO in Mumbai's Dharavi, the third largest slum in Asia by population, is helping reduce the prevalence of child malnutrition by plugging nutrition awareness gaps and supporting local health workers.

Action: SNEHA's efforts have reduced wasting among children aged up to three by 23% and produced a 109% increase in the services received by children through the Integrated Child Development Services Scheme, a government programme covering health, food and primary education. It plugs gaps in nutrition-related knowledge in the community by training community volunteers, who spread awareness and inform anganwadi (daycare) workers about the status of pregnant women and families who are finding it difficult to feed a newborn.

Education

Challenge: India has been successful in increasing primary school enrolment to the extent that more than 83% of primary school-age children were enrolled in 2016-17, according to data from the District Information System for Education (DISE). But fewer than half (47.8%) of grade V rural students could read at least a grade II text in 2016, the Annual Survey of Education Report 2016 found.

Action: World Vision, a non-profit, runs a remedial education programme, Aparajitha, for 4,300 students in government schools in 130 villages in Lalitpur district in Uttar Pradesh. From a zero baseline, within a year 1.55% of enrolled students could read local content (such as newspapers) and understand it; 6.2% (up from 1.8%) could read a story and comprehend it; and 10.4% could read a story (up from 5.1%). World Vision expects to complete the project by 2020 and empower the community to take over.

Disaster relief and rehabilitation

Challenge: In the two decades to 2017, India suffered a $79.5 billion loss, ranking among the top five countries in the world to be affected by climate-related disasters, The Wire reported on October 11, 2018. India is taking baby steps towards disaster preparedness, the lack of which is becoming obvious in the wake of climate change-related extreme weather events. Only 7% of the 4,862 dams in the country have emergency action plans, a 2017 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India said, the Hindustan Times reported on September 3, 2018. Often, the armed forces are summoned to undertake rescue operations, such as during the recent Kerala floods in August 2018, despite the constitution of the National Disaster Response Force in 2006.

The Kerala floods affected an

estimated 5 million people's lives and damaged infrastructure to the extent that the state needs nearly Rs 30,000 crore to rebuild.

Action: The Kerala state electricity board's quick response under Mission Reconnect restored electricity to nearly 2.5 million homes in less than two weeks. Kerala is one of the 15 states in India that have 100% household electrification, the Hindustan Times reported on November 28, 2018. It managed the task by improving coordination through a state-level task force and an army of volunteers comprising retired staff, students and private electricity personnel.

The move comes after farmers started locking up stray cows in government buildings to protect their crops from them. Aligarh's Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Ajay Kumar Sahni said the decision has been taken on the suggestion of some police personnel.

""Some incidents have come to our notice in which the bovines which stopped giving milk are often left out in the open to fend for themselves in farms or at other places. Lately, we have to face some law and order issues because of these animals,"" Sahni told news agency ANI. The SSP said some police officers proposed to adopt stray bovines. Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath Instructs Officials to 'Ensure Shelter for Stray Cows'.

""Hence we have decided that all police station chiefs, circle officers and senior police officials from the district will be adopting one such animal each. This will also give a message to the people as well not to abandon their animals if they stop giving milk,"" he said. Sahni added that if needed, then these animals can also be kept at the police stations.

The SSP said that the purpose of the initiative is to encourage citizens who can afford maintenance of stray bovines to adopt these animals in the larger interest of the society. He said policemen will continue to adopt stray bovines till all cow shelters in the state become operational. Earlier, chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed the officials concerned to make immediate arrangements for proper care of stray cows.

This initiative by the Aligarh Police comes days after over 700 stray cows were locked up inside a government school and primary health centre in Gorai area of the district by farmers on December 24 and 25 to save their crops from being damaged by the cattle. ""The cows are destroying our crops. For long, we have been demanding cow shelters from the government but no action is being taken,"" a farmer had said.

Last week, the district authorities had to deal with locals, mostly belonging to villages falling under Iglas and Khair tehsils, driving away the stray cattle to compounds of different government buildings, including schools and hospitals. Several schools in the area were reportedly closed as farmers turned the compounds into temporary cow shelters."

Rural Development Ministry data shows access to highest level of school education remains a concern, only 6.57 per cent villages have up to senior secondary schools.

New Delhi: Over 14 per cent of villages in India don't have schools, while as many as 10 states in the country have over 15 per cent such villages, shows the latest data available with the Rural Development Ministry.

Collected under Mission Antyodaya, the data also shows that around 47 per cent villages have schools only up to the primary level.

The comprehensive data, an assessment of village-level infrastructure facilities and amenities across states and Union Territories, is currently available for 5,27,507 villages and 2.3 lakh gram panchayats.

Apart from the 75,613 (14.33 per cent) villages that don't have schools, data shows 21 per cent villages have up to middle level schools (Classes 6 to 8), around 11 per cent have up to high schools (Classes 9 and 10) and only 6.57 per cent have up to senior secondary schools (Classes 11 and 12).

The ministry's aim behind collecting village-wise data is to identify gaps in villages based on the set parameters to ensure targeted development and execution of schemes.

Ten states -- Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Manipur, Goa, Odisha, Uttarakhand, Arunachal Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh -- are worse off than the national average, with over 15 per cent villages reporting no school at all.

Mizoram, Kerala and Gujarat, meanwhile, have less than 2 per cent villages with no schools.

Kerala also does exceedingly well with respect to higher education, with senior secondary schools available in as many as 80 per cent villages, and 11 per cent villages reporting at least up to high school level. This implies that the state has less than 10 per cent villages which have schools only up to middle or primary level.

The poorest performers at senior secondary level school education are Odisha, Nagaland and Jharkhand, with only 1.7 per cent, 1.8 per cent and 2.1 per cent villages, respectively, with such schools.

Ministry officials explain that the data is only for villages and not at the Gram Panchayat level -- which usually has a cluster of villages under it. The ministry hasn't yet collected Gram Panchayat-level data.

Effectively, this means that the 14 per cent villages that don't have schools might have one in a neighbouring village. This also implies that access to school education may not be as difficult.

The National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)'s 2014 data said 94 per cent households in rural areas reported availability of primary school within 1 km from the house.

The NSSO data said it was the availability of higher levels of school that remained low in rural areas, a fact further corroborated by the current Rural Development Ministry data.

The government of India's flagship Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan aims at the universalisation of elementary education ""in a time bound manner"", as mandated by the Indian Constitution that calls for free and compulsory education to children in the 6-14 year age bracket.

From the breezy Trisha-Vijay Sethupathi starrer 96 to the hard-hitting Vada Chennai, it's quite evident that content took priority over star power.

Pariyerum Perumal

While commercial directors, in general, refuse to budge from the formula, it's newcomers like Mari Selvaraj who give us some hope. I believe the primary objective of any art is to hold a mirror up to society. That way, Pariyerum Perumal, which begins with a card that reads 'caste and religion are against humanity', was unapologetic. What sets this Pa Ranjith production apart from other caste-based stories is the narrative. Kathir was a terrific choice to play the lead. The film, which sheds light on caste hegemony, education system and gender minorities, equally excels in the technical departments from cinematography to the background score.

Nadigaiyar Thilagam

It's not easy to make a convincing biopic -- especially -- when it revolves around the life of a female actor. Recreating a bygone era which has the top star of the times definitely needs meticulous research. Credit goes to director Nag Ashwin and team for the same. Some of the best moments of the film include the romance between Gemini Ganesan (Dulquer Salmaan) and Savitri (Keerthy). The makers couldn't have found better artistes to play the legendary actors on the screen. The frames that involve Keerthy with exquisite designer saris, hand-crafted and vintage jewellery are a visual treat to watch.

Chekka Chivantha Vaanam (CCV)

It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say only Mani Ratnam can make an action-based gangster film, and draw the family audience to theaters. The story deals with a man's quest for power, money and the way it affects even close relationships. Despite having four male lead actors -- Vijay Sethupathi, Simbu, Arvind Swami and Arun Vijay on board, there is a seamless balance in the screen time allotted to each actor. Mani Ratnam has been making movies for the past 35 years and is still exploring new ways to tell stories within the boundaries of mainstream cinema. It's amazing how Tamil cinema has changed, and he is keeping up with the pace.

96

Advertising

If you are a hopeless romantic, this film will leave you in tears. 96 isn't an earth-shattering love story, but there is something special about it. Director Prem Kumar captures 'love', 'helplessness', 'memories' and 'life' in the right ways possible. A school reunion is planned. How two people who were pulled apart by circumstances meet eventually forms the story. Trisha, again, revives the performer we saw in Vinaithaandi Varuvaaya. As for Vijay Sethupathi, he aces the reticent Ram. This is unlike any other Vijay Sethupathi movie. You have to give it to Govind Vasantha for the amazing tunes that come like an answer to fill up the blanks.

Kanaa

Though Kanaa reminds one of Dangal and/or Chak De India, it's one of the interesting sports dramas made in Tamil after Irudhi Suttru. The story revolves around the life of Kousalya, a small-town girl who hopes to play for the Indian women's cricket team. Kausalya isn't forced into the sport. India loses the World Cup to Sri Lanka in 2007. Her dad, Murugesan, a humble farmer weeps. Kausalya was a kid when she witnesses this. She wants to become a cricketer only to bring back that smile on her dad's face by playing for team India. There's an authenticity in the story and the way Aishwarya Rajesh plays Kausalya. Kanaa also chronicles the struggles of a farmer whose life takes a turn after a drought hits their village.

Vada Chennai

This gritty tale, directed by Vetrimaaran, is all about love, betrayal, revenge and violence. The filmmaker reasonably spends time in the locales his films are set in to get more understanding of his subjects, and no wonder his characters are well-defined. Despite largely being a gangster film, this one has beautiful scenes written around a carom player Anbu (Dhanush) and Padma (Aishwarya Rajesh). You can't help but be a part of their love story. This multi-layered script is brought to life by breathtaking visuals of Velraj accompanied by Santhosh Narayanan's background score. Though a non-linear screenplay makes it difficult to get the story arc in the beginning, Vada Chennai, as a whole, is an epic gangster saga.

Raatchasan

Ram Kumar's psychological thriller Raatchasan is rated as IMDB's second-best Indian film this year, and is ranked first in the South Indian films category. The story revolves around an aspiring filmmaker-turned-cop who tracks down a psychopath serial killer. Though the film is well-made in parts, it fails to keep us entertained till the end. But the cleverly made second half does send chills down your spine. Barring a long-drawn climax portion, it makes for an interesting watch. Ghibran's background score and PV Sankar's cinematography help Ram Kumar set the right tone overall. What works in favour of the film, apart from the able technical crew, is the ensemble cast of Saravanan, Ramdoss, Abhirami, Amala Paul and others doing just what is required of them.

U-Turn

As the title suggests, this Samantha-starrer has many 'U-turns'. If you have not watched the original (An acclaimed Kannada film by the same name), the Tamil one will certainly keep you hooked. Rachna works at a newspaper office. A spate of murders takes place in the city. How does she get involved in it while she is on an assignment forms the rest of the plot. When Rachna breaks down, you empathise with her. Pawan Kumar manages to keep the audience guessing with sudden twists and developments throughout. Samantha owns the film as the story progresses.

Merku Thodarchi Malai

No big actors, no big director, but Merku Thodarchi Malai hit the big screen like a breath of fresh air. Debutant filmmaker Lenin Bharathi managed to portray the lives of people on the Western Ghats with an effortless tinge of realism. In order to keep the film real, the director made his actors work as daily wage labourers for some time, so they absorbed the milieu of their characters. Merku Thodarchi Malai is as much a story of the place as the people. Lenin hasn't criticised anything but presented various issues concerning people of the Western Ghats in an emotional way. This film had minimum dialogues, which is a rare feature in Tamil cinema. It's not your swiftly-cut film. But slowly takes you into the lives of cardamom labourers who stay atop the hills. As the audience, you feel you are there with the characters.

Kolamaavu Kokila

Kokila (Nayanthara) is forced to take up drug smuggling because of her mother's cancer treatment. What happens when she is put in the toughest of times has been handled with dark humour. The film is an out-and-out star vehicle that offers you truckloads of whistle-worthy moments. Debutant filmmaker Nelson Dilipkumar subtly conveys a message that women empowerment is the key to take on the male-dominated society. This film also has an iconic scene where Sekhar (Yogi Babu) proposes to Kokila (Nayanthara). As Anirudh Ravichander's sensational hit ""Kalyana Vayasudhan"" plays in the background, we are shown how Sekhar falls for Kokila. It is not just Nayanthara who scores high with this film, but the supporting cast including Saranya Ponvannan, RS Sivaji, Saravanan and Motta Rajendran.

Kaatrin Mozhi

Even if you have watched Tumhari Sulu featuring Vidya Balan, this Jyotika-starrer does fairly work. Thanks to Radha Mohan, who has strived to do more to Kaatrin Mozhi, besides trying to recreate scenes from the Suresh Triveni directorial. The story revolves around Vijayalakshmi, who lands the job of a night radio jockey. What happens when she struggles to balance her work and responsibilities at home has been told in an engaging manner. One can relate to the characters so easily, and that makes Kaatrin Mozhi a breezy entertainer to watch. Jyotika pulls off Vijayalakshmi with ease and balances the laughs with the tears.

Mercury

In this 'silent' film, nobody 'talks'. But the silence, however, is filled by background music -- the sound that goes well with the ambience. Five friends go on a midnight drive in a car and accidentally kill a man (Prabhudheva) in the dark. When they try to dispose of the dead body, it reappears alive in a factory. The entire episode has an interesting backstory that is narrated in a typical Karthik Subbaraj style, which, by now, is a genre in itself. However, the problem lies in the second half, when it becomes more about the execution than the actual premise. Besides minor glitches, Mercury is easily one of the best thrillers released this year.

Savarakathi

Though Savarakathi marks the directorial debut of Mysskin's brother GR Adithya, it constantly reminds you that you are watching a Mysskin film, literally. The story revolves around Manga (Mysskin), a thug and a barber, Pichai (Ram). What happens when both accidentally cross paths hold a lot of surprises to the audience in the form of the cat and mouse game. But the tone entirely changes in the second half. It makes you think and feel. Savarakathi, in fact, raises some important questions about life and death. Thankfully, even towards the end, it doesn't get preachy at all.

Maa

Advertising

Sometimes, you feel glad that a story is more suited for a short film than a full-length feature. KM Sarjun's 28-minute-venture, Maa, available on Ondraga Entertainment's YouTube channel, is one such. Maa explores a sensitive topic -- teenage pregnancy and its repercussions on an average middle-class home. Fifteen-year-old Ammu (Anikha) tells her mother Sathya (Kani Kusruti) that she is pregnant after a sexual encounter with her friend. At one point, Sathya even suggests that the girl kill herself. But then, she runs to her, and says, ""I'm here for you!"" With an intense performance, Kani Kusruti steals the show and make us empathise with her situation as a young parent. There's something cathartic about listening to a story narrated in all honesty."

Challenge: Climate change can lower the standard of living of nearly half of India's population by 2050, the World Bank warned in a June 2018 study. Particularly vulnerable are farmers who are dependent on rainfall for a good harvest, especially in regions such as Karnataka that are prone to drought. In the 15 years to 2015, only three years--2005, 2007 and 2010--witnessed no drought, as per a 2017 assessment report by the Karnataka State Disaster Management Monitoring Centre. In 2018, 77% of the 30 districts were declared drought-hit, The Times of India reported on September 14, 2018.

Action: A farmer couple, Shyamrao and Laximibai Patil, in water-scarce Kalaburagi in north Karnataka, have shown that a combination of state and NGO support, supported by grassroots innovation, can help farmers combat the effects of climate change. The Patils practice organic farming, run a dairy and poultry farm, and are helping their fellow farmers experiment with new methods.

The couple have set up their own self-help group to sell produce such as pulses. From their mixed-crop farming and livestock produce, they make an annual income of Rs 5 lakh and a profit of around Rs 2.5 lakh, at a time when 70% of the country's agricultural households spend more than they earn on average every month.

Challenge: In 2017, nearly 50,000 women died at the hands of intimate partners or family members, making ""home, the most dangerous place for women"", according to a November 2018 study by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.

India is perceived as having the worst record on sexual violence, harassment from cultural and traditional practices and human trafficking, and is considered the least safe country in the world for women, according to a Thomson Reuters Foundation poll, as IndiaSpend reported on June 26, 2018. Only 14% of Indian women who have experienced physical or sexual violence have sought help to stop the violence while 77% have neither sought help nor told anyone about the violence they experienced, according to the National Family Health Survey (2015-16).

Action: In Mumbai, health advocacy Centre for Enquiry into Health and Allied Themes has since 2001 been running support centres called Dilaasa, which are funded by the National Health Mission, to identify victims of domestic and sexual violence. Using a model of care that can be replicated across government health centres nationwide, Dilaasa centres have provided help to more than 8,000 women.

Over the two years to 2018, Mumbai's 11 centres identified 5,647 women as potential victims of domestic violence. They got 2,554 cases registered for domestic violence and 809 cases for sexual violence, according to municipal records.

Sikkim, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Assam and Uttar Pradesh are replicating and activating this model.

The Society for Nutrition, Education and Health Action (SNEHA), an NGO in Mumbai's Dharavi, the third largest slum in Asia by population, is helping reduce the prevalence of child malnutrition by plugging nutrition awareness gaps and supporting local health workers.

Action: SNEHA's efforts have reduced wasting among children aged up to three by 23% and produced a 109% increase in the services received by children through the Integrated Child Development Services Scheme, a government programme covering health, food and primary education. It plugs gaps in nutrition-related knowledge in the community by training community volunteers, who spread awareness and inform anganwadi (daycare) workers about the status of pregnant women and families who are finding it difficult to feed a newborn.

Challenge: India has been successful in increasing primary school enrolment to the extent that more than 83% of primary school-age children were enrolled in 2016-17, according to data from the District Information System for Education (DISE). But fewer than half (47.8%) of grade V rural students could read at least a grade II text in 2016, the Annual Survey of Education Report 2016 found.

Action: World Vision, a non-profit, runs a remedial education programme, Aparajitha, for 4,300 students in government schools in 130 villages in Lalitpur district in Uttar Pradesh. From a zero baseline, within a year 1.55% of enrolled students could read local content (such as newspapers) and understand it; 6.2% (up from 1.8%) could read a story and comprehend it; and 10.4% could read a story (up from 5.1%). World Vision expects to complete the project by 2020 and empower the community to take over.

Challenge: In the two decades to 2017, India suffered a $79.5 billion loss, ranking among the top five countries in the world to be affected by climate-related disasters, The Wire reported on October 11, 2018. India is taking baby steps towards disaster preparedness, the lack of which is becoming obvious in the wake of climate change-related extreme weather events. Only 7% of the 4,862 dams in the country have emergency action plans, a 2017 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India said, the Hindustan Times reported on September 3, 2018. Often, the armed forces are summoned to undertake rescue operations, such as during the recent Kerala floods in August 2018, despite the constitution of the National Disaster Response Force in 2006.

The Kerala floods affected an estimated 5 million people's lives and damaged infrastructure to the extent that the state needs nearly Rs 30,000 crore to rebuild.

Action: The Kerala state electricity board's quick response under Mission Reconnect restored electricity to nearly 2.5 million homes in less than two weeks. Kerala is one of the 15 states in India that have 100% household electrification, the Hindustan Times reported on November 28, 2018. It managed the task by improving coordination through a state-level task force and an army of volunteers comprising retired staff, students and private electricity personnel."

In the first week of December, residents of the Gothikoya tribal village in Bhadradri Kothagudem district, around 600 km southwest of Hyderabad, gathered for an unusual celebration -- to garland the new drinking water taps in front of their huts. Days later, four new taps came up in Nagasala village of Mahbubnagar district, a couple of hours by road from the state capital, where residents had to earlier trek for nearly a kilometre to access clean water.

Launched in August 2016, Mission Bhagiratha, Telangana's ambitious project to supply drinking water to every household outside municipal corporation limits, is nearing its March 31, 2019 deadline. And government officials say 1,00,200 km of the 1,04,749-km network of pipelines -- around two-and-a-half times the Earth's circumference -- has been laid.

On the ground, meanwhile, the change is visible.

""Earlier, we had to walk at least a km to fetch drinking water, and had to leave in the morning to fetch it. It was difficult to get our children ready for school and prepare food. After these taps were fixed, that is not a worry anymore. We have been told that taps would soon be fixed just outside or inside our homes,'' says Mamidal Renuka from Nagasala in Mahbubnagar.

""We used to fetch water from an agricultural well, a stream nearby, or a community tap in the neighbouring village. The water was unclean and frequently caused diarrhoea, especially among our children. Now, we drink directly from our tap,'' says Madavi Sanjiv from Gothikoya village.

Why a Telangana village gathered to garland its water taps been given a stiff target by Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao in his first official meeting after coming back to power this month: Make Telangana the first state where every house receives filtered drinking water through an individual connection in the kitchen or outside.

""As of today, drinking water reaches bulk collection points in 22,947 villages. The deadline to provide water at these collection points to the remaining 1,021 villages is January 10. The deadline to complete the project to provide drinking water through individual household taps is March 31, 2019,'' says Krupakar Reddy, engineer-in-chief, Mission Bhagiratha.

According to officials, houses in 17,000 habitations were provided individual drinking water tap connections as on December 18, 2018. ""These households will start receiving purified drinking water shortly. About 95 per cent work of laying pipelines to the remaining 6,968 villages is completed and only last-mile pipes and taps have to be fixed, which we will complete by March,'' says Reddy.

Apart from addressing the shortage of drinking water in rural areas, the project is aimed at resolving a serious health crisis in Nalgonda and Medak districts, where much of the ground water is contaminated by fluoride.

""The project covers remote Adivasi tribal hamlets, Lambada settlements, Dalit colonies, habitations in hillocks, and forest dwellings. It is taking us some time to complete the work in remote villages in tribal areas like Sirpur, Adilabad, Nirmal, Asifabad, Kothagudem, where there are habitations in hillocks or inside the forests,'' says Jogu Ramana, TRS MLA from Adilabad, who attended that meeting.

In Telangana, the primary sources of drinking water are the Godavari and Krishna rivers: northern Telangana and the Godavari basin receive 53.38 TMC from the Godavari; south Telangana receives 32.43 TMC from the Krishna. ""The 49,120-km primary pipeline network has already been laid through which water is being pumped. Around 51,080 km of a separate 55,629-km intra-village pipeline network has been completed,'' says Reddy.

The key question, however, remains, say experts: will the government's responsibility end with the pipelines? The real challenge will begin after the pipelines are laid and connections are given, says Dr K Shashidhar, Associate Professor at IIT-Hyderabad, who holds a PhD in Environment and Water Resources Engineering from IIT-Madras.

""In such a huge project, everyone will ask whether the water source is enough to sustain supply? So, apart from laying the pipeline network, ensuring daily supply to households becomes very important,'' he says."

Sehrawan's students now travel 2km to village Dhani to reach the nearest school. Sat Singh, an elderly resident, said: ""I've myself studied in the GPS. It was running fine. I don't know why the government decided to shut it down."" Most parents in Sehrawan said they find it hard to send their kids to school now. Sukhvinder Singh said, ""Even though Dhani is not too far off, I can't send my son there, as the national highway runs between our villages, and it's dangerous to cross it every day with the kid. So he's sitting at home. This was the only school in the village, and they have closed it.""

The elementary education department at Panchkula has decided to close or merge 62 GPSs having ""zero student strength"" this year.

An education department official said: ""This decision was taken by the department. We had no say in it. Officially, the reason is low attendance.""

According to official records that TOI has sourced, at the time of being closed down, GPS Sehrawan had zero students and two teachers. Charan Singh, one of the teachers at the school, said: ""I don't know what the records say, but at the time the school was unofficially shut down in 2015, we had around 26 students."" Today, the four rooms in the school lay deserted. A poster in one room displays the midday meal schedule, that includes among others chaat on Monday and dal on Wednesday. One of the walls has a political map of Haryana, showing different districts.

A letter sent by the education department earlier this year reads: ""The government has decided that 62 government primary schools having zero student strength may be closed down or merged.

However, at the time of rationalisation, posts of teachers will be rationalised on the basis of actual requirement at that point of time.

Officially, there are no students at GPS, Sehrawan, although the school has two teachers. Following the education department notification, the staff have been told they may be transferred to a school facing staff crunch.

Stalker dies after private parts chopped off in Maharashtra

Thane: A 27-year-old man from Maharashtra's Thane district whose private parts were allegedly chopped off by three persons, including a woman he was reportedly stalking, has died in a Mumbai hospital, police said Sunday. An official said that Tushar Pujare, a home loan adviser, was allegedly stalking a 42-year-old woman in the district's Manpada area and had also visited her home and told her husband about his infatuation. Pujare's brother, in his complaint to the police, said 15 days prior to the incident, the woman had warned Pujare of dire consequences if he did not stop his advances. On December 25, Pujare was called to Nandivli area of Dombivali by the accused on the pretext of arranging a home loan, the official said. ""Pujare was assaulted there and the woman chopped off his private parts with a knife. The woman rushed Pujare to a nearby hospital and then left from there,"" the official said.

State governments have increased their budgets for school education in the past three years, but the allotment of funds has not been enough to attract permanent qualified teaching staff to government schools, finds a recent study conducted across six States.

The report, prepared jointly by Child Rights and You (CRY) and the Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability (CBGA), examines budgeting for school education in six States -- West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra -- during the 14th Finance Commission recommendation period, which started in April 2015.

The study finds that there has been an overall increase in revenue with the States following the 14th Finance Commission recommendations. This was a result of an increase in the share of the States in the divisible pool of Central taxes from 32% to 42%. At the same time, a reduction in the Union government's contribution to the States for Central schemes in social sectors forced the States to improve their tax revenue collection. The study analyses whether the availability of additional funds translated into prioritising of school education in these six States.

Between 2015-16 and 2017-18, there was a net decline in the share of school education budget in the total State Budget for three of the six States, according to the detailed demand for Grants and State Budget documents. Bihar saw a dip of 3.1%, Maharashtra a drop of 1% and West Bengal 0.9%. On the other hand, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh saw an increase in the size of school education budget by 0.4%, 2.6% and 3.2%, respectively.

The report examines whether the increase in the size of school education budget was more than the rise in size of the total budget, indicating a higher priority for the sector. It concluded that between 2014-15 and 2017-18, Uttar Pradesh saw a 98.8% increase in budget for schools, whereas its total budget increased by 63.3%. West Bengal's budget for school education increased by 49.4% while its total budget increased by 48.2% and in Tamil Nadu, the former increased by 38.7% but the total budget increased by 38.5%, indicating that school education was a priority for these three States.

At the same time, all the six States showed an increase in the magnitude of per-child and per-student spending for education between 2014-15 and 2016-17.

Despite a varying level of commitment towards school education across the six States, all of them struggle with a shortage of teachers. The report cites data from the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development to show that as on March 2017, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have from 19% to 34% of total teacher positions at the elementary level vacant. Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu were relatively better with 5.9% and 2.6% posts unfilled.

Data from the District Information System for Education show that at the upper primary level, there is a severe paucity of subject-specific teachers required under the Right to Education Act -- 77% upper primary schools in Maharashtra, 46% in Uttar Pradesh, 40% in West Bengal and 37% in Bihar do not have subject teachers.

More than one lakh schools in India are run with only one teacher and all the six States surveyed have shown the number of such schools on the rise. The shortage of teachers is more acute at the secondary level -- Bihar has 20,494 teaching posts vacant, Chhattisgarh 8,278 and Uttar Pradesh 12,008.

The figures don't entirely capture the severity of the shortfall as they do not reflect the shortage of subject teachers."

S. Swamy, Block Education Officer, said, ""We have already trained the teachers and cluster officer, and conducted meetings with the various teachers' associations. The motive behind the EEPF is to build confidence among the students to communicate in English.""

Though there is no official communication, the programme is being seen as a precursor to the State government's plan to introduce English medium in 1,000 government primary schools across the State.

The Education Department is thinking of extending the 'T. Narsipur model' across the State by training teachers through the Department of State Educational Research and Training (DSERT) and the District Institutes of Education and Training (DIET), another senior officer said."

The proposal to ""voluntarily"" adopt a bovine was mooted at the meeting of district police officials by Aligarh senior superintendent of police AK Sahni. Forty-one police personnel, who attended the meeting, offered to adopt one stray bovine each. These included four additional SPs, nine circle officers and 27 police station incharges, besides the SSP himself. The bovines will be adopted from January 1.

Talking to TOI, SSP AK Sahni said that the purpose of the initiative is to send a message among the residents that those who can easily afford maintenance of a stray animal should do it in order to help the society at large.

""Every adverse law and order situation is to be faced by us, so we should be the ones taking the initiative in resolving the problems that ail the society,"" Sahni said, adding that this arrangement will continue till all the cow shelters, which are being constructed by the government, become operational.

Sahni, however, added that he will keep the cattle forever.

Superintendent of police (city) Ashutosh Dwivedi said the initiative should also motivate people not to abandon their unproductive animals as they end up destroying standing crops in the fields besides becoming a nuisance in the streets.

Dwivedi said he had no space in his house to keep the bovine, but he volunteered to bear the entire expense of the animal's upkeep.

Meanwhile, Aligarh district magistrate CB Singh has also planned to call a meeting and urge all the administrative staff, around 15,000 of them, to voluntarily adopt a stray bovine each. He said, ""This is a good step in terms of contributing for a social cause.""

Protests against the stray cattle menace have been happening in Aligarh for the past week.

On Wednesday, students and teachers of around a dozen government primary and upper primary schools in Aligarh were forced to stay out of their classrooms on Wednesday as local residents in Iglas area herded stray cows and bulls inside the school compounds. Later, the schools were closed by the administration and the children went back to their homes.

Angered by stray cattle roaming around in their villages and damaging crops, residents of Mohakampur in Iglas, Kaser Gangiri in Atrauli and a few other blocks of the district locked up around 800 animals in schools. Stray animals were even locked up inside a primary health centre."

Announcing this at a press conference here on Sunday, Minister for Welfare of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes A.K. Balan said that the work on the project would be launched on January 6.

The funds for the project include ₹42.68 crore from the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund of the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard); ₹11.93 from the voluntary retirement scheme of the State government; ₹17.75 crore from the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) and ₹6.85 crore from the Central scheme; he said.

""A project aimed at comprehensive development of a resettlement area is the first such initiative in the tribal sector,"" Mr. Balan said, adding that it was a model for the entire country.

The government was giving top priority to the efforts to empower tribal families by focussing on education and employment sectors, he said. The works being implemented under the project include a higher secondary school at the tribal resettlement area (₹2.71 crore); a boys' hostel (₹2.45 crore); five community halls (₹2.59 crore); three anganwadis (₹1.13 crore); fencing to prevent wild animal attacks (₹3.11 crore); electricity connection (₹1.03 crore); two lower-primary schools, (₹3.72 crore); community health centre (₹1.26 crore); five Supplyco Supermarkets (₹2.17 crore); and roads (₹3.78 crore) and bridges at Odanthode and Valayamchal areas (₹9.96 crore), among others.

Jasprit Bumrah's form and fitness will be one of India's primary concern during the World Cup in England and the Gujarat pacer may get some well deserved rest for a few games during the twin ODI series against Australia and New Zealand.

Bumrah, who played a stellar role with match haul of nine for 86 in India's 137-run win against Australia at the MCG, has played nine away Test matches this year with 48 wickets in this current calender year.

Bumrah has bowled 379.4 overs in nine Tests while Mohammed Shami has bowled a few overs more (383.5 overs) but he has played 12 Test matches. Ishant Sharma during this phase has bowled 335 overs while off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has bowled the maximum overs (386 overs).

Among these bowlers, both Ashwin and Ishant do not figure as far as India's World Cup preparation is concerned as the core team of 20 is already set.

The core 20 comprises the 16 selected for Australia and New Zealand ODIs along with Rishabh Pant, Shreyas Iyer, Manish Pandey and Umesh Yadav, who are still very much in the mix.

It is understood that Indian team management as well as national selectors are on same page with regards to the workload management of the pacers.

Bumrah is expected to play a major role in India's final Test match of the season in Sydney and everyone associated with the national team are aware that he is also an integral part of Mumbai Indians set-up for the Indian Premier League.

In best case scenario, Bumrah is expected to bowl at least 30 overs (minimum) across two innings at Sydney which will take his tally to over 400 overs.

With Bhuvneshwar Kumar fresh and raring to go and young Khaleel Ahmed also joining the ranks during the ODI phase, there is a school of thought that Bumrah could be sparingly used during the next 13 ODIs (3 away and 5 home vs Australia, 5 away vs New Zealand).

Bhuvneshwar, Khaleel along with Hardik Pandya and the two wrist spinners could provide Bumrah some relief time to time during upcoming ODIs as he will be as important as skipper Virat Kohli in the larger scheme of things.

However, the tricky part for the BCCI mandarins will be discussing Bumrah's workload management with the Mumbai Indians team management.

Earlier in October, there were discussions during a meeting between CoA, team management and selectors whether bowlers in the fray for the World Cup could be rested during the IPL but it didn't see the light of the day as franchises were wary.

However, there is expected to be some effort put in by the BCCI to convince Bumrah's franchise to co-operate looking at the bigger picture.

""For someone of Virat's stature, he can take a call himself and discuss with his franchise about his workload. However, for Bumrah, the Indian team's support staff will need to prepare all the relevant data so that we can have discussion with MI if the situation arises,"" a senior BCCI official told PTI on condition of anonymity.

""Obviously, if he is fit, he will play all important matches for MI but in between, with such a hectic travel schedule during IPL, it will be great if he is rested keeping the World Cup in mind,"" he added."

The journalist, who declined to be identified for fear of reprisals, said activists of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ruling Awami League party in Chittagong, Bangladesh's second-largest city, warned him and other voters at the polling centre not to go inside.

""They said we didn't need to go inside as our votes had already been cast,"" the journalist told Reuters by phone, adding that there were five other voters around him at the time at the polling centre set up at the national primary school in Chittagong's Kotwali area.

""I am hearing the same thing happening at several other polling booths in Chittagong,"" the journalist said.

His comments add to accusations by several leaders of the country's main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) who have alleged rigging and vote manipulation by the Awami League.

The Awami League said opposition supporters were wrongly accusing the party.

The Election Commission said it had received complaints of rigging that it was investigating. ""Allegations are coming from across the country and those are under investigation,"" the agency's spokesman S.M. Asaduzzaman said. ""If we get any confirmation from our own channels then measures will be taken as per rules"".

At least 10 people were killed and more than a dozen injured in political clashes on Sunday by the time voting ended at 1000 hours GMT. At least six candidates of the opposition National Unity Front alliance said they had pulled out alleging rigging.

When Rasel, a 34-year-old voter in Chittagong, went down to the polling centre set up at a local polytechnic college in his area, he said about 30 people stopped him from entering the booth. He knew at least one of them was an Awami League activist, he said.

""They told me that 'voting is going on nicely, you don't need to go inside'. If you try to enter, you will be in trouble',"" Rasel, who declined to give his second name fearing reprisals, told Reuters by phone. He turned back without voting.

Hasina has promised to conduct a ""free and fair"" election and earlier this month said in a public speech that she would not try to win the election using ""unfair means."" She is seeking a third straight term in power.

Bumrah is expected to play a major role in India's final Test match of the season in Sydney and everyone associated with the national team are aware that he is also an integral part of Mumbai Indians set-up for the Indian Premier League.

In best case scenario, Bumrah is expected to bowl at least 30 overs (minimum) across two innings at Sydney which will take his tally to over 400 overs.

With Bhuvneshwar Kumar fresh and raring to go and young Khaleel Ahmed also joining the ranks during the ODI phase, there is a school of thought that Bumrah could be sparingly used during the next 13 ODIs (3 away and 5 home vs Australia, 5 away vs New Zealand).

Bhuvneshwar, Khaleel along with Hardik Pandya and the two wrist spinners could provide Bumrah some relief time to time during upcoming ODIs as he will be as important as skipper Virat Kohli in the larger scheme of things.

However, the tricky part for the BCCI mandarins will be discussing Bumrah's workload management with the Mumbai Indians team management.

Earlier in October, there were discussions during a meeting between CoA, team management and selectors whether bowlers in the fray for the World Cup could be rested during the IPL but it didn't see the light of the day as franchises were wary.

However, there is expected to be some effort put in by the BCCI to convince Bumrah's franchise to co-operate looking at the bigger picture.

However, for Bumrah, the Indian team's support staff will need to prepare all the relevant data so that we can have discussion with MI if the situation arises,"" a senior BCCI official told PTI on condition of anonymity.

Voting for the 11th national election began with the machines being used in the six seats selected through lottery. These are: Dhaka-6, Dhaka-13, Chattogram-9, Rangpur-3, Khulna-2 and Satkhira-2. The six seats comprises over 2.1 million voters. The results from these six seats could be announced within hours after the voting ends, Bangladeshi media reported.

Electronic voting machines created problems across different voting centres in Dhaka-13 and Dhaka-6, slowing down voting process and leading to long queues, the Daily Star newspaper reported.

Voters in some areas have reported facing trouble when the machines could not recognise their fingerprints, BDnews24.com reported.

""But I got to vote using my voter ID. It didn't take much time.""

Gazi Hossain, a former librarian of Lalmatia Mohila College, was unhappy with the EVM because of the time wasted in trying to match his fingerprint in the machine. ""It wasn't matching, so it took more time, that's a problem,"" he said.

Bimal Chandra, a retired teacher, voted using EVM at the Mohammadpur Chand Community Centre. ""I just pressed two buttons on the EVM. One on the poll symbol, then another on a green button. It takes roughly ten seconds. It takes more time to be marked on the thumb with ink. ""It takes just 20 minutes to count the votes from EVM centres. This is good,"" said Chandra.

On December 27, the Election Commission organised mock voting at selected polling centres to educate voters on how to use EVMs. The EVM technology is being used for the first time at the national election level, eight years after being introduced in local government elections in the country.

The machines were first used in the Chittagong City Corporation election of June 2010. However, the Election Commission stopped using the technology in 2015 due to some errors. The machines were later reintroduced in the Rangpur City Corporation election in 2016.

During this year's city corporation polls, EVMs were used in three polling centres in Khulna City Corporation with 10,000 voters; two centres in Sylhet City Corporation with 5,413 voters; 11 centres in Barishal City Corporation with 25,000 voters; and two centres in Rajshahi City Corporation with 3,383 voters, the Daily Star reported.

During the Election Commission's electoral dialogues, most of the 40 registered parties, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party of former premier Khalida Zia and its allies, opposed the idea of using EVMs in the election.

However, five political parties, including the ruling Awami League of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, its allies Workers Party of Bangladesh, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal faction led by Hasanul Haq Inu and Bangladesher Samyabadi Dal (M-L) and Zaker Party supported the use of EVMs.

The BNP has all along been opposing the EC move, alleging that this might facilitate ""the government's plan for election engineering"".

The Bangladesh Machine Tools Factory (BMTF) imported parts of the EVMs and assembled them in Bangladesh ahead of the general election, media reports said.

Bangladesh Sunday deployed electronic voting machines for the first time in a general election, though only on a limited scale, a move which received mixed responses from the voters amid reports of glitches in some booths.

Out of the 299 parliamentary constituencies that went to polls, six saw the use of electronic voting machines (EVMs), a regular feature in neighbouring India since decades ago.

Voting for the 11th national election began with the machines being used in the six seats selected through lottery. These are: Dhaka-6, Dhaka-13, Chattogram-9, Rangpur-3, Khulna-2 and Satkhira-2. The six seats comprises over 2.1 million voters. The results from these six seats could be announced within hours after the voting ends, Bangladeshi media reported.

Electronic voting machines created problems across different voting centres in Dhaka-13 and Dhaka-6, slowing down voting process and leading to long queues, the Daily Star newspaper reported.

Voters in some areas have reported facing trouble when the machines could not recognise their fingerprints, BDnews24.com reported.

Dhaka-13 voter Jagat Dashi Mondol, a septuagenarian, was smiling as she came out of the polling centre at Mohammadpur's Borabo Government Primary School.

When asked about how she felt using an EVM, said, ""easy, very easy.""

The polling centre's Presiding Officer Jayanta Chandra Deb said he replaced three EVMs when they stopped working.

Nazrul Islam, a retired engineer, said his fingerprint was not matching when he went to vote at the polling centre in Lalmatia Mohila College.

""But I got to vote using my voter ID. It didn't take much time.""

Bimal Chandra, a retired teacher, voted using EVM at the Mohammadpur Chand Community Centre.

""I just pressed two buttons on the EVM. One on the poll symbol, then another on a green button. It takes roughly ten seconds. It takes more time to be marked on the thumb with ink.

""It takes just 20 minutes to count the votes from EVM centres. This is good,"" said Chandra.

On December 27, the Election Commission organised mock voting at selected polling centres to educate voters on how to use EVMs.

The EVM technology is being used for the first time at the national election level, eight years after being introduced in local government elections in the country.

During the Election Commission's electoral dialogues, most of the 40 registered parties, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party of former premier Khalida Zia and its allies, opposed the idea of using EVMs in the election.

Bumrah, who played a stellar role with match haul of nine for 86 in India's 137-run win against Australia at the MCG, has played nine away Test matches this year with 48 wickets in this current calender year.

Bumrah has bowled 379.4 overs in nine Tests while Mohammed Shami has bowled a few overs more (383.5 overs) but he has played 12 Test matches. Ishant Sharma during this phase has bowled 335 overs while off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has bowled the maximum overs (386 overs).

Among these bowlers, both Ashwin and Ishant do not figure as far as India's World Cup preparation is concerned as the core team of 20 is already set.

The core 20 comprises the 16 selected for Australia and New Zealand ODIs along with Rishabh Pant, Shreyas Iyer, Manish Pandey and Umesh Yadav, who are still very much in the mix.

It is understood that Indian team management as well as national selectors are on same page with regards to the workload management of the pacers.

Bumrah is expected to play a major role in India's final Test match of the season in Sydney and everyone associated with the national team are aware that he is also an integral part of Mumbai Indians set-up for the Indian Premier League.

In best case scenario, Bumrah is expected to bowl at least 30 overs (minimum) across two innings at Sydney which will take his tally to over 400 overs.

With Bhuvneshwar Kumar fresh and raring to go and young Khaleel Ahmed also joining the ranks during the ODI phase, there is a school of thought that Bumrah could be sparingly used during the next 13 ODIs (3 away and 5 home vs Australia, 5 away vs New Zealand).

Bhuvneshwar, Khaleel along with Hardik Pandya and the two wrist spinners could provide Bumrah some relief time to time during upcoming ODIs as he will be as important as skipper Virat Kohli in the larger scheme of things.

However, the tricky part for the BCCI mandarins will be discussing Bumrah's workload management with the Mumbai Indians team management.

Earlier in October, there were discussions during a meeting between CoA, team management and selectors whether bowlers in the fray for the World Cup could be rested during the IPL but it didn't see the light of the day as franchises were wary.

However, there is expected to be some effort put in by the BCCI to convince Bumrah's franchise to co-operate looking at the bigger picture.

""For someone of Virat's stature, he can take a call himself and discuss with his franchise about his workload. However, for Bumrah, the Indian team's support staff will need to prepare all the relevant data so that we can have discussion with MI if the situation arises,"" a senior BCCI official told PTI on condition of anonymity.

""Obviously, if he is fit, he will play all important matches for MI but in between, with such a hectic travel schedule during IPL, it will be great if he is rested keeping the World Cup in mind,"" he added."

They are making a splash in Aligarh district of Uttar Pradesh. It all started a few days ago with Timotia village, where irate farmers fed up with stray cattle eating up their crops, rounded up 500 heads of cows and locked them up in the local primary school. It was not just to get the rampaging cattle off their land; it was to get the government administration to find a solution.

The protest has spread like wildfire. Aligarh farmers are rounding up stray cattle and locking them up in nearest government buildings -- hospitals, offices, schools. Work in these government outposts has come to a halt, and the local administration is paralysed. Cities and towns too are facing traffic accidents and people are being horned by stray bulls. India's 'stray' cattle population is believed to have hit 5.2 million, and Maharashtra alone is estimated to have 7.5 lakh heads roaming untended on the roads.

A frustrated sub-divisional magistrate from Aligarh, A K Sharma, summed up the crisis thus: ""Once a cow stops giving milk, they leave it on the streets. We have to rescue cattle and transport them to overflowing gaushalas.""

Dairy farming disrupted

The crisis we see in Aligarh and elsewhere is a fallout of the disruption of the dairy economy by last year's ban on trade and sale of cattle. The situation has been aggravated by cow vigilantism, where gangs of extortionists have attacked dairy farmers. The crisis was triggered with the notification of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Regulation of Livestock Market) Rules on May 23 last year, which banned sale of cattle for slaughter in animal markets. It was withdrawn in October 2017 and a fresh watered down draft issued in April this year.

Arvind Subramanian, then Chief Economic Advisor when the 2017 ban was first imposed, broke ranks with the government and said that if the farmer was not able to sell his less productive cattle for meat, it would lead to dairy farming becoming uneconomical. He also warned: ""Stray cattle, and a lot of it, will have to be looked after, otherwise diseases (foot and mouth) could spread, leading to health hazards and social costs."" Subramanian's warning is now playing out.

Ban policies and cow vigilantism have knocked the bottom off the normal cycle of the dairy economy. The milch cow has a normal productive period of eight to nine years, after which the farmer sells his aged stock and uses the money to renew his herd. The old stock earlier went to abattoirs as meat or as hides for the leather industry. It's like selling your old car, investing a little more, and buying a new one. Abattoirs are now closed and for the dairy farmer, this 'resale' option is not there. Expectedly, prices of cattle of all varieties have plummeted.

Thus, the farmer has no investible surplus to renew his livestock; and to add insult to injury, he is now saddled with unproductive cows he is forced to feed. The only option he has is to dump his old herd on the roads or in someone else's field.

Rollback necessary

After Bulandshar, where cow vigilantes lynched a police officer, it is Aligarh. And these are warning signals the Centre can scarcely afford to ignore. India is too diverse a country to be foisted with a unitary diktat on food habits and cultural norms. Beef is consumed by over 80 million Indians as a staple diet and 12.5 million of these are Hindus. In the seven north-east states as well as Kerala and Goa, beef is sold openly and there is no ban on cow slaughter.

But more than pleas for diversity, it is economics that must prevail. Despite all the brouhaha, India is the world's second largest beef exporter in 2018, accounting for 1.9 million tonnes. Over two decades, it has increased its milk production tenfold to 185 MT a year; and by 2020, it is all set to overtake the European Union as the largest dairying nation. To disrupt all this by restricting bovine trade is to hit jobs and farm incomes.

It is time that some of these trading and cattle restrictions were rolled back. Supporting ill and ageing livestock can be crueler. Thousands of cows have died in ill-equipped and overcrowded gaushalas. People's sentiments have to be respected and there should be no open display of slaughter and sale in Hindu localities, but at the same time shackling Indian agriculture to religious bigotry is not an option."

To cope with the situation, two sections of each class are clubbed and taught together. Further, students are compelled to sit on carpets to make optimum usage of space.

The school, which was constructed in 1995, has 306 children studying in classes 1 to 5. It has 10 sections, but only five classrooms to accommodate the strength. Two out of these five classrooms also function as the school's kitchen, administrative room, and a store house.

Pardeep Kumar, administrative head of the school, admitted that the institution was suffering for lack of classrooms. ""One single room functions as the kitchen, where mid-day meals are stored, school's record room, and even a classroom. We have very little space for construction of additional classrooms. We are not sure if more floors can be added to the current structure since it is old and already deteriorating. We don't even have a playground,"" said Kumar.

Vanshika Singh, a Class 5 student, said that she and other classmates had to sit on the floor during classes. ""I sit on a carpet that is spread over the floor. We don't have benches for all the classes,"" she said. The 11-year-old added that the school did not have enough play area. ""During the lunch break, the small courtyard area gets too crowded. There are far too many children and sometimes they even get hurt while trying to play in the limited space,"" added Singh.

Kumar, however, said that the school was trying to make the optimum usage of whatever little resources it had. ""We only have benches in two classrooms. In the remaining three classes, we use carpets so that more students can be adjusted in one class. During summer, at times, we move one section outside to study on the verandah, and students from the other section study inside the classroom,"" explained Kumar.

Apart from the space constraints, the school is grappling with crumbling infrastructure. Students study in classrooms where the walls are cracked, with plaster peeling off their surface, and ceilings that have been water-damaged. The portion of the school that houses the washrooms is also in a bad state, and is enclosed by a broken wall.

Kumar said that the school had recently received funds for routine repairs and work would be initiated during the upcoming holidays. ""The routine repairs will be taken care of, but the school should be given a new and bigger space for it to overcome the space crunch. The school needs a bigger space to operate and accommodate the increasing number of students,"" said Kumar.

Meanwhile, district elementary education officer Premlata Yadav said that the education department had not received any complaints pertaining to the matter of space crunch from the school. ""We will look into the matter if we receive a formal complaint. We have already directed funds for routine repair work,"" said Yadav."

For the last few years, 30-year-old Vashi resident Arvin David, who runs the music company Connect, has been introducing students with hearing loss to the beats of the djembe -- a rope-tuned goblet drum with origins in West Africa. To accomplish this, he invented the ""vibration box"" -- a two-seater box, made with wood of a particular thickness and width, inside which speakers are placed. David's djembe is connected to the speakers via a wireless microphone. He is not alone. Breach Candy resident Nicole Fernandes recently started an electronic keyboard tutorial on YouTube, Music For The Deaf.

Kirsten Varela has turned his backyard into a no-frills calisthenics park and christened it Elysium, a place of perfect happiness. ""The best part about calisthenics is that it's mainly 90 per cent upper body,"" he says. ""Calisthenics is mixing your body with movements like mobility, stability and just trying to create a beautiful movement.""

This year saw the launch of apps like Delta, which are LGBTQ friendly, and Tinder also opened up its platform to be more inclusive. As they opened up to us, members of the LGBTQ told us why dating apps, which helped them personalise their needs, gave them an opportunity to look for exactly what they want.

The project will record and archive stories of Indian citizens who've witnessed India through two centuries, using oral history and material memories.

They are very young, but that doesn't stop them from giving their thousands of followers advice on issues ranging from exam stress to mental health to suicide. India's young Instagrammers, themselves vocal about their problems, make themselves relatable to their followers. They address the fans' issues through their posts, live streams (where they take questions), YouTube channel, and also private messages. As we enter 2019, they get even more important than ever before.

Punyakoti -- the first crowdsourced attempt at making a full-length 2D animated film in Sanskrit -- has reached its post production stage and will release in 2019. Over 100 people from across the country have collaborated on the project, including actor Revathi, music maestro Ilaiyaraja, National award-winning editor Manoj Kannath and puppeteers Anupama and Vidyashankar Hoskere.

Sensing the growing homophobia in schools, former student Kabir Karamchandani formed a support group titled Garv in February to address the issue. While the 20-year-old may be miles away, pursuing his higher education in Oberlin, Ohio, his legacy is being carried forward by a dedicated team of 'woke' boys and girls. Interestingly, the Garv initiative might be included as a case study in a large scale survey conducted by Humsafar Trust on bullying in schools.

In October, the Diss track trend hit India when Mumbai underground rapper Emiway took on popular singer Raftaar. When rapper Raftaar said in an interview that there was no money to be made in underground rapping and named Emiway, the 22-year-old Mumbai rapper released a diss track called Samajh Mein Aaya Kya trying to address the issue. Then Raftaar released a song, then Emiway released another... well, you get the drift. What makes it good for you is that you can follow them and enjoy some quality music.

You browse the website and find a suitable storage plan, then order as many boxes as you need, and then pack and label your belongings.

What is it about Ludo King that has made it beat Temple Run, Candy Crush and Pokemon Go, to become the No. 1 free game on both Google Play Store and App Store? We dug deep to find out how this trend has seamlessly penetrated the lower rungs of the socio-economic segment, galvanising a strata that hadn't warmed up to digital games. Raamesh Gowri Raghavan, an ancient Indian games researcher and professor of archaeology at Mumbai University, believes the game has an innately competitive element which makes it addictive.

If recruitment is through word of mouth, so are contracts, which means you can order from them, too.

Makarand Deshpande, the maverick playwright, finished his 50th original script, Epic Gadbad, marking a milestone in a glorious journey onstage. A farce, it is a conclusion to his previous play, Shakespearecha Mhatara, which was a hilarious take on King Lear. While it was first staged at Prithvi Theatre in July 2018, the playwright has plans to bring it back to the city in 2019 as well.

In 2018, the iconic theatre group Awishkar Theatre brought Aranya Kiran directed by Ajit Bhagat. The play, staged 10 years after the death of its late director-playwright Chetan Datar, is set in the Mahabharata. It revolves around a self-questioning Lord Krishna (played by Sushil Inamdar) in Dwarka. The string of monologues with various lead characters -- wife Rukmini, brother Balaram, foster parents Nand and Yashoda and lastly, mother-like Gandhari -- interrogate Krishna's trickery, political moves and worldview. The play is still being staged and the next show is in January itself.

A publishing house that started a reading movement back in the '70s, is set for a new innings to revive the language of its people. The publishing house was launched in 1974 by journalists Ashok Jain, Dinkar Gangal, Arun Sadhu and Kumar Ketkar, who created an informal organisation to spread the culture of reading among Marathi speakers. Over the years, it has seen several members come and go and even survived a slump.

Suyash Rawat, a 32-year-old emergency medical practitioner, has set up Mumbai's first surf school, along with Krishna Lamani, who previously worked as an instructor at the Kovalam Surf Club. Rajori beach enjoys a kilometre-long stretch of grey sand and is a perfect place if you are still at an introductory stage. Call a day prior for weather conditions.

When Aneesh Bhasin, co-founder at Svami, told us his tonic water has 50 per cent fewer calories than Schweppes, its main competitor, we knew the way we had our gin and tonic was going to change forever. Made from quinine sourced from Congo, cucumber and lime from India, and grapefruit from the US, Bhasin has increased the carbonation over the months because ""Indians like their fizz"". Svami is getting ready to launch more flavours, and a ginger ale by February.

The backstory behind booze

What and Where: White Lady cocktail at The Bombay Canteen; Chanel No. 6 at House of Nomads; Sherlock In A Pickle at London Taxi; and Red Monsoon at Hakkasan

This year, Yash Bhanage, co-owner at The Bombay Canteen, and his research team soaked themselves in the history of single screen theatres as inspiration for cocktails. Not just them, several other bartenders tried to create a story out of their cocktails. For instance, Jiaan Kris J Lam, House of Nomads, created Chanel No. 6 (in pic) as an ode to the fashion house, and Ami Shroff at London Taxi, whipped up a Sherlock-inspired drink which stood out for its prominent notes of gherkin, tea and rose. Order a glass.

At, Harajuku, on Chapel Road, co-owner Saleha Bawazir wanted to bring the street food of Harajuku to Mumbai. So, the restaurant offers a wide range of sweet and savoury crepes; Dorayakis, palm-sized treats comprising a sweet filling sandwiched between two round cakes, among other things. Vikram Khatri, executive chef at Hello Guppy, also overhauled the menu to introduce a range of new items including caramelised popcorn with crispy bacon, beetroot rice cracker and tuna nachos pizza. ""Everybody knows about sushi and ramen. It was time to educate people that there's a lot more that comes from Japan,"" he says.

Inspired by the legendary wrestler, Mini Punjab introduced The Dara Singh thali on its menu this year. Not for the weak-hearted, it packs in the best of unlimited eating. It features 33 items, and includes aloo paratha, chur chur de naan, makki di roti, murg mussalam rice, lamb yoghurt curry, chicken Amritsari and more. If you're in for a man-versus-food contest, here's your best bet.

Development consultant Ragini Kashyap, who started Third Culture Cooks -- a multinational supper club -- likes to tell a story with a bite. Her venture, Bordered dinner, explores border conflict by pairing food with peoples' stories and history. We sampled the Tamil-Sinhala conflict in Sri Lanka, and returned knowing a lot more about our neighbour's culinary diversity.

If you are severely intolerant to gluten, there is a chance you have stayed away from vodka, which is made from wheat, barley, or rye. Well, Tito's Handmade Vodka that is produced in Austin at Texas's oldest legal distillery is now available in Mumbai. The drink is made using corn. Tito Beveridge, who came up with the recipe, distilled the corn mash six times, because it was believed that corn retains some of its smoothness even after distillation. The process of making the corn-based vodka is similar to that of the making of single malts and high-end French cognacs.

It's not every day that you come across pepper in your pannacota, which is why pastry chef Husna Jumani's timut-infused creamy Italian dessert is noteworthy. It's the pronounced flavour of the Nepalese pepper -- spicy with hints of grapefruit -- that propelled her to pick this as the hero ingredient. However, it is an acquired taste, she warns.

The ingredients of Du Rhone might be a well-kept secret, but not its stellar reputation. So when the 140-year-old gourmet chocolate brand opened their first store in May this year, we were the first to rush for a blind tasting evening. Our favourite was the Coline which is a dark ganache with 70 per cent cocoa beans from Brazil and Papua New Guinea.

The last one year saw a rise in the number of gourmet delivery joints in the city. The menu at these kitchens range from Bento Buddha bowls to coconut-panko crusted shrimps with orange and ginger dips. The food, then, is the biggest selling point. We'd recommend the Mis Malaysian Seafood Bisque from Hello Green.

The wandering Maharaj is invited for weddings and funerals, casual get-togethers and Diwali dos, any affair in which the party size is too significant for a regular cook, and when guests need to be impressed. Om Maharaj specialises in sweets, such as rasgulla and ghevar; and Lallan Maharaj, who has also trained in restaurants and five-stars for 13 years, can be trusted to pull off Italian and Chinese dishes convincingly. Lallan says, ""In this line of work, the person who knows his job, doesn't need the title. I have not kept my name maharaj. It's all of you who call me maharajji. So, now, it has become a surname.""

From kombucha to vegetable broth, mixologists discuss what you can replace your calorie-laden mixer with. The almond milk soda cocktail at Colaba's Bombay Vintage has an interesting backstory. Here, Sean Pereira, bar operations manager, uses doodh soda consumed by farmers in Peshawar to keep themselves hydrated.

A food service in Bandra has been made special by autistic students, who have donned chefs' hats to make the lunch break worthwhile. The students belong to the Support for Autistic Individuals (SAI), a charitable trust set up by Kamini Lakhani and her husband, Anil. The young autistic cooks need a fair amount of support. ""It will take them anywhere between one and eight months for them to understand all the steps,"" says Lakhani.

What can you expect when the power couple behind The Table teams up with the boys behind The Woodside Inn? Miss T, a gastro Asian cocktail bar and restaurant. Every cocktail we sampled was characterised by an adventurous, refreshing and comforting tag. The Quixotic (R850) came with peanut butter-infused Jim Beam bourbon, hints of saffron and orange bitters. In the food menu, we liked the chicken and tender coconut curry (R900) that came with pandan rice. The curry was light without lacking depth. We liked the food for its simple execution of flavours and lack of pretentiousness, which is just what an Asian meal should be.

One of Goa's most loved restaurants, House of Lloyd, made its Mumbai debut this year. We met the chef for a taste of the Goa-inspired menu. He has selected the choicest of dishes including rassa omelette, pork chops and clams masala. Now you know where to head for a susegad experience.

Chef Scott Linquist (who runs the Miami favourite Coyo Taco) and Jason Hudanish introduced chapulines or grasshoppers as an off-the-menu dish at Mexican restaurant Xico. The grasshoppers don't have a distinct taste and the texture is close to crunchy prawns. A rich source of protein, you can either eat the dried grasshoppers directly, or on tortilla.

Shunned by society, trans-women have found jobs sans judgment at Third Eye Café. We visited the restaurant to find a place that serves decent food, and the opportunity to the third gender to lead a respectable life. Spread over eleven pages, the menu offers Italian, Oriental and Indian cuisine.

A hoppumm is a marriage between Sri Lanka's hoppers, a type of fermented pancakes, and South Indian appams, and three school friends from Bombay Scottish brought it to Bandra this year. Hoppumm is a 15-seater restaurant, exuding architectural influences from Sri Lanka. The highlight is the bowl-shaped Sri Lankan pancakes filled with a range of fragrant curries. To make it flexible, they offer combinations where you can pair a base staple -- hopper, string hopper (idiyappam), neer dosa, paratha or kothu roti -- with a flavourful filling.

Mastani is a milkshake that comes topped with a dollop of hand-churned ice cream. Some people also add fresh cut fruits, dry fruits and whipped cream. It is believed that when guests tried it for the first time, they would exclaim 'masta'. It has become a part of Pune's food heritage, and you can now try it at a tiny dessert parlour in Vile Parle called Karandikar Mastani House. A simple store with a couple of chairs, this Mastani house offers eight flavours starting from mango to the interesting Irish pudding Mastani.

Chembur, the eastern suburb which last made headlines for a culinary reason in November 2016 when Matunga's iconic eatery Mani's Lunch Home moved here, is now in the midst of a hospitality boom. Want to spend a day indulging your cravings? Do it with as few steps as possible as you start off with Pot Pourri, Theobroma, then 99 Pancakes, Keventers, London Bubble Co, The Koffee Works, Wok Hei and then China Villa.

Did you know that the hair dryer, apart from blowing hair, can be used to relight charcoals on the grill, soften chocolate and frost cake? Chefs across Mumbai are putting non-kitchen items to good use. The stand out was Empresa Hotel chef Ajay Chopra's ingenious hack of using a coal iron to press a quesadilla. Book a table to see for yourself."

Some teachers have opposed this decision and have informed the education ministry to refine the current state of government-aided schools, instead of focussing on starting new ones.

The current state of government-aided schools is shoddy,"" averred teachers and principals alike. Various school principals have revealed that for several months, the government has stopped providing adequate funds, leading to a financial crisis. Maintenance charges, bills, basic supply lines and even salary payments have not been facilitated by the state.

More importantly, the syllabus and curriculum has not been revised for years, according to teachers. It is the same old pattern of teaching and rote learning, teachers lament. Sukhmani Pandey, a teacher said, ""The lessons, poems and chapters have been based on the same pattern for years. There is no addition of new technologies, experimental learning, personality skills, life lessons or practical concepts.""

Creative and interactive teaching-learning concepts are absent, as state-board curriculum is based on book learning and classroom lessons. Jasmeet Barbara, a teacher said, ""For want of a practical approach, we have to stick to textbooks for lessons, there is no way to explain concepts to students through life models. This makes learning boring for students, as their attention span is minimum and there is no creative input at all.""

Outdoor education, practical focus and interactive lessons will improve the standards of state board curriculum. Shabnam Quesreshi, a senior teacher said, ""If we add few elements like interactive and fun learning, outside classroom teaching and practical application of theories, then we can match the style of international curriculum. We should formulate and teach the syllabus according to the primary needs of students so that we make it fun for them and increase their interest in state board schools."""

So he gave himself a new identity: IAS officer Vishal Kumar.

For several months, this 'officer' -- who identified himself as a district magistrate, spoke in a rasping tone and was unusually forthright in telling government officials which issue to take up and what to ignore -- managed to keep up the ruse of authority. But the bubble had to burst and it did on Saturday when police saw Tyagi for who he was. Head down, handcuffed, visibly afraid, and stripped of his manufactured IAS trappings, Tyagi was marched by a posse of policemen into Badalpur police station and booked under sections 419 (impersonating) and 420 (cheating) of the IPC, which carries a maximum prison term of seven years.

Tyagi was arrested from Dujana village in Greater Noida, where he was hiding. Police said he was trying to get work done in favour of people known to him in exchange for money.

Tyagi, a resident of Sahibabad, would call up senior officials with authority to take decisions in any government department if someone paid him enough to get his work done. A driver by profession, he would identify himself as Vishal Kumar, a 2005-batch IAS officer of the Rajasthan cadre, and get directives passed in his favour.

Police said he was enjoying this authority for the past several months until he dialled the number of SP (rural) Vineet Jaiswal last week. Tyagi wanted Jaiswal to clear the papers for a car that his friend Chaman wanted to sell. In the process, he gave away.

""His language was quite unbecoming of a senior official. He would identify himself as a district magistrate, but would never name the district. He would say he is a DM from Rajasthan. I doubted his intentions when he called me up to get a work as minor as getting approval for a car's papers done,"" Jaiswal said.

According to the officer, Tyagi had made calls to the income tax, land revenue and transport departments. At times, he would call up station house officers of various police stations and allegedly get them to drop cases against his acquaintances.

Tyagi's orders raised more eyebrows when he called up the SHO of Badalpur police station a few days back.

""He had been calling repeatedly for a minor case to be resolved. I doubted him by the way he spoke over the phone. My suspicion became stronger when he mentioned the batch year (2005) when I asked him about his state cadre. I asked an officer to put his mobile phone on surveillance. He was tracked and then arrested,"" Jaiswal said.

Tyagi charged a fee for getting orders passed and hurdles cleared for his friends. ""Police are tracking his bank accounts and other financial details,"" Jaiswal said. He graduated from LR College in Sahibabad last year. His mother is a primary teacher in a private school in Ghaziabad and his father works with a CA firm.

""Police have recovered a mobile phone from him. But the phone is not the one with which he would make the calls. We are examining his call records. He had made calls to the income tax, sales and several other departments,"" Jaiswal said. ""When he was questioned, he vehemently denied all the allegations against him. Then, he confessed to the crime,"" the SP added.

Tyagi, however, has an IAS connection, distant though it may be. His employer -- he works as a driver -- is the brother of a 2016-batch IAS officer of Tripura cadre."

Amidst the speculations on bleak chances of survival of miners trapped in a tunnel like space under 70-feet water, the rescuers recovered three helmets, which are suspected to be of those miners. However, family members of those trapped are still hopeful that miners would be taking shelter in wind-chambers inside the tunnels.

The Navy divers started preparations to navigate the rat-hole coalmines to descend into the coal pit where 15 miners are suspected to have been trapped in some wind pockets. Sources engaged in the rescue operations told this newspaper that biggest challenge before the rescue team is to navigate the rat-hole mines, as there is no information or map is available about the tunnels in which mining activities were going on.

The chief fire officer of Odisha Mr Sukant Sethi, who is leading 21-member team of rescuers said, ""Initially we were told that we would be travelling by trucks. Then the plan was changed and it was decided that dumpers would be used to shift the equipment to the accident site.""

He regretted that by the time they reached a primary school (located 25 km from the mine) where they were supposed to spend the night it was very late in the night and no body was there to help them for basic needs.

Informing that they have already started work, he however clarified that even after all these logistic challenges, they have started work on installing pumps to flush out water. He said that Indian navy divers are also working out strategy in consultation with experts of the Coal India.

The 15 miners have been trapped in a 370-feet deep illegal rat-hole mine in Lumthari village since December 13, when water from the nearby River Lytein flooded the mine.

Meanwhile, a six-member team of the Opposition Congress in Meghalaya visited the site and found several lacunae in the arrangements made by the district administration. The legislators led by Ampareen Lyngdoh expressed their surprise over district magistrate FM Dopth going on leave in spite of the tragedy of such a scale. ""Precious lives are at stake but the officer in-charge of the rescue operations has been allowed to go on leave,"" she said, demanding that the district magistrate be immediately recalled."

But being a breadwinner came at the cost for the young shepherd: his unannounced engagement, based on his tribe's tradition.

At 10, Gulzar barely remembers the last visit to his native village. He doesn't even remember the last time he has taken a holiday. Nor does he remember if his father had sought his opinion when he was engaged to a young girl in his village.

Every morning, he leaves his home with a flock of sheep for the nearby hills and returns when the sun sets. He has been hired to take care of the sheep and to ensure that the flock is fully grazed. In Kashmir, the people working in this field are called pahel (shepherds).

And Gulzar is one!

He routinely carries a long stick and wears an effortless smile. But Gulzar's boyish appearance conceals his helplessness and compulsion.

FPK Photo/Ifham Islam.

In 1986, Indian Parliament passed a law, prohibiting the employment of children aged below 14, and an amendment in 2016 has made it an offence with imprisonment of up to 2 years and a fine of up to Rs. 50,000.

But Gulzar's case is a bit different.

The minor has an aged father and is the oldest among the three brothers and two elder sisters, one of whom is getting married next year.

He hails from Frastdab, a small hamlet tucked some 20 kms from Chrar-e-Sharief, a town in central Kashmir's Budgam district. The village receives almost 4-5 feet of snowfall every winter. And all the outdoor activities are halted until the snow melts in early spring.

Sporting a white thick beard, his father Muhammad Sultan is an occasional farmer. Their village offers fewer opportunities for the people to work. And Gulzar's father, who's in his mid-seventies, needs regular healthcare. He does not have the strength to deal with daily long commutes, thus making Gulzar as the default breadwinner for the family.

Indian federal government runs a social assistance programme called Indira Gandhi Old Age Pension Scheme with the help from the state governments. The programme is supposed to benefit the people living below the poverty line.

The scheme offers Rs. 200 a month to a person in the age group of 60-79 years and Rs. 500 per month to the people aged 80 years and above. In the financial year of 2016-17, a total of Rs. 5901 crore were spent for this programme.

Surprisingly, the flour in Kashmir costs around Rs. 300-400 per 10 kg, depending on the quality that a buyer wants to purchase. And Rs. 200 a month will not suffice even for the monthly ration needs of Sultan's family.

People like Sultan, who live in a far-flung area, do not know about these schemes and if some of them do, they don't pay attention because of the lengthy process and corruption involved. The administration often turns a blind eye towards it.

In Frastdab, it's a tradition that if you are giving your daughter in marriage to a family, you have to get theirs as well.

Gulzar's sister is getting married next year; the person who she is getting married to is her own cousin. Her father has made a deal with her future in-laws that he would give his daughter in marriage only if they give their own in exchange for his 10-year-old Gulzar.

Since they agreed to the demand, the 10-year-old shepherd is engaged now! His fiancé is 2 years younger than him.

Gulzar's father does not want his son to be ""spoilt"" in the village surroundings. And now that Gulzar is engaged, his father has handed him in apprenticeship to Akbar Dar, a butcher in Nagam town, a place that is some 16 kms from the city centre. And the deal is, the young boy will stay with him all along the year.

In return, Dar has to pay an annual salary of Rs. 40,000 and has to bear all the expenses of Gulzar's accommodation, food, clothes, etc.

In turn, Gulzar has to herd the sheep that Dar sells on his mutton shop. The little shepherd only stays at home only when its rain or snowing. He also helps Dar on his mutton shop.

Mushtaq, Gulzar's supervisor and the butcher's son, says that he had advised Gulzar's father that he wasn't doing the right thing by engaging him so early.

But Sultan fears that if he delays the engagement of his son, his in-laws may refuse to marry their daughter afterwards.

Interestingly, before taking care of Dar's livestock, Gulzar used to herd sheep for a professional shepherd. The work continued only in springs and autumns. For the rest of the year, he used to sit idle.

But working with the shepherd was not an easy job for him. He had to go deep into the forests in search of grass. And sometimes he would be so frightened that he would run away from his work. ""The salary with the shepherd was Rs. 4500 a month and now it's Rs. 40,000 a year,"" says Gulzar in a muffled tone.

Dar provides continuous work in all the four seasons which makes him feel less vulnerable and gives him some sort of monetary independence. The continual work has made him so confident that the young shepherd says that he himself is going to purchase the jewelry and clothes for his sister's wedding.

Barely knowing how to read and write, Gulzar who's never been to even a primary school laughs at the prospects of schooling for him in future. Behind his smiling face, he conveniently conceals his compulsion. But, his fiancé goes to school, where she is still learning Addition and Subtraction. Gulzar, however, has no idea what class she studies in.

He has seen his fiancé just because she is his cousin otherwise he might not had the privilege of knowing her before marriage. Gulzar complains that he was informed casually about his engagement. Nobody had asked him whether he wanted it or not. ""But, what can I do now?"" the shepherd smiles.

The Indian Navy divers armed with special diving equipment including re-compression chamber and remotely operated vehicles capable of searching underwater, joined the operation to rescue 15 miners in the East Jaintia Hills district in Meghalaya.

Amidst the speculations on bleak chances of survival of miners trapped in a tunnel like space under 70-feet water, the rescuers recovered three helmets, which are suspected to be of the miners.

However, family members of those trapped are still hopeful that miners would be taking shelter in wind-chambers inside the tunnels.

The Navy divers started preparations to navigate the rat-hole coalmines to descend into the coal pit where 15 miners are suspected to have been trapped in some wind pockets.

Sources engaged in the rescue operations told Deccan Chronicle that biggest challenge before the rescue team is to navigate the rat-hole mines, as there is no information or map available about the tunnels in which mining activities were going on.

Meanwhile, the state administration was also accused to have failed in coordinating the movement of the rescue team, which landed at Guwahati Airport on Friday.

The chief fire officer of Odisha Sukant Sethi, who is leading 21-member team of rescuers said, ""Initially we were told that we would be travelling by trucks. Then the plan was changed and it was decided that dumpers would be used to shift the equipment to the accident site.""

He regretted that by the time they reached a primary school (located 25 km from the mine) where they were supposed to spend the night it was very late and no body was there to help them with basic needs.

""There was no food, blankets or beds for the men to take few hours of rest. We are not used to such cold temperatures in Odisha and had to rush for our mission without carrying enough warm clothes and bedding,"" he added.

The team of rescuers is carrying 10 high-powered pumps to flush out water from the mine.

Informing that they have already started work, he however clarified that even after all these logistic challenges, they have started work on installing pumps to flush out water.

He said that Indian Navy divers are also working out strategy in consultation with experts of the Coal India.

The 15 miners have been trapped in a 370-feet deep illegal rat-hole mine in Lumthari village since December 13, when water from the nearby River Lytein flooded the mine.

Meanwhile, a six-member team of the Opposition Congress in Meghalaya visited the site and found several lacunae in the arrangements made by the district administration.

The legislators led by Ampareen Lyngdoh expressed surprise over district magistrate FM Dopth going on leave in spite of the tragedy of such a scale.

""Precious lives are at stake but the officer in-charge of the rescue operations has been allowed to go on leave,"" she said, demanding that the district magistrate be immediately recalled."

MLA and former Minister S.A.

National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) Assistant Commandant Santosh Kumar Singh, who is overseeing operations at the rat hole coal mine. said a three member team of the Indian Navy visited the site.""They did a recce of the spot, spent 30 minutes inside the main pit.

The water levels inside the mine remains unchanged, he said.

Ace diver Jaswant Singh Gill from Amritsar with prior experience of saving miners in West Bengal was again at the coal mine today.

A team of Odisha fire and emergency services, who finally reached the spot, tried to install their high-powered pumps. ""They may be operational by tomorrow,"" Singh said.

""Pumps and other machinery are being installed at the site. Everyone is working overtime with extreme dedication and zeal as our mission is to save lives. That is our top priority,"" East Jaiñtia Hills district police chief Silvester Nongtnger told Hindustan Times.

He aid that after all the gear has been installed and put into place on Saturday night, rescue operations will begin on Sunday morning. ""We will start right from the first hour itself.""

The initial rescue operation to help the miners started on December 14 once the NDRF and SDRF teams arrived. On December 17, a team of Directorate General of Mine Safety along with Coal India officials arrived and suggested 100 HP submersible pumps be used. The district administration wrote to the state government seeking immediate help from Coal India on December 20. However, it was only on December 26 that Coal India received a request from state government for assistance.

The rescue operation launched by the state government had to be stopped as the pumps were not adequate to flush out large volumes of water. The state government then sough Centre's help and high-powered pumps and a team was dispatched from Odisha.

But due to total lack of coordination and support from the local administration in Meghalaya, the arrival of 21-member team was delayed.

The team reached Guwahati on Friday morning around 11:30 am, but due to lack of transport provided by Meghalaya they had to wait till 5:45 pm to start their 220 km journey to the mine.

""Initially we were told that we would be travelling by trucks. Then the plan was changed and it was decided that dumpers would be used to shift the equipment to the accident site,"" said Sukant Sethi, Chief Fire Officer (Odisha), who is leading the team.

""By the time we reached a primary school (located 25 km from the mine) where we were supposed to spend the night it was 2 am on Saturday. There was no person from Meghalaya government's side who helped us with basic needs,"" Sethi said.

Despite the problems faced by them, the team was keen to reach the spot soon to help the trapped miners. They finally reached around 1 pm on Saturday

Another aspect of seemingly lukewarm response by the government has emerged. Tata Trusts had offered to lend two pumps which it had airlifted from London to augment rescue efforts during the Kerala floods to Meghalaya but till date, there has been no response from the government.

Efforts to reach Peter W Ingty, additional chief secretary in-charge revenue and disaster management by Hindustan Times proved futile as he did not respond to calls."

Although the Uttar Pradesh basic education department has been talking about higher school enrolments, what takes away from their claims is the huge dropout rate witnessed in the state, especially at the elementary level.

Now, a primary school has decided to combat this issue in its own unique way. The school's 'Bal Sansad' is doubling up as the 'Santa squad' this festive season, conducting a door-to-door drive to get back dropouts and classmates who have been irregular.

Students of the primary school in village Lakhesar of Jaunpur district have used this Christmas to make guardians of their former classmates and other irregular students understand the importance of education. In this direction, they have also created a small informative pamphlet that urges parents to send their children to school.

Headmaster Ramesh Chandra Yadav said that one of the reasons why the dropout rate at the school was high was its location. ""The school is situated in a remote part and the terrain is tough. As a result, attendance and retention figures have been suffering.""

However, members of the 'Santa squad' are now out to change this.

Harshit of Class 5, president of the Bal Sansad, Saumya of Class 5, vice president, Vanshi of Class 4, health and hygiene minister, Anshika of Class 4, education minister, Chandni of Class 5, cultural minister and Sohani of Class 4, environment minister, have taken up the responsibility to get students back to school.

""On Christmas Day and since then, we have been going out in the afternoon, with our teachers Shivam Singh and Mukesh Dubey, to convince villagers to send their children to school,"" said Harshit and Saumya.

Chandni and Sohani added that it had been a learning experience for them as well -- convincing elders and classmates on how important it was to attend classes daily.

""In the process, the squad succeeded in bringing back12 students -- 10who had been irregular and two dropouts,"" informed Shivam Singh, teacher.

Appreciating the idea of forming a 'Santa squad', village head Nisha Tiwari has promised to help the school improve its infrastructure, including construction of better toilets and getting a projector to facilitate lectures. ""With her help, the school will soon have new and better facilities,"" said a teacher.

The headmaster said that the goal of the 'Santa squad' wasto build confidence among students and guardians, strengthen teacher-student relationship, create a positive atmosphere for promoting education, and improve student retention and attendance.

According to available data, the Net Enrolment Rate (NER) in UP at the elementary level is 79.86% -- 9 percentage points lower than the all India average of 88.94%. The state has an annual dropout rate of 8.58% at the primary level -- the 6th highest in the country and more than double the all India average of 4.13%. Also, the state's primary to upper-primary transition rate of 79.1% is the 4th lowest in the country -- 11.04 percentage points below the national average of 90.14%."

But due to total lack of coordination and support from the local administration in Meghalaya, the 21-member team which left Bhubaneswar on Friday is yet to reach the site in East Jaintia Hills district where the miners are trapped.

The team equipped with 10 high-powered pumps to flush out water from the mine reached Guwahati on Friday morning around 11:30 am, but due to lack of transport provided by Meghalaya they had to wait till 5:45 pm to start their 220 km journey.

""Initially we were told that we would be travelling by trucks. Then the plan was changed and it was decided that dumpers would be used to shift the equipment to the accident site, said Sukant Sethi, Chief Fire Officer (Odisha), who is leading the team.

(Click here for live updates on the trapped miners)

""By the time we reached a primary school (located 25 km from the mine) where we were supposed to spend the night it was 2:00 am on Saturday. There was no person from Meghalaya government's side who helped us with basic needs,"" Sethi said.

""There was no food, blankets or beds for the men to take few hours of rest. We are not used to such cold temperatures in Odisha and had to rush for our mission without carrying enough warm clothes and bedding,"" he added.

Despite the problems faced by them, the team wants to reach the spot soon to help the trapped miners. But the Meghalaya government was yet to send transport to carry the men and equipment to the site on Saturday morning.

""It's 8:00 am already on Saturday. We have been told that some vehicles are on the way to the school where we are staying, but they haven't reached yet. What is more surprising is that there is no Meghalaya government officer who is coordinating with us,"" Sethi said.

HT caught up with additional chief secretary, PW Ingty to find out the reason for the delay but he couldn't throw much light. ""The team has just left and they're on their way now,"" he said over phone adding that since he was travelling he didn't have much information.

When contacted, East Jaiñtia Hills district police chief Silvester Nongtnger said the onus of arranging vehicles etc. lies with the DC and not him. ""Please ask the DC or the ADM in charge,"" he told HT over phone from Khliehriat the district headquarters.

Following the mode of campaigns run by privately-managed educational institutions, government schools across the state have started a massive advertising campaign ahead of commencement of the new academic session on January 1, featuring achievements and facilities of the schools.

Sources in the education department said the state government's recent decision to provide annual administrative grants to schools on the basis of enrolled positions has added an impetus to this campaign.

Banners portraying facilities and accomplishments at entrances of schools has become a common sight. Some school authorities have also launched a social media campaign, named Utsav Vidyarambha, an annual enrolment drive conducted every year with the help of local community and students, to enhance enrolment in schools.

""From this year, the publicity campaign for Utsav Vidyarambha has been launched on a massive scale. The prime thrust is to change the prevailing notion of most guardians that the quality of education in the state-government schools are not at par with private schools. Let's spread the message that trained and qualified teachers are imparting education in government-run schools and the admissions as well as other facilities are totally free for the newly enrolled kids at the primary level,"" a senior official of the education department told TOI on Friday.

Checking the decrease in enrolment, something which was detected as a major worry in Gunotsav, is the primary agenda behind launching such a publicity campaign, he added.

As per the new guidelines, schools with enrolment of 60 or below will not get any financial support, schools having enrolment of 61 to 400 will get financial support of Rs 20,000, schools having enrolment of 401 to 600 will get financial support of Rs 25,000 and schools having enrolment of more than 600 will get financial support of Rs 35,000."

A real estate agent remade himself as CoinDaddy, producing cryptocurrency-themed music videos. Kids barely out of high school were buying Lamborghinis because of a crypto meme. Experts went on CNBC to say Bitcoin was going to reach $100,000 per coin.

For a few sweet months of 2018, all of Silicon Valley was wrapped up in a fantasy of remaking the world order with cryptocurrencies and a related technology called the blockchain. And just as the public had been given every possible blockchain explainer that could be written, the whole thing collapsed. The bubble popped.

This December closes out cryptocurrency's most exciting year, ending in a terrible, sober headache of a winter.

Those who have stayed are calling this ""the winter of crypto."" Believers say this is only ""the trough of disillusionment,"" pointing to a chart that posits all new technology goes through a similar trough before exploding into inevitable glory.

Those still chipping away at crypto dreams insist that this is all a good thing because only the serious ones, the true crypto believers, remain. ""It's painful to lose money, but it's a necessary step,"" said Robert Neivert, an investor with venture capital firm 500 Startups. ""2018 was about moving from hype to product.""

This year, the blockchain industry -- a subset of the cryptocurrency industry that would very much like to live on its own -- went through a Cambrian explosion. But first, an explanation of blockchain: A blockchain is a relatively new kind of database that was initially introduced with Bitcoin. It's not the digital currency. It's the underlying technology that helps manage the currency. Most important, it's decentralised so no one person, government or business controls it.

Blockchain became a solution for everything -- blockchain for journalism, for pot, for dentists. At its core was real technological progress and a growing understanding that this decentralised technology could transform financial systems. But the excitement spun out of control.

Even adding the word ""blockchain"" made stock soar. When Long Island Iced Tea Company changed its name to Long Blockchain Company, its stock went up 500 percent in a day. Scammers flooded the space, launching dubious new investment schemes called ""initial coin offerings.""

The computing power needed to ""mine"" a Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency is now sometimes costing more than that coin is worth. Mines -- or electricity-needy data centers -- are shutting down. As demand for Bitcoin has dwindled, Bitcoin's algorithm has adjusted and the coin has become easier to mine.

But this is actually good, crypto experts argue.

""The fact that miners are shutting down and difficulty is decreasing is a feature, not a bug, of Bitcoin's design,"" the venture capitalist Arianna Simpson wrote on Twitter.

Some in the cryptocurrency business would just like the world to know there are still people working on it. Julian Spediacci, a cryptocurrency investor in San Francisco with his twin brother, James, said he would like people to know he identifies as a HODLer, or someone who is not selling despite market fluctuations.

""A lot of people want to find out if we're still alive, so it'd be great to clarify that there are a lot of OG HODLers,"" Mr. Spediacci said, using language common in the crypto industry to indicate he would remain an investor.

""I think we're nearing a bottom,"" his brother said.

Some of the friends they made have left town. The meetups are quieter. The most recent video from the community's primary musical voice, CoinDaddy, né Arya Bahmanyar, is set to the tune of Beatles hit ""Yesterday.""

Not everyone is struggling in the downturn. For lawyers, it is a new gold rush.

""Now that the market dropped, everyone is getting sued,"" said Chante Eliaszadeh, a law student and the president of a blockchain law club called Blockchain at Berkeley Law. She said the legal scene is pretty exciting right now. As the US Securities and Exchange Commission cracks down, some scammers are trying to escape to Bali or Malta, where regulations are more lax.

At one holiday party in Palo Alto this year, the theme was ""real."" Organisers had pasted the motto -- ""Real People, Real Money, Real Deals"" -- on the walls, on boards, on slide shows and handouts.

Moderating a panel was Radhika Iyengar-Emens, a founding partner at a venture firm that specialises in cryptocurrency and blockchain start-ups called StarChain Ventures. ""I think we're going to see a lot of real use cases,"" Ms. Iyengar-Emens said. ""And these guys will be here for those very real use cases.""

A use case would be a regular consumer's being able to use a cryptocurrency to do something other than make a speculative investment.

Kerry Washington, a member of the Litecoin Foundation, talked about a big Litecoin summit this year, which on one slide he specified cost a quarter-million dollars. There, guests could buy candy with Litecoins. This showed everyone how useful Litecoin could be, he said.

The trouble was always that we already have something that lets us buy candy.

An ad played for something called Bitrue, a wallet. It was just a half-dozen people looking straight at the camera saying: ""I trust Bitrue.""

And then Curtis Wang, the chief executive of Bitrue, stood up to announce a very special offer. He could promise investors a 10% annual yield. There was scattered applause in the crowd.

Someone in the audience raised a hand and asked whether that was even legal to offer."

"136","1028453814","2018-12-28","https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/life-in-the-city-5514344/","Life in the City","The Indian Express",FALSE,"A documentary by two Swiss filmmakers, Living with Le Corbusier, discusses the blueprint of Chandigarh and the relationship between architecture and society.

IT was in 2015 when photographer and filmmaker Thomas Karrer, and professor in arts and scenographer Karin Bucher visited Chandigarh for the first time from Trogen in Switzerland, where they live and work in a redeveloped hospital. The two were impressed by the integrity, aesthetics and sculptural appeal of Chandigarh, from the layout of the streets to the houses, colour and design of the government district, public spaces and the green areas. Both, Karrer and Bucher, felt it could be a model for how people live together, how communities are formed and what a good life could be.

''Few Swiss know about Chandigarh, though the portrait of Le Corbusier decorates our 10 Franc banknote. The back of the note has the Secretariat built in 1958 in Chandigarh. A conversation around it, always arouses curiosity and raises controversial opinions. Travel guides describe Chandigarh as a last-ditch attempt to colonise India. In architectural circles, Chandigarh is controversial and is described as concrete poured into a vision that is a failure for everyday life, but the inhabitants lovingly call their Chandigarh, 'The City Beautiful',"" says Bucher.

To pursue these questions, Karrer and Bucher travelled in 2016 to Chandigarh again -- this time with a camera to conduct a short research for their film. ''As ambiguous as Chandigarh is perceived today, the city has raised a number of questions. We wanted answers and the idea of the documentary took shape,"" says Karrer, who has made several films and is currently working on the documentary Between Worlds, about mind healing in Switzerland.

With an artist-in-residence grant from Appenzell Ausserrhodenn in Switzerland, the duo probed how Chandigarh is different from other Indian cities.

''The courage, vision and attitude behind the planning are still noticeable today. As part of our research, script and shooting, we strived to find answers to questions like have the ideas of Le Corbusier to form a new society become real? What remains from Le Corbusier's vision after 70 years? Which ideas have proven to be worthy, which ones haven't? Can cultures meet, enrich and inspire each other for further development? Can a European architect build in a sensible way for India?"" says Bucher, who has worked on diverse site-specific theatre projects, installations, audio, photo and videos.

Advertising

The film, share the two, is meant for a culturally-interested public, which wants to discuss the relationship of architecture with society and individuals. According to statistics, 50 per cent of the world's population lives in urban areas and by 2050 this will increase to 80 per cent. The filmmakers are interested in finding answers to several questions -- How modern cities repel human interaction? How can we build cities in a way that takes human needs for inclusion and intimacy into account. How human beings use the streets, how they walk, see, rest, meet and interact? The filmmakers say they are interested in people, more than buildings. They aspire to find out what constitutes the soul of Chandigarh.

Bucher and Karrer describe Chandigarh as a vibrant movie set. Over numerous months, they have interacted with people from various walks of life, gathering many cinematic stories. They have filmed them at work , life in the city, perception of their personal urban geography and of their memories of places. The protagonists are people who were born in Chandigarh or who live here and have seen it develop. They come from different social backgrounds -- from artists to a fine art primary school teacher, a student of art and a professor of architecture, an urban activist, a theater professor, a shop owner, a tourist guide -- and are people who can talk about the master plan and Le Corbusier's ideas.

The filmmakers also address the fact that Chandigarh now has little space for low-income groups, and how it has grown far beyond the originally planned population size to accommodate 1.2 million inhabitants, pushing infrastructure to its limits. There are many questions for the future: traffic and transport, waste, population, chaotic outskirts, how should the surroundings of Chandigarh develop, what does the government do and how they involve the city residents to make them feel part of the city? ''To find answers to all these questions, people should know the spirit of the town; only then can it grow and change without losing his soul,"" state the duo."

Kumaraswamy over his move to introduce English medium in 1,000 government schools from the next academic year across the State.

The opposition of the former Chief Minister over this issue had indicated there is no clarity and consensus over many issues among coalition partners according to observations from political pundits.

Speaking after distributing books free-of-cost to the readers at the programme organised by Kannada Book Development Authority yesterday, he said he would discuss with Chief Minister in this regard to get sort out this issue as various eminent Kannada writers and activists urging the State Government to withdraw the decision and to teach English only as a language from primary classes.

Siddaramaiah had also took to Twitter to criticise the decision of the CM, saying, ""I have studied in Kannada medium till high school. Am I an idiot?""

In the first tweet on last Thursday evening, Siddaramaiah wrote: ""We should have clarity on learning Kannada language and Kannada medium (of instruction). I have studied in Kannada medium till high school. Am I (Has it made me) an idiot? Kannada should be the sovereign language in Karnataka.""

In the second tweet, he said, ""Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy has said that 1,000 English medium schools will be started from the next academic year in the State. I will discuss this with him.""

About a week ago, eminent Kannada writers had met in Bengaluru and expressed their reservations over the decision of the State Government. Following the meeting, the writers had decided to send a delegation led by Kannada Sahitya Parishat President Manu Baligar to meet the CM and urge him to withdraw the decision. They had threatened to launch an agitation against the government if their demands were not fulfilled.

This is not the first time that Siddaramaiah has been critical of the decisions made by the coalition government led by Kumaraswamy.

Apart from being critical of increase in fuel cess and others, he was also opposed to the interim budget presented in June.

The Karnataka State Government announced recently that it would ensure that English is used as the medium of language in government schools.

The initiative seeks to try out English-medium sections in 1,000 government schools at first, and will be applicable to all classes, including Kindergarten."

The Congress government at the Centre in 1995 offered 60% of the costs as grant, with the rest 40% being contributed by the state, he added.

""Now, the BJP government at the Centre, which is acting against the interest of Tamil Nadu, has reduced the grant from 60% to 40%. This has to be condemned.

Popular science books were my biggest companions since childhood and I believe they had a huge impact on my career choice. Dr Jayant Naralikar and Dr Prakash Tupe are my favourite authors. Their books kindled my curiosity towards astronomy. It was my high school Science teacher, who truly inspired me to pursue a career in Science. She was a very good teacher and she explained the importance of scientists for the development of the society. Her encouragement gave me the confidence to take up science.

During my bachelors course, I became a member of the Astro Club in Fergusson College. This group was mentored by our professor Raka Dabhade. In Astro club, I came across many like minded classmates and seniors who were interested in astronomy. We used to have stimulating discussions, participate in science exhibitions in the college and interact with research fellows from IUCAA and NCRA. During one of those days, I got an opportunity to work with Govind Swarup, who is a pioneer of Radio Astrophysics in India. That was how I was introduced to National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA). I carried out my research projects at NCRA. This opportunity was unique in several ways. I got glimpses of the cutting edge research in astrophysics. I also got to know how professional researchers operate and learned a lot about radio astronomy. This exposure was enough for me to make a decision to pursue radio astronomy as a career.

What happened after graduation?

While pursuing my master's, I carried out a research project with Dr Bhal Chandra Joshi at NCRA. After I cleared the joint entrance screening test and interviews at NCRA, I decided to continued the research with him for Ph D.

Tell us about your career journey?

My career journey truly started with the opportunity to work in NCRA with Dr Govind Swarup. In this project, I got hands on experience with a small radio telescope to observe celestial objects. Radio telescopes are unique because they see a completely different picture of the universe, compared to the optical telescopes. This gave me a hang of what radio astronomy is and I decided to come back to NCRA for my masters project. During the masters project, I observed with a world class instrument, the ""Giant Metrewave Radio telescope (GMRT)"". In this project, we were searching for radio pulsars, the rotating neutron stars that emit radio pulses. I developed a keen interest in pulsar search and timing while working on this project. Meanwhile I cleared the Ph.D. entrance test and became a junior research fellow at NCRA. I readily chose pulsar search as my Ph D thesis topic because of my interest. After submitting my thesis, I moved to Radio Astronomy Centre in Ooty as a visiting scholar. Here, I worked on a different kind of radio telescope, the Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT). While working at Ooty, I got an offer to work with Dr Duncan Lorimer (the discoverer of Fast Radio Bursts or FRBs) at the West Virginia University in the USA. I immediately took it up and joined in April 2017. I am currently working there as a post-doctoral scholar.

What about the highs and lows of your career so far?

Getting the prestigious Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana (KVPY) fellowship in 2007 gave me direct access to research institutes and their libraries across India. It was also a confidence booster which showed me that I can actually make a career in research. Discovering my first pulsar in 2010, which was a first professional achievement for me, then getting my first paper published in an international journal in 2016, which gave me peer recognition and also a job offer from Dr Duncan Lorimer. It is always inspiring to work with pioneers of the field. He is both my personal as well as professional idol. Of course, defending my thesis and getting my Ph. D. was a major milestone.

There was a period of 4-5 months during the third year of my Ph. D. when I was struggling to detect the pulsar that I had discovered earlier. It was frustrating to travel to GMRT and to carry out observations only to not detect the pulsar again and again, but my patience paid off and I successfully completed the project. Another low was during the last year of my Ph. D. when I was applying for post-doctoral positions. I was writing my thesis and applying for jobs simultaneously and nothing was working out. This period taught me the value of trusting my ability because things worked out eventually. These highs and lows have shaped my career and personality in specific ways.

Please tell us about your upcoming/current project?

I am currently working on developing an instrument to search for FRBs at the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in USA. GBT is the largest, fully steerable radio telescope in the world and we are setting up the instrument that will search for these mysterious radio bursts from far away galaxies. Our instrument is unique because it will keep working round the clock, even when other observations are going on. We have almost completed the project and are eagerly awaiting first results.

What are your future plans?

I am looking for more research opportunities abroad to work on a variety of radio telescopes. This will provide me with work experience in diverse work environments and learn more about pulsar science. I would like to use this experience and contribute to the growing field of pulsar research in India. I am also planning to write popular literature, especially in Marathi to help develop scientific temper and to make people aware of the career opportunities in science."

Subsequently, tension gripped Iglas locality after the remains of the bovine were dugout following the information by a resident who found the animal parts popping out of the ground.

After the police authorities recovered the carcasses, a post-mortem examination was conducted which confirmed that the cows died of asphyxia. Notably, the residents of Iglas and surrounding areas miffed over the presence of a large number of stray cattle, locked up hundreds of them in primary, upper primary schools and health centres in the locality on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, the residents of Iglas have raised the issue of increase in the population of stray cattle which was causing inconvenience to them. Besides destroying the crops, such non-lactating, old and ailing cows lead to road accidents. However, the ban imposed on cow slaughter by the authorities and pro-active cow vigilante groups had made the life difficult for local residents.

The report even notes, ""we respect the privacy rights of fake people."" The Senate Select Committee investigating Russian interference with the 2016 elections commissioned this and another report, and released them on December 17.

Why do we, and why should we, ""respect"" ""fake people""? On a deeper level, why would we accept the epidemic of false and hidden identities that have spread not only misinformation, but also hate, anger, and fraud, all over today's primary communications medium?

It all goes back to different times and different circumstances, when a right to anonymous speech was first recognized. That right was later broadened, and then applied to the new circumstances of the Internet.

In colonial times, some of our founding fathers used pseudonyms. Benjamin Franklin used the pseudonym ""Silence Dogood;"" Hamilton, Madison, and Jay published the Federalist Papers under the pseudonym ""Publius."" In constitutional law, we tend to revere practices associated with the founders in colonial times.

So, after Los Angeles enacted an ordinance restricting civil rights protesters from circulating handbills with ""fictitious names,"" the Supreme Court, in Talley v. California, found that law unconstitutional. In that 1960 decision, the court noted the history of pamphleteering as a way in which ""persecuted groups and sects from time to time throughout history have been able to criticize oppressive practices and laws."" Such groups, it said, had to speak ""either anonymously or not at all.""

The court referred to the pseudonym used for the Federalist Papers, and gave other examples of dissenters who wrote anonymously or with pseudonyms, including famous dissenters like John Lilburne of England, New England Puritan ministers John Penry and John Udal, and various ""Revolutionary War colonial patriots."" And it relied on another famous Civil Rights Era decision, NAACP v. Alabama, which it recognized ""that identification and fear of reprisal might deter perfectly peaceful discussions of public matters of importance.""

The Supreme Court again considered anonymity in 1995, in McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission. There, a state law prohibited distribution of anonymous campaign literature. The Supreme Court, relying on Talley, struck down the law as unconstitutional.

The plaintiff in McIntyre was a dissenter, like the plaintiffs in Talley. Margaret McIntyre, as an individual, composed, printed, and distributed handbills opposing a school tax increase. The Supreme Court in McIntyre, as in Talley, noted the benefits of anonymity to dissenters: ""The decision in favor of anonymity may be motivated by fear of economic or official retaliation [or] by concern about social ostracism.""

But the court then went further, endorsing as well ""a desire to preserve as much of one's privacy as possible."" The court then held that ""whatever the motivation,"" there is a public interest in allowing anonymous speech, and the First Amendment therefore protects ""an author's decision to remain anonymous."" Thus, McIntyre, though arising from the situation of a lone dissenter, led to a ruling that seems to recognize a First Amendment right of anonymity for anyone, anytime. McIntyre clearly suggests that American law ""respects the privacy rights of fake people.""

A series of lower court rulings have followed McIntyre's principles in imposing procedural protections for anonymous speech on the Internet, although most of those cases arise, like Talley and McIntyre, from comments by minorities and dissidents who fear retaliation.

But the two Supreme Court decisions and the lower court rulings leave many questions unanswered. They have dealt with anonymous speech, or obvious pseudonyms, not with fake names that likely deceived readers into believing that they were real people. They dealt with true contributions to public debate, not fictitious posts designed to undercut the democratic process, or fictitious names used for commercial fraud. And other situations of anonymity, like those involving reporters' confidential sources and the recent New York Times op-ed by an anonymous Trump administration official, involve vetted and verified speakers, and thus much different policy considerations.

All of these considerations suggest anonymity and fictitious names raise many important issues that need individualized attention. But a simple rule of absolute protection of all anonymity seems to be the prevailing interpretation of McIntyre, and, judging by that decision's broad language, maybe even the Supreme Court's intent.

But because Ms. McIntyre was a dissident, the language in McIntyre about extending protection for anonymity to all circumstances (""whatever the motivation"") may be legal dictum -- a statement that goes beyond the circumstances of the case, and hence need not be followed. And both Talley and McIntyre recognize room for state laws to combat fraud. Justice Harlan, concurring in Talley, suggested that a ""substantial showing"" of fraud or other misconduct could overcome the First Amendment right to anonymity. Thus, there is a reasonable basis for looking more closely at today's broad use of anonymity and false identities, not only by the Russians, but also by perpetrators of many kinds of fraud and wrongdoing on the Internet.

On a daily basis, individuals and businesses are attacked and deceived by Internet activities of people shielded by false identities; indeed, false identities are the baseline tools for most Internet frauds. The Senate consultants caution that Russian interference in U.S. elections and public opinions continues on a large scale, using false identities. And people write with more anger, and foment more hate, when their identities are shielded. In these circumstances, a lot will ride on what happens whenever the McIntyre protection for anonymity is tested against the realities of the modern Internet."

The civil supplies department, set up in 1918 when thousands of people fell victim to frequent episodes of famine, completed 100 years in August. The landmark event, though, went completely unnoticed. There were occasions when several pockets of princely Hyderabad state ran out of food stocks. Rice supplies, then, were rationed at 50 grams per head per day and it was increased to 100 grams only in 1950.

The pandemic flu of 1918 resulted in the decline of Hyderabad city population by 9.4% -- the population of Hyderabad state in the 1921 census was lower than that of 1911. There were more deaths than births and the decadal population dropped from 1.33 crore in 1911 to 1.24 crore in 1921. The flu which struck in September 1918 killed 46.5 people per 1000 that month and the death toll increased rapidly to 464 deaths per 1000 by Octoberend. Two per cent (3.50 lakh) of Hyderabad's population had been wiped out within a month.

2018 was also the year when the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), set up as Beri-Beri Enquiry Unit at Coonoor in Tamil Nadu, turned

100. It was shifted to Hyderabad in 1958.

Also completing a century was the Hyderabad Currency Act 1918 which introduced paper money for the first time. Earlier, only coins were in use. The Act came into force on June 4, 1918.

The Osmania University was also set up in 1918 though the institute celebrated the centenary in 2017.

While exams went online, campuses erupted with unrest and agitation

From reforms to resentment, 2018 was a mixed bag for students and parents. After almost two decades since its inception, common entrance tests such as Eamcet, ICET among others went online for those seeking admission to various professional courses.

In a major development, Telangana joined the national pool for medical courses by earmarking 15% of MBBS seats and 50% of postgraduate medical seats to students from other states.

What rocked Hyderabad this year was a string of student protests reported from top institutions such as Birla Institute of Technology Science, Tata Institute of Social Science, apart from other engineering colleges such as Vasavi College of Engineering, Chaitanya Bharati Institute of Technology etc. Their demands ranged from fee regulation to continuation of courses.

Those in school found no respite from the spiralling fee structure as the state government for the first time ordered school managements to maintain status-quo on the fee hike and issued an admission notification. Subsequently, on January 22, the Hyderabad High Court issued an interim order allowing schools to hike fee, leaving parents fuming. It was only closer to the end of year that the Delhi Public School, Mahendra Hills, decision to slash fee by 50% brought them some hope.

Apart from fees, two alleged cases of sexual abuse of primary students reported from a private school in Tolichowki, added to the angst of parents who demanded better surveillance in educational institutions.

City set to get an AIIMS, but will H1N1 deaths stop?

Right at the beginning, the government found itself in a spot with maternal deaths showing a three-fold jump since 2016-2017.

The core Hyderabad district itself reported as many as 105 maternal deaths compared to just 31 in 2017.

A worried healthcare department put all heads together and managed to bring things under control by strengthening government hospitals and introducing several health schemes, including KCR Kits, where pregnant women were given financial assistance in instalments towards the end of the year.

Fee regulation among several other issues triggered protests from students at top institutes such as TISS, BITS and many others

The maternal mortality rate (MMR) now stands at 70 female deaths per 100,000 live births. But right through the year, the government struggled to contain the deadly swine flu (H1N1) virus, with 154 deaths officially recorded till October this year and with 90% cases reported in Hyderabad city itself. If the battle to control the mutated virus was an uphill task, the dengue virus with 2,700 deaths and malaria with 1,500 deaths, underscored the government's failure to tackle diseases in Hyderabad. The health department also struggled to create more jobs and depute doctors and other necessary staff to rural areas, forcing patients to flock to Hyderabad's hospitals.

On a positive note, the decision to renovate the heritage block of the iconic Osmania General Hospital and build a new hospital premises, came as a welcome move. On December 20, Telangana received happy tidings, when the Union cabinet finally clearing the decks for the establishment of a new All India Institute for Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Bibinagar, at a cost of Rs 1,028 crore. The new prestigious facility spread over 200 acres will also have 100 MBBS seats.

Within minutes, they were hooked to the story of a young boy climbing up, and learning how to come down. They slowly stitched together the simple words, read them aloud and figured out the rest from Deval Maniar's large illustrations.

The story had appeared on a split screen -- the Bengali version, their mother tongue, on one side, and English and Hindi on the other. The exercise was meant to prune their mother tongue skills and familiarise the Std 1 students with English. ""Most of the students are first- and second-generation learners,"" says Dam. ""It is difficult to get them to speak in English. They understand the language, but lack the confidence to converse in it.""

Dam, along with many other teachers, is trying to engage children with languages through stories. His aide in this exercise is StoryWeaver, an online repository of stories for children. Started in 2015 by Pratham Books, a not-for-profit publisher of children's books, StoryWeaver is not just a virtual library but is also viewed differently by diverse groups.

If Dam sees it as a teaching tool that opens up story chests for his students, Chetan Acharya, president of the Konkani Bhasha Mandal (KBM), looks at it as a medium to save small languages. To artist and traveller Sarayu Kamat, StoryWeaver books are the way to connect with a community. For language-based organisations and translation practitioners, it is a vast pool of resources.

It offers over 10,000 stories for children in 124 languages, including Bhoti (spoken in Ladakh), Kumaoni (in Uttarakhand), Santali (in eastern India) and Gondi (in south-central India) and foreign languages such as Kurdish, Afrikaans and Haitian Creole. The content on the website is available on open licence, making it free for anyone to translate it into any language. For instance, I Can Climb is available in 60 versions and 47 languages including Thai, Vietnamese, Khmer, Sinhala and Norwegian. Dam himself has translated over 25 stories on the platform -- from English and Hindi to Bengali and vice versa.

""The purpose of StoryWeaver is to create a reading ecosystem, driven by the ideas of inclusion and collaboration,"" says Himanshu Giri, CEO Pratham Books. Anyone can access the site or use the content for free. Translators, publishers and other organisations who make content available on StoryWeaver do so without charging a fee.

Free access separates StoryWeaver from the rest. Giri admits keeping the medium open-source is complicated when there are authors, illustrations and publishers on board. ""Asking any established author or illustrator to give away rights is tough. I call myself the copyleft model,"" quips Giri. Yet, StoryWeaver has managed to do so. On the upside, the platform offers authors and illustrators a reach that copyrighted material often does not have.

Bengaluru-based Pratham Books got a hint of the unprecedented reach of online stories when it put up material on open licence in 2009. It uploaded some 20 titles on a CC (creative commons) licence platform, on which a work can be freely shared, translated, altered and so on. ""Over a year, 20 became 100 with derivatives in multiple languages. Our books were being used to teach English in Tokyo, they were being translated online into Hebrew and Zulu,"" says Giri.

StoryWeaver thrives on collaboration, and has managed to create a larger community bound by stories. ""Some partnerships have evolved organically. Someone interested in translating a story into his/her mother tongue would approach us,"" says Giri. On the other hand, the platform has generated interest among diverse advocacy groups working in education, literacy and health, spurring partnerships and generating stories in local languages. The focus in StoryWeaver is on underserved, local languages. ""At the time of Independence we had over 2,600 languages, we are left with 700 now,"" points out Giri.

The platform attempts to push back at least a few languages from the brink of disappearance through local interventions. ""Technology will not help us scale unless people help us. Language is such a thing that needs human involvement,"" he adds.

Others -- such as governments and organisations -- are sitting up and taking note of StoryWeaver. The Arunachal Pradesh government has asked Pratham Books to establish libraries in government schools. ""Around 400 classrooms are digitally equipped,"" says Giri. CGnet Swara, the online voice portal that allows people in the central tribal belt to report local news, partnered with the platform to translate stories into Gondi. The website has over 250 stories in the language now.

Purvi Shah, Head, Digital Initiatives, Pratham Books, says the call to preserve a local language through stories often comes from the community. Suchana, an organisation working on child welfare and literacy in West Bengal, partnered with StoryWeaver to translate stories into Santali and Kora, another indigenous community language spoken in the region. ""Suchana evangelised the idea of translating from Bengali into these languages; now we have over 84 resources in Santali and Kora on the platform,"" says Shah.

As the partnership between Suchana and StoryWeaver has grown, so has the link of Santal and Kora communities with their stories. Since readers were often in remote areas, translated stories were downloaded in PDF format, saved on devices and taken to the grassroots. To make it effective in areas without internet access, the platform allows stories to be saved offline. ""Suchana has raised funds to print these stories into books,"" Shah says. It is making the stories accessible to Bengali-speaking teachers so that they can, in turn, spread the Santali books within the Santal communities and widen the reader base, she adds.

Shah calls it the ""ripple effect"", where a child warms up to the idea of reading, slowly sheds the fear of words and graduates to reading more. ""The goal is to create a large repository of mother tongue resources and instil in children the joy of reading in their language. That is why we never digress from stories,"" adds Shah.

The KBM's association with StoryWeaver is over two years old and has resulted in nearly 120 stories being translated into Konkani. ""Children should get a chance to read and think in their mother tongue. This is a small effort to save a language,"" says Acharya of KBM. Konkani, among the 22 languages that are a part of Schedule Eight of the Constitution and written in five different scripts, was waiting for a boost that would connect it with the young.

""Stories are one way of doing it,"" Acharya says. At the primary and secondary school run by the KBM in Madgaon, students were trained to browse and read on StoryWeaver. The mandal also conducted a workshop for schoolteachers, training them to use the platform and even try their hand at translation. Pratham Books and KBM together printed 50 translated titles. ""We made 500 copies of each book, and distributed them for free in 250 schools,"" Acharya adds.

StoryWeaver has also forayed into languages that barely have a history of children's literature. Earlier this year, it held a hackathon in Haryana by bringing together schoolteachers from 20 government schools to translate children's stories into Haryanvi, a language that closely resembles Hindi but does not boast a strong literary tradition. ""It is a deep-rooted oral language, and yet the schoolteachers who came for the hackathon did not remember reading a Haryanvi story growing up,"" says Amna Singh, associate language editor at Pratham Books. When a language begins to fade out of official use, it's considered an early marker of a bleak future. ""Documenting it is the best way to keep a language alive,"" Singh says.

At the two-day event, teachers were trained on the nuances of translating for children. They translated 74 stories from Hindi to Haryanvi, peer-reviewed and polished each other's work, and enhanced the StoryWeaver pool. The experience emboldened the team to conduct a second hackathon in Kolkata, this time bringing together language experts, students of literature and schoolteachers. The exercise had participants splitting their hair on how to aptly translate ""You are being silly, Mr Brown"" into Bengali.

""They animatedly discussed the most suitable translation for 'silly',"" Singh recalls.

Participants with different skill sets made the exercise vibrant. ""The schoolteachers were game changers. They were the closest to the children and would not allow a story to be sanitised,"" she adds. The teachers argued that if a story was cleansed to speak a language the children were unfamiliar with, it would never lure them to the classroom.

Collaborations at StoryWeaver have often extended into foreign shores and the Philippines-based QwertyWorks, a professional translation group, is one such international ally. ""We uploaded our very first book from StoryWeaver in April this year,"" says Jake Irwin Estrada, founder and CEO. In a matter of months, the group translated 67 books from the platform -- 23 were translated into Tagalog and 44 into Cebuano -- two languages spoken in the Philippines. ""We are currently working on translating more books into secondary Philippine languages such as Hiligaynon, Ilokano, Bikolano, and Tausug and Maranao,"" adds Estrada.

While most stories remain online, Estrada keeps a limited number of printed books to be distributed among children who attend public day-care centres near his office in Manila. ""Some of these children don't have enough money to buy food for school, let alone books,"" says Estrada. The children, he says, are shocked when they receive books in their native language, and are allowed to take them home. ""They end up receiving from us the first book that they will ever own,"" he adds.

StoryWeaver boasts a handful of ""champions"" -- people who have translated hundreds of stories into a particular language for free. And then there are those like Sarayu Kamat who have taken the stories into the community. On a recent trip to Bastar, she took with her 200 stories in Gondi, each of them printed in colour on A4 sheets and spiral bound into small books. ""We visited several houses in Kanker and distributed the books. We also donated some to the local school library,"" Kamat says. She shares pictures of young Manisha, who belongs to the Muria tribe in Chhattisgarh, enjoying the Gondi book Kamat had gifted her.

As the portal scales new milestones such as breaching the 10,000-story mark, Giri wants the community to own it: ""We want people to run it. We want publishers to join this."" Even if for-profit publishers would share their backlist (older books from a publisher) on StoryWeaver, he says, it would go a long way.

""The goal next year is to get a few known children's publishers from India on board,"" he says. ""If people own it, they will value it more."""

Alappuzha sub-collector Krishna Teja's Facebook page 'I am for Alleppey' is helping rehabilitate those affected in the flood-battered state.

Bengaluru: In August, when severe floods ravaged Kerala, killing 433 people and causing damage worth Rs 40,000 crore, the relief and rescue efforts, particularly by the local fishermen, were hailed by everyone.

One of the earliest, and biggest, rescue missions -- ""Operation Kuttanad"" -- was led by state Finance Minister Thomas Isaac and Alappuzha sub-collector Krishna Teja Mylavarapu. The alertness and quick response shown by this officer and his team in evacuating and moving people to safer zones saved the lives of nearly 2 lakh people in the Kuttanad area of Alleppey, which was the worst affected by the flood.

After the rescue operations, the young, dynamic IAS officer shifted focus to rehabilitation and launched ""I am for Alleppey (IAFA)"" on Facebook, the first crowd funding-based social media initiative that has been successfully helping locals rebuild their lives.

The campaign team is close to building nearly 500 homes and provided for infrastructure for schools and hospitals, largely in the Kuttanad area. Businessmen and celebrities have come forward to help and donate, giving people cattle and ensuring safe potable water.

On 24 December, the initiative marked 100 days of its launch.

During the rescue operations, Teja realised how crucial social media could be when several images and messages were circulated on it. He decided to use Facebook to seek help.

""During a crisis, the focus of the people and government is usually concentrated on rescue. But after one tides over the crisis, the focus is lessened during rehabilitation (sic). That is when I realised that it is important to concentrate on rehabilitation,"" Teja told The Print, explaining the rationale behind the initiative.

""I thought we would bring some campaign which gives some momentum for the work we have done. That is why I launched 'I am for Alleppey'. This initiative works in tandem with government programmes and adds value to efforts put (in) by all of us,"" he said.

When the page was shared among Teja's friends the day it was launched -- on 14 September -- within six hours, a woman from Kerala, who was living in Andhra Pradesh, agreed to adopt a primary health centre in Kuttanad. ""This was our first success story,"" said Teja.

Teja's Facebook page has built up an impressive following since then, and has been liked by more than 96,000 people.

""I am for Alleppey"" has been conducting several rehabilitation programmes:

Officials found during a survey that despite extensive rescue operations, nearly 500 animals were lost. This was a severe setback for the 133 families in Kuttanad who were completely dependent on livestock for their livelihood. This initiative helped generate interest among those who wanted to donate a cow to the dairy farm owners.

The process is simple. IAFA volunteers identify healthy cows in the district or nearby areas. When a donor approaches them through the Facebook page, a price lower than the market rate is quoted. Once the price is fixed, the cow is handed over to a beneficiary identified by the IAFA team. This way the dairy farmer benefits directly.

""We ensure that it is a healthy and insured cow, preferably one that is pregnant so that it would not stress the farmer,"" says Teja. ""Every cow is screened and insured for a year. There are already 120 people who are ready to donate cows and we have already donated 66 cows.""

He emphasises that the IAFA ensures it sources the cattle from Kerala and not from neighbouring states such as Tamil Nadu, so that that revenue generated remains within the state.

Kuttanad faced two successive floods and schoolchildren lost out on three months of their academic year. Attendance fell and classrooms were empty. The IAFA provided notebooks, schoolbags and water bottles for children as incentives to go to school.

The move worked. By 14 November, three months after the floods, 40,000 students were back in government schools in Alleppey.

In Kuttanad, the anganwadis also grappled with another problem after the deluge -- that of drinking water contamination. The IAFA came to the rescue, fitting water filters free of cost to ensure clean drinking water.

The team from the blockbustre film Baahubali was the first to promise to build five houses in the area. Later, many others stepped in. By the end of January, the team expects 500 houses to be built.

Telugu cine star Allu Arjun adopted 10 anganwadis while organisations such as the Ramakrishna Mission, Save the Children and Andhra Pradesh Unaided Schools Management Association provided for schoolbooks and other basic facilities. Of 99 anganwadis, 50 have been adopted till date.

Stressing on dignity for widows, the IAFA refers to their families as women-headed ones. It believes these families require extra help as it is even more difficult for them to rebuild their lives. About 6,000 such families have befitted and received kitchen and other household articles, campaign workers say.

The IAFA has organised medical camps and provided two months' free medicine, food and protein supplements to benefit nearly 4,000 elderly people in the area.

Several specially-abled persons lost equipment such as hearing or visual aids during the floods. IAFA volunteers visited the houses of such people and gathered a list of their requirements. After registering with the local primary health centres, nearly 6,000 people were provided equipment free of cost.

The worst-hit roads in Alleppey were mapped and identified to assess the extent of damage to trees. After a detailed study, 400 saplings were planted to help rebuild the green cover.

The IAFA provided free nets to the local fishermen.

Rameshan, a cattle farmer from lower Kuttanad's Kainakari panchayat, lost most of his livestock. He is a beneficiary of the ""Donate a Cow"" campaign.

""I am happy that I can sell this milk and feed my family. I don't understand what this internet and Facebook is. But I know that through Krishna Teja sir, I have been given a cow sponsored by a Good Samaritan. We are very thankful,"" he said.

Shiny V, headmistress of the KK Kumarapilla Smaraka Government High school in Karumady, Alleppey district, recalls how badly affected her school was.

""We wanted to encourage children to come back to school and instill reading habit in them. There was no space to keep such books and (I) requested for almirahs. I met sub-collector Krishna Teja sir who at that time asked me the condition of our computer lab.... it was in bad shape..."" says Shiny V.

""In less than an hour, he (Teja) said he will provide us funds worth Rs 2 lakh. With that money we bought four laptops, 11 chairs, two printers and furnishings for the computer room. We are indebted to our sponsor AP Unaided Schools Association who provided us infrastructure for our school,"" she adds.

C.S. Balachandra, founder of Abhaya Foundation, is among the organisations helping with construction of houses.

""Instead of distributing only relief material, we wanted to involve ourselves in a more constructive way. After consulting with three sets of engineering experts from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Kerala, we found a 'flood-resistant construction module' which costs close to Rs 6 lakh per unit. On an experimental basis, we are building five homes in the Thirumala and Nehru Trophy wards,"" he said.

The efforts by Teja and his team have received positive feedback on social media, and have been appreciated by both the state and the central governments.

""I am for Allepey is an endeavour in addition to the rehabilitation programmes by the Kerala government. We are only additionally facilitating to help maximum impact in our small way... I only hope that in times of need or calamity, people get together and help one another, during and after,"" says the IAS officer."

The post mortem report of the animals, dug out from a field near a canal on Aligarh-Mathura Road, confirmed that they died of 'asphyxia', though police claimed that only dead cows had been buried at that particular spot.

According to eye witness, the district administration and local police officials rushed to the site with an earth-mover on Thursday morning after some local residents informed them that they had seen animal parts poking out of the ground which seemed freshly dug up. The incident came a day after Iglas residents locked hundreds of stray cattle in primary, upper primary schools and health centres on Wednesday in a bid to save their crops.

Local residents told TOI that after animal body parts were spotted sticking out of the ground, a large number of villagers reached there and started digging the area. By the time police reached the spot, the local residents had already dug out five cows. They claimed that one of them was alive and died later.

A resident told TOI on the condition of anonymity that the police personnel who initially arrived at the scene sent the five dug out cattle to veterinary hospital and wanted to leave after cleaning the spot. However, they brought a JCB after angry villagers demanded that more area with loose sand should be dug up. The operation led to the recovery of seven more cows.

According to Aligarh's chief veterinary officer, Dr KP Varshney, post mortem was conducted on 12 cows and the report indicated that they had died of ""asphyxia"" (body deprived of oxygen). He, however, added that this condition could have also occurred due to the inflation of stomach due to cold weather. He told TOI that five cows were under treatment at Iglas vetenary centre but failed to confirm whether these, too, were dug out from the same spot.

Aligarh DM CB Singh strongly denied that cows were buried alive. He said that only dead cows were buried and the animals that had been taken to hospital for treatment were found sitting near that spot. He claimed that some locals were spreading rumours to vitiate the atmosphere. ""Post mortem report confirmed that they died 24-36 hours ago,"" he added.

SSP Ajay Kumar Sahni also claimed that only dead cows were buried. He said that in villages dead animals are usually buried near the canal. He claimed that some people were trying to vitiate the atmosphere in the village by digging out the dead animal from their graves.

Villagers of Iglas are up in arms against the administration for its failure to resolve the stray cattle menace. Residents say that ever since the Yogi Adityanath government imposed a ban on cow slaughter and 'cow vigilantes' are on the rampage, there has been a phenomenal increase in the population of non-lactating, old and ailing cows deserted by their owners. These animals have been destroying crops, leading to resentment among farmers.

Abhimanyu Singh, who owns 20 bigha land in Iglas area, said that the farmers can't afford to feed non-productive cows and no one wants to buy them because of the fear of ""gau rakshaks"". ""We respect cows, but they are damaging crops,"" Singh said, adding that stray cattle had become a huge nuisance. ""Farmers have been facing problems for the past one year, but now the situation has worsened. The government must take corrective measures,"" he said.

""If we block roads to pressure the administration for a solution, police register FIRs against us. What should we do, where to go?"" asks another farmer Jagdish Prasad, who owns 70 bigha land in Iglas area. He said villagers had herded hundreds of cows into government school buildings to highlight their plight.

The SSP said that five FIRs were registered so far in the Wednesday incident when animals were locked in school campuses. He told TOI that he had received information that someone had 'advised' the villagers to lock these cattle in school and health centres to earn Rs 500 per animal. He said this information was, however, yet to be verified.

The DM said that around 2,000 cattle had been shifted to 12 gaushalas in the past three days. ""We are making arrangements for cow sanctuaries in 15 available grazing land in the district where 10,000 cows would be accommodated,"" he said.

Vetenary officer Dr Varshney told TOI that there were 17 registered cow sheds in Aligarh where 3,900 cows have already been accommodated. He said a large cow shed is being developed in an area of 4.5 hectares with a capacity to accommodate 2000 cows. He said that the district administration was fully aware of the problem of stray cattle and necessary steps were being take to resolve the issue. He appealed to farmers to cooperate with administration for some more time.

Meanwhile, BSP Sadabad MLA and former minister Ramveer Upadhyaya warned the Hathras district administration that he would sit on an indefinite protest along with farmers at the DM's office if the issue of stray cattle was not resolved within a week."

The market dynamic forces have been determined after conducting a detailed study of the Global Recycled Metal Market.

Europe recycled metal market share is projected witness gains of more than 4% during the forecast timeframe. This is primarily due to stringent laws and legislations imposed by environmental regulatory bodies in Europe, which has triggered metal recycling to reduce the carbon footprint and help save the environment from hazardous waste generated. For instance, Directive 2008/98/EC imposed by European Commission defines basic concepts related to waste management.

According to a new research report by Global Market Insights, Inc. Recycled Metal Market size is forecast to exceed USD 125 billion by 2024

Industry Growth drivers are

* Rapidly growing construction industry in the Asia Pacific and the Middle East

* Strong product demand from electrical & electronics industry in North America

* Stringent & supporting legislations for metal recycling in Europe

It signifies terms and conditions related to waste, recycling and recovery. Moreover, Directive 2012/19/EU prevent the generation of electrical & electronic waste and to promote reuse, recycling and other forms of recovery to reduce the quantity of waste to be eliminated, whilst also improving the environmental performance. These trends are likely to make significant impact on the reprocessed metal market size by 2024.

Recycled non ferrous metal market size was valued more than USD 90 billion in 2017. Non ferrous metals such as aluminum, copper, lead, precious metals and other metals such as nickel, zinc, tin, palladium, etc. These metals find wide-ranging applications across construction, electrical & electronics, transport, consumer goods, industrial machinery, nuclear, military and several other end-user industry. For instance, lead is widely used electronics in batteries, ammunition, cable sheathing, etc.

Lead batteries are used in transport industry and constituted approximately 35% of the total industry share in terms of volume in 2017. These trends will help boost the global recycled metal market share by 2024.

In terms of volume, recycled metal market share for building & construction constituted close to 45% of the total business share in 2017. It is mainly due to comprehensive recycled metal applications in the building & construction industry. For example, ferrous metals (iron and steel) are broadly used in the construction of large steel frameworks in the building, bridges, drainage components and various other architectural frameworks.

Furthermore, non ferrous metals including aluminum, copper and lead are also utilized in the building & construction sector. Lead sheets are used for roofing, cladding of vertical walls, soundproofing in partitions and ceilings in office, school and hotel buildings. These trends will help make considerable contribution to reprocessed metal market size by 2024.

North America electrical & electronics industry is on the rise which is due to consistently changing consumer's preferences and continuous technology upgradation. For instance, the electrical & electronics industry was valued more than USD 900 billion in 2016 and accounted for a total of 21% of the global electrical & electronics industry. These trends will drive reprocessed metal demand owing to its wide spread applications in metal plating electronics via electrodeposition. It provides improved corrosion resistance, enhanced electrical conductivity and improved solderability which helps in protecting against wear.

Furthermore, precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum, rhodium, etc. are also widely applicable in the electronics industry owing to its unique physical and chemical properties which provides reliability to the electronics sector. It will help attain significant gains to the global recycled metal market share by 2024.

Ineffective metal reprocessing is a key constraint which is probable to impede the global reprocessed metal market size by 2024. For instance, only 40% of the total copper produced is attained from recycling and 33% of the total aluminum produced is attained from recycling process. Nevertheless, rising emphasis on metal processing and reusability to reduce carbon footprint and impact of hazardous waste will generate plentiful opportunities for the reprocessed metal market size by 2024.

Key reprocessed metal market players are Sims Metal Management, Steel Dynamics, European Metal Recycling, Nucor Corporation, ELG HanielGmbh, Schnitzer Steel and Novelis. The market players are expanding their capacity to process metal to attain profitability in the market. For example, Novelis announced to build flat-rolled aluminum plant in January 2018 in Kentucky U.S. for USD 300 million.

Many of us are now bemoaning this tendency. 2018 was a year of splashy celebrity weddings, in which movie stars and billionaires seemed to be passing the baton, one reception to the other, to create one single, tinsel-streaked extravaganza, like a real-life re-enactment of Hum Aapke Hain Koun, the 1994 blockbuster often described as a very long wedding video.

In the past month, actors Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh were married at Lake Como in Italy, at an occasion graced only by a few friends and family but scrutinized by millions. Priyanka Chopra and her American beau Nick Jonas had a traditional Hollywood wedding, which is to say it was branded within an inch of its life and packaged for People magazine. The bride wore a 75ft-veil to the Christian ceremony, misreported in many papers as ""Catholic"".

Nick Jonas was brought up in a Pentecostal household, part of a religious denomination which, among other things, tends to frown upon ostentation. But what was low-key about this year's viral, splashy blowouts? They made it apparent that the Indian wedding is as much a temporal affair as a spiritual one. In 2018, no one, or at least not the couple, wants to be seen thinking of the lifetime ahead.

This was the year of the maximalist wedding, as well as of elite objections to unsophisticated displays of wealth. But elites were not their primary audience, if you discount the guests who did get flown to Como or bag the fort-facing rooms at Umaid Bhawan Palace. Hindi movie stars act in the multiplex movies that have made Bollywood acceptable to many Indian Anglophones, and their Insta stories may bring us algorithmically closer to them. But they didn't marry to set trends. Their celebrations were about adhering, faithfully, to an already existing template of aspirational Indian weddings.

Their regimented splendour, whether Sonam Kapoor's Punjabi dance party or the elaborate Padukone-Singh celebrations, seemed like extensions of their screen roles. Weren't the Kapoors dancing to songs from their own movies at some point? Didn't Padukone and Singh look like they were cosplaying Sanjay Leela Bhansali characters? Chopra and Kapoor both took their husbands' last names, drawing snide reactions, especially since Kapoor professes herself a feminist, and Chopra's first work appearance after her wedding was at a meeting for Bumble, a dating app that also professes itself feminist.

But not even the crustiest elder could have found fault with any of them. There were more choodas on display than in a ladies' carriage on the Delhi Metro in December. Large streaks of sindoor appeared on bridal foreheads. This look, explains Shefalee Vasudev, editor-in-chief of The Voice Of Fashion, ""comes from the Sabyasachi school of thought and design ideology."" Sabyasachi designed bridal outfits for Padukone, Chopra and Isha Ambani, among others. But Vasudev says her reporting and discussions with fashion stylists indicate that the actors ""have been willing and happy converts to wearing symbols of marriage. Sindoor and chooda as shringar (adornment) are seen as romantic and pretty by a large number of newlywed brides. I am not surprised that the actors are no different.""

The journalist Rebecca Mead, in a book about the American wedding industry called One Perfect Day, recalls a joke told to grooms: ""You've got to understand: She already had the dress picked out, she had the church picked out, she had the music picked out. You were the last element she picked out.""

Is it so hard to believe, that we, the fans, were the first element these happy couples picked out for their festivities? It was fascinating to see these wealthy 30-something metropolitans, Instagram habitués and globe-trotting sophisticates, go against the grain for their kind. Their own friends are probably getting married barefoot on beaches, or foregoing the ritual altogether. But they chose to put on large, conservative public spectacles because they know what their public wants to see. They may not set the mood of the nation, but Hindi movie stars have always known how to read it.

To complain that Bollywood weddings are inauthentic is really to complain that water is wet. Padukone's Saraswat Brahmin ceremony may have featured a Kanjeevaram from Bengaluru, but I doubt anyone looking at her pictures would be able to tell you how a coastal South Indian community's wedding differs from a Sindhi one. Among the many things that Hindi movies take from around the country and render in stereotype as one-note ""Indian,"" the three-day mehendi-sangeet-shaadi template is among the most successful.

Fair enough, you think: for the first time in history, Indian brides and grooms are expected to have fun at their own weddings. Ask an upper-caste Maharashtrian or Tamilian if they could have gotten away with a ""youngsters' party"" in any other era. In my own community, where our great-grandmothers consented to a union by formally accepting a length of cloth from a suitable man, Nair brides now want to arrive at their weddings under a canopy of flowers held up by their cousins, something that only gained currency in Kerala (and, I suppose, the Gulf states) thanks to its appearance in Bollywood romances about rich Punjabis.

And what of those tradition-bound Gujaratis, Mukesh and Nita Ambani? Of the wedding of Isha, daughter of the Ambanis and Anand, scion of Ajay Piramal, little remains to be said. Henry James once created a villain who thought it proper and reasonable for his well-bred young daughter to ""not carry half her fortune on her back."" The dissatisfied may neglect to say so, but it must be acknowledged that Isha and Anand wore not even a fraction of their net worth on their persons.

Meme factories reaped rich dividends from A-list stars dancing in the background of the Ambani-Piramal sangeet, but I would be feeling pretty good about the whole thing if I were Karan Johar. From the video of Anant Ambani dancing to a song from Kuch Kuch Hota Hai to the Ambanis unironically performing the comic ""G-U-J-J-U"" bit from Kal Ho Naa Ho -- perhaps the only time a Karan Johar movie has been rude about rich people -- it seemed that Bollywood had made the rich dream, rather than the other way around.

But yes, things were different in simpler times, when rice was rationed and the middle class static. Indira Gandhi's biographer, Katherine Frank, saw video footage of her subject's wedding to Feroze Gandhi, in which guests were served a simple dinner of rotis and green vegetables. Of course, that was in 1942, when World War II, Gandhian austerity and money troubles came together in perfect conspiracy with her family's taste for restraint. In 1965, bristling from another round of war, Lal Bahadur Shastri's government introduced controls on wedding spending around the country, which is why some family photographs from those years make our elders look wonderfully, almost romantically austere.

Some find it convenient to blame liberalization for the whole aesthetic shift away from cassata ice-cream and very tiny zari bootis on the wedding sari. But this country is only 70 years old. Almost all our money is new money, and would have been even if there was much less of it going around than there is now. Secondly, the Indian wedding, across class, caste and religion, habitually aspires to outrageousness. With very few exceptions, most Indian weddings are lavish by the standards of those who pay for them.

Expenditure on daughters' weddings is a major anxiety for wage earners in India, ranking only behind medical bills. Last year, MP Ranjeet Ranjan introduced a private members' bill seeking to prevent extravagant wedding expenditure. The Indian data journalism site Factly notes that 10 such bills were introduced in the last 30 years. In 2012, a Planning Commission panel working on improving anti-dowry laws recommended that lawmakers consider income-based limits on wedding expenses and gifts.

Economists Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo have observed that even extremely poor Indians may choose to spend on occasions such as festivals and weddings, instead of more immediate needs. Banerjee and Duflo classified weddings along with television as ""entertainment"", a categorical definition that is very well-suited to this year's wedding news cycle. Funnily enough, the only people in India who don't need to splurge on their own weddings are the famous, whose reach on social media directly corresponds with others' desire to give them free stuff.

The truth is that no one expects Indians to marry within their means. Most of the décor and all the clothes at 2018's celebrity weddings looked expensive, whether or not we thought them beautiful. That is the goal of most wedding expenditure. Big jewellery, high turbans and giant lehngas aren't just meant to make brides and grooms look rich: they're meant to make them look khandaani, of exalted family. In other words, you want to look like your father bought you your clothes.

""Young people enjoy the thought of being a prince, a princess,"" Parthip Thyagarajan, CEO of WeddingSutra.com, a popular bridal media platform, says. I asked him if he thought the weddings this season were setting new trends, but he demurred. If celebrity season is good for weddings, Thyagarajan thinks, it's because these actors have made tying the knot look like fun to a lot of people. How little a dance party on Lake Como has in common with that bureaucratic necessity, ""solemnization"".

Como may be out of the question for many -- too far for elders, too costly, too done -- but destination weddings are hardly new to rich Indians, Thyagarajan explains. I learn from him that wealthy Delhi families have a taste for getting their scions married in Monte Carlo. Italy, France and Spain may see more Indian wedding bookings in the next few years, as entrepreneurs in these countries, dazzled by the Sharma-Kohlis and the Padukone-Singhs, ready themselves to accommodate Indian requirements.

2018's extravaganzas are unlikely to cause wedding budgets to expand across the board, according to Thyagarajan. Another planner, who specializes in environmentally conscious weddings, pointed out that even low-key celebrations in India are expensive, simply because even tiny weddings have big guest lists. ""Even small Indian weddings are so big that a weekend in Goa sets you back by at least ₹25 lakh,"" Sejal Deshpande, who runs a company called Shaadi Ityaadi in Mumbai, says. If you're an upwardly mobile couple in Mumbai, congratulations: a Goa weekend is probably cheaper than a dinner, a dance party, a ceremony and a reception within the city. To break the internet, first marry rich.

For all this, it isn't immediately clear that the big, happy wedding signals any change in that other awe-inspiring institution, the Indian marriage. Until two or three generations ago, few Indians smiled for their wedding portraits. It wasn't the style then, but presumably they also knew there was, by and large, little to smile about in what they had done. Like so many other Indian rituals dictated by social status, marriage was a duty to be fulfilled. We are still overwhelmingly unlikely to marry outside caste and community; Chopra's youthful Caucasian groom was a notable exception even among her cohort of successful, independent female stars.

In the week of the glittery Ambani wedding, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a speech in which he appeared to sneer at his political opponent, Sonia Gandhi, as ""Congress ki vidhwa"" -- the Congress widow. Widowhood is not a personal failing, but Modi clearly intended it as an insult. In a country where female misfortune is tied so closely to marital status, it was a reminder that for many of the laughing brides on Instagram, 2018 was the beginning, not the end, of a lifetime of maximalist expectations."

Moreover, the trend of urban green spaces is also supporting the growth of the market. Urban green spaces are those spaces in the city which are covered by vegetation or other soft and permeable surfaces. The interest in urban and green spaces seems to be rising and many cities are giving trials to innovative ways to introduce urban greenery into the cities. Cities are generating greener spaces to create more calm and environment-friendly places.

Sport turfs and Synthetic Grass to Act as Roadblock

The utilization of artificial turfs has moved rapidly beyond sports fields to commercial and residential landscaping. Use of synthetic grass and sports turfs is increasing as these require lower maintenance. Apart from that, they are also environment-friendly as they require less water. Synthetic grass and sports turfs are employed in indoor as well as outdoor residential and public gardens, play areas as well as airports as they add to the aesthetic appeal and give a natural look to the space where they are used and also have low maintenance cost. Hereafter, they are being preferred by end users over natural grass. Nevertheless, this, in turn, would lead to a decline in the growth of the gardening tools market.

The DEO after examining the bag physically, even weighed them.

The officials said that in majority of the cases, the students were found to be carrying bags heavier than what the government has prescribed. In some of the schools, the management had followed the government resolution and made changes in the time-table.

The state government had earlier issued a directive to all district education officers and district primary education officers to conduct surprise raids in schools and check the weight of schoolbags carried by children.

The education department has asked all DEOs to carry out checks in at least three schools every week irrespective of the board to which a school belongs. DEOs have been asked to check schools affiliated to Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board according to Gujarat government rules, while those affiliated to Central Board of Secondary Education will be checked according to CBSE standards.

In the last week of November, after the government of India's decision, the Gujarat government had also announced that it will act against schools not following the schoolbag weight criteria and that are forcing children to carry bulky bags.

Education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama said, ""We have issued a directive to all education officers to check and prepare a list of schools flouting schoolbag norms. We will first issue notices and if the schools fail to reduce the bag weights we will penalize them. The government is working outthe penalty for such schools.""

Chudasama said no homework is to be assigned to students of classes I and II. Only half an hour of homework can be given classes III to V students and the same for Classes VII and VIII students can be one hour per day.

A district education officer said, ""It will be difficult for us to check the exact weight of the bags as we will not be carrying weighing machines. Inspectors who will be going to the schools will be using their own judgment by looking at the bags and holding it in their hands.""

He said, ""We have asked the schools to schedule their periods in such a way that the student is not required to carry all text books. According to government direction classes for only three to four subjects are to be held in a day. The notebooks for homework and classwork should not be separate. There shall be no separate notebook for essay writing."""

The Commission had received a complaint from Vanessa Peter of the Information and Resource Centre for the Deprived Urban Communities (IRCDUC), stating that the number of schools was insufficient in the colony which housed nearly 14,000 families. As on date, there is one primary school functioning out of a residential tenement, and a higher secondary school.

Many children travel long distances to their old schools. The presence of anti-social elements and the increasing crime rate have also been causes for concern and most of the families do not want to be evicted in the middle of the academic year.

During the visit, the children and their parents told Mr. Anand that they lacked toilets in these schools. They also expressed their fear to venture out in the evening due to insufficient lighting.

About a month after the Department of Primary and Secondary Education stopped the distribution of bicycles to class 8 students in the current academic year, a departmental inquiry has found the quality of cycles to be ""largely satisfactory"".

The Department of Public Instruction, on Wednesday, submitted a report to the State government stating that a majority of the reports that they have collected have found the quality of cycles to be largely satisfactory. The department is now awaiting directions from the State government to decide whether the process of distribution of cycles should recommence.

The department had halted their distribution last month following directions from the Chief Minister, who had received complaints regarding the quality of the cycles. This year, around 4.11 lakh of the total 5.04 lakh cycles have been distributed to class eight students in rural areas under a scheme that was started in 2006-07, when B.S. Yeddyurappa was the Chief Minister. However, around 93,000 students are still to get their cycles after the distribution was stopped.

Following this, the department had initiated an internal inquiry and asked officials to submit a report after carrying out visual tests and random checks at the school level. ""We have received reports from 23 districts and all of them state that the quality of cycles is satisfactory. We have, however, received some complaints regarding the fitting and assembling of the bicycles,"" an official in the department said.

The R&D Centre For Bicycle and Sewing Machine in Ludhiana has already assessed the quality of the cycles and had stated that according to preliminary reports, the bicycles tested were found as per standards.

The department had ordered that officials should carefully examine if around 20 parts mentioned in the checklist had any problems.

""We have received complaints in some places that the side stand, bell, or chain were not fixed properly, or the reflector was missing,"" the official said.

The cost of a cycle for boys is ₹3,457 and for girls it is ₹3,674.

The total cost of the scheme for this academic year is ₹180 crore. This is a 5% escalation from the previous academic year. As many as four companies were given the work order for supply of the cycles."

On Thursday, scores of the people associated with Kashmiri Language Union (KLU) including students of Kashmiri language department asked government to save the dying mother tongue.

""Kashmiri language is dying and we are losing our identity day by day,"" shouted protestors at Press Enclave, Srinagar. Besides raising slogans like ""Kashrin Henz Pehchan, Kashir Zaban Kashir Zaban (Identity of every Kashmiri is Kashmiri langue), the protestors asked governor administration to make this language compulsory at higher secondary level in all educational institutions.

They appealed the administration including Director of School Education Ghulam Nabi Itoo to implement the order Via 333 Edu of 2017 which states that mother tongue of Jammu and Kashmir (Kashmiri, Dogri and Bhudhi) should be made compulsory till higher secondary level throughout the state including Chenab valley.

""This is not the matter of just Kashmir students, but every Kashmiri should be worried,"" said Kifayat Ahmad, who is pursing M.A in Kashmiri from Kashmir University.

He said out of more than 200 higher secondary in the Valley, Kashmiri is taught only in 25 to 30 schools, and only nine colleges out of more than 20. ""Every year 100s of students come out from university with Post graduation in Kashmiri language. Many scholars who have qualified NET, JRF in this subject are sitting idle, because we don't have enough schools and colleges where we can teach,"" said another protestor.

One of the protestors said that government should close down ""Kashmiri department"" if they don't want to preserve this language and introduce subjects in all the educational institutions.

The protestors lashed out at government for not creating jobs for Kashmiri teachers in Primary and Higher Secondary Schools and Colleges.

Pertinent to mention, Kashmiri language is being taught in all government schools of Kashmir division up to 9th standard and it is one of the optional subject for class 11th and 12th.

Besides, Kashmir University has a full-fledged Kashmiri department to teach students at postgraduate, doctorate and post doctorate level besides Certificate and PG Diploma.

Majrooh Rashid, HoD Kashmiri department at Kashmir University said that every year, around 70 students are registered for MA in Kashmiri language. ""We have around 30 scholars in our department. Kashmiri subject has been introduced in many colleges but there is a need to introduce it in other colleges as well,"" he said. Rashid said there are hundreds of students who are doing Post-graduation from private institutes.

Meanwhile, General Secretary, Kashmiri Language Union (KLU), Sufi Hilal said that they met all the higher ups and asked them to make this subject compulsory in all the higher secondaries of the valley, but to no avail. ""If our demands are not fulfilled we will go for the hunger strike,"" he said.

On Thursday, he tweeted taking exception to the plan and said he would have a discussion on the matter with Mr. Kumaraswamy. Mr. Siddaramaiah said there was a need for the State government to have clarity on Kannada language learning and Kannada medium.

Saying that he had studied in Kannada medium till high school, he asked if he was ""dimwitted"" for studying in his mother tongue. He said Kannada should remain the ""sovereign language in Karnataka"".

Govt. unclear on stand

The government currently seems to be unclear on what its stance is on introducing English medium in 1,000 schools. While the proposal was mooted by Mr. Kumaraswamy during the 2018-2019 budget session, he later retracted his statement and said English would only be taught as a language.

However, the government has not issued any directions to the Department of Public Instruction in this regard. In fact, department officials were only asked to make preparations to implement the proposal.

""Although we have started implementing other budget promises, we are still waiting for direction from the Chief Minister's Office as it is a contentious issue. We have no clarity on it,"" a senior official in the department said. While several private schools are allowed to run English-medium classes, the State government's policy does not allow sanctioning of English-medium schools in lower primary classes.

During his tenure as Chief Minister, Mr. Siddaramaiah was known for his pro-Kananda stance and had pushed for a State flag and fought against the ""imposition"" of Hindi.

Sometimes their ways are too mysterious for commoners to understand -- - when their actions bear no relation to their declared principles. Take the unfortunate railway accident that killed a minor last Friday near New Alipurduar station.

Thirteen-year-old Raja Sarkar lost his life while doing a painting job on some equipment close to the tracks. This station is on the route of the Guwahati -New Delhi Rajdhani express. Unfortunately for Raja, the train thundered into the station, running over him. Presumably the poor visibility during the cold season was an indirect cause. Even a cursory check into the reasons behind the accident revealed certain facts that do not do credit either to the Railways or the West Bengal Government. According to prevailing laws, 13 year old kids should not be working at all. But local reports said that senior workers who should have been in Raja's place had outsourced their labour to the boy.

He was keen to earn the Rs 50 promised to him by his seniors. So keen was he to earn, he skipped his school frequently to do this! His father, a railway employee himself, said he was not aware of this. Post accident, a familiar scenario unfolded. Leaders of political parties staged a demonstration, holding up the train for over three hours.

They shouted slogans against Railway authorities and heckled them during discussions. The railways announced a compensation of Rs 8 lakh to the bereaved family. But this did not satisfy the demonstrators, who warned railway staff to be more careful -- - or else! No doubt, if a minor is found working on any assigned job at a railway station, resident rail officials including the station master, remain accountable.

They must stop the illegal outsourcing of work by corrupt workers to child labour. There had certainly been an official lapse.

But local political leaders couldhardly get away by taking a holier-than-thou stance. After seven years of heir rule, it remains for them to explain why such child labour should exist at Alipurduar. The incident did not exactly endorse the thousands of state government ads and hoardings that proclaim Bengal's economic progress .

But instead of any introspection, local leaders were content to point the finger at the railways and utilized to opportunity to harangue them. Demonstration over, they left satisfied, having scored a point in the state vs centre war, with no apology for the service disruption caused and the harassment to passengers -- - clearly the worst sufferers in the matter without any fault ! Mediapersons reporting the incident pointed out that the number of children illegally working as labour was around 500,000 in West Bengal. If so, the state Government must take action by immediately ordering for special reports about the state of the economy in the districts and rural areas.

The primary duty to prevent child labour in West Bengal is that of the state, whiles the centre/Railways, must co-operate more seriously with the State Government on this.

If anyone thinks that such incidents happen only in Bengal, he or she is mistaken. Such incidents are taking place all over the country. Yet the authorities are still in slumber."

There is something of the Roman god Janus about Kota. Janus, the two-faced. Janus, the god of beginnings as well as endings.

Kota is a bustling town some 250 km south of Rajasthan capital Jaipur. Over the past couple of decades the town has changed from an industrial power house to an educational hub.

Kota where every year thousands of aspiring minds descend to study and crack various entrance exams. Kota is the town where bright young sparks come with a dazzling future in their eyes.

But beneath this veneer lies a bitter truth. Kota is slowly becoming India's suicide capital. Kota -- the beginning of a dream, also the end of a life.

This year alone 15 students have taken their lives. India Today TV visited Kota to check on the pulse of the town and its young denizens.

Every year lakhs of students from across the country come to Kota to enrol in the multitude of coaching institutes to crack the entrance exams to engineering and medical colleges.

To support them, a market that thrives and feeds itself on the coaching ecosystem has developed. There are several houses, apartments, housing societies, eateries and restaurants have cropped up to cater to the needs of the students.

For many students it is the first time they have stepped outside their home towns, living away from family. At times the surroundings can feel alien. The emotional pressure starts to build up from the beginning.

And then there is the huge difference in the quality of education at the school level and that needed to crack premier engineering and medical college examinations. Students need to hone their skills and there is enormous pressure to excel in the competitive exams.

Some students India Today TV spoke to said that the kind of contextual and logical understanding of the subjects that is required for preparation of entrance examinations were missing during their primary and secondary education that they received in their home states and that is why they feel extremely difficult to cope up with the exam preparations in Kota.

""Many students are not very strong in the basics. There is a difference in the skills for cracking Boards and these entrance exams,"" Apoorva Arora, an IIT aspirant, tells India Today TV.

""I came to Kota from Bihar to prepare for IIT [Indian Institute of Technology],"" says Chandan Kumar. ""The last time I took the exam, the result was not as per expectations. So thought I'll give it another shot.""

The peer pressure that some students preparing for various competitive examinations, including those for the IITs and the AIIMS, is so huge that some of the students are unable to cope up with it and wilt under it.

Added to it is parental pressure to succeed. Far away from home, under emotional and psychological stress, they sometimes do not know who to turn to in the hour of crisis. At such a young age, unable to handle stress, a number of students take the extreme step of ending their lives.

Some of the students know that their parents have taken loans or have mortgaged their property to fund their studies. And that sometimes act as an additional pressure.

A student has to shell out anything from Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 5 lakh a year to prepare for the competitive exams. For those who come from financially weak background, sometimes the kind of monetary investments that their families make to let them study in Kota adds to the stress.

""Firstly, students who come here should be screened to find out the aptitude and whether the child has a history of depression or psychiatric illness. If the student is not fit for a particular field, then career counselling should be offered and the suitable field [of study] pointed out. Secondly, child guidance clinic should be held regularly for the children,"" Dr ML Aggarwal, president, Hope Foundation, said.

Hope Foundation, an NGO, works with children and young people.

""Sometimes peer pressure increases. We try to counsel parents not to put additional pressure on the children,"" says Nitin Vijay, chairman, Motion Private Education.

But till that state is reached, Kota will continue to be the beacon of the beginning of a successful life or the cliff where many bright sparks fall off unable to withstand the pressure.

The Uttar Pradesh Police have arrested four people in Aligarh district for allegedly attacking vehicles transporting 800 stray cattle, NDTV reported on Thursday. The administration was moving the cattle to shelters on Tuesday evening after farmers had locked them up on the premises of a government school and a primary healthcare centre, claiming that the animals were damaging their crops.

Protestors attacked the vehicles, allegedly because of rumours on WhatsApp that the animals were being taken for slaughter, Senior Superintendent of Police (Aligarh) AK Sahni told ANI. Two cases have been filed and an investigation is underway, he added.

Mathura Prasad Sharma, a farmer, said neither the district administration nor the state government had taken any action even though the animals destroy crops. Shyam Bihari, a resident of Gorai, told NDTV that villagers were staying awake at night to protect their farms. ""We are also falling sick because of this,"" Bihari said. ""So we chose to lock the stray animals together in a health centre.""

According to The Economic Times, the healthcare centre was shut for a day after the cattle were locked up in its premises.

Instances of farmers locking up cattle in government property were also reported from Tamotia village in Iglas division, Ahraula village of Khair division and Edalpur in Sadabad division.

A tobacco control expert explains how flavours may be contributing.

An upsurge in e-cigarette use among middle and high school students occurred nationally between 2011 and 2018, with nearly 21 of every 100 high school students surveyed reporting e-cigarette use in the past 30 days, according to data from experts at the US Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

This trend is not by chance. Tobacco companies have spent billions of dollars annually on tobacco product advertisement, according to a Federal Trade Commission report, and have used appealing packaging, culturally tailored brand names and advertisements that appear to target specific minorities and youth. The colourful packaging and other strategies employed by the industry contribute to lower harm perceptions of these products and higher susceptibility to use among young people, according to researchers at the Center for Global Tobacco Control, Harvard School of Public Health and recent research on cigarillo packaging I conducted with my research team.

The FDA has announced efforts to impose restrictions on flavoured e-cigarettes and tobacco products. FDA recognises the high rates of e-cigarette use among young people as a public health concern, and sees the urgent need for stricter product access.

Part of the agency's plans call for restricting young people under the age of 18 from accessing flavoured e-cigarettes via retail establishments and online websites. The FDA is seeking to have retailers move flavoured e-cigarette products - excluding mint- and menthol-flavoured products - to age-restricted areas in stores, and the FDA is proposing to heighten practices for age verification online. Agency officials have also called for removing e-cigarette products that are marketed to kids, among other measures.

And with the announcement that tobacco giant Altria paid $13 billion for a 35% stake in Juul, the vaping company that uses flavours to market its e-cigarettes, the need to impose youth restrictions on flavoured tobacco products takes on even more urgency.

Using a survey of young adults aged 18 to 26 recruited through an online crowd-sourcing tool, our group of researchers at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine found in a study published in PLOS ONE that cigarillo pack flavour descriptors, such as grape and sweet, and colours such as pink and purple resulted in more favorable product perceptions among young adults. These pack attributes had a greater impact on how people who had never used cigarillos perceived product flavour and taste, compared to current cigarillo users, and people who have previously used them.

Further, we conducted a systematic review of all the scientific literature through April 2016 examining the impact of flavours on tobacco product perceptions and use behaviours. Important findings from this study, published in Tobacco Control, suggested that flavoured tobacco products have a strong appeal to youth and young adults because of the variety and availability of flavours; that flavours are a reason for use; and that flavours play a primary role in the use of e-cigarettes, little cigars and cigarillos, and hookah among younger people.

Two studies within our systematic review found that packs containing flavour descriptions were more likely to be rated as having a lower health risk. Another study of smokeless tobacco packs in the United States found that young adults were more likely than older adults to report that packs without flavour descriptions would contain more dangerous chemicals. Research is clear that flavoured tobacco products have the potential to undermine progress gained to reduce youth tobacco use in the United States.

Research and survey data have shown that tobacco habits in this age group are changing. Youth cigarette smoking rates have declined substantially in recent years, with the National Youth Tobacco Survey showing current use of cigarettes declining from 15.8% in 2011 to 7.6% in 2017 among high school students, according to data from experts at the CDC and FDA. Meanwhile, e-cigarettes were the most commonly used product in that population in both middle and high school students in the survey data.

While traditional cigarette smoking has declined, patterns of dual (that is, use of two or more tobacco products in 30 days) and poly tobacco use (or the use of three or more tobacco products in 30 days) have emerged. In 2013, in a survey of North Carolina high school students, almost 30% reported use of any tobacco product, according to a study from our team published in 2015 in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.

Within this sample, 19.1% used multiple tobacco products, compared with just 10.6% of the sample who were single product tobacco users. Youth predominately used cigarettes in combination with little cigars and cigarillos, or cigarettes with e-cigarettes. While there is substantial racial variation in multiple tobacco use patterns over time, in 2015, e-cigarettes were the most commonly used tobacco product among single product users across all racial groups, according to one of our studies published in Nicotine Tobacco Research.

Using data from the 2015 North Carolina Youth Tobacco Survey, we found in a study published earlier this year in Preventing Chronic Disease that among survey respondents who were not susceptible to smoking cigarettes, 26% were at ""high risk"" for future e-cigarette use; 11.3% were classified as ""susceptible"" to using e-cigarettes; 10.4% had already tried an e-cigarette; and 4.5% were current e-cigarette users.

Using school enrollment figures, we estimated that 55,725 high school students in our home state of North Carolina were at low-risk of smoking cigarettes, but at high risk for e-cigarette use - which meant that they were susceptible to using e-cigarettes, had experimented with e-cigarettes, or currently used e-cigarettes. On a national scale, these findings are a considerable public health problem.

Specifically, high school students who believed that e-cigarettes and secondhand e-cigarette vapour were not harmful, or only somewhat harmful, were more likely to be susceptible to using e-cigarettes than students who thought e-cigarettes and secondhand e-cigarette vapour were harmful, our study found.

Moreover, exposure to e-cigarette vapour in indoor or outdoor public places was associated with greater odds of being susceptible to using e-cigarettes. This could mean that restricting secondhand exposure to vapour of e-cigarettes in public places, such as in school buildings, stores, restaurants, school grounds and parks, and mass media efforts to educate youth about the harms of e-cigarette use could be just as necessary as restricting access to these products.

We know that adolescents and teenagers are very vulnerable to the influence of tobacco marketing. The use of appealing packages and flavours has a significant impact on young people, causing them to perceive these tobacco products as less harmful and, in turn, making them more likely to experiment and continue using tobacco products. As research on the impact of flavoured tobacco products builds, I look forward to increased action to help prevent youth tobacco use."

The KVS examination for the post of PGT scheduled on December 23, 2018, at Centre No. 42307 (Gyandeep English School, Lamahi, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh) had to be cancelled due to the reported wrong distribution of the PGT Test Booklets in Session I.

The 'yatra', which is to start from Kurtha in Jehanabad district, is considered to be aimed at galvanizing people of his Koeri (Kushwaha) caste, which is in OBC group and accounts for six percent of the population, and also pillorying CM Nitish Kumar on the poor education scenario in the government-run schools in the state.

""For the last one and a half years, we have been campaigning for educational reforms and chalked out 25-point demands, but CM Nitish has ignored them,"" Kushwaha said.

Kushwaha, who left NDA and joined the RJD-led Grand Alliance in Bihar through Congress-led UPA last week, alleged that the BJP's national brass (read PM Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah) were in cahoots with CM Nitish who was bent on destroying both and his own party.

Kushwaha said his 'yatra' would cover all the districts before concluding on January 30, coinciding with the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. Incidentally, both the Centre and the CM have announced yearlong celebrations of Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary next year.

Kushwaha said he would also lead an 'aakrosh march' to the Raj Bhavan here on February 3. He would also submit a memorandum to governor Lalji Tandon, giving details of the demands backed by signatures of 1 crore people. The RLSP rank and file would start collecting signatures on the issue from January 1.

The 'yatra' from Kurtha is symbolic as Jehanabad district has strong presence of Koeri caste population. The place is significant for Kushwaha as the Jehanabad parliamentary constituency is represented by Arun Kumar, who had won the seat on the RLSP ticket in 2014, but later turned a rebel. Recently, he condemned CM Nitish and the police lathicharge on the procession of Kushwahas in Patna. Arun's move was considered as trying to mend fences with Kushwaha.

Otherwise, Kushwaha also said the Nitish government's decision to merge two primary schools into one owing to the lack of teachers and to provide transport facility for the distantly located children to reach the newly merged school was both ""impractical and faulty""."

Students enrolled in government-run English medium primary schools say they do not want to switch over to Hindi as a medium when they begin lessons in upper primary school after finishing Class 5. Their demand to convert some of the upper primary schools from Hindi to English medium is growing louder with every passing day.

Kajal Kumari, a student of English medium primary school Gejha in Gautam Buddh Nagar said, ""Switching back to Hindi will not be easy. I request the authorities to please do something so that we may continue to study in English after passing Class 5. It is through a lot of hard work that we developed a comfort level in studying in English. Now, if we go back to learning lessons in Hindi, it will undo whatever we learnt over the past few years.""

In 2015, the basic education department had converted a few primary schools of Uttar Pradesh into English medium institutions. The primary school Gejha in Gautam Buddh Nagar was also made English medium at this time. It has 434 students enrolled in it and most of them do not wish to switch over to a Hindi medium school.

Officials said that after seeing the craze for English-medium schools growing in the state, the BJP government decided to convert 5,000 primary schools to English-medium ones from the April 2018 session. At present, 4,97,108 students are studying in these government-run primary schools.

""In Lucknow alone, there are 44 such schools where more than 6,200 students are enrolled,"" said Amar Kant Singh, Basic Shiksha Adhikari, Lucknow.

Hariyali Srivastava, assistant teacher at primary school Gejha, said the problem was that most students coming to government-run primary schools hailed from humble backgrounds. ""Their parents can't afford to send them to private English medium schools in Class 6, as the fee is very high,"" she said.

Corroborating what the teacher said, Kajal added, ""I want to study only in a government-run English medium school because my father (an e-rickshaw driver) can't afford to pay the fees charged by private English medium schools.""

Zainab Khatoon, another Class 5 girl of the same school, said that she wanted the state government to intervene in the matter.

Making an appeal to senior officials in the basic education department, Srivastava said, ""The students have learnt all terminology in English. Now, they will have to study in Hindi medium upper primary schools, which will be very difficult for them. Our students are asking for help. They want schools to be made English medium till Class 10.""

Chhavi Agarwal, assistant teacher of another primary school, said she teaches 280 students. ""Similar requests are pouring in from my students too.""

Lucknow BSA Amar Kant Singh agreed with the teachers and said that the demand for English medium schools after Class 5 was ""quite natural"". ""After studying in English medium institutions, students will not like to go back to Hindi medium schools,"" he said.

A senior basic education department official added that they were aware of the growing demand for government-run English medium schools and were looking into the matter."

Farmers locked up hundreds of stray cows in Gorai for two days this week to protect their crops. A top police officer later said vehicles transporting the animals to shelters were attacked. Why? Rumours spread that they were going to be slaughtered.

On December 24 and 25, farmers locked up around 700 to 800 stray cows inside a government school and primary health centre. One farmer said the animals were destroying crops, and that the government had taken no action despite requests for cow shelters.

Complaints were made. District Magistrate CB Singh said he asked a sub-divisional magistrate to visit Gorai, and that the administration was building shelters in various villages.

Then, when the cows were being transported to shelters, a few people attacked the vehicles, Aligarh SSP AK Sahni said.

He said rumours had been spread through WhatsApp that cows were being taken to be slaughtered. (Rumours on WhatsApp have proved to be deadly in India in the past. Read more here.)

Four arrests have been made, and two cases filed, Sahni said. An investigation is ongoing.

The election is just three days away and polls campaign ends at 8:00am tomorrow, but election violence and attacks on BNP and Oikyafront candidates are escalating even after military deployment.

In the latest such attack by alleged Awami League men, BNP candidate for Pabna-4 constituency Habibur Rahman Habib was stabbed in Ishwardi of Pabna yesterday.

His wounds were said to be serious, and the BNP leader was flown to Dhaka in a helicopter in the afternoon for treatment.

""He has four stab injuries on his hip and all the wounds are deep. So after primary treatment, he was taken to Dhaka for better treatment,"" said Abul Kalam Azad, emergency ward record keeper at Pabna Medical College Hospital.

It comes a day after BNP candidate Goyeshwar Chandra Roy and 30 others were injured in an attack by alleged AL men in Dhaka's Keraniganj.

Since election campaign officially began on December 10, at least 53 BNP and Jatiya Oikyafront candidates have now been attacked allegedly by AL men. Two AL aspirants have also come under attack allegedly by their opponents.

The polls violence, which seems to be escalating despite army deployment across the country, left some 1,100 people, mostly BNP men, injured.

Witnesses said some 12-15 men wearing AL badges attacked Habib from behind with knives and machetes soon after he joined a pre-scheduled election rally on Alhaj School premises in Ishawardi around 12:00pm.

His supporters then shielded him and took him to a nearby house from where he was first taken to the upazila health complex and then to the medical college hospital, before being shifted to Dhaka.

Five of his supporters were also injured in the attack.

Bahauddin Faruki, officer in-charge of Ishwardi Police Station, confirmed the attack and said they detained eight people from the spot over the attack.

He, however, refused to disclose the identity of the detainees, citing ongoing investigation. But law enforcers frequently disclose the names of suspects and even parade them before the media during ongoing investigations.

But Pabna district BNP Secretary Habibur Rahman Tota blamed the AL for the attack and demanded the arrest of the perpetrators.

Meanwhile in Thakurgaon, BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir's wife Rahat Ara Begum alleged that she and her daughter had to postpone the campaign for her husband following threats from a group of Chhatra League and Jubo League men yesterday.

""I, along with my daughter Mirza Safaruh and some supporters, went to Bashirpara for campaigning. But a gang of eight to 10 people carrying sharp weapons intercepted us. They threatened us with attack if we do not leave the place immediately,"" she told a press conference at her residence following the alleged incident.

District Jubo League President Abdul Mazid Appel denied any involvement of his men.

Besides, an independent candidate in Faridpur and a Gonotantrik Biplobi Party candidate in Manikganj alleged that ruling party men vandalised their election camps on Tuesday night.

""The Awami League men also beat up my men and snatched Tk 50 lakh from my uncle who was on one of the cars,"" he told The Daily Star.

""They have been threatening us for the last few days as they are afraid of my increasing popularity,"" he added.

Sanwar Hossain, incumbent lawmaker and AL candidate in the constituency, said none of his men was involved in the incident.

""I have heard that local people caught them when they were coming out of a bank with sacks of money,"" he added.

Rezaul Islam, additional superintendent of police in Tangail, said police detained a man in connection with the attack and the snatched money was recovered.

In Madaripur, at least seven people were injured in a clash between the supporters of AL candidate for Madaripur-2 Shajahan Khan and BNP candidate for the same seat Milton Baidya at Amgram under Rajoir upazila on Tuesday night.

Witnesses said a chase and counter-chase took place between the two groups when a procession of Shajahan Khan's supporters was passing by the residence of Milton around 5:30pm.

Later, AL men organised themselves again and attacked the residence of Milton in the same area around 8:30pm. At least nine people were hurt in the clash, although Milton escaped unhurt.

Ziaul Morshed, OC of Rajor Police Station, said they rushed to the spot and brought the situation under control.

In Tangail, the Basail Upazila administration imposed Section 144 at Basail Bus Stand and its adjacent areas yesterday after Krishak Sramik Janata League president Abdul Kader Siddiqui and upazila Chhatra League leaders called meetings at the same time there.

In Narayanganj, a mobile court recovered over 200 ""tetas"" (a spear like weapon) from the residence of Kamala Hossain, organising secretary of Jubo League's Sonargoan upazila unit in the evening.

Executive Magistrate ABM Ruhul Amin Rimon, who led the drive, said the weapons were stored for creating anarchy.

Contacted, Kamal said the weapons were stored to fend off thieves and robbers.

Meanwhile, Habiganj police raided Oikayfront candidate Dr Reza Kibria's residence in Gopalbazar yesterday afternoon.

His Personal Assistant Sohrab Hossain Mahdi said police suddenly stormed into their house without any warrant and started searching the house.

Reza Kibria, son of former finance minister Shah AMS Kibria, told The Daily Star that the raid was meant to harass him.

Nabiganj Police Station SI Shamsul Islam said they had information an accused named Mujibur Rahman Sefu was hiding in the house."

The Scottish Government has invested an additional £100,000 in charity Cash for Kids to support community projects across the country. These will provide food and activities for children during the Christmas holidays who may not otherwise have had access to them.

In addition, a further £48,000 is being awarded by the Scottish Government to 12 smaller, community organisations to provide food and activities to children in their local areas during the Christmas and February half-term school holidays.

Aileen Campbell said: ""We provide free school meals to all pupils in P1-P3 {primary school years 1 - 3] and families on low incomes, but we know it can be a struggle for families to provide affordable healthy food as well as fun activities for children during school breaks.

""No child should be going hungry but we know that costs can rise in the school holidays - particularly around Christmas. This extra support will make a huge difference to children and their families across the country.""

Cash for Kids received £150,000 from the Scottish Government to support children from low income families during the seven weeks of the summer holidays. Around 37,000 children benefitted from activities and food projects in rural and urban areas across Scotland during the seven weeks.

The additional £48,000 includes Dundee Bairns and Achieve More Scotland, who received support for successful summer programmes this year in Dundee and Glasgow, and ten organisations which currently receive funding through the Fair Food Transformation Fund to meet an expected rise in demand this Christmas.

The £1.5 million Fair Food Fund supports dignified responses to food insecurity. It is evolving the response from charitable food provision towards rights-based access to nutritious food and support to tackle the root causes of poverty."

Even as Pune gears up to host the second Khelo India Games in 12 days, it has emerged that more than half of the athletes handpicked from the inaugural edition haven't joined the government's flagship programme.

Out of the 1,518 under-17 athletes selected by a high-powered committee, only 625 have joined the training camps at 89 academies identified by the sports ministry. The primary reason for the remaining 893 athletes giving these camps a miss was their reluctance to leave their schools in the middle of the academic year.

""625 out of the total number of Khelo India talent have joined academies in 2018, while the others have not yet joined because Khelo India talent is selected through the year, and it is not possible for all the players to change their schools in the middle of the academic year to join an academy,"" informed SAI director general Neelam Kapoor.

While the first edition of the Games ended in early February, the government released the first list of athletes only in July after conducting dope tests and age verification. The National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) said in March that 12 medal winners from the Games had tested positive. Many more were weeded out because they were found to be overage. The final list was released in December after fresh names of talented athletes were added to those who made the cut during the Khelo India event. This delay was responsible for many athletes not opting to join the training camps.

Kapoor said that this year, they would finalise the list by February, ""so that the players can join the accredited academies in the start of the academic year and balance their sporting career as well as education.""

Under the Khelo India programme launched last year, the government planned to identify and train athletes and provide them an annual assistance of up to Rs 5 lakh each for eight years. According to officials involved in the project, the confusion over financial remuneration also led to several pullouts.

A trainee, who decided not to join the programme, said his coaches and parents believed he receive Rs 5 lakh annually under the scheme. But after the government announced that the actual stipend would be Rs 10,000 per month (Rs. 1,20,000 annual), he had second thoughts. Kapoor said the grant of Rs 5 lakh per year included costs incurred for ""training, kitting, equipment, fooding and lodging in an accredited academy, and an out-of-pocket expense for each scholar at Rs 10,000 per month.""

Another reason why several trainees decided not to join the programme was the fact that they would've to leave their existing academy and coaches, and relocate to the centre assigned to her/him. According to the terms laid down by the government, athletes did not have the option to continue training at their original academy and avail the benefits of the scheme.

For the second edition, the government has merged school and college level categories for a combined Khelo India Youth Games. It will be held in Pune from January 9 to 20."
"195","1027009632","2018-12-26","http://www.asianage.com/life/more-features/261218/living-the-indian-dream.html","Living the Indian dream","The Asian Age",FALSE,"Subramanian, who is fondly known as Subbu among colleagues and friends, was the first one to go to college in his family.

Leadership trainer, entrepreneur and author Farshad Asl refers to the American Dream in his best-seller 'The ""No Excuses"" Mindset' when he says, ""we live in the land of opportunities. People come from all over the world to hustle and work their way up to places that they could only imagine or dream of"".

Many have left the Indian shores as well in search of this American Dream and it is time for them to come back. Freedom to dream big and opportunities to achieve them are no less in their own land. Krishnamurthy Subramanian, the newly appointed Chief Economic Advisor of the country will readily agree to this as his journey is one from an 'extremely humble background"" to the coveted office for any economist in the country, that too at a relatively young age of 47.

His father A V Krishnamurthy sold 'papads' (appalam in the local language) on the streets of Tambaram on the outskirts of Chennai to make both ends meet and complete schooling. The senior Krishnamurthy had to leave his hometown in Tiruchirappalli for Chennai after he lost his father at a young age of seven. He did odd jobs and somehow completed schooling. He got a job in Indian Railways but remained in the lower grades for a long time.

Subramanian, who is fondly known as Subbu among colleagues and friends, was the first one to go to college in his family. His father knew the importance of education and wanted the children to have what he was denied due to financial constraints. Subramanian thankfully acknowledges the role played by his father in making him what he is today. His mother, a homemaker, too is a Tamilian, who has her roots in Kerala.

Subramanian and his younger brother Vaidyanathan spent their school days in Bilaspur, now in Chattisgarh. During the Bilaspur days he cultivated a liking for Bollywood flicks and songs. It is interesting to see the other side of an economist, who is a fan of Amitabh Bachchan, who delights in movies like 3 Idiots and loves to hear Kishore Kumar's Jeevan Se Bhari Teri Aankhen from the movie Safar. As most of the children of 80's he too developed a craze for cricket, which declined to die out even during the days of academic rigour.

Being good at mathematics, he gained entry to the prestigious IIT Kanpur, graduating in electrical engineering. He worked with Tata Consultancy Services for three years under a bond after completing graduation. By then, he started to realise that he was not meant to be an engineer. With his passion for mathematics, finance felt like a natural extension. He did his MBA in finance from IIM-Calcutta, where he was named to the Honour Roll of the Institute for being a top ranker in the batch and was awarded the Institute's coveted medal for the most balanced outlook to business problems.

For the next two years, Subramanian worked with ICICI with their derivatives research team. Wanting to go deeper into financial economics, he applied for Ph.D and going by the advice of his mentor and banker Nachiket Mor and former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan, he chose University of Chicago Booth School of Business, which is known for its free market economics. It was the time when behavioural economics and other schools of economic thoughts were gaining traction. His guide Luigi Zingales and Raghuram Rajan had together penned 'Saving Capitalism from Capitalists' around that time. An influence of these thoughts have reflected in the banking reform recommendations made in 2014 by the P J Nayak committee, of which Subramanian was a member.

After completing Ph.D, Subramanian served as finance faculty at Goizueta Business School at Emory University in the United States till 2010. By then, he had decided to come back and contribute to the economic growth of his home country. By 2012, his guide Raghuram Rajan also had taken up the prestigious responsibility of heading the Reserve Bank of India.

In 2010, Subramanian joined Indian School of Business in Hyderabad and currently serves as Associate Professor of Finance (with tenure) and Executive Director for the Centre for Analytical Finance. Subramanian's wife Kavita also serves the ISB as its head of Academic Services Administration and Senior Associate Director in Hyderabad. Interestingly, Subramanian's younger brother Krishnamurthy Vaidyanathan is also associated with the ISB.

He is a faculty member in its Mohali campus. He too is a graduate from IIT Kanpur, alumnus of IIM Ahmedabad and has done Ph.D in Finance from Edhec Business School in Paris.

Subramanian also serves as a member of SEBI's Standing Committees on Alternative Investment Policy, Primary Markets, Secondary Markets and Research. He was part of the Uday Kotak Panel, which has made recommendations on corporate governance. He is also on the boards of Bandhan Bank, the National Institute of Bank Management, and the RBI Academy and was also part of the P.J. Nayak Committee, which reviewed the governance of boards of banks in India. He has also done a research in bankruptcy code.

The Chief Economic Advisor technically has to play a key role in shaping the economic policies that guide the government initiatives. Subramanian is an apt choice as Chief Economic Advisor at a time when the banking system is beleaguered by huge non-performing assets and loan defaulting corporate sector continues to be an unresolved puzzle. The timing is crucial as the National Democratic Alliance, hit by the recent losses in the state assembly elections, will need an ""Economic Survey boost"" before going for the Lok Sabha polls next year.

As CEA, the first task for Subramanian would be coming out with a survey that will define the policies of the government aspiring for another term. The task will become even more arduous if the survey has to outline solutions for the vexing problems of the economy while appearing populist. Subramanian believes in expansion of formal economy through taxation and taxing of farmers. After the recent poll results which reflected the discontent among agrarian community and the informal sector, Subramanian may have to keep aside some of his economic theories and get to work on a more populist survey. More than long-term policies, the government would now prefer quick fix solutions.

Subramanian also holds strong opinion in a variety of subjects which sometimes seem radical for a vote-dependent political class. As an independent economist, Subramanian has been quite vocal about the economic and political developments in the country. But diplomacy and restraint are two virtues that come handy when one becomes part of the administrative system, especially when the independence and autonomy of governmental institutions are at stake.

He had expressed his optimism about the state of affairs at a time when Arvind Panagariya was Vice-Chairman of Niti Aayog, Arvind Subramanian the CEA and Raghuram Rajan the RBI Governor. All of them have gone and even the successor of Rajan has quit. An advocate of providing more autonomy for public sector banks and a critic of state interference in the banking system, Subramanian will have a tougher time ahead.

He was among the very few economists who had welcomed demonetisation after the government withdrew the high value notes. While his views drew a lot of flak, he has also openly praised Raghuram Rajan and Arvind Subramanian, who at different points of time, disapproved the government's misadventure. His articles linking subsidies and dynasty rule and dissection of crime data of Uttar Pradesh also drew the attention of readers, especially those who are critical of the current political dispensation at the centre and the state."

Later, the schools were closed by the administration and the children went back to their homes. FIRs were being registered till the time of filing of this report.

Angered by stray cattle roaming around in their villages and damaging crops, residents of Mohakampur in Iglas, Kaser Gangiri in Atrauli and a few other blocks of the district locked up around 800 animals in schools. Protests against the stray cattle menace have been happening in Aligarh for the past three days. Stray animals were even locked up inside a primary health centre.

Sonia Verma, a teacher in one of the primary schools which was closed said, ""We are facing a lot of problems as classes are being disrupted and students are feeling insecure due to the prevailing atmosphere. The school compound has also become dirty. We don't know when this issue will be resolved, but we have informed our seniors.""

An emergency meeting was called by district magistrate CB Singh, which was attended by police officers, pradhans of the villages and the education officer. The DM directed pradhans to control the situation and prevent residents from resorting to such measures. ""These incidents are unusual and seem to be politically motivated. FIRs will be lodged against people responsible for this,"" Singh added.

Following the meeting, basic shiksha adhikari (BSA) Dr Laxmikant Pandey issued a letter to all block education officers (BEO) and asked them to direct teachers of primary and upper primary schools to make video clippings of those people who herded stray cows into schools and provide the clippings to the police station concerned with a complaint.

Senior superintendent of police Ajay Kumar Sahini told TOI that people responsible for such an act would be booked under Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act."

""Kabhi kabhhi mujhe itna sambhalna padta hai...hum kanoon banane wale hain...magar hum har vishay ka abhyas karte hain...aisa nahi hai (We are law makers but we often are not updated on topics and policy matters discussed),"" she said, adding that the provision of roping in experts from different backgrounds have been introduced in the Lok Sabha. ""Interested members should come and discuss those topics with the experts,"" said Mahajan, who also happens to be an MP from Indore.

Mahajan also expressed concern over one-upmanship between the judiciary, parliament and executive. ""The three pillars of democracy should act responsibly for the development of the country,"" she said. ""The media should also act responsibly and refrain from reporting irrelevant issues."" she added.

The Lok Sabha speaker also exhorted the lawyers and judiciary to ensure that justice is delivered timely and appropriately. ""Why are so many pending cases? The questions needs to be answered by the legal fraternity. For good lawyers, interests of litigants is of primary interest. Otherwise it becomes very easy to say that Justice delayed is justice denied,"" Mahajan said.

India's youths seem to have taken Mahatma Gandhi's advice - be the change you want to see - to heart. Through 2018, the one common theme that stood out in the stories that grabbed eyeballs and created an impact with our readers was young change-makers.

Be it through ideas, startups, innovations, individual campaigns and initiatives, community engagement, or voluntary services, numerous youngsters chose to focus on solutions rather than problems.

From unique innovations, ideas and solutions to help in household chores to using peer-to-peer learning model in schools and taking cancer screening medical camps to rural India, the nation's youth are becoming harbingers of change. We list a few stories that inspired us this year and will continue to provide inspiration in the New Year.

No point crying over spilt milk, but there could be some when spilt juice is involved. To avoid getting an earful from his mother over some juice he spilled, 10-year-old Arman Gupta invented the ""Mopping Machine"", a remote-controlled cleaning device for wet surfaces.

With detachable sponges, the machine can be customised for different surfaces -- the floor, under the table, and corners. The Class 5 student become the youngest innovator to showcase his creation at Somaiya Research Innovation Incubation Design Laboratory (RIIDL's) 'Maker Mela' in January this year.

India will have the world's largest rural population by 2050, and Dr Priyanjali Datta's Aaroogya is democratising preventive healthcare to combat breast cancer to the last mile. The team identifies a ""vulnerable location"" and chooses a village based on availability and access to primary healthcare facilities.

Priyanjali's team comprises doctors and volunteers who go door to door and visit every family in a village. They speak to women about the disease, teach them breast self-examination, and also clinically examine them. The bootstrapped organisation has helped 500,000 women across Delhi-NCR region, Haryana, and North Eastern states, including West Bengal.

Mohd Sujathullah, a student at Sultan Ul Uloom College of Pharmacy, distributes free food to 1,000 people every day outside Koti Maternity Hospital and Nilofer Children's Hospital, Hyderabad. Sujathullah wakes up early and leaves his house at around 7.30 am every morning for Koti Maternity Hospital where 300 poor patients have already queued up and are waiting for a meal.

Within 15 minutes, he, along with a volunteer or two, finishes distributing hot upma to them and proceeds to his next destination. At Nilofer Children's Hospital, another 700 people on an average are waiting to get their breakfast. For 485 days now, this routine has become a part of his daily schedule. Irrespective of bad weather, poor health, or other reasons, he does not fail to show up at both locations every morning.

Rohim Momin, an orphan, school dropout, and the sole breadwinner of his family, migrated to Delhi from his village in Malda, West Bengal, and joined the construction labour force. His determination to earn a better livelihood and secure his three younger sisters' future drove him to go beyond manual labour.

He sought to get skill training and refine his bricklaying capabilities and went on to represent India at the World Skills Competition in Abu Dhabi. Rohim went on to win a 'Medallion of Excellence,' and the fifth position. Through his work and training, Rohim hopes to spread the message that laborious work can help propel the country's economy forward.

In today's fast-paced, highly digitalised world, some humane ideas have ensured that stray animals - often found hurting, homeless, and overlooked - are not left behind. Let It Wag is an app that connects animal lovers and caregivers across India so that strays get the medical attention they need in real time.

""Let it Wag is like 911 for animals. The whole idea is to get all stakeholders on one platform, and simplify and improve the turnaround time for rescuing animals,"" says Yash Sheth, the 27-year-old Founder of this mobile application.

Within 100 days of its launch, Yash has started seeing the change he envisioned. With over 4,000-plus users on their Android app and through volunteers, the team has helped 215 dogs, 15 cats, 3 owls, and 12 pigeons in trouble. Two puppies have been adopted, Yash says.

Founded by 24-year-old social entrepreneur Abhishek Dubey, Muskaan Dreams is a unique education initiative that is currently operating in three cities of Madhya Pradesh - Gwalior, Bhopal, and Indore. The startup tries to solve the problem of insufficient teachers in rural government schools through e-learning (self-learning) classrooms for students.

The virtual classrooms allow students to easily learn anything related to their subjects. The social startup uses LED screens in order to ensure sustainability.

The bovines were later freed by the police personnel, who carried them in trucks to the nearest gaushala.

Farmers in Gorai and Tamautiya villages of Aligarh were forced to lock up the cows as several acres of farmlands have been destroyed by the bovines, left stray by their owners after they no longer yielded milk. Cow Slaughter, Banned by UP CM Yogi Adityanath, Creates Bovine Menace in State.

The number of bovines have multiplied exponentially over the past couple of years, since the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP was elected to power. The state government has rigorously enforced a ban on the slaughter of cows and cow progeny.

Apart from the government-enforced ban, vigilantes affiliated to some right-wing groups have been involved in attacks on cattle traders -- which has forced many of them to abandon their animals.

The incident on Tuesday in Aligarh led to a brief law and order violation as well, as the police team which arrived to free the cattle and take them to the nearest gaushala faced protests, including stone-pelting. The demonstrators were mobilised through a WhatsApp rumour claiming that the cows are being sent for slaughter.

He is currently in jail, after a .22 rifle, a vehicle bearing a Haryana registration number, wild boar skin and hunting gear was recovered from him.

Did you know that Jyoti has a Bollywood connection? He was married to actress Chitrangda Singh, and the two have a son named Zorawar.

Chitrangda and Jyoti's fathers were in the same regiment of the Indian Army. ""The first time I saw her was when I had gone to her house; she was in class 8 then and I was in the last year of school,"" the golfer revealed in an interview with a website.

However, love blossomed after Chitrangda shifted base to Delhi. Since Jyoti's father was posted in the same city, they moved there as well. After a five-year-long courtship, the couple tied the knot in 2001.

In fact, when Chitrangda landed her debut film, Sudhir Mishra's Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi, she was a married woman. Eventually, she was juggling between Mumbai and Delhi, which took a toll on their relationship.

Jyoti said in an interview, ""It used to bother me initially that we were not together as we used to be."" He said that he was trying his best to be as accommodating as possible. ""When I played golf, she followed me. Now, when she has an opportunity to do what she likes, I should do the same,"" he said.

The golfer added, ""I do miss her. The house feels empty without the woman of the house...""

Around the time of this interview, which was in 2013, rumours of trouble in paradise began doing the rounds. It was being said that Chitrangda and Jyoti's marriage was on the rocks, which the actress vociferously denied.

Eventually, she admitted to a newspaper, ""There are pressures on any relationship. You have to work on it; just as you work on other things... I am not living a perfect life.""

A few months later, in 2014, Chitrangda and Jyoti were officially divorced, with primary custody of their son granted to the actress. Recently, she told a leading daily that being a single mother was no cakewalk. ""It is difficult to bring up a child as a single parent. But society is no longer cynical towards it. Divorce and single parenthood have become normal things,"" she said.

Jyoti is also actively involved in Zorawar's life, she revealed. ""My son is living a very balanced life with both his parents,"" Chitrangda said.

The Report of the Expert Panel was delivered to Prime Minister Turnbull on 18 May, 2018 following a two month consultation period. Upon receipt of the Report, Prime Minister Turnbull commented: ""I look forward to considering the report in detail and will consult with members of the Government before releasing it to the public and responding to its findings.""

On 12 October 2018 Fairfax Media leaked the Report.

The Government released the Report, and it's response, on 13 December 2018.

The Fairfax Media report contained 20 recommendations, however, the recommendations that garnered the most media coverage and sparked the fiercest debate are recommendations 5 and 7.

These recommendations suggest the amendment of Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) to allow religious schools to, respectively, ""discriminate in relation to the employment of staff, and the engagement of contractors"" and ""in relation to a student basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or relationship status"". However, the recommendation provides that ""the discrimination is grounded in the precepts of the religion"" and that the school policy on the issue is made publically available, provided to current and prospective employees contractors, and students. Recommendation 7, which relates to discrimination in relation to student, also states that the discrimination may take place provided that ""The school has regard to the best interests of the child as the primary consideration in its conduct.""

Academics Liam Elphick, Amy Maguire and Anja Hilkemeijer have commented that ""Much of the immediate reaction to the leaks incorrectly claimed that the recommendations would grant such a right for the first time"", which is not the case.

Currently, section 38 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) permits educational institutions established for religious purposes to ""discriminate against another person on the ground of the other person's sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital or relationship status or pregnancy in connection with..."":

However, for the discrimination to be lawful, the education institution must ""discriminate in good faith in order to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents of that religion or creed.""

Elphick, Maguire and Hilkemeijer have explained that the additional limitations contained in recommendations 5 and 7 would actually ""constrain this existing right to discriminate"".

While the right of faith-based schools to discriminate on the basis of ""sexual orientation, gender identity or relationship status"" has been enshrined in legislation for some time, the release of the recommendations by Fairfax seems to made many more people aware of the fact, and sparked debate on the legitimacy of such an anti-discrimination exemption.

The exemptions ""that enabled faith-based schools to discriminate against teachers, contractors students and so forth"" were actually introduced in 2013 by the Gillard Labor Government. The current Labor leader, Bill Shorten, has voiced support for repealing the existing exemptions, stating: ""It's time our laws reflected the values we teach our children."" The Liberal Party, on the other hand, appear to be "" split"" on their stance to the current exemptions.

In an address given following the publication of the recommendations, the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney, Dr Glenn Davies, argued for the right of ""religious organisations... to operate according to their religious ethos"", explaining that he believed that ""Anglican schools, if they are going to remain Anglican, must be able to employ staff who support the Christian values of the school"". However, he stated: ""Let's be very clear. Anglican schools in Sydney do not expel students for being gay.""

While the Expert Panel's Report, and the Government's response, were not released until 13 December 2018, in the final sitting days of Parliament in early December, the Government tabled proposed amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act that, in its view, ""would have removed discrimination against students while also protecting religious schools' ability to maintain their ethos"". However, the proposed amendments did not have the support of the Opposition, and no new legislation was enacted.

In its official reply to the Report, the Government responded to recommendations 5 and 7 as follows:

While noting and agreeing with the principle underpinning the... recommendations ..., the government is of the view that further consideration is necessary to address the complexities associated with these recommendations.

In particular, the Government:

will consult with the States and Territories on the terms of a potential reference to the ALRC [Australian Law Reform Commission] to consider [the] recommendations 1 and 5 to 8 of the Review with a view to settling upon a legislative mechanism that would, on a nationally consistent basis, achieve the twin purposes of limiting or removing altogether (if practicable) legislative exemptions to prohibitions on discrimination based on a person's identity, while also protecting the right of religious institutions to reasonably conduct themselves in a way consistent with their religious ethos.

We will keep you abreast of future developments in this area, and in particular any proposed amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act flowing from the Report."

'Pedal to Jungle', an expedition in Rajasthan... was the message in our Mangalore Bicycle Club Whatsapp group. Jungle and Rajasthan? I had always pictured Rajasthan as a dry region. I clicked the link and saw that the organisers -- Rajasthan Forest Department and Le Tour De India, Jaipur, had indeed planned a jungle trip in the state.

I decided to sign up and for the tour (November 29 to December 2), paid ₹9,000 fee and rented a Mountain Terrain Bike(MTB) from Le Tour. Two other friends, GN Ashoka Vardhana (64) and Hariprasad Shevire from Mangaluru, also signed up.

The three-day tour was to begin from Udaipur's Baghdara Nature Park. On the first day we had to pedal about 60 km (to Jaisamand Lake), on the second day we cycled 120 km (to Sita Mata Wildlife Sanctuary) and on the final day we went 25 km (to Dam Dama Forest check-post).

Bhatnagar hoped the second edition of this tour would bring participants closer to Nature and indicated that more events were being planned.

The expedition was flagged off from Baghdara's entry gate and we rode along a kuchcha road in the interiors of the Nature Park. We stopped for breakfast on the banks of Baghdara Lake. Freshly prepared aloo parathas, sandwiches and fruits fuelled us for the next leg of the journey.

Exiting the Park, we navigated a small road to reach Jagat, at a distance of about 20 kilometres for a pit stop. Enjoying the beauty of the Ambika Mata temple that dates back to the 8th Century, we relished samosas and chai before visiting the Government Higher Primary Girls' School nearby to interact with students.

Narrow village roads then took us towards Jaisamand Lake through the countryside of Udaipur and it was past 2 pm when we reached the entry gate of the lake. After lunch in the lake garden, we hiked over to the adjacent hill to view Hawa Mahal, said to have been built by Maharana Jai Singh. The 450-metre climb gave us a breathtaking view of the lake beneath. The palace that is under the control of Archaeological Survey of India was out of bounds for regular tourists.

We went on a boat ride on the 85 sq km lake, said to be the second largest man-made one in India built by Maharana Jai Singh across the river Gomati. After watching spectacular cultural performances by artistes, followed by dinner, we retired for the night into the tents pitched in the lake garden.

The second day's ride began on a highway, but soon we entered Karawali town after which where steep ascents and descents awaited us. After a gruelling ride of about six hours with multiple pit-stops for refreshments, we reached the Forest Department's office at Dhariyawad town in Pratapgarh district. Post lunch, some bikers got back onto the saddles while others took the support vehicle for the next 25-kilometre journey to the sanctuary.

Bhatnagar pointed out that the region was the meeting point of three mountain ranges -- Aravali, Vindhyas and Mewar. I soaked in the beauty as I heard the folk songs around the camp fire. We retired for the day with the lullaby of Jhakum, ringing in our ears.

On the last day, we rode through the sanctuary . It was a steep ride made bearable with the green cover and the small streams that we crossed. The enchanting Sita Mata rivulet with crystal clear water held me back for a while. The 25-kilometre ride marked the end of the bike trip.."

The latest data from the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), a database of information about schools, says that the situation is particularly grim in states such as Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Jammu and Kashmir, Telangana, West Bengal, and some north-eastern states, as per 2016-17 statistics.

In these states, the percentage of students dropping out of school in secondary classes was considerably higher than the previous years. For example, in Bihar, in 2016-17, 39.73 per cent students in secondary classes withdrew from school, as compared to just 25.90 per cent students in 2015-16.

In Jharkhand, 36.64 per cent students dropped out in 2016-17, the last year for which data is available, which is over 12 per cent more than the previous year. The Union Human Resources Development Ministry has been boasting about making significant changes in the school education sector.

It's own figures, however, suggest that while the gross enrolment ratio was over 100 per cent at the primary level in 2016-17 (GER can be more than 100 per cent at the primary level because of overage and underage children taking admissions), it Is less than 80 per cent at the secondary level and is yet to reach 60 per cent at the senior secondary level.

Education experts said that while lack of access in rural areas and lack of interest in learning are major factors why children in higher classes drop out of schools, the no-detention policy till class VIII, which was introduced as part of the Right to Education act, could also be a reason.

""The government has now moved to end the no-detention policy, but in the past many year, it has been seen that children who were not assessed properly till class VIII, lose interest in studies when they don't do well at higher level examinations,"" said educationist Varsha Narain."

The mishap took place when the bus, packed with 107 passengers, including school children and teachers, was returning to Ahmedabad from Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, where they had gone for a picnic.

While the cleaner of the bus, Balram Bhadoria, died in the accident, its driver fled the spot, said Panchmahal District Superintendent of Police Leena Patil.

""The bus slipped into a roadside pit after the driver lost control over the vehicle. While 24 students received minor injuries, the cleaner died as he jumped from the moving bus to save his life,"" said Patil.

The injured students were shifted to the Godhra Civil Hospital for treatment, she said.

What Does The Primary Investigation Reveal?

Primary investigations by the police revealed negligence on part of the school management as the bus was carrying 107 passengers, way beyond its capacity, said Patil.

""The bus driver fled from the spot after the accident. The bus was indeed over-crowded. Apart from students, there were teachers and their family members in the bus. We have lodged a case against the driver and others,"" said the SP.

Based on a complaint filed by one of the parents, Radheshyam Prajapati, the Godhra taluka police lodged the FIR against the unidentified driver, bus operator Sitaram Sharma and the school owner, Panjabilal, said the police.

They were booked under various sections of the IPC, including 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 279 (rash driving) and 337 (causing injury by rash act).

According to PSI Jotana, the capacity of the bus was just 58, against which 107 people, including 70 students, were in the vehicle at the time of accident.

""The bus stopped only after hitting a tree. To save his life, the cleaner jumped from the bus when it started slipping into a pit along the road.

""However, he was crushed to death under the wheels,"" said the PSI.

As many as 13 schools have recorded zero enrolment, while another 171 schools have fewer than 20 students. A total of 1,140 schools have fewer than 40 students.

These were the details furnished by the state in 2017-18 to the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), a database about schools in India, developed at the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA). According to officials, the reason for the low enrolment is parents' preference to private schools due to lack of infrastructure, teacher absenteeism, and poor quality education in government schools, among others.

This is in addition to 1,773 schools without buildings, which the government plans to merge with nearby schools with infrastructure. The merger plan comes after the state failed to land for the 1,773 schools. Most of these schools have been merged. Of them, 190 schools in Patna district alone.

The enrolment in government schools dropped to 1.8 crore in 2017-18 from 1.99 crore in 2016-17. The number is expected to drop further when fresh data is examined, diluting the government claim of more than 99% enrolment.

The most alarming trend reflected through U-DISE is that the dropout rate from Class 9 to Class 10- almost 25% of the total enrollment in 2014-15, which jumped to 39.73% in 2016-17, the period when there was unprecedented increase in the number of students failing in Bihar class 10 and 12 board exams.

One of the reasons for the drop, authorities admitted, is parents' preference for private schools for better education and infrastructure.

""If the incentives (such as scholarships, bicycles) attached with government schools are removed, the number will drop further. Many students get admitted to government schools to avail incentives but study in private schools. In 2011, when reports on inflated enrolments surfaced, it created a flutter,"" an education department official added.

Three years ago, the then principal secretary, department of education, Amarjeet Sinha, had said the duplication of enrolment in government schools could be up to 20%.

Bihar Education Project Council (BSEPC) director Sanjay Singh, however, said that the drop in students' number was due to government's drive to do away with duplication in enrolment. ""The number children availing mid-day meal has come down to 1.20 crore compare to previous years,"" he added.

Singh said that the sanctity of data was being maintained. ""Earlier, there was no data on private schools. Now, that is also being prepared. Around 12 lakh more students have joined private schools, not necessarily because they have suddenly opened, but because they are being documented,"" he added.

Singh said under the Right to Education Act, there should be a school within a kilometre for Class 1-5 students provided there are a minimum of 40 students. ""If that is not the case, teachers can be used elsewhere more effectively. Having 3-4 teachers for fewer than 40 children is not relevant,"" he said, adding he would do another appraisal in January after studying the reasons and reports of physical verification."

A study conducted by the Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability (CBGA) and Child Rights and You (CRY) has raised questions over the government schools being run in six states.

The study claims that just the two states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, have a vacancy of over 4.2 lakh teaching positions, reports The Indian Express.

Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were part of the study.

Overall, the study revealed that there is a shortage of five lakh elementary school teachers in these states, while 14 per cent of government secondary schools do not meet the mandatory minimum number of six teachers.

Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra were the best performers in filling up teaching posts, recruiting about 95 per cent of the sanctioned strength at their elementary schools.

On the other hand, Bihar was found to have the greatest proportion of untrained teachers at the elementary as well as the secondary school levels, with West Bengal emerging as the runner-up in the metric.

38.7 per cent and 35.1 per cent of Bihar's teachers were found to be professionally unqualified at the elementary and secondary levels respectively. In case of West Bengal, 35.1 per cent of its primary teachers and 23.9 per cent of its secondary teachers are untrained.

The study noted that despite increased budgetary spending on school education at the state level, the shortage of well-qualified teachers and poor infrastructure are major issues that continue to plague public schools."

Yet, it's been struggling to pick up in a significant way in India.

How can states across India provide the much-needed impetus to organ transplantation? Mohan Foundation's Lalitha Raghuram tells us from experience.

Organ transplants prolong the lives of millions of people around the world. Yet, organ supply is an issue, and in India particularly, organ donation statistics at 0.08 per cent per million indicate a critical shortage.

The potential, however, is immense. Doctors A Srivastava and A Mani of the Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, in a paper early this year had surmised using 2013 numbers that if the total number of road accident fatalities in India was 137,572 - with head injury being the cause of death in 40-50 per cent cases - the total organ donation shortage of the country could be met if even 5-10 per cent of these persons served as organ donors.

Certain states have managed to step up action in this area, with the government's efforts aided by private organisations. Tamil Nadu is one such leading state in the country, whose efforts Swarajya covered in November. Reportedly, after a kidney scandal came to light, where an entire colony had its women selling one kidney for paltry sums (the colony came to be known as ""kidney bazaar""), chief minister Jayalalithaa took it upon herself and started the ""Cadaver Transplant Program"" in 2008.

Mohan Foundation (""Mohan"" is an acronym for ""Multi Organ Harvesting Aid Network"") was started in Chennai in 1997 by transplant surgeon Sunil Shroff, who has been at the forefront of deceased organ donation and transplantation in India.

Lalitha Raghuram, the country director at Mohan Foundation, is based in Hyderabad. She emphasised to Swarajya, in an interview, the need for hospital sensitisation in order for these programmes to succeed: ""Contrary to what is commonly believed, the most difficult task is not counselling the families; the difficult part is to sensitise the medical fraternity about this cause and the need for being part of this organ donation movement.""

Excerpts:

Ms Raghuram, we know that Tamil Nadu is the leader in organ transplants, but recently we have heard about Telangana making good strides in this area. Any significant trends that you have noticed?

Without going too much into the statistics, I would say that all southern states are doing well. After Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh are seeing an upward trend, and now Karnataka has picked up. Of course, Kerala has seen a dip.

The positive effect, especially in Telangana and Tamil Nadu, is that organ donation is happening even in the smaller districts. We are witnessing hospitals in Warangal and Karimnagar showing more interest, and couple of organ donations have happened. So, I would put this as a significant trend - that it is not restricted to the state capitals.

Since when has this change been happening, and how has it become possible?

In the last one year. There has been greater awareness and greater networking between hospitals. For instance, Apollo in Hyderabad. Let's say they have a tie-up with a hospital in Karimnagar; there is a brain death there, and they are able to convince the family, and the donation happens. So it is no longer restricted to only certain hospitals. There is greater hospital sensitisation.

I have always maintained that the public is very willing to give. I never had any issues with the public saying 'yes' to organ donation of their near and dear ones. It's just that we had to have our own house in order, our infrastructure in place.

We've seen that even in government hospitals where poor patients come, they are very interested in organ donation, and when they are motivated and counselled that it is going to benefit five to six people, they see that there is a lot of good to it. Only that they want transparency in organ distribution. If you can convince them that there is no malpractice here and the ethics is in place, they are most willing to give. So the issue lies mostly in the hospital domain, not in the public domain.

With such great benefits involved, it's a win-win for all, so why don't hospitals do more of these?

Let's go to the root of the problem. In medical school, doctors are not taught how to declare patients brain dead. Also, since the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994, talks about brain death as well as about organ transplantation. So the impression is that you have to declare brain death only for the sake of organ donation. Whereas, in the Western world, brain death is declared irrespective of whether the organ donation will happen or not.

But that perception is slowly changing among Indian doctors - particularly among the southern states. As a result of which, young doctors especially are declaring brain death and more organ donations are happening.

There is definitely a positive change, and I'm very confident that we're going to see a large number of organ donations in the next five years.

The need is so great. One would expect many more donations to be happening...

If you see my inbox, there are more than 25 emails every day asking for organs for family members. How desperate people become when their loved ones need an organ!

Lalitha Raghuram addressing participants at an NGO meet organised by Mohan Foundation.

What exactly is going for Telangana in this area?

When the state government takes it up, naturally, there is more machinery, and more rules and controls are in place, and more cooperation from everyone. Mohan Foundation was there in Tamil Nadu since 1997, but things picked up after the government became proactive.

Similarly, in Hyderabad also, we started in 2001 and worked on our own till 2013, when we helped start ""Jeevandan"", the government's Cadaver Transplant Program. We have to work very hard to put in place a government body so that everything happens in a streamlined manner.

Like Jeevandan in Telangana and also in Andhra Pradesh, we have initiatives all over the country - we have Navjeevan in Rajasthan, Mrithasanjeevani in Kerala, Jeevandsrthakathe in Karnataka, and similar bodies in Mumbai, Pune, and Nagpur. It started with Tamil Nadu, and we are now part of the advisory committee of several state governments.

As an NGO (non-governmental organisation), you'd made efforts in these two states and they are successful. How can this be scaled up in other states?

I think the most important thing is good public-private partnership - the government and the NGOs working together. Like we have our transplant coordinators, who work with Jeevandan in Telangana, they are posted in Osmania and Gandhi hospitals.

They are trained social workers from institutes like the TISS (Tata Institute of Social Sciences), all colleges of social work and nursing - trained in counselling and coordination. We have trained more than 2,500 transplant coordinators across the country - we have a presence in Chennai, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Delhi, Jaipur, Nagpur, and also Trivandrum.

Why not in other states or cities?

We go to places where we have strong resource people. Money is not the only issue.

We need to have passionate people - we are not selling Pepsi or Coke here. That is our USP - passionate people. Many of those heading our centres in Mumbai, Nagpur, Jaipur, and Bangalore, for instance, are themselves recipients of transplants or donors.

I, too, was the first employee of L V Prasad Eye Institute and then executive director of Eye Bank Association of India, and was looking to get into multi-organ donation work. I met with Dr Shroff and leading doctors in Hyderabad, but the major turning point came when my teenage son met with an accident and was declared brain dead. We donated all his organs and from then on got fully involved in this.

An underlying passion is very important for a cause like this. We need to have partnerships with such people. This is what takes us to those places. State governments could also help us connect with such people.

What are some other ingredients for success?

Good public-private partnership, good media participation, and also religious leaders to talk about organ donation - these would all help. In fact, I call it the Panchasutra: public-private partnership, media participation, trained transplant coordinators, excellent support from the hospitals, and good legislation and organ donation network.

Legislation is in the hand of the state, health being a state subject; so, are there varying legislation across states?

Not much. Most states have adopted the Central Act. Only Telangana has its own Act - the AP Transplantation of Human Organs Act, but it's a copy of the Central Act.

When you say you need excellent support from hospitals, what are you referring to? Is it storage facilities?

You don't need storage because the organ has to be saved and transplanted immediately, because there are so many patients waiting.

Just that when there is a brain death, there are several departments that need to be involved in this; for example, in the ICU (intensive care unit), the patient has to be maintained well on the ventilator, and the nurses and doctors have to work in tandem to ensure that the organs are perfusing properly even after brain death, so that the quality of organs is maintained.

Then comes good counselling and good coordination because most donations are from road-transport accident victims, and when the person is declared brain dead, it automatically becomes a case of post-mortem, so forensic doctors and police have to be involved. So you need to have the wherewithal to undertake all these things on time. The hospital has to be geared up. You can't run helter-skelter at that time; the hospital has to have a good rapport with all these departments so that it happens like a well-oiled system.

Sometimes, the organ-donating families may ask for help to take the body back to their city in an ambulance, for instance. And you should be able to accommodate such requests because for their acts of generosity, small little things need to be taken care of. At that time, you cannot go running to look for agencies to arrange all this; you should know how to take care of it. They need the body back within a time frame, to conduct the rituals; otherwise, they tend to get angry at such a sensitive time. So you have to ensure the family's interests are primary.

Once a couple of donations happen in a hospital, all these things will be put in place; it takes experience to do this. So, as an NGO in this area, we have the wherewithal and experience; we work closely with the hospitals.

So, it has to begin with having enough doctors in place to declare brain death. According to our laws, four doctors have to declare brain death - form No 8 of the Indian Organ Transplantation Act - and all the tests have to be done. All this is necessary. After that, the things I have mentioned - good ventilators, coordination with different departments, police, etc.

Is transplantation a high-cost procedure?

Yes, it is a very high-end surgery.

Is that why the number is small?

No, but donations can happen anywhere. That does not require any costs. Just that the hospital has to be geared up to do that.

What is NOT in place?

Some hospitals don't know how to do it. It is in the medium-sized and small hospitals that the problem arises. Awareness among the hospitals is needed. And also, greater awareness among the public. Some people tend to think that it is against their religion to donate organs. But we've had religious leaders' conferences and all have endorsed donations unanimously.

Do transplants come under Ayushman Bharat?

Yes, they are covered. In fact, Arogyasri of Telangana also covers heart, kidney, and liver transplants.

From Telangana, is there a takeaway for other states for organ donation?

Yes, good public-private partnership. Because you need an NGO that will fuel this whole programme. Government cannot do everything. You may have legislation, you can have good hospitals, you may have doctors and a good organ-distribution network, but if you don't have an NGO that will ensure that this whole thing is put in place, which includes public awareness, hospital sensitisation, training of transplant coordinators, etc - all that infrastructure still wouldn't produce organs. Someone to handhold all agencies is needed.

One person was killed and 24 school students were injured when an overcrowded bus returning from a picnic in Madhya Pradesh met with an accident Tuesday morning in Gujarat's Panchmahal district, said police. The private luxury bus, hired by an Ahmedabad-based school for picnic, fell into a roadside pit after the driver lost control over the vehicle at Parvadi village near Godhra, around 130km from here, said Police Sub-Inspector M V Jotana.

According to an FIR lodged at the Godhra taluka police station, the bus was hired by the Vivekanand Hindi Higher Secondary School, situated in the Narol area of Ahmedabad. The mishap took place when the bus, packed with 107 passengers, including schoolchildren and teachers, was returning to Ahmedabad from Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, where they had gone for a picnic. While the cleaner of the bus, Balram Bhadoria, died in the accident, its driver fled the spot, said Panchmahal District Superintendent of Police Leena Patil.

""The bus slipped into a roadside pit after the driver lost control over the vehicle. While 24 students received minor injuries, the cleaner died as he jumped from the moving bus to save his life,"" said Patil. The injured students were shifted to the Godhra Civil Hospital for treatment, she said. Primary investigations by the police revealed negligence on part of the school management as the bus was carrying 107 passengers, way beyond its capacity, said Patil.

""The bus driver fled from the spot after the accident. The bus was indeed over-crowded. Apart from students, there were teachers and their family members in the bus.

Based on a complaint filed by one of the parents, Radheshyam Prajapati, the Godhra taluka police lodged the FIR against the unidentified driver, bus operator Sitaram Sharma and the school owner, Panjabilal, said the police.

They were booked under various sections of the IPC, including 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 279 (rash driving) and 337 (causing injury by rash act). According to PSI Jotana, the capacity of the bus was just 58, against which 107 people, including 70 students, were in the vehicle at the time of accident.

The course will be implemented from the primary education level for which disbursal of funds have already started, he said.

Besides imparting theoretical knowledge, the curriculum would also highlight the practical aspect of tackling obesity such as the necessity of physical activity, regular measurement of certain parameters and eating healthy food, the official said. Teachers will be taught to induce among students the habit of practising yoga to prevent obesity. The teachers in turn will teach the students, he said.

""The lessons will explain the necessity of regularly monitoring certain parameters like blood pressure, blood sugar and body weight. The first two factors have an intimate relation with obesity. ""All these will be explained in the curriculum to raise the awareness level of the students, which will eventually help their parents know about the basic things about obesity,"" the official told PTI.

In fact, measurement of blood pressure, blood sugar and body weight should be regularly done among school students, he said.

""The instruments for measuring these parameters will be bought by the schools from funds provided by the department, mainly meant for this purpose,"" he said.

The department has already purchased sphygmomanometer and stethoscope for measuring blood pressure, he stated.

According to the earlier norms, only government schools were allowed to become part of the board. Through the Maharashtra International Education Board (MIEB), the state education department aims to bring in a curriculum similar to that of international schools in state-run institutions. A total of 455 schools, including government, aided and self-financed schools from across the state, have applied to become a part of the board. In the first phase, the schools will follow the curriculum of the new board from pre-primary to Class 3, with Marathi as the medium of instruction for the first year. Currently, the governing body of the board is in the process of scanning the applications from schools to select the final 100.

Tawde said the government would pick 25 private schools and 25 aided schools, along with 50 government schools, as the first 100 schools under the board. ""We have got around 40-45 applications from private schools this year, so we decided to allow a few good private schools to join,"" he said.

Heramb Kulkarni, an educationist from the state, said the government needs to be careful before allowing private schools to become a part of the initiative. ""While some private schools are doing good work, they need to set criteria for selection. The move should not benefit schools run by politicians and big corporates,"" he said.

Government schools that would become a part of the selected 100 will be named 'Bharat Ratna Atal Bihari International School' in the memory of the late former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

2018 has been a very significant year for privacy and data protection in India, triggered in part by the Aadhaar case and the affirmation of the fundamental right to privacy by the Supreme Court in 2017. A growing privacy consciousness can be seen among the people, with a view to safeguarding their data and their freedom, as can be seen with the outrage that followed the recent MHA notification.

The same consciousness can be seen in the government as well, but from the perspective of recognising the potential of data, and of privacy and data protection laws as a means to enable this, as opposed to protecting the people. The focus of laws and proposed laws thus, by and large, seems to be with the aim of maximising control and utilisation of data, as opposed to safeguarding people's rights. The recently released draft Intermediary Guidelines are reflective of this as well.

Draft Intermediary Guidelines

Meity released a draft of the Intermediary Guidelines for public consultation on 24 December this year. These guidelines, in addition to various proposed provisions in relation to content regulation, propose a 72-hour time limit to respond to government requests for information. Given the broad definition of 'information' under the IT Act, this could include data of any form, even text, images, messages, databases, etc.. This also includes a requirement to trace the originator of such information on its platform. The proposed requirement is reflective of the traceability requirements which were to be imposed on WhatsApp for dealing with the fake news menace.

Such requirements are being proposed without any clarity on corresponding privacy protections for the people. It must be remembered here that while intermediaries like Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, etc. are often at the receiving end for their lack of privacy protections in relation to the use they make of the data, they have often turned out to be the only protection people have against governmental access of data (the FBI-iPhone struggle, for instance). These rules put in question the extent of governmental access to data with such intermediaries, and also with the use of encryption as a means of protection for users.

The MHA Notification

The recently issued MHA notification is another such instance, which appointed 10 governmental bodies such as the Intelligence Bureau as agents for the purpose of interception, monitoring and decryption. While the notification was widely misunderstood to be conferring unbridled surveillance powers on these agents, it did have the effect of bringing state surveillance to the forefront of people's privacy concerns.

For the sake of clarity, the notification did not make any change to the existing situation or confer any new surveillance powers on the agents (Read here for a full explanation on this). These powers are already within the IT Act, and the issue with their constitutionality existed from the moment of their introduction into the IT Act, and not with this notification.

Another reason for the huge outrage that followed this notification was possibly owing to the introduction of the need for judicial oversight as a procedural safeguard for sharing of data under the Aadhaar judgment (the striking down of Section 33(2)). As a result, any step forward in relation to Section 69 was expected to be in relation to testing its constitutionality and those of the procedural safeguards under related rules. What was seen instead was the government taking the next steps for more efficient exercise of the existing surveillance powers.

Section 69 of the IT Act and its procedural safeguards have long since been in question for their constitutionality. This is owing to, firstly, their failure to meet privacy standards for surveillance possibilities today, the lack of judicial oversight as required under the Aadhaar judgment, and failure to meet the proportionality test as required under the Right to Privacy Judgment. The safeguards, moreover, are on the lines of those prescribed under the PUCL judgment, a judgment which was delivered almost 20 years ago (1996) and in relation to telephone tapping only. Review of these for their constitutionality is thus essential.

The Personal Data Protection Bill

The attitude of the state towards data protection is further reflected in the draft Personal Data Protection Bill, released in July 2018. On the one hand, it was a good step forward for India to move from next to no privacy law at all to a comprehensive privacy law. On the other hand, the fiduciary relationship put forth by the Bill leads to a situation where instead of giving the individual the ultimate control and ownership of his data, once he hands his data to a data fiduciary or controller, he can only trust that the data fiduciary will handle his data in compliance with the law. This is reflected primarily in the omission of the right to erasure (the right to have a data fiduciary delete all data that he has on the individual) among the rights granted to the individuals.

The effect is thus that while the law imposes a number of welcome obligations on the data fiduciaries, the people are not sufficiently empowered in relation to their data. The broad scope of exemptions for State related processing and provisions for non-consensual processing only adds to the lack of control that people have been given, particularly vis-à-vis the State.

TRAI Recommendations on Privacy

In particular, the Bill was a disappointment in comparison with TRAI's Recommendations on Privacy released just prior to the Bill. This was not without its own problems, for instance, that the scope of the Recommendations, which were to apply to the entire digital ecosystem, encompassed a range of entities far beyond TRAI's jurisdictional boundaries, such as browsers, handsets, tablets, OTT services, applications and the like. However, the recommendations put the individual squarely as the owner of his data. The recommendations thus placed the individual in a much stronger position in relation to his data than under the Bill.

Data Localisation

Yet another consequence of the Data Protection Bill was the suggestion of data localisation of 'critical personal data', an undefined term, in a move that was criticised far and wide for its detrimental effects on innovation. This implies, for instance, that companies can no longer rely on global cloud storage, and that there will be a significant increase in compliance costs.

This is also supported by the RBI's move to mandate data localisation for the data with payment service providers such as card networks and mobile wallets. While the scope of data localisation requirements under the Bill is still unclear, the impact of the RBI's data localisation requirements is already being felt with the launch of payment services like Apple Pay being put on hold. While the aim of retaining the data within India might serve the aim of retaining governmental control of the data, it is unlikely to actually contribute to better security or privacy of the data itself.

The Aadhaar Judgment and its impact

The most significant development for privacy was, of course, the Aadhaar judgment. In a final hearing that spanned 38 days over almost five months, this was the second longest one in Indian history, and the people's involvement, whether for or against Aadhaar, was just as tremendous.

After major arguments against Aadhaar, such as with the privacy implications of the large-scale collection and storage of biometric data, and its potential as a surveillance tool, among others, the Supreme Court finally gave a judgment which supported Aadhaar but largely reduced the wide-scale impact it was having. The major cause for this was the limitation of the use of Aadhaar to Section 7 benefits, as well to governmental use.

Thus, while the biometric database with all of its privacy and security concerns has been retained, the uses it can be put to has been limited, for the present. The limiting of its sharing with private companies has had wide implications, including with bringing an end to its rampant mandatory use, such as for children's school admissions, the NEET, hospital admissions, etc. This has also brought an end to eKYC, in a move that affected not only several digital payment companies but also drone companies. This was followed with debates on whether voluntary use of eKYC was possible, and with the introduction of new, offline methods of verification such as the use of QR codes.

Mandatory linking to bank accounts and SIM cards, which was coupled with the threat to disable those accounts/numbers that were not so linked, was thankfully also brought to an end. However, since the judgment, rumours have already started to surface, of the possibility of the bringing in a new law which mandates the same.

The linking of Aadhaar with Voter IDs was another cause for strife that arose this year, with allegations that non-consensual Aadhaar-EPIC seeding was the primary cause for thousands of voters being missed from Telangana electoral lists this year. Among others, these allegations raise questions on whether the Aadhaar database and access to it are really as private as is claimed.

Others

In addition to these primary concerns, a number of other concerns have emerged, which include, among others, the proposed Social Media Communications Hub which has been challenged before the Supreme Court at present, introduction of the draft DNA bill in Parliament for the creation of a national DNA databank for certain categories of persons, and the proposal of a national AI marketplace for data aggregation.

2019 for Privacy?

Looking at the year gone by for privacy, one can look ahead at 2019 only with concern, since many of these developments discussed here are currently in draft form. 2019 may well see these laws taking concrete form by being enacted. The involvement of the people has played a crucial role in reducing the rampant use of Aadhaar, if not bringing it to a complete halt. While there is a huge movement in the field of privacy and data protection, the people will have to continue playing this role to ensure that it takes the right direction.

The previous BJP government increased the time of school by an hour in 2014. Teachers across the state had opposed the increase of the school timing but the government did not reduce it. For the last four years, teachers have been agitating while demanding reducing school time.

The Congress promised to reduce school time in its election manifesto and so teachers are now reminding the Congress government of its promise.

Similarly, teachers' training camps are organised every year in the state. These camps were non-residential during the previous Congress government's tenure. The BJP government had ordered to conduct residential teacher training camp three years ago and teachers across the state had protested against it. Teachers in different districts of the state boycotted these camps forcing the previous BJP government to take disciplinary action against them.

Now the government has changed in the state and so teachers are demanding that these camps be made non-residential.

Teachers' delegation led by Rajasthan Primary Secondary Teachers Association president Shashi Bhushan Sharma and senior vice president Vipin Prakash Sharma met both Gehlot and Pilot on Tuesday. They handed over their five-point demand letter. Sharma said that both CM and Deputy CM listened to them carefully. They then instructed the officers to take immediate action.

This decision has been taken after the central government, in July this year, scrapped the 'No detention policy', thereby allowing states to detain children in class 5 and 8.

Earlier, schools could not detain or make any child repeat a class until Class 8. The amendment to Section 16 of the Right To Education Act, takes away the important 'no detention policy' which was enforced in 2010.

Confirming the same, Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, state education minister, said, ""All the damage in the state of Gujarat has been done due to the no detention policy. Due to the policy, fear among students had gone which led to poor results. Not just students, even the parents stopped paying attention to their studies. With no exams till class 8, how do you expect a child to perform well in higher standards? The result of the policy was seen during board exams.""

While the centre has asked states to conduct exams in class 5 and 8, we are likely to introduce the same for class 3 also. The issue is pending in Rajya Sabha now. Once we get the nod, we will be implementing the same.""

The seventh edition of Gunotsav, annual drive to ascertain learning levels of primary school students, had revealed shocking results, with nearly 6 lakh of the 21 lakh surveyed could not do basic reading, writing or arithmetic.

But now it is in great demand and actually all the positions get filled and people take it as their first choice. Why I took it is because for some reason towards the end of finishing my medical school, MBBS, I got interested, maybe, because it was interesting to read about it at that time and it somehow suited my personality.

But now, for instance in the US, it is in much greater demand than medicine or paediatrics. It has changed a lot in the last ten years and more so in the last five years.

SOM: Despite the need for more Psychiatrists in the US, mental health care, it is said, is not treated the same way as physical health. Is this true?

Dr. Chandragiri: It is both yes and no. In the US there is a greater need for Psychiatrists. But what happened is, the slot for Psychiatry were frozen for nearly 15 to 20 years. So there have been fewer programme openings and if there are openings they have not been keeping in pace with the population growth.

There has been a shortage of Psychiatrists for a long time now, where I practice. I am the Psychiatry Residency Programme Director and one of the reasons we started the programme was to increase the supply of Psychiatrists locally for us.

Mental health care, in some ways is not, but more recently now, we have mental health parity, that is, mental health care should be treated on par with physical health care. For a long time some insurance companies were not covering Psychiatric treatment. That is no longer the case. It has improved. It is not one hundred per cent there, but definitely it is a lot better.

SOM: Where does Psychiatry in India stand as there are less than 4,000 Psychiatrists in the country for a population of 1.2 billion. That is just about one Psychiatrist for over 13,000 people.

Dr. Chandragiri: I am not an expert about work-force requirement in India but 4,000 we know are very low. Again it is the same thing. But every slot gets filled and it is not that Psychiatrist PG training slots get unfilled. Everything gets filled and lots of people choose Psychiatry as their first choice, but the problem is that not enough people are being trained to be Psychiatrists.

SOM: Since you are associated with Manipal University as Adjunct Visiting Professor, Department of Psychiatry, Kasturba Medical College, what are the changes you have seen here in the last 27 years since you passed out?

Dr. Chandragiri: The changes I have seen in Psychiatry are that gradually the stigma towards seeking Psychiatric treatment has decreased. Maybe the decrease is more in the metropolitan areas and among more educated people. But I think overall the stigma has decreased and more people are seeking treatment. The quality of treatment is not just training Psychiatrists but there are other programmes like social workers for example and the training for Psychiatrists for medical students has improved a lot. At least the MCI (Medical Council of India) guidelines have changed and they require more training. Whether it is actually implemented everywhere we don't know. But in Manipal it is implemented.

SOM: Your License is unrestricted in States of Pennsylvania. What does this kind of License mean?

Dr. Chandragiri: Oh, that just means everyone gets unrestricted license. We put that in CVs, because when you apply for a job or something, they know that it is unrestricted, that is the norm. Unrestricted License is the default license. Restricted license means you are in trouble that you might have committed something like you have over-prescribed or you did something unethical or usually for people who had substance use problems like alcohol or drug use...

SOM: Even the doctors have these problems?

Dr. Chandragiri: Yes. So if something like that happens, you lose your license for a period of time and then you have to demonstrate that you are maintaining sobriety or something like that. They may restore your license but for a year or two you have to work under someone else's supervision.

SOM: Is this rule also there in India?

Dr. Chandragiri: I think it must be there in the rulebook. But I do not know how strictly it is enforced. There are many examples that I personally know of in the US where the Psychiatrists' Licenses have come under restricted category where they have to go for treatment and maintain sobriety. It is usually for people with alcohol problems. If a crime is committed then the license is not going to be restored.

SOM: As Psychiatrists, do you have emergency cases like for instance you have to face as a Surgeon or even as a Physician?

Dr. Chandragiri: Yes, you do have a lot of emergencies and especially in the US it is a little more. For example, somebody may come in a very, very agitated state because they are psychotic, talking to themselves, they are out of touch with reality, have been destructive. So you have to assess and control them. Lot of times, somebody comes in, who is suicidal, very depressed and you have to make a decision whether to admit that person or you can discharge them home and they can be followed as outpatients. So those are the kind of emergencies we get.

SOM: Any examples you can share?

Dr. Chandragiri: Like a person may come in totally psychotic believing that people are trying to hurt him, hearing voices of people who are not actually there, the person's thinking is highly disorganised and then you have to decide whether this is schizophrenia or a drug induced psychosis. Sometimes if it is what we call stimulate induced psychosis then the treatment is slightly different from the person who just came with schizophrenia. So that can happen at any time of day or night.

Where I work, we actually have a separate Psychiatric Emergency room. It is in the regular emergency room but separate part of it where we treat these kinds of patients.

SOM: But are there any separate mental hospitals like we have NIMHANS (National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences) in Bengaluru?

Dr. Chandragiri: There are. I worked for a while in a State Psychiatric Hospital. But those places are decreasing in numbers. More and more psychiatry is being treated in general hospitals.

In India though there is a separate one like NIMHANS, there are many Psychiatric Wards in many hospitals. For example in Manipal, the Psychiatric Unit is in the general hospital, I think they have one in JSS too; in Mysore Medical College again it is within the general hospital. That is the way it is being treated and Psychiatrists are trained everywhere.

SOM: What about NIMHANS?

Dr. Chandragiri: Yes, NIMHANS used to be a mental hospital but now it is a major research institute known worldwide. It has changed, its primary function is not a mental hospital. They treat a lot of mentally ill people. A long time ago, the reason was, a lot of psychiatric illnesses could not be treated. So, many of them were being kept in large mental hospitals, many times, forever. There are still some patients who may not respond to many medications, other treatments and may need longer term treatments. But the number of patients who need long term treatments are steadily decreasing because we have better treatments and better outcomes.

SOM: You have presented a paper 'A treatment Dilemma' at the International College of Neuropsychopharmacology (CINP) World Congress, Vienna, Austria, in June this year. What is this dilemma about?

Dr. Chandragiri: Oh that dilemma was about a young patient who had schizophrenia, who had not responded to many different medicines. In the middle of the treatment we said we will put him on a medicine called clozapine which will treat schizophrenia. Then we had to do a blood test where we discovered that he had low platelet count and then we saw that we could not give clozapine because of low platelet count. Then we realised that with every medicine we started he would get low platelet count and when we stopped it, his platelet count would increase and then we didn't know whether it is Idiopathic Thrombocytopenia, in which the treatment is to take out the spleen. In his case it seemed like it was drug induced because whenever a drug was given his platelet count was going down. We consulted a Haematologist and other specialists, but it was still unclear. Finally, his spleen was taken out and then the platelet count came back to normal so that we could give him this clozapine and his condition improved. And also because he had schizophrenia, he couldn't even give consent, he couldn't agree to the surgery. So his mother had to go to court and take power of attorney over him. We decided to submit the paper which was accepted in the World Congress.

SOM: How much of teaching and private practice are you involved in and which gives you more satisfaction?

Dr. Chandragiri: This time it is almost 50/50. Both of them give me lot of satisfaction. I teach medical students and residents and so teaching residents gives me a lot of satisfaction because with teaching you have to continuously strive to improve. In practice you still have to keep up developments but not in great depth. You have to know enough to keep using them.

For instance when I gave a talk at Manipal, one was about a treatment called TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) that is relatively new for depression for other psychiatric conditions too but mainly for depression in which there is a big machine where you put a magnet over the head and then stimulate the brain.

SOM: Do you have this machine in Manipal?

Dr. Chandragiri: In Manipal they don't but they have something similar to that. But I have that in Pennsylvania. It is there all over the world. Even in the US it is slowly increasing. So that means for people for whom other treatments for depression do not work, you can use that machine.

SOM: Depression is a huge problem. For instance one person who has openly talked about it is actress Deepika Padukone. In US, many celebrities have talked about depression. Tell us something about it.

Dr. Chandragiri: The important thing for people to know about depression is, it is an illness, and it is a disease just like one has a heart disease or hyper-tension, asthma. Depression happens because there are changes in your brain, the changes in how the nerve cells communicate with each other because there is some chemical imbalance.

In depression, one is feeling down, has no energy, no motivation, feels guilty about things they don't need to feel guilty about, cannot sleep, cannot get up, and that person may be labelled as lazy, or as lacking ambition, whereas, the fact is they cannot help themselves. Many times, I think others will look at it as weakness of character.

SOM: Have you come across any celebrities and have you yourself treated any of them?

Dr. Chandragiri: Celebrities I have not, but possibly if I did I would not reveal it. But there are celebrities who have had depression and admitted to seeking treatment. The person with depression many a times may not know that he is going through depression and that may be the issue. So to remove that stigma, you should seek treatment; otherwise it will lead to bad outcomes."

Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur stated this while addressing a public meeting at Dughilag in Lag valley of Kullu district today.

Jai Ram Thakur said that the State Government was giving special thrust on development of far flung and remote areas of the State. He said that the Government would provide all possible help to develop Lag valley from tourism point of view.

The Chief Minister said that present State Government was completing one year of office on 27th of this month. He said that one year back when he took oath as the Chief Minister of the State, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and top BJP Central leadership graced the oath ceremony held at Shimla. It was honour for our State that on the completion of one year of office, the Prime Minister was once again gracing the 'Jan Aabhar Rally' being held at Dharmashala on 27th of this month, he said. This shows the love and affection the Prime Minister shares with the people of the State, he added.

Jai Ram Thakur said that Prime Minister has always provided help to the State not only for its development but also helped the State at the time of distress. He said that seven helicopters were provided by the Centre to airlift the people stranded due to untimely snowfall in Lahaul valley and Holi in Chamba. He said that the Centre has also provided developmental projects worth Rs 9000 crore for the State.

The Chief Minister also accused the previous State Government for making announcements in fag end of its tenure with a desperate attempt to grab power. He said that several colleges and educational institutions were announced without any provision in the budget. He said that on the other hand the State Government from the day one was working for the development of the State without any politics of vengeance and vendetta. He said that the very first decision of the State Government was aimed at welfare of the senior citizens.

Jai Ram Thakur said that Jan Manch has been a big success among the common man of the State as this has ensured redressal of their grievances nearer to their homes.

The Chief Minister announced Rs. one crore for the construction of Government Senior Secondary School Dughling. Announced Rs. 3 lakh for each Mahila Mandal Bhawan Dughling and Laidharag. He announced opening of Health Sub Centre for Gram Panchayat Salan. Alongwith upgradation of Middle School Chaupartha to High School, he also announced Rs. 10 lakh for construction of Primary School building Dugan.

The Bhawan would have car parking in ground floor and shopping complex in first floor. The second floor would have five suits and third floor would have Conference halls.

He also laid foundation stone of renovations and restoration work of Deputy Commissioner's office which would be completed at a cost of Rs. 80 lakh.

The Chief Minister also performed Bhoomi Pujan of Dupkan to Dunkhari Gahar road to be completed by spending an amount of Rs 4.93 crore.

Forest and Transport Minister Shri Govind Thakur said that the State was fortunate to have Chief Minister from the Mandi Parliamentary Constituency for the first time after the formation of the State. He said that the State was witnessing all-round and equitable development under dynamic leadership of Jai Ram Thakur. He expressed gratitude that Kullu district was witnessing rapid pace of development for the last one year.

Ram Swaroop Sharma said that during the four and a half years he had strived hard at the Centre to raise developmental issues of the State. He said that the combination of Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Centre and Chief Minister Shri Jai Ram Thakur at the State was ensuring that Himachal Pradesh emerges as a front runner State of the country.

MLA Kullu Sunder Singh Thakur while welcoming the Chief Minister and other dignitaries to this remote area of his home constituency thanked the Chief Minister for dedicated various developmental projects for the area. He also urged the Chief Minister for ensuring better road connectivity and water supply to the area. He also detailed various developmental demands of the area.

Former MP Maheshwar Singh also spoke on the occasion and detailed various developmental demands of the area. He also urged the Chief Minister for developing the area from tourism point of view.

MLA Banjar Surinder Shourie, MLA Anni Kishori Lal Sagar, HPMC Vice Chairman Ram Singh, District BJP President Bhim Sain, Deputy Commissioner Kullu Yunus were also present among others on the occasion.>"

Aneesh, son of Krishna Kotian and Renuka, residents of Karkala taluk allegedly suffered injuries on his back.

Aneesh is a Class 1 student of a Government Aided Higher Primary School. He was not keeping well on Saturday and had taken de-worming tablets. The parents thus thought of sending lunch from home and requested the head teacher Suresh S R to allow their son to consume food brought from home.

However, Suresh allegedly insisted that Aneesh consume the food prepared at the school. When the boy refused to have the food at around 12.30 pm on Saturday, he was summoned to the staff room by Suresh. He again put pressure on the boy to eat food prepared at the school. When the boy refused, the head teacher beat him with a stick to the extent that the boy got ""severe"" bruises.

Renuka, mother of Aneesh, who complained to Karkala rural police pleaded that action be taken against the head teacher.Nazeer Hussain, sub-inspector attached to the Karkala Rural Police Station told TNIE that the head teacher went absconding after the complaint was lodged by the boy's mother on Sunday.

A spectacular Christmas switch-on took place at London's Luton Airport, which saw 1.5 miles of multi-colored LED lights and 850,000 light sequences illuminate an entire easyJet Airbus as a festive treat for airport staff and families.

A team of 10 special effects artists and lighting designers spent four weeks working on the design and it took staff at the airport a painstaking 24 hours to create the display inside easyJet's 5000 sqm aircraft hangar. An A320 Airbus was provided to ground staff by easyJet which became the star of the show on Monday as staff draped it in twinkling lights, while festive images were projected against the 120ft aircraft.

As a festive surprise and to add some extra seasonal cheer, local children from Chantry Primary Academy and Whitefield Primary School were invited to the show which saw hundreds of people gather in the airport to see the festive projections and lights synced to a contemporary remix of Tchaikovsky's Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy.

The Christmas spectacular was designed to celebrate the airport's 80th anniversary and the completion of the three-year redevelopment of the airport, which increases the annual capacity of the airport to 18 million passengers by 2020.

Literally. Seventy-two years after Independence, the village inhabited by 120 tribal families has no pucca road, drinking water supply or healthcare facilities. Located 17 km from Kaptipada town, Hudisahi is deprived of basic amenities.

While the villagers eke out their living as daily wage workers, some families earn a livelihood by selling sal leaves and stitching leaf plates. Lack of a bridge over Kaniabuda canal has posed a major hurdle for all-round development of the village which remains cut off from the mainstream during rainy season. The locals alleged that no official ever visited the village and enquired about their condition.

Similarly, the inaccessible area makes healthcare facility a distant dream for the villagers. Sans road connectivity, 102 and 108 ambulance vehicles never reach the village. In cases of emergency, they carry serious patients and pregnant women on slings for two km till Haldiasahi which has a motorable road to Thakurmunda and Kaptipada hospitals. There have been incidents of patients succumbing on the way to Haldiasahi.

""There is no tubewell or drinking water supply system in our village. Consumption of contaminated canal water poses a serious health hazard for the villagers. Local quacks and tantriks take advantage of the situation. Frequent interruptions in power supply have also added to our woes,"" said a villager.

While the anganwadi centre runs from a thatched shade with no wall, the village primary school has no basic facilities for students. Mid-day meals are being served at a dilapidated house used for kitchen in unhygienic condition.

Seta Banra, a resident of the village, said, ""We don't send our children to higher educational institutions at Sarat and Bhandar which are located 14 km from the village. It is only during elections that villagers get to see politicians and some Government officers who accompany them. Promises of development are made and forgotten.""

Talking to the media persons in Ranchi, School Education and Literacy Minister Neera Yadav said that the State Government is ready for talks and consider the logical demands made by them in a transparent manner. Notably, around 67000 para-teachers all over the State have been agitating for the last 38 days demanding regularisation of their services and other facilities on the lines of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal and have been staging indefinite rotation dharnas outside the residences of ministers in the State Government. Education in around 12000 primary and middle schools have been completely or partially been affected due to this deadlock.

""Even though we are ready for talks, the protesting para - teachers are not ready for it.even if they come tomorrow, we are ready for a discussion with an assurance that their demands, if rational, will be fulfilled. otherwise we will be forced to take strong step in the interest of the children,"" said Yadav.

Since, dialogue is the only solution to end any deadlock, they have been repeatedly being asked to come forward for talks so that the issues, whatever they might be, could be amicably discussed and resolved, she added. ""If they show some willingness for talks, we will further extend the deadline for another one day, in case they are reluctant to start the talks on Christmas,"" said Yadav.

Counting on the facilities the para-teachers have been given since Government of Raghubar Das came into power; Yadav said that the State Government is committed towards providing quality education.

""Future of thousands of students could not be put on stake anymore and hence they must come forward for talks or the Government is free to take steps to secure quality education to the children in this State,"" said the minister. Para teachers, on the other hand, are adamant on their demands and are not ready to bow down before the State Government. ""

We also believe that table - talk is the only way out, but will not go for it until the State Government calls us formally by issuing a letter in this regard. Any decision will be taken following a state level meeting,"" said leader of Ekikrit Para- Teacher Sangharsh Morcha, Bajrang Prasad.

He, however, cleared that any talks with the State Government will be held only after the Assembly Session ends on July 27. Prasad said that they will not let go the sacrifice of the five para - teachers who lost their lives in this movement. It is worth mentioning that at least four para-teachers have died so far due to shock, depression and cold wave while one of their friends - Ujjwal Rai succumbed after getting injured in police lathi-charge when he was protesting before Chief Minister Raghubar Das during Foundation Day celebrations on November 15."

After mohalla clinics, the Delhi government has set up 101 ""mohalla playschools"" or ""modern anganwadi hub centres"" for children from the economically disadvantaged families.

The centres are part of the Delhi government's ongoing reforms in the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme under which the anganwadi centres provide food, preschool education and primary health care to children up to six years of age and their mothers.

Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia, who also looks after the women and child department, inaugurated the centres on Monday.

""We recognised that care for children starts from the time when they are in their mothers' wombs and learning starts from the day they are born. Our 10,000 plus anganwadi centres are the platform to provide this care and learning. In a way, these hubs are 'mohalla play schools' for the children of the common people who can't afford play schools otherwise,"" he said.

The centres, which will cater to children aged between 3 and 6, have been created by clubbing two or three existing angawadis in multiple locations, including Okhla, Kondli and Patparganj.

The centres were inaugurated by legislators of the respective areas. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government is also planning to come up with a new curriculum to make these children school-ready.

""Poor early learning experience in early years is the beginning of the learning gap that gets further perpetuated as children progress to higher classes. Government school children start formal school in class 1 and are already at a disadvantage compared to those who go to playschools that use various tools for cognitive development during early childhood,"" Sisodia said.

Earlier this month, the government had trained anganwadi workers under its new early childhood education (ECE) curriculum. ""The new curriculum was developed in collaboration with ECE experts and has many new learning features and techniques based on latest research on early childhood learning and development,"" a government statement read."

The Gautam Buddh Nagar administration has invited private players to join it in uplifting the infrastructure and quality of education in state-run primary schools under the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative, an official said. The administration's move comes days after a wall of a private school collapsed in Noida's Salarpur village, killing two children and injuring three others.

Officials had said that the illegally-run school's building was in a ""poor and deteriorated"" condition. ""There are 685 government primary and upper primary schools. When the quality of established private schools is compared with government schools, there is a perceptible gap. The gap needs to be bridged,"" district magistrate Brajesh Narain Singh said in an official letter last week.

While the initiative to invite private players is new, the administration had inked pacts with leading private firms such as the HCL Foundation and Paytm last year for partnership in around 100 schools.

Singh said of late, some good companies have come forward to play their roles under the CSR initiative and they have adopted the schools after signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the administration.

""Their work ranges from providing infrastructure facilities to improving the quality of education. At times the effort is in form of a joint venture as well. Many are doing good work. All this is being done without creation of any rights of any type and is purely under the CSR initiative,"" he said.

As many as 580 schools in the four blocks of the district -- Bisrakh, Dadri, Dankaur and Jewar -- are up for adoption and proposals for this could be sent to the administration by January 15, 2019, the magistrate said.

""I reiterate that this will be only under the CSR initiative and all rights shall be reserved with the administration,"" Singh said."

They have built a school by pooling Rs 2.20 crore with 24 classrooms and imparting English education alongside Kannada, and it is all set for inauguration.

The 43-year-old Government Higher Primary School, Daddalkad, Bantwal taluk, was in a dilapidated condition in 2015 and had only 30 students. Now it has around 500 children, studying from LKG to class VIII, where English is taught along with Kannada.

It was all possible because of the efforts and foresight of Shree Durga Friends Club, Karenki, led by Prakash Anchan, a garment merchant from Bantwal.

""When most Kannada-medium schools across the state are closing down due to various reasons, we wanted to show the world that this school can be saved by adopting new teaching skills, and today we are successful in doing so. Our mission began three year ago when theschool had only 30 children. Even those who had joined nearby English-medium schools have quit, and have taken admission here,"" says an elated Prakash while speaking to TOI.

The first phase of the school with eight classrooms was inaugurated last April, and second and final phase will be inaugurated by governor Vajubhai Vala on January 5.

Anchan added that they collected all the money from generous donors, who included locals, parents and others. ""We have not taken a single penny from any government be it the Centre or state. When we proposed the same building plan, the government estimated a cost of Rs 6 crore, but we have completed the work by spending Rs 2.2 crore.""

The school has five government-appointed teachers, three guest teachers, three vehicle drivers, and Karate, dance and music teachers. About16 staff are paid by the Shree Durga Friends Club members. All the facilities are provided free-of-cost to children, including transportation.

Success story

In 2015, when the school was about to shut down, the Shree Durga Friends Club members swung into action. They made their own children quit from English-medium schools and admitted them to the school, due to which their number rose to 56 from 30. The members later sought permission from the department of public instruction to convert the medium of instruction to English. It has adopted teaching in the English-medium in a Kannada school, which is a model similar to what is followed in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The club is in a five-year agreement with the government to run the school in various capacities.

Earlier, the school had only three teachers appointed by the government. After taking over, club members have recruited additional teachers, and the club pays their salaries. It has transportation and other facilities."

And since then, many famous Indian personalities have been celebrated with doodles.

Google Doodle has an interesting history. Apparently, the ritualistic tradition of adorning the colourful homepage of the search engine with scribbles began even before the company was incorporated in 1998.

The occasion was the Burning Man festival and Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who were supposed to be ""out of office"" for the fest, were on the lookout for a unique style to convey the message. What started out with simply adding the Burning Man stick figure to the logo, has turned into an almost regular tradition, using thoughtful visual doodles to mark key events and celebrate iconic people around the world.

Over 20 years and 2,000-plus doodles, the presence of Indian milestones and personalities is felt every now and then. YourStory takes a look at the top 10 Google Doodles from India that grabbed attention in 2018.

Doodle 4 Google 2018 - India Winner

Mumbai-based Pingla Rahul More, a Class 8 student from JB Vachha High School, was chosen as the winner of the annual Doodle 4 Google competition this year, and to celebrate the occasion, Google India displayed her artwork on its website. The all-India competition, which is organised every year around November 14 on Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru's birthday, also celebrated as Children's Day in India, received more than 75,000 entries based on 2018's theme of ""What inspires me?""

And in tune with this theme, Pingla's doodle - titled ""Galaxy, Space Exploration"" - showcased the possibilities that the vast universe presents and human exploration of the same. Her artwork beautifully captured the galaxy, replete with a young girl and her telescope.

Sir M Visvesvaraya's 158th Birthday

September 15 marked the 158 birth anniversary of Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya, a well-recognised civil engineer whose birthday is also celebrated as Engineer's Day in India. Unfailingly, Google celebrated the occasion with a special doodle tribute.

Known for his contributions in irrigation design, Sir MV (as he is fondly called by many) was raised in the village of Muddenahalli - that falls in erstwhile Mysore kingdom and present-day Karnataka. He had a licence in civil engineering from the University of Bombay and was involved in the construction of Krishna Raja Sagar dam in Mandya district in Karnataka.

Floral motifs resembling the lotus and images of peacocks, elephant and tiger accompanied the homepage logo on August 15 as Google celebrated India's 72 Independence Day. This was in tune with the long-standing tradition, wherein each year the tech giant would come up with a unique design to mark the national event. This year, however, the inspiration came from Indian truck art, mostly comprising folk designs.

Dilip Sardesai's 78th Birthday

On August 8, an animated doodle celebrated the life and achievements of legendary cricketer Dilip Sardesai. To mark his 78th birthday, the homepage animation captured the spirit of this sportsman with a doodle showing him on the pitch and in action. Sardesai was best-known for his batting against the West Indies team. He was particularly effective against spin bowling and as his son, journalist Rajdeep Sardesai summarises, ""He wasn't the greatest fielder, but he was always someone who was ready for a fight.""

With a doodle artfully capturing the expressive features of Indian cinema's tragedy queen Meena Kumari, Google marked the birthday of the actress on August 1. Fondly known as ""Baby Meena"" among her fans, the actress' tryst with showbiz happened at the tender age of four. Following which, Baby Meena went on to make appearances in more than 90 films over a 38-year-long successful career.

In addition to being a Bollywood star, the actress was also an accomplished poet who even recorded her Urdu compositions in an album titled, I Write, I Recite.

Raja Ram Mohan Roy's 246th Birthday

A free thinker and a scholar, Raja Ram Mohan Roy was born in 1772 in the British-controlled Bengal presidency of India. During his life, he learned a host of languages including Bengali, Hindi, English, Arabic, Persian, and Sanskrit. Drawing inspiration from his multicultural learning, he went on to become an advocate of women's rights and also fought against social evils like the caste system. On May 22, Google celebrated his 246 birth anniversary with a doodle tribute.

Mrinalini Sarabhai's 100th Birthday

Trained in both Bharatanatyam and Kathakali, the two distinct Indian dance forms, Mrinalini Sarabhai was an accomplished dancer and choreographer. Along with her husband, she founded the Darpana Academy of Performing Arts in 1949 in an attempt to pass on the craft to thousands of other aspiring dancers. On May 11 - the occasion of her 100 birthday - illustrator Sudeepti Tucker celebrated her life and contribution with a sketch depicting the dancer with her trademark parasol.

Dadasaheb Phalke's 148th Birthday

Guest artist Aleesha Nandh depicted a young Dadasaheb Phalke in action in her black and white and yellow creation for the search engine's homepage on April 30, the day marking the cinematic genius' 148 birthday. Born as Dhundiraj Govind Phalke in Trimbak in present-day Maharashtra, this Indian legend learnt filmmaking in London and went on to create his masterpiece and what is considered India's first full-length feature film - Raja Harishchandra in 1913.

Holi 2018

A splash of colours took over the Google homepage on March 2 as doodle artist Amrita Marino's creative work depicted a mix of emotions that is the festival of Holi. Apart from being a day of colourful celebration, Holi also marks the seasonal change - end of winter, arrival of spring, and this was well-portrayed in the symbolic use of the four primary colours in the Google Doodle.

On February 1, 1976, renowned author and poet Kamala Das' autobiography My Story, written originally in English and later translated into Malayalam, was published. Almost four decades since then, Google celebrated this wordsmith's life earlier this year with a vibrant doodle, replete with her animated sketch and a background resembling the nightscape."

A proposal for 20 such schools with low enrolment was cleared by the north corporation's House meeting on Monday. These will give rise to 10 new schools.

Located mostly in the Karol Bagh, Narela and Rohini zones, these schools are currently running at places like Inderpuri, Pyare Lal Road, Shahbad Daulatpur, Nimari Colony, Shiv Nagar, Pratap Kunj, Avantika, Sangam Park, Molar Basti, Old Ranjeet Nagar, Azadpur Colony and Auchandi.

A senior corporation official attributed the decision to low enrolment, poor finances, and proper utilisation of resources. He gave the example of the proposal to merge Municipal Corporation Primary School (MCPS) Pyare Lal Road 2 and MCPS New Dev Nagar Co-ed School. ""Keeping in view better management, saving of posts and the poor economic condition of north corporation, it would be feasible to merge schools in case of availability of accommodation,"" he said.

The proposal also argues that more and more parents want to educate their wards in morning-shift schools. ""MCPS Pyarelal Road has 202 kids while the Dev Nagar school has 265. After merger, a school with 467 kids and 12 sections will be formed,"" the official said.

He added: ""There are many vacancies in other schools and the staff from the schools being closed down can be sent there. At the same time, we will be able to use the buildings and other infrastructure for purposes such as sports academies.""

The merger of the two schools alone would lead to a surplus of a principal, five teachers and two Class IV employees who could be reassigned. The official also said that 29 schools with low enrolment had been similarly shut down two years ago. But education experts have been criticising the corporations for their failure to enrol more children.

Khagesh Jha, a Supreme Court lawyer and education activist, remarked, ""If the corporation has extra land, why not add to the capital's school infrastructure so that more kids can be brought in the school system? There are more than 20 lakh kids outside the school system in the city. Besides, children from unrecognised schools too need to be brought to government schools.""

The north civic body runs 714 municipal primary schools, in which children, mostly from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, study. Enrolment in all corporation-run schools, however, has been declining steadily. Around 70,000 students have opted out of north schools since the 2012 trifurcation. It then had 3,70,648 students in its primary schools. This figure slid to 3,50,611 in 2013-14 and 3,14,022 in 2016-17. At present, around three lakh students are on the rolls."

It was a pre-Christmas party and someone was asking me why I was so obsessed with toilets. I patiently explained that no less a personage than Bill Gates considered it important to research and understand why so many Indians preferred the fields to closed toilets.

""Why don't you write about something more important?"" asked my interlocutor. ""Such as human rights?"" I considered this for a long moment. ""Do you think humans have a right to do it in the fields?"" I asked him finally. ""Why don't you ask some villagers what they think?"" he dared me. So I did.

I met my first problem right here - no one in the Mumbai suburb of Swachhpura could understand why we needed to discuss something that had been an accepted tradition since the dawn of peristalsis. No one disputed that on Indian streets, cows and bulls dropped steaming patties where they wished, or that birds did it on the sculpted heads of statesmen and visionaries.

But humans, being at the top of the food chain, should be able to excrete at will where they wished. This was the considered opinion of the council elders. ""But is open-air excretion a human right?"" I asked.

""It's a human need as well as a right and no one can take it away,"" the village elder replied. ""Though God knows wave after wave of colonisers have tried their best to suppress and deny human excretory rights. Our diets used to be rich in fruits, nuts, quick-cooked vegetables, unmilled cereals, and fibres. Then along came McDonald's, KFC, Pizza Hut and their ilk, with their fizzy zero-calorie drinks and burgers high in proteins and preservatives and no roughage. Now our children don't go in

the morning.""

""You're telling me that suppressing human excretory rights has been an international agenda through history?"" ""Exactly,"" he said admiringly. ""You are definitely the sharpest knife in the drawer.""

""There's more,"" he continued. ""Multinationals offer top dollar for our land and rivers to build their factories. We're poor, so we take the offer. Now the field I once used to fertilise with my exertions every morning belongs to a corporate giant who makes breakfast cereal we don't even like.""

I thought this was an opportune moment to introduce the toilet theme. ""Supposing we constructed a toilet in each village, so that every villager could use one? Imagine a closed room, completely private, with an easy-to-clean ceramic bowl, a tap with running water, special super-soft, double-ply tissues which we call toilet paper - and a small fee, perhaps a rupee, to hire an attendant to keep it clean?"" The assembly was silent, chewing over this new concept. ""You mean we'll now pay to do something that we could once do where we wished?""

Another calculated: ""A rupee a day is 30 rupees a month. I have seven in my family, so we're looking at about 200 rupees a month. And, we usually don't have any money in the last week. Does this mean we'd have to just not go until the next salary arrived?""

""There's that old suppression of minority rights trick again!"" shouted an angry villager. ""They're trying to create a problem for us by taking a right away, then trying to get us all hot and bothered about our rights being violated, and then suggesting a solution that will only make us poorer and more constipated!""

""Not necessarily,"" I said. ""What if the first 25 families that endorse walled public toilets were offered a free lifetime supply of Isabgol? It's an outstanding laxative.""

There was silence. ""Also free education up to end of school for the first three children,"" I added. More silence. ""And fur-lined seats,"" I threw in, desperately. Some villagers began to nod. ""Do we have a right to these free add-ons - Isabgol, school, fur-lined seats?""

I smiled. Breakthrough! ""You do!"" I cried. ""You also have a natural right to an Income Generating Activity, such as packaging locally harvested fleaseed husks, that will generate enough income to pay for the free add-ons."" ""We pay for free add-ons?"" frowned a villager.

""You can call them whatever you like,"" I said triumphantly. ""Bottom line: you have a right to a toilet. You have a right to a fur-lined toilet. You have a right to have a smooth unfettered bowel movement each morning. You have a right to a laxative. You have a right to child-friendly environment and free primary education. You have a right to pay for all of the above. Isn't science wonderful?""

""I beg to differ about the paying. . ."" began one old man. I held up a finger. ""I regret that is the only thing you don't, at this moment, have a right to do,"" I said."

Vibrant and despairing, diverse and parochial, hyper-traditional and quick to change, rural India is more than the sum of its contradictions

Let There Be Light

NIGHT VISION: Kids collecting freshly charged LED lanterns at a micro solar power station near Hardoi in UP. (Photo: Bandeep Singh)

Governments are generally bigger on promises than on delivery. On rural electrification, though, PM Narendra Modi has been keen to trumpet his achievements. Modi promised that 18,452 villages that were yet to be 'electrified', out of India's 600,000 villages, would be connected to the grid in 1,000 days. On April 28 this year, he announced that the target had been achieved. Leisang, in Manipur, was the last place in the country to officially receive electricity, ""a historic day in the development journey of India"", as the prime minister tweeted. But there appears to be a difference between being 'electrified' and actually having access to electricity. Recent studies by academics show that power supply and billing in rural areas are significant hurdles, so while households are connected, are they necessarily availing the benefits of having electricity? As the photograph suggests, solar-generated power is crucial to India's commitment to clean energy. Despite solar power being cheaper than its coal-generated equivalent, and despite the rapid increase in India's solar capacity, it is still too small-scale to meet demand.

Battle for Ambedkar

Dr B.R. Ambedkar has always been a celebrated figure, the country's first law minister and architect of the Constitution. But appreciation of his legacy has become a curiously political enterprise of late. Dalits are increasingly an important aspect of the BJP's political calculations, and part of the party's outreach has been for the prime minister to talk up his personal veneration for Ambedkar. Opening a memorial for Ambedkar in April, Narendra Modi claimed that other governments (read Congress-led ones) had paid lip service to Ambedkar while doing nothing to shore up his legacy. BJP leaders, including the likes of party president Amit Shah, have made it a point to be photographed showing obeisance to Ambedkar, but is it helping the party retain the votes it won so comprehensively in 2014? Signs, particularly in the recent assembly polls in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, are not encouraging, with SC votes in the rural heartlands swinging comprehensively towards the Congress.

Fragile Threads

WARP 'N WEFT: Two women embroider a phulkari 'bagh' in Urdan village in the Patiala district of Punjab. (Photo: Bandeep Singh)

India's traditional textiles have been treasured by people across the globe for centuries. They brought traders and invaders to our shores and may have spun the competitive engines of the industrial revolution which would later all but vanquish them. Today, powerlooms provide some 70 per cent of all Indian fabrics. Yet an astonishing diversity of handloom and handicraft fabrics survives in the Indian countryside, most of it produced by women weavers and embroiderers. While the state has played an important role in preserving these livelihoods-for example, by winning GI or Geographical Indication certification for the phulkari embroidery of Punjab-government policies can also endanger this fragile sector. The roughshod implementation of new GST rules proved a particular threat to the delicate economy of handloom weavers in small towns and villages.

Transports of Delight

The bail gaadi or bullock cart was perhaps the most persistent emblem of rural India-for a couple of thousand years. In the 20th century, the infernal combustion and horsepower of motorised transport made steady inroads into that romantic image. It's a transformation that has moved so fast that younger generations will probably view this image of a 'Tempo' taxi (right) in rural UP with nostalgia. The bhat-suwar, as it is fondly remembered in North India, along with its fellow travellers like the hand-made 'Marutas' of UP or 'vans' of Bengal, is now giving way to new models such as the chhota haathi (the Tata Ace), the Mahindra Jeeto or the Ashok Leyland Dost, as major corporations rediscover rural markets. Tata, for example, saw its rural sales expand by 38 per cent this year-almost twice its growth in urban markets.

Cock-fighting, popular around the country, is just as cruel, and arguably even more vicious than the bull-taming exercise, jallikattu. Both 'pastimes' are banned by the courts. But advocates have successfully argued that on some occasions, particularly on temple premises, cockfights ""held in the traditional manner"" should be permitted. The Hyderabad High Court, however, banned cockfights even during the Sankranti harvest festival in January, an order the SC upheld and led to the arrest of roosters. Yes, roosters.

Cries Over Spilled Milk

LAND OF MILK AND...Dairy farmers at a street protest in Aurangabad, Maharashtra. (Photo: Raju Sanadi)

Farmer anger has been a major story of recent years. And it's still building. Protests have been numerous and vociferous, with thousands marching through New Delhi just last month. Many analysts argue that agrarian distress contributed substantially to the BJP's damaging defeats in the five recent assembly elections. In the past two summers, farmers across the country threw their milk onto the streets in protest at falling prices. Farmers have been demanding greater subsidies to prop up their increasingly meagre earnings. Before milk was being thrown in the streets, it was vegetables and sugarcane. Data from the National Crime Records Bureau show an eight-fold increase in farmer protests between 2014 and 2016. Solutions beyond loan waivers and fiddling with minimum support prices are thin on the ground. Climate change and dwindling groundwater supplies mean the future holds little promise of a 'technological fix'. With a looming general election, politicians are likely to continue to offer financial quick fixes. But a serious conversation about an agrarian crisis that is claiming the lives of thousands of farmers each year is long overdue.

Striking Oil

BUBBLING AWAY: Vedanta's Mangala oil processing terminal in Barmer district, Rajasthan. (Photo: Purushottam Diwakar)

Little used to happen in Barmer, a dusty, yawning stretch of Rajasthan desert- one of the country's biggest parliamentary constituencies in terms of area- barring the odd cattle fair. In 2004, though, over three billion barrels worth of oil was discovered to be lying under the sands, causing a sudden surge in excitement, and demand for such things as upmarket hotels and luxury cars. In October this year, a subsidiary of Vedanta Resources, the mining company, agreed to a 10-year extension of its contract to produce oil from the Mangala area. Since 2013, Pachpadra, another village in Barmer, has been waiting for a refinery and the promise of wealth and jobs. In July, eight people were arrested for conspiring to steal 50 million barrels of crude oil from the Barmer fields and sell it on for Rs 25 per barrel. Nice work if you can get it?

In the Name of the Cow

RED MEAT: A lull in the fatal lynching of Alimuddin Ansari in Ramgarh, Jharkhand, June 2017. (Photo: Somnath Sen)

Conservative estimates suggest that some 30 people have now been killed by 'gau rakshaks' since 2014, the attackers apparently emboldened by government moves to penalise cow slaughter. Among those lynched was Alimuddin Ansari in Jharkhand last year. Eleven men were sentenced to life imprisonment for the crime by a fast-track court in March. Out on bail, the men were warmly received by their local MP, a Union minister, at his official residence. Earlier this month, in Bulandshahr, an alleged case of cow slaughter led to riots in which a police inspector was shot in the head. As a result of the new wave of 'cow protection', many farmers, unable to feed cows that no longer give milk, have turned their animals loose. Government shelters, such as the one in the picture in Madhya Pradesh, are filled to capacity.

Healthcare on the Hoof

TAKE YOUR PILLS: State-sponsored medical check-ups in Sawai Madhopur, Rajasthan. (Photo: Purushottam Diwakar)

One of the more irritating cliches about India is that it is the land of jugaad, a land where everyone can fashion a bandage out of rags to staunch the bleeding, if only temporarily. And then along comes a picture like this and you have to acknowledge the cliches exist for a reason. For some years now, the government has made certain basic diagnostic tests free of charge. Drugs and diagnostic tests make up as much as 70 per cent of the costs that push millions of people below the poverty line in India each year. To get tests done, people have to go to their nearest clinics, though 'nearest' is a relative term in rural India. Vans were perhaps what they had in mind. But, for these patients in a village in the Sawai Madhopur district of Rajasthan, a camel will do just as well.

The Maggi Index

NOODLED: A sales drive for Nestle in a village in Muzaffarnagar district, UP. (Photo: Shekhar Ghosh)

India has had over two decades of solid economic growth. Disposable incomes have been rising, if faster in some places and for some people than others. And people all over the country, not just in the metropolitan centres, have access to and want a part of the consumer lifestyle. The scene in this photograph is an example of the spread of 'cityfied' lifestyles. The phenomenal popularity of Maggi in India has always been something of an oddity. The nutrition may be questionable, but Maggi became an urban staple. And perhaps, as a sign of the inexorable march of urbanisation and urban habits, a rural one too.

Business of Beauty

TRADE SECRETS: Beautician Puneeta on a home visit to a client in Malikpur village near Sonepat, Haryana. (Photo: Chandradeep Kumar)

Economic growth may be robust, but jobs remain hard to come by. The government has suggested that self-employment might be the way of the future. This is, of course, a familiar experience for many Indians, particularly those who live in rural India. The great majority of Indians, urban and rural, work in the casual economy. The young beautician pictured here goes door to door, providing a valued service. The salon may be makeshift but the customer isn't complaining. And even the buffaloes seem to approve.

Road to Normalcy?

ROLL IT OUT: A CRPF patrol securing a stretch for roadwork in Dantewada, Chhattisgarh. (Photo: Chandradeep Kumar)

In April, the now ex-chief minister of Chhattisgarh boasted that the building of roads in the state had progressed to the extent that in ""districts like Bastar and Dantewada you can now go anywhere"". Later that same month, Maoist guerrillas killed 25 CRPF men guarding the highway linking Dantewada to the Sukma district. An extensive government plan is in place to connect some of India's most remote rural areas by road, to enable these villages to participate in countrywide development. Many of these villages are in Chhattisgarh, in the 'Red Corridor' plagued by running battles between the Maoists and security forces.

Reading, Writing and Terrible arithmetic

WRITTEN IN STONE: Young students from the Madia Gond community at a school run by Prakash Amte in Gadchiroli, Maharashtra (Photo: Vikram Sharma)

India's record in education is a deceptive image. Despite the gains made in achieving benchmarks of universal enrolment and better gender parity in primary education in the early 2000s, recent studies have revealed that the country is failing in secondary education. The ASER study in 2017 found that 57 per cent of 14- to 18-year-olds can't solve basic division problems and a government survey in 2014 concluded that only 16 per cent of Class X students could correctly answer more than half the mathematics questions put to them. Rural students from disadvantaged communities risk higher dropout rates and poorer learning. It doesn't help that government expenditure on education as a proportion of GDP fell from 3.1 per cent in 2012-13 to 2.6 per cent in 2016-17.

The Ghost Villages

DESERTED COUNTRY: The roofless ruins of Milam village in Pithoragarh district of Uttarakhand's Kumaon region. (Photo: E. Theophilus)

While migration from the countryside to the cities is an ancient and universal story, it has reached stark proportions in some parts of the country. In the foothills of Uttarakhand, in particular, the phenomenon has begun to spook even the state government, which in 2017 appointed a 'Migration Commission' to look into the proliferation of bhootiya or 'ghost' villages. The commission found that some 119,000 people had abandoned their homes and agriculture, leaving some 700 villages deserted. The village pictured here, once one of the wealthiest settlements in Kumaon, has been reduced to ruins by the loss of border trade and migration to towns better integrated into the economic mainstream."

The 29-year-old, who has shown his work twice at the Lakme Fashion Week and was named one of the finest GenNext fashion designers, is content to work from Saharanpur and not move to a bustling big city. Mazhar justifies his choice by saying he finds his narratives and context here, he resists accepted notions of a high-profile career, and, above all, has the courage to put this small town on the fashion map of the country.

It all started when as a class nine student, Mazhar set up a boutique with his senior in school. The senior's father had a boutique.

In 2017, Mazhar's first collection, called Dhobi Ghat, evoked nostalgia about his hometown. The washerwoman Sakina Begum, a regular visitor at his home, used to make a small mark on the clothes. The whites of his collection had these marks that Sakina, along with 30 other women, pressed on to the clothes to make a design. The next collection used darn or the craft of the rafugars.

""My inspiration is the Indian artisan, especially those indirectly contributing to the fashion industry like the dhobi or the rafugar,"" he says.

Saharanpur is known for wooden handicraft and Mazhar's family is one of the many engaged in this business. ""Coming from a conservative Muslim family, it wasn't easy to say that I wanted to be a designer,"" he adds.

Today, he runs his label under the national rural employment guarantee programme and more than 70 people work for him. In his design, the visual language is distinctly made up of small-town life and the ways of the artisans there.

Rahul Mishra invokes his village, Malhausi, in his collections on display at the Paris Fashion Week. Just like Mazhar, nostalgia is the primary moving force in his designs too. The broken door, where his mother used to hang a white curtain with its daraz work filtering the afternoon sunlight symbolising a diffused state of being with those white curtains shielding him against the world. His intimate relationship with the things of his childhood-pillow cases, curtains, table cloth, the white of his grandmother's dhoti, the little pond, dew drops and the white and blue checks of the lungis of the weavers and the butchers in his sleepy village in UP-are all part of his storytelling as a designer.

While India's fashion story is shaped by designers who come from little towns and villages and set up shops in Delhi and Mumbai like Samant Chauhan, who is from a small place near Jamalpur in Bihar, or Sanjay Garg of Raw Mango, who hails from Mubarikpur, there is also another set of designers who are choosing to live and work in their small towns and reaching out to the world with their crafts via social media and e-commerce. Like in Kochi, Kerala, 32-year-old Sreejith Jeevan says he is moving towards ""unfashioning"" and it is the joy of slow-paced life that inspires his designs and collections. ""We're moving so fast that sometimes we have absolutely no time for little things such as raindrops and birds.

Though being far from the fashion capital of the country comes with its own drawbacks, there is nothing like the feeling of being home, doing the work you love in a place you know. ""Today, fashion is everywhere and is no longer limited to the metros,"" says Jeevan, who studied at the National Institute of Design (NID), Ahmedabad, and then at the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs (ENSAD), Paris. He launched his label Rouka in 2013. ""My stories have a local flavour for a global audience,"" he says.

After the devastating floods in Kerala this year, Jeevan, along with some other designers, helped the weavers of Chendamangalam, near Kochi in Kerala, who had lost their livelihood, get on their feet with the launch of Origins.

""How can my people make fashion for the world-that's what I ask myself,"" he says.

With sustainable fashion and craft becoming the buzzwords of the industry, it is no surprise that designers are looking back at their experiences and creating a new design vocabulary, along with social consciousness and an urgency to be innovative with local crafts and contexts. Take, for instance, Bihar-based social entrepreneur and designer Praveen Chauhan, who set up MATR-Motherly. Luxury. Artistry, a social enterprise in Bodh Gaya, his native place. The National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) alumnus collects discarded flowers from the Mahabodhi Temple and transforms them into natural dyes with Kathy Williams, who is from Australia and the founder of 'Because of Nature', a sustainable clothing label. Together, they have founded the Happy Hands Project. ""I always tell artisans that it is your right to expect from us. You are the people who kept our art, craft and culture alive. The artisans have taken me to a different level of creativity. So many people from other countries approach me to study traditional Indian textile and handicrafts,"" he says.

""Thousands of people visit the Mahabodhi Temple every day and offer hundreds of kilograms of flowers. Though this project is at its early stage, we have been able to employ 30 women from the surrounding villages,"" he says.

The Happy Hands Project is an initiative started as a collaboration between the Bodhgaya temple management committee, MATR and Because of Nature to bring sustainable employment to the people through natural dyes on khadi made in Bihar. The project aims to promote the skills of artisans to produce high quality khadi and garments for national and international designers and retail brands that utilise traditional skills.

People used to make fun of him, saying that he was studying tailoring at a high cost after joining NIFT. His father, a contractor, supported him against all odds. Today, Chauhan is credited with reviving khadi, along with other ventures.

Forty-eight-year-old Vijayalakshmi Nachiar grew up in a 'Kutchi' family and was introduced to the world of embroidery and textiles at a young age: Her family had been cotton traders for generations. She graduated in textiles and clothing from the SNDT Women's University, Mumbai.

After marriage, she moved to Pollachi on the outskirts of Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, an agrarian town with a rich tradition of woven cotton sarees.

Her husband started growing ecological cotton through his contract farming initiatives in 2005. And, in 2008, Nachiar set up a handloom studio and co-founded Ethicus in 2009.

""I think I can do what I am doing today with Ethicus only because I come from a small town. This would have been impossible in a big city. I have an in-house production facility and local craftsmen work here. Living in a rural area has enabled us to work from farm to fashion,"" says Nachiar.

When they launched Ethicus, there were very few handloom brands and the challenges were many. ""Customers were willing to pay high price for silk but not for good cotton,"" she says.

Today, her venture is listed by the textile exchange as one of the few brands worldwide using 100 per cent sustainable raw material and adopting a sustainable method of production. It has been awarded the 'Future Shaper' prize by textiles exchange in 2012 and the 'Pride of Tamil Nadu' award in 2017, instituted by the Round Table of India, as an emerging retail brand.

Naushad Ali's story is similar. ""My dad was a textile merchant and I grew up with all kinds of fabric around me. We used to have bundles of fabric from all over India stocked up in our living room, and I used to help my father tag them all. That was my introduction to textiles and fashion,"" says Ali, 33. Unsure of being accepted as a designer, Ali gave himself five years when he launched his label at Puducherry. ""The lifestyle, landscape, culture and people I meet every day have all been great inspirations for the label and shaped me as a designer. 'Made in Pondicherry' has given me an identity in the industry,"" he adds.

""We are committed to being a sustainable label, with a difference. Being part of fashion, the second most polluting industry in the world, I want to take my decisions carefully and consciously-from the choice of materials to what we make out of them. I believe in slow fashion, creating something that lasts and is also something meaningful,"" he says.

Slow and Steady: Naushad Ali at the beach in Puducherry (Photo: Bandeep Singh)

Born in Vellore, Ali spent his growing up years in Chennai and Bengaluru, before his parents moved to Puducherry. He wanted to be an astrophysicist and was also good at botanical drawings. But once he got through NIFT, Chennai, he knew he would do something entirely different.

In 2014, he set up Studio Liam in Auroville to revisit and transfer the expertise of Indian craftsmen to contemporary fashion. His definition of fashion: there is no hurry, there are no seasons, there's only time and commitment. In 2017, three years after he launched his label, he received the prestigious Grazia Young Fashion Award (Sustainable Wear category). And in 2018, he was chosen to represent India for the first IFS biennale at London Fashion Week, 2019, supported by the London College of Fashion and Somerset House.

Pankaja Sethi, 39, spent her childhood at different places-from Itanagar to Chennai-as her father was the chief medical officer with the CRPF. A graduate in botanical science and a NIFT alumnus, after working for export houses, she was asked by a former teacher to help document the folk arts and narratives of Jharkhand. That was the beginning of her foray into indigenous textiles. She relocated to Odisha to help with design intervention and work with tribal weavers.

Rare Tribe: Pankaja Sethi with adivasi women at the Lakme Fashion Week, Mumbai.

It was not an easy task to enrol artisans to create textiles because some of them had fallen in the trap of mass production and many of them did not want to create contemporary concepts, fearing it wouldn't last, she adds.

""Being located in Bhubaneswar, I now see the merits of living in a place that is pollution-free and with much less traffic on the roads compared to metro cities. Moreover, I am close to the weavers and the tribals, who create indigenous textiles and crafts. And, above all, I see the importance of local traditions at the global level,"" she says."

Discarded tyres, waste wood, and water bottles are now providing some much-needed physical exercise as well as entertainment to children of this government school, with a play area being created out of them.

In this play area, class 4 student Sangamesh says he loves to balance and walk on the row of tyres placed on the balancing pole even as class 7 student Manjunath Madiwala Agasar says he likes to climb up the ladder and swing from two poles.

Sangamesh and Agasar are among the 250 students of Government Higher Primary School, Baikampady (Muslim), Angaragundi, in Baikampady Industrial Area, who now spend their breaks at the play area.

Apart from the balancing bar and ladder, tyres have been used to make a swing, a climber, and to create a chess playing area. Some lorry tyres have been used for children to jump. A vertical garden has also been created using discarded water bottles while cycle tyres are being used as hula hoop. Along with the new play area, the boys toilet was renovated using discarded distilled water cans as flush tanks.

Opened on November 5, the play area was conceptualised by Inchara Foundation, an NGO, with the help of Trigon, a wing of students of Sahyadri Engineering College and St. Aloysius College. UB Group chipped in with ₹1.5 lakh as part of its corporate social responsibility.

Preetam Rodrigues, executive director of the foundation, which has been working with the school for over three years, said the students were in dire need of a play area and a hygienic toilet for boys. ""Having seen play areas being created out of discarded items, I presented the idea to Sahyadri college students, who came up with the design.""

Though happy with the new play area, headmistress Ravikala Shetty said the staff was struggling to protect it. ""After school hours, people come into the play area and spoil it,"" she said."

Autopsy by the forensic experts of the Kakatiya Medical College (KMC), Warangal, was carried out at the grave itself in the presence of the local thasildar.

According to sources, Lunavath Anusha (16), a class IX student of the Zilla Parishad Secondary School (ZPSS), Parvathagiri, suddenly collapsed while morning prayer was going on on December 13.

Following this, the school staff, who thought that she developed seizures, immediately rushed her to the local primary health centre (PHC) and later to the MGM Hospital, Warangal, for treatment.

Doctors at the MGM Hospiral suggested that she should be shifted to Hyderabad and she was being taken to the Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad. But, the girl died in the early hours of the following day (i.e, on December 14) before even she was admitted to the Gandhi Hospital.

The parents brought the body to their thanda and buried it as they thought she died of seizures.

But on December 22, father of Anusha, Lunavath Sikinder approached the Parvathagiri police and lodged a complaint with them stating that he had doubts over of the death of his daughter and accused Bhukya Ganesh of the same thanda, who reportedly had beaten her on December 12.

It is said that Sikinder had raised doubts over the death as his younger daughter saying that Bhukya Ganesh had gone the school and thrashed Anusha on December 12.

Based on the complaint of Sikinder, the police have registered a case and exhumed the body to conduct the postmortem.

Sub-Inspector Karunakar said that they would take further action in the case after getting the postmortem report."

According to a recent research conducted by the University of California, Davis, blindness and other vision disorders can be linked to genes.

Experiment:

Hundreds of new genes have studied a screen of mouse strains.

According to researchers, many of these genes are likely important in human vision and the results could help identify new causes of hereditary blindness in patients.

""This is extremely valuable for people with hereditary eye disease,"" said co-author Ala Moshiri, Associate Professor at the UC, Davis, School of Medicine and Eye Center.

""The whole ophthalmic community is going to start using these data,"" Moshiri added.

For the study, published in the journal, 'Nature Communications Biology', the research team combed the consortium database for genes linked to eye and vision defects.

They identified 347 genes, of which 86 were either well-established as involved in eye disease or were associated with vision in some way.

Three-quarters of the genes -- 261 -- were not previously known to cause eye disease in any species, according to the research team.

Eyes and genes

""In 2018, if someone has a form of hereditary blindness, we can identify the cause 50 to 75 per cent of the time,"" Moshiri said.

""In the remaining cases, we know the mutation is there but we don't know where to look. Now, eye centres that do DNA sequencing can call back patients and screen them for these new genes,"" Moshiri added.

The team also said that the new genetic information could also enable new therapies for hereditary eye disease.

""We expect that more and more of these genetic diseases will be treatable,"" Moshiri noted.

Diseases which can be identified by eyes:

""Brain problems like tumours and infarction can be diagnosed with the simple eye test of perimetry which is done using Humphrey Field Analyser. In many patients, this test gives the primary clue to the brain disease,"" says Dr. Minija C K, Senior consultant Medical Retina Cataract & Uvea, Sankara Eye Hospital.

How are the eyes and health related?

He further added, if eyes get affected, it can affect the psychology of the man. Eye problems and poor vision reduces the self-confidence levels and leads to depression, Dr Minija C K informs.

A urine drug test, also known as a urine drug screen or a UDS, is the analysis of an individual's urine for the presence of certain illegal drugs and prescription medications.

The study, which was conducted by researchers at the Boston University School of Medicine, revealed that patients are less likely to disclose drug use earlier in treatment, and although the study was not able to identify reasons for this, the authors believe that it may be related to fear of discharge from a treatment program and stigma related to relapse.

The findings of the study are published in the Journal of Drug and Alcohol Dependence.

Office-based addiction treatment has become a key strategy in combating the opioid epidemic, where patients get treatment for their disease in a primary care setting with close monitoring during their recovery.

However, one of the questions in the current practice of is how best to monitor for illicit substance use, especially when patients do not report it. There has also been a lack of data regarding how frequently patients in these programs report substance use compared to finding a positive result by urine drug testing (UDT).

""It is important for providers to understand more about how the lab results compare to what patients tell us in a visit. Patients may not be self-reporting substance use early on in their treatment due to concerns about being discharged from programs if they disclose use, or they may feel shame about relapse and do not want to disappoint their care team,"" said Sarah M. Bagley, study's co-author.

The researchers correlated the frequency of patients' self-reported substance use and the results of their UDTs. It showed that 76 per cent of UDTs positive for cocaine and 57 per cent of those positive for opioids occurred when patients did not disclose substance use in their treatment visit.

Additionally, rates of positive UDTs without self-reported substance use were higher earlier in treatment, possibly reflecting growing trust between the patient and the treatment team over time.

I wish I had more reliable sources and books within my access instead of having to search for things with no direction on the Internet.

I never went to primary school. My parents were my first teachers, helping me explore the world via ships and planes, through numerous hardbound books and countless films on VCR tapes. They also inadvertently made me comfortable with sports shoes, pants, t-shirts and jackets - clothes that maximized on utility and comfort, in those years when I grew up quickly every day. I was handed remote controlled cars and teddy bears to play with instead of petite Barbie dolls and miniature tea sets. My father taught me how to swim, my mother taught me how to read, and at that age, it was all that you would ever need. Looking back, I feel like my parents had a huge hand in making me realize my sexuality at a very early age, and not just because of these somewhat trivial clothing and lifestyle choices, but because they did not treat me as a highly gendered individual, and neither did they prod me towards a particular gender and/or direction of people.

I did eventually start going to school in a small town in Uttar Pradesh. It was quite a letdown compared to my previous classroom that spread over oceans and was not limited by four drab walls. I grew up alone, my only friends being the books that I studied and found in the library. There wasn't really much in terms of common experiences or mutual hobbies that I could talk about with anyone else. I was pretty much the prize student, getting top grades in all subjects, winning in all extra co-curricular activites and sports events I participated in.

I grew up reading comics and books whenever I could, being particularly inspired by superhero figures and characters like Wonder Woman, Doctor Who (I read the books first), Harry Potter, Eragon, Artemis Fowl, Batman, Batwoman, etc. I remember being particularly drawn to the sporty yet feminine women in the various Enid Blyton boarding school novels and other such characters in various other classics, such as Jo from Little Women. I was particularly fascinated in reading about courageous and non-conventional women in history encyclopedias, with role models like Joan of Arc, Cleopatra, Amelia Earhart, Marie Curie, Amrita Shergill, Fearless Nadia, Kalpana Chawla, to name a few. My parents had a penchant for listening to a wide range of English music, and I grew up listening to LGBTQ pop culture icons such as Cher, Barbara Streisand, Madonna, Britney Spears, Elton John, Queen, Prince, George Michael, to name a few. While I didn't realize it, and I am sure, neither have my parents even to this day, this was an essential education in LGBTQ culture that they imparted to me pretty early on in my formative years.

Towards the final few years of senior secondary school, I fell in love with a female friend of mine, and I was hated for it. Overnight, the star student who could do no wrong, became the universally joked about social outcast of the place. Life taught me for the first time, that it isn't always a good, benevolent teacher. At sixteen years of age, my soul already felt weary and old, questioning everything that was happening to her, and getting no answers in return. Murphy's Law took over my life, and my home, my health, my life, everything went sideways. I spent four miserable years, trying to kill my feelings for the straight girl crush I had, and in the process, constantly feeling horrible and hopeless about my future romantic prospects. With my family's dysfunctionality at an all time high, I lost all faith in love and marriage and finding a meaningful romantic relationship with anyone.

I dropped a year right after school. My classmates were beginning a new chapter in their lives, college, and I was just a sitting duck at my house. I was depressed, severely ill, and unable to really concentrate on anything. Towards the end of that one year, my uncle decided to whisk me away to Singapore, where he lived, to cheer me up. My parents did help me with my medical expenses and trips to the doctor, but they didn't facilitate the safe, sensitized environment I needed for recovering. For the most part, I was happy that I was getting out somewhere, even if it was only temporary.

Those two months taught me to hope, to dare to dream. On my uncle's insistence, and my own anxiety about my future, I paid a visit to the university there, and I was so surprised by what I saw there, people of my age, comfortable in their skin, going about their lives, learning and living and enjoying on their own terms. I got a glimpse of what my life could be if took charge of it, so I did exactly that. I didn't want to lose out on anything else any more than I already had. I argued with my parents, and gave all those damned pre-medical entrance tests again on one condition, that I be allowed to give an entrance examination of my choice.

I qualified that examination, and entered one of the most prestigious colleges in my field in the country, as an English honours student. It was an all womens' college, and the place was literally like my own version of Themyscira. I came out to my friends, batchmates, anyone and everyone, started a queer collective, did various workshops and seminars across the university to sensitize others, met my girlfriend and the love of my life there. My life, in the words of John Green, was one exhilarating roller coaster that only went up, at that point of time. I was acquainted with the world of LGBTQ literature and authors in that space, had the opportunity to research queer themes in different works of literature and media, and interacted with numerous like-minded queer people, whether it be professors or fellow students. It was here that I discovered the works of Virginia Woolf, Patricia Highsmith, Sarah Waters, Adrienne Rich, and so many other queer female authors. It was exhilarating to find so many friends with whom I could discuss these finer details of everyday life, such as being queer, who knew of my girlfriend, even though my own parents had a hugely negative response when I came out to them in the same time. That was the first time in my life that people reacted to me coming out as gay with the same intensity they would to a mild weather change, and that was the turning point for me. I decided that I would not hide my sexuality any longer, unless it was a potential and grave violation of personal security. I should have known, there would be trying times later on.

I started my postgraduate studies in mass communication and filmmaking at one of the most reputed institutions in the country. It was a religious minority institution, and an orthodox one, and I was scared that I might have to go back into the closet again after three glorious years I spent outside of it. I was reluctantly getting ready to put on a façade, thinking of a cover story for my personal life, when one of the professors for our course walked in. My gaydar went wild, and it was such a welcome relief to see another queer individual in that building, that too, an unapologetic butch woman, that all of those previous thoughts of hiding my true identity flew right out of the window. That same professor made us watch and study a ton of queer films and documentaries, and I lived for those classes, because it helped me gain a different perspective on showcasing queerness as a potential filmmaker. A couple of weeks later, when I had settled comfortably into my new friend circle, I came out to my friends, and it felt so reassuring to do that. I found some of my closest friends in the walls of that college, and it became another home for me.

I wish I had more teachers in my life who could have helped me in coming to terms with my identity. I wish I had more reliable sources and books within my access instead of having to search for things with no direction on the Internet. I am glad the young kids today and to come will have more access to queer role models and vital information growing up, unlike me. I am happy, that I am doing my bit to make the world a better place for the children to come, and not blindly expecting them to grow up good in a horrible world. I am so happy that my current workspaces don't mind who I am or where I come from, and that is such a rejuvenating and affirmative fact to remind myself when I go to work everyday. But I still wish there were still more safe spaces for me as a queer individual, where I didn't have to fear for a homophobic backlash from people if I did come out. I wish my parents, who I still regard as the biggest teacher figures in my life, had been more supportive of my identity, among a lot of other things. I wish I had that in my first job where I undoubtedly spent some of the worst months of my life. I wish there wasn't a recurring process of coming out again and again, and that people would stop assuming I have a boyfriend just because I am a girl. I wish that our parents, our teachers, who we spend such an important and huge time with while growing up, are more sensitized to concepts of gender and sexuality, so that boys wouldn't be scolded for crying, or girls for not being a certain dolled-up kind of feminine, and I really wish our generation does better as parents. But most of all, I wish that some of the people who I really valued in my life as teachers, hadn't viewed me through a different lens once they saw that I wasn't conforming to the rules of the heteronormative society we live in. I was still that person, maybe a little flawed, and maybe a little wiser each passing year, but still the same good student at heart. And I will never stop learning."

While earlier such programmes were meant for those working with defence or police, in recent years there is a surge in demand and universities are coming with unique programmes to detect cyber frauds.

These courses are open for everyone showcasing how important is for students to learn to safeguard and defend themselves and others.

The Council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) launched a certificate course in forensic accounting and fraud detection. Within few months of its launch, the course has already registered over 6,000 people. This course was aimed for only ICAI registered CAS but due to high demand, employees of IOCL and HPCL got registration. The ICAI has launched Data Analytics/ Forensic Analytics Labs at Noida, Hyderabad, Kanpur, Chennai, Kolkata and Chandigarh already.

ICAI president, Naveen ND Gupta, said, ""The course is created by experts from the field of accountancy and law keeping in mind the emerging economic scenarios. Specialisation in this area is much sought-after considering increasing incidents of cybercrime and fraud detection. It is the practice of utilising accounting, auditing, CAATs/ Data Mining Tools and investigative skills to detect frauds.""

There was a rise in cyber crimes this year. A total of 30 people were arrested in cyber crimes out of which 12 were juvenile, according to the National Crime Bureau report. The data collected is till August 2018. According to NCR crime in India 2016 report, there has been a rise of 3 per cent in crimes committed 2014-15 3 per cent and a 2.6 per cent rise in crimes committed in 2015-16, showing a continuous uprise.

A total of 31,396 cases were registered against juveniles in 2015, almost double the number in 2001.

Keeping this scenario in mind, Punjabi University at Patiala started a course on substance abuse in October this year. So far, 35 candidates have registered. The university also conducts a course in HIV awareness which had witnessed the maximum strength up to 26 students. Those who enrol in substance abuse courses will be sent to do field work in which they will be asked to spread the message of prevention against drug abuse.

On completion of the course, one can work at a rehab centre or as a psychotherapist in government, private and not for profit organisations.

Naina Sharma, assistant professor, Punjabi University said, ""The course was introduced keeping in mind the spreading epidemic of substance abuse. To our surprise, a large number of school teachers enrolled for the course showing how deeply rooted the issue is and the need for early intervention.""

Managing director of a corporate security and risk consulting firm - Netrika, Sanjay Kaushik, highlighted while there is an increase in number of courses related to physical, digital and social security in India, most of them are introduced as short-term and additional level, however, a formal and in-depth training is required in the fields. ""India still lacks formal training in security-related courses. Even today, people do not consider it to be a full-term primary career choice.""

Netrika launched several programmes including certified anti-terrorism specialists, crime prevention specialist. PEACE interview and investigation technique, corporate security management specialist among others. There has been a rise in enrolment up to 17 per cent for these courses. While Netrika has global association including the forensic investigation services, Unites States of America, Gujarat Forensic Sciences University is the only Indian university to tie-up with the India-based firm.

""While the crime keeps increasing at a high rate, the pace of defence is not as high. Every organisation including corporate houses host such mandatory coaching, the approach remains theoretical. It is important to teach students in an artificial atmosphere how to handle an adverse situation,"" he adds.

Among most unique crime courses was 'Insolvency Associates' launched and designed by Ministry of Skill Development, the course is not yet open to learners. The ministry is in talks with the University of Delhi (DU) to initiate the course. The aim of the course is to impart knowledge about insolvency law and catch financial frauds. DU this year had also launched a centre for cyber crimes. The centre provides a postgraduate diploma in cybersecurity and law.

Cybersecurity remained particularly favourite this year. The University of Hyderabad had announced to launch courses in the field including cyber law, human rights, forensic science, criminal justice and technology. Ethical hacking also emerged as one of the emerging courses this year."

The benefit of using this software is that no one can hack into it by faking results and the final result will be published on the website by the co-ordinators. The software is accessible both mobile and laptop. Events are created by the developer himself and a unique ID and password would be given to the event coordinator to control the whole event who would be able to edit it accordingly.

Time management and the token system are two primary features of the software. A token announcement calls out the participants ID or name with the help of a recorded voice before the competition begins and also alerts the judges or the coordinators along with a warning bell and stop bell. Judges can score marks through the online scorecard thereby easily marking them under each category and publishing the results instantly. ""eTalenter shines with its simple interface and makes talent management easy for all users,"" says an event coordinator.

The software is steadily gaining popularity and has been booked in advance, by schools, organisations and communities. eTalenter can easily make its mark in events like the school kalolsavam and university events, as they are the largest competitions in Kerala with numerous participants. Justin is looking forward to expanding the software across the whole country and does not want it to have a limited outreach."

Ghajini, a Hindi remake of a 2006 Tamil film of the same name, made history when it became the first Indian film to cross Rs 100 crore at the domestic box office, beating the collection of the then-highest grosser, Farah Khan's Om Shanti Om. Aamir has been relentless in his box office conquests since then, with almost all the films with him in the lead role, barring Reema Kagti's 2012 suspense thriller Talaash: The Answer Lies Within, hitting the Rs 100 crore mark.

In fact, he beat his score at the box office with blockbusters like Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots in 2009 (which inaugurated the Rs 200 crore club with a Rs 202 crore domestic collection), Acharya's Dhoom 3 (Rs 280 crore), Hirani's PK (which opened the Rs 300 crore club with a Rs 340 crore domestic collection) and Nitesh Tiwari's sports biopic Dangal (Rs 375 crore). Right when he hoped he could break through the glass ceiling with Thugs of Hindostan, the film fizzled out at the box office after the quickest Rs 100 crore ever in Hindi cinema. It could barely cross the Rs 150 crore mark subsequently.

Where Aamir went wrong with Thugs of Hindostan was exactly the opposite of where he went right with Ghajini. The 2008 blockbuster set up what would go on to be the ingredients of every big-budget, star-driven film that would aim to breach the Rs 100 crore mark.

Firstly, it was a remake of a South Indian film. South remakes have gone on to cross Rs 100 crore, including Sohail Khan's 2014 action drama Jai Ho, Murugadoss' 2014 spy entertainer Holiday: A Soldier Is Never Off Duty, Aneez Basmee's 2011 action comedy Ready, Prabhu Deva's 2012 action entertainer Rowdy Rathore, Siddique's 2011 action romance Bodyguard, Ahmed Khan's 2018 action drama Baaghi 2 and Sajid Nadiadwala's 2014 action comedy Kick.

Secondly, Ghajini went back to '80s Bollywood and borrowed heavily from the potpourri films that had a range of elements, from action to romance, comedy to music, and promoted each aspect through promos and behind-the-scenes videos.

But most importantly, where Ghajini emerged as path-breaking was its lead star Aamir's involvement at every stage, particularly in marketing the film. He took what Shah Rukh Khan did -- with his home production Om Shanti Om a year before -- several notches higher by ensuring there is constant engagement with the prospective audience in the days leading up to the release.

He also started the trend of being in the character's look while promoting the film. He not only sported a shaven head like his Ghajini character but also served as a barber and shaved the hair of selected fans at public locations to give them the Ghajini half-shaven hairstyle.

All these measures helped the film open to huge numbers. The fact that it released on Christmas eve allowed it to snowball with momentum, banking on the week-long school holidays. But what really helped it sustain its momentum was that all the marketing, all the hype around the film was not merely bait. The film had the chops to deliver wholesome entertainment and engage the audience for the length of its runtime.

With subsequent films like 3 Idiots, Dhooom 3, PK and Dangal, Aamir proved that he is the rare specimen who can blend event films with high concept value. For Ghajini, besides all the formulaic inputs, he did experiment with the concept of amnesia as the term ""short-term memory loss"" became a household phrase in India after the film. He also transformed his physicality into that of the character, bulking up and stamping tattoos all over his body, to get hold of the audience's attention with the first look, and transport them into the world of Ghajini.

He followed the same mix of commerce and art, scale and substance with 3 Idiots, Dhoom 3, PK and Dangal, all of which released around Christmas. Clearly, the timing of the release was also an influential factor, but it did not come at the cost of the content. He took a couple of years or even more to come up with every release. It was not a ritual to release an Aamir Khan film every Christmas as it was for a Salman Khan film on Eid.

He transformed his body for all his later films as well and also marketed them aggressively. However, there was no pattern to these coincidences as his primary intent remained to get into the head of the character and in turn into the head of the potential viewers. For Dhoom 3, his strategy was to not go all out during promotions. Since it was the third instalment of an already-popular franchise, it went on to do great numbers nonetheless. Aamir married the Dhoom legacy with his signature emotional quotient to present a film that could appeal to a wider audience.

This year, Yash Raj Films (which backed Dhoom 3) chose Acharya, Aamir and Katrina Kaif to replicate the same strategy for Thugs of Hindostan. They barely promoted the film by doing media interactions, reality show visits or brand collaborations, let alone Aamir's trademark innovative promotional tools, hoping that the film benefits from the success, of both Dhoom 3 and Aamir's previous massive hit Dangal, and goes on to break records.

But while there was scale, hype, positioning, music and pop patriotism, what the film lacked was the high concept value that Aamir brought with his addition to an event movie. While he owned up for the failure, he must have realised that along the way, he was tempted to sacrifice content for scale. After getting it right five times and not falling prey to his commercial invincibility, Aamir committed the sin of taking his audience for granted.

As Ghajini completes 10 years, Aamir must look back at his first tryst with a 100-crore film and realise that more than the figures, what matters more is how he engages the audience through the film, rather than just selling it to fans who are in awe of his brand. It is time Aamir realises yet again why he is no Salman Khan, and why he definitely should not try to become one."

The Gautam Buddh Nagar administration has invited private players to join it in uplifting the infrastructure and quality of education in state-run primary schools under the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative, an official said.

The administration's move comes days after a wall of a private school collapsed in Noida's Salarpur village, killing two children and injuring three others.

Officials had said that the illegally-run school's building was in a ""poor and deteriorated"" condition.

""There are 685 government primary and upper primary schools. When the quality of established private schools is compared with government schools, there is a perceptible gap. The gap needs to be bridged,"" District Magistrate Brajesh Narain Singh said in an official letter last week.

While the initiative to invite private players is new, the administration had inked pacts with leading private firms such as the HCL Foundation and Paytm last year for partnership in around 100 schools.

Singh said of late, some good companies have come forward to play their roles under the CSR initiative and they have adopted the schools after signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the administration.

""Their work ranges from providing infrastructure facilities to improving the quality of education. At times the effort is in form of a joint venture as well. Many are doing good work. All this is being done without creation of any rights of any type and is purely under the CSR initiative,"" he said.

As many as 580 schools in the four blocks of the district -- Bisrakh, Dadri, Dankaur and Jewar -- are up for adoption and proposals for this could be sent to the administration by January 15, 2019, the magistrate said.

""I reiterate that this will be only under the CSR initiative and all rights shall be reserved with the administration,"" Singh said.

The administrative work of the school is managed by a teacher as it doesn't have a principal. The former principal passed away in 2017 and no appointment was made since then.

This is one among several schools in the state that are struggling without basic necessities.

State education minister Arvind Pandey has been pushing for better facilities for students in government schools, but they are still a distant dream for many schools in the state.

According to the education department data for 2017-2018, out of 1,412 schools in Dehradun, 649 schools do not have a playground, 329 schools do not have ramp facilities or boundary walls, and fencing is missing in 117 schools.

Sunita Rawat, the teacher in charge of the primary school in Raipur, said: ""We got ~50,000 from the department this month and we will use it to repair the floors and toilets. We never had furniture in the school and students have been sitting on mats only.""

She also added that even the neighbouring schools don't have such facilities and they ""never asked the department especially for furniture"".

Another teacher said on condition of anonymity: ""We requested the department to release funds for repairing the boundary wall many times as it is a worry if any child sneaks out through the broken part of the wall.""

SB Joshi, chief education officer of Dehradun, said: ""There are over 1,000 schools in the district and we are trying to provide furniture to all. Till then, jute mats and carpets are provided for students to sit on.""

The department of school education sanctioned Rs 10 crore in November to all 13 districts for buying furniture for government schools.

The project is called ""Udaan, the Wings of Transformation"" and is focusing on bringing about a developmental change in the villages.

As a part of their CSR initiatives, INOX Air Products has started to focus on holistic rural development and initially taken up 2 villages (Jharnamuri and Bajudih) for their campaign. These are around 19 kms from Bokaro Steel Plant, where INOXAP has its on-site liquid production unit. These initiatives will be undertaken for a period of 34 months and began from June 2018.

Community mobilization was the pre-requisite for sustainable development initiative at these villages. The buy in from people would only come about after they were directly involved in the decision making process. Today, villagers are a part of a Village Development Committee and take decisions about the developmentinitiatives directly in consultation with the Mrida Team.

Existing Solar LED Street Light network has been strengthened by repairing existing lights and installing new ones as per need, so that the safety and security of those in these areas can be reinforced. 100% coverage has already been achieved in both villages.

Since safety and health of the villagers is one of the main concerns, availability of clean drinking water to the households becomes very important. As a result,Solar Powered pumping and purification system plant has been installed in Jharnamuri village on a community-based model where villagers pay Rs. 20 per month from each household to the Village Development Committee for availing the services. The money thus collected is utilized for the upkeep of the systemover time and makes the intervention self-sustainable. A water purificationsystem has been installed in the Govt. Middle School for the school students. The Pipeline work for water to school toilets has also been completed.

Creating sustainable and scalable livelihood generation opportunities including encouraging micro entrepreneurship and all-round community engagement will be another area of operation. 2 Stitching centres have already been established and training program initiated for 32 students across 2 villages. Incense Sticks value addition and marketing training imparted for 30 women and local linkages being created: Business already flowing in for them.

It is planned that the following will be also focused on in the next phase:

Setting up of Solar Powered E-Hubs to provide education, entertainment and E-Commerce facilities.

These are predominantly agrarian communities and the farmers are still using traditional methods of cultivation. An in-depth agri-input program focused on bettering yields and focused on high value crops will be undertaken to improve productivity and income levels of the farmers.

Working closely with the existing state-aided primary schools to ensure that more and more children can benefit from the education imparted.

Health and Nutrition related initiatives: This will start with the health baseline survey of the villagers through medical/health camps and based on the results of the survey, subsequent interventions to improve on the basic health index would be undertaken.

Installation of Solar Water Pumping & Purification system in Village Bajudih on similar lines.

Strengthening local leadership at the Village level in the form of Village Development Committees (VDCs) to play an active role in the entire initiative. The idea is for the VDC to eventually take over ongoing activities with minimal involvement of the INOX and Mrida."

Gymnastics is considered as one of most famous and prestigious sports categories in the Olympics. Gymnastics develops flexibility, strength, coordination, motor skills and balance. It's no wonder that those who aspire to taste Olympics glory undergo rigorous training, which often starts at an early age. For a gymnast to be successful, two things are of prime importance: the gymnast's core strength and proper equipment. One such equipment essential for strength building and initial training is the gymnastic bench.

A gymnastic bench is a structure with a wooden board and legs with hooks attached to one side, which fixes the attachment to a vault box or a wall. Gymnastic benches can be set to different inclines, allowing varying levels of exercise intensity. A gymnastic bench is designed for exercising in the sitting position, hall laying position or lying position. Gymnastic bench legs are equipped with an anti-slip rubber (usually PVC) coating to improve stability.

The use of lightweight and economic gymnastic benches as an alternative to traditional ones is trending in schools. These are manufactured from a differently chosen, light timber.

There has been a lot of debate about long-term effects of gymnastics in an athlete's body, particularly women. Stress fractures are common amongst gymnasts and such issues hinder gymnast participation and consequently, gymnastic bench sales.

North America, currently, is the largest market for fitness and gymnastic equipment, owing to long time exposure and awareness about the sport. Every Olympics, American gymnasts rise to glory and with this, the participation has been noted to increase. A report by Sports & Fitness Industry Association (SFIA) states that gymnastics participation increased by about 13% from 2009 to 2016. In the U.S. alone, gymnastics is an essential part of schools, which are almost always equipped with multiple gymnastic benches. Europe closely follows North America with regards to the gymnastic bench market. Gymnastic benches are expected to experience moderate growth in the European market, owing to its maturity. APEJ and Latin America present attractive opportunities for the gymnastic bench market over the forecast period. Rising awareness about healthy lifestyles and the growing affinity towards sports are likely to give the gymnastic bench market a boost in emerging countries such as India and Brazil. The APEJ gymnastic bench market is expected to exhibit the highest CAGR during the forecast period.

Gymnastic Bench Market: Market Participants

Some of the key market players in the global gymnastic bench market are Gymnova SAS, DimaSPort, MTB Group, Spieth Gymnastics, Davies Sports, Janssen Fritsen, Niels Larsen Limited, Continental Sports Limited, Kübler Sport GmbH, Other Key Players

As we sat down making the list, a lot of really interesting cars popped in our heads and unlike what you might think, not all of them are absurdly priced eccentric hypercars (heck it's a wishlist, so what if they are?). It was pretty difficult narrowing everything down (yes, we are quite greedy like that) but we eventually did. So here is our Christmas wishlist of cars that we would love to see on Indian roads in the near future (are you reading Santa?)

Suzuki Jimny

With rumours of its India debut floating around for over a decade now, the Suzuki Jimny has to be among the most awaited cars in the country. The spiritual successor to the venerable Gypsy, it is a rugged-looking, no-nonsense off-roader. And like the Gypsy, it too packs in a peppy petrol engine and not a diesel.

The venerable 4x4 is already on sale in major markets such as Europe, Australia, Russia, and of course, Japan, and Suzuki has promised that it will be sold 'throughout the world.' However, there has been no word regarding its India launch yet.

Maruti Suzuki is of the opinion that a small three-door SUV won't drive as much demand as they'd like. The Jimny is a recreational vehicle, and isn't something that most would buy as their primary car. Nevertheless, we would love to see it come to India.

Civic Type R

The most loved Honda car by enthusiasts and the uninitiated alike got a complete reboot in 2017. The Civic not only got an all new design but with the Type R, it also got a new 2.0-litre 306PS petrol motor that helped it run circles around its competition and break the Nurburgring lap record for front wheel drive cars. After the Japanese manufacturer took the eighth-generation Civic sedan away from us in 2012, enthusiasts and purists have longed for the sporty Honda to make a comeback here. The Type R is the radical looking fastback version of the Civic and with the sedan spied testing and being readied for launch, we hope Honda gets the Type R here as well.

Ford Raptor F-150

With its reputation for being one of the toughest, most capable pick-up trucks around, the Raptor F150 is a beast on four wheels. It packs a powerful engine, an extremely capable suspension setup, and off-road abilities that can rival the best in the business.

Powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.5-litre V6, the Ford Raptor makes a hefty 450PS of power and oodles of torque. Despite all its weight (5500 pounds or 2494kg), the Raptor is astonishingly quick and does 0-100kmph in just about 6.0 seconds!

Jeep Gladiator

Jeep has recently taken the wraps off its much awaited, big-and-burly pick-up truck christened the Gladiator. Based on the current-gen Wrangler, the all-new Gladiator is a behemoth on four wheels and takes 'Bada hai toh Behtar hai' to another level.

Being a Jeep, the Gladiator gets the best equipment for some spirited off-roading such as Command-Trac and Rock-Trac 4x4 systems, third-generation Dana 44 axles, Tru-Lock electric front- and rear-axle lockers, Trac-Lok limited-slip differential, a segment-exclusive electronic sway-bar disconnect for extra articulation and traction at all ends, and a ground clearance of nearly 282mm!

The last time Jeep built a midsize pick-up truck was back in 1992 when the last Comanche was sold. The all-new Gladiator gets a Wrangler cabin and a five-foot steel bed which has a payload of up to 1600 pounds (726kg).

Powered by the 3.6-litre V6 petrol engine that churns out 289PS and 352Nm of torque, paired to either a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic transmission, the Gladiator packs enough to take over any terrain.

Toyota Supra

The long-awaited fifth generation of Toyota's most revered sports car is here. Recently teased with the speckled vinyl camouflage, the reborn Supra has got us as excited as the last time Goku was brought back from the dead in a Dragonball Super episode.

After a hiatus of nearly 16 years, Toyota's halo two-seater sports coupe is all set to make a comeback. An icon of pop culture and made famous by films like the Fast and Furious, this versatile sportster is every tuners dream.

The 2019 version is powered by a turbocharged 3.0-litre inline-six motor which makes 350PS. It shares the same platform as the BMW Z4 and will debut at the upcoming Detroit Motor Show in January. The Supra is a legend in its own right and one of the best cars to come from Japan.

Mercedes Maybach Pullman S650

The Maybach Pullman S650 is an uber luxurious limo like no other. This armoured beast of a machine is nearly 6.5metres long and features all the creature comforts you can think of.

Priced at around half a million euros (Rs 4.02 crore), the 2019 Mercedes-Maybach S650 Pullman comes with the 6.0-litre V12 bi-turbo engine that has an output of 622PS of max power and a mammoth 1,000 Nm of peak torque. And if you are looking for speed, then the 2019 S650 Pullman can do 0-100kmph in less than 7 seconds. It is the longest, most expensive, and most exclusive S-Class and we would love to get our hands on it.

Aston Martin Valkyrie

If you are old-school and firmly believe that there is no replacement for displacement, then the bonkers Aston Martin Valkyrie is a match made in heaven for you.

Powered by a 6.5-litre, naturally-aspirated V12 engine which makes 1000PS and revs to 11,100 rpm, the Valkyrie is a marvel of automotive engineering itself. It develops all that power and a humungous 740Nm of torque, and that too without any of that turbocharger or electric motor wizardry under the hood. With an estimated price tag of nearly $3 million (Rs 21.16 crore), this hypercar is the most expensive and eccentric entrant on our list.

McLaren Speedtail

Carrying the mantle of being the spiritual successor of the legendary McLaren F1 from the 90s is no easy feat, and with the Speedtail McLaren will leave no stone unturned. This gorgeous Hyper GT is one of the most beautifully designed cars by the iconic British marque.

The Speedtail is built around a bespoke McLaren monocage carbon fibre structure and benefits from lightweight engineering throughout, including an all-carbon fibre body, aluminium active suspension and carbon ceramic brakes. This makes it the most aero-drag efficient Mclaren road car till date.

Packing in a monstrous 1050PS petrol hybrid engine under the hood, the petrol-electric powertrain can propel the Speedtail from 0-300kmph in a mind-numbing 12.8 seconds! It also enables the Speedtail to break the F1's top speed record of 243mph (391kmph), set way back in 1993, by a significant margin.

The Speedtail certainly looks a car like no other. And with just 106 units to be ever built (which are already sold out) it is among the most expensive hypercars of its time as well, with a sticker price of over 1.75 million pounds (Rs 16.50 crore). If there ever was a must have wishlist car it is this!

Mercedes-AMG One

The F1-engined Project One, is one of the most talked about cars and probably the most ambitious project from the Mercedes-AMG stables yet. All 275 examples planned for production have long been sold out, despite the hypercar's eye-watering price tag of $2.7 million (Rs 19.11 crore).

Powered by a hybrid electric powertrain which features a 1.6-litre V6 gasoline engine and two 120kW motors in tandem to make over a 1000PS of power this hypercar is simply mental. It does a top speed of 350kmph and can clock 0-200kmph in less than 6 seconds, talk about hair raisingly fast.

Rimac Concept Two

Let's end the list with one for the future. The Rimac Concept Two, is the amalgamation of the latest and the greatest tech advancements in the automotive industry. An all electric hypercar, the Concept Two is the better and improved version from the Croatian carmaker after the Concept One. For the uninitiated, the Concept One was the same crazy electric that Grand Tour host Richard Hammond crashed in one of the episodes in season 2. Now Rimac is back and has done one better with the Concept Two.

It comes loaded with an arsenal of electric Motors that propel it from 0-100kmph in a mind altering 1.85 seconds! It does that with a combined output of a mammoth 1914PS of power and 2300Nm of torque. What's more is that you can have all of this insane performance along with a claimed range of around 650km!"

Jashn-e-Rekhta, an organisation dedicated to the preservation and promotion of the Urdu language, its literature and culture, recently concluded its 5th edition in Delhi last week. Jashn-e-Rekhta, which literally means 'the festival of Urdu', has been extremely successful in attracting huge audiences to its events built around Urdu. The popularity of the event has led to the establishment of another organization, Rang-e-Rekhta, curated by the Rekhta Foundation, which takes the success of Urdu to other cities. So far it has held three events in Chandigarh, Jaipur and Gurugram.

This apparent success of Urdu also raises an important question about the de facto status of Urdu in India. Scholarly studies show that Urdu has suffered marginalisation and that its social landscape is shrinking. Against this backdrop, many claim that the success of Jashn marks the revival of the Urdu language and literature. For instance, the Bollywood artist Javed Jaffrey said: ""Urdu khatre mein nahin hai, Urdu to qatre qatre mein hai (Urdu is not in danger; Urdu is actually in every drop)."" This pithy line received a round of applause from the audience. Tanweer Ahmad of the Urdu Qaumi Awaz made it into a headline.

Similar claims were made at the end of the 2017 Jashn festival. Malini Nayar of the Times of India dismissed the idea that Urdu was dying. She too echoed the jubilation and enthusiasm about Urdu's revival with her headline, 'Urdu language is not only alive but rocking.' Urdu newspapers followed suit. The Siasat Daily published a report on the role of Jashn in reviving Urdu with the headline, 'Jashn-e-Rekhta has proved that Urdu is not only alive but is creating waves'. Twitter resonated with the excitement of revival too.

Such views about its 'revival' and 'resurgence' overlook the ground reality that Urdu is actually in sharp decline in North India, especially in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, considered its traditional strongholds. Clearly, if there is a revival, it will mean that the young generation, who will be the carriers of the language, is learning it. The attendance at a Jashn festival or a mushaira or a qawwali is not an indicator of the revival of a language.

Sudha Pai, a scholar of political science, notes that other than the two Urdu medium schools run by Aligarh Muslim University, there is not one single primary or junior high school in the whole of UP where Urdu is fully the medium of instruction . The symbolic second language status accorded to Urdu by the UP government has not arrested its decline either. The recommendations of Gujral Committee (1975), the Ale Ahmad Suroor Committee (1979), and the Ali Sardar Jafri Committee (1990) to revive and popularise Urdu have never been implemented.

The situation of Urdu teaching in Delhi is no less gloomy. As per an RTI filed in 2013, a whopping 73% of posts for Urdu teachers within Delhi government schools are vacant. This despite the fact that Urdu has been granted the second official language status in Delhi. Furthermore, 74 out of 80 textbooks needed in Urdu schools were not available in the market. The result was an abnormally high failure rate in Urdu schools in Delhi.

For the claim of Urdu revival to be true, it follows that the young generation has the opportunity to learn its script as well. This point was stressed by Gulzar, the legendary Bollywood figure in the 2017 Rekhta festival. A declining proficiency in the Urdu script can be seen in the mushrooming of Urdu books transliterated into Devanagari found in Urdu Bazar, Old Delhi. Urdu in Devanagari has emerged as a response to the lack of proficiency in the script among the younger generation of speakers in Delhi and UP.

Another indicator of its decline in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi is the loss of the pronunciation of Urdu sounds, especially /kh̲/,/gh̲/, and /q/, as in kh̲uda (God) gh̲alat (wrong) and qalam (pen) respectively. Considered the shibboleths of Urdu as a language, the young generation is increasingly non-observant of these sounds. The decline interestingly is also visible in the pronunciation of words in Bollywood songs; the new generation of singers pronounce words containing these sounds using the Hindi pronunciation norms.

So what does the success of Jashn festival actually mean? In my view, it says little about the 'health' of the language and more about the marketing of the event. First of all, utilising the linkages between Urdu and popular culture, they have successfully galvanised Bollywood celebrities to promote it. Not all the Bollywood stars who have graced the Jashn are stars of Urdu language and literature. But they are all big crowd pullers.

Secondly, on the socio-political front, Urdu is no longer a force to reckon with as it has lost its battle for survival in North India. Such events are, therefore, aimed at the elite - especially the English educated ones. The first few editions did not have the Jashn-e-Rekhta written in Urdu. The recent ones did include the Urdu script. However, the schedules were available only in English. The big 'I LOVE URDU' cut-out where the youth were seen taking pictures was only in English. Both speak volumes about the targeted audience.

The English-speaking elite, however, has not embraced Urdu as it is. This elite has a romanticised and orientalised view of the language of love, beauty, politeness, tahzeeb and romance. Contrary to this, for its traditional speakers, Urdu is a world of myriad lived experiences which include, but are not limited to, love, romance and politeness. For them, Urdu is as much about love (mohabbat) as it is about revolt and revolution (inqilab). The new admirers of Urdu may not know that Urdu has some of the strongest expletives as well.

The success of Jashn-e-Rekhta, then, seems to be analogous to the popularity of sarson ka saag and makke ki roti in elite hotels and restaurants where the dish is an exotica - an occasional item on the menu rather than a lived experience of a villager. For the non-Urdu elites, it is more a matter of yaadgaar - something memorable, butwhich also means an old building - than a matter of rozgaar, or employment."

Police said Bharath, 16, son of Gajendran, suffered from primary nocturnal enuresis also known as bed-wetting. He had been consulting doctors to treat the health issue. Last Wednesday, Bharath fell asleep during a free period in school and apparently urinated on the bench. One of his classmate, who saw this, allegedly told others and they teased him.

Upset over this, the boy told his parents that he'd never return to school and was on leave till December 21. His father, however, convinced him and sent him to school later.

The facts are startling. Close to 15 million individuals in India are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder/ social communication disorder. Nearly 35 million children in India have dyslexia, a common learning disorder. Down syndrome occurs in one in every 830 live births in the country. At least 11% of India's primary school children have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The harsh truth is there aren't enough trained professionals and facilities available for special needs children. Schools are not sufficiently equipped to address special needs. Parents and caregivers aren't enabled to support the special needs children in their care. However, a first-of-its-kind startup called Mom's Belief is trying to make a difference in the lives of people with special needs children. The startup was launched in 2015 to support parents of special needs children and their care-givers to enable and empower them.

""So far, we have been able to touch 1,000 families across India and five international locations, which is five times more than we had planned to serve,"" says Nitin Bindlish, founder and CEO, Mom's Belief. The Mom's Belief home programme empowers parents to support their special needs child in the absence of accessible and affordable services, operating from its base outside Delhi. A dedicated, masters-level child psychologist is assigned to each family. Psychologists connect with parents using video conferencing, phone, email, and instant messaging. Guided by a team with expertise in child psychology, pediatric neurology, occupational/speech therapy and special education, the psychologist helps parents to identify goals and create monthly individualised education plans. Teaching tools are delivered to the home every month.

As support is provided remotely, Mom's Belief works only with children who have a diagnosis. It uses the child's medical history and a skill and development assessment to create a neurodevelopmental profile, which guides the creation of IEPs and acts as the baseline against which progress is measured. The programme is offered on a subscription basis. ""Technology is at the core of all our activities, and we use it to support parents and professionals. For instance, we are developing tools that will help parents understand their child's likely growth trajectory and map out plans for the future,"" says Bindlish. ""Digital platforms connect us with parents and professionals who care for special needs children. They also help us reach families in more remote areas. Parents can use Skype to virtually bring their dedicated child psychologist into their home.""

Initial funding for the startup came from personal investment, and friends and family. ""We have drawn the attention of investors from all over the world who are impressed with our empowerment model, which is scalable, effective and affordable,"" says Bindlish. ""When you empower a mother with professional guidance and resources, she can help her child overcome the challenges of a developmental disorder and fulfill his or her potential. Therefore, we want to empower parents to act as ""co-therapist"" for their child at home and empower professionals to provide more integrated solutions at therapy centers, schools, and hospitals,"" he informs.

Mom's Belief addresses disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, learning disabilities, intellectual disability, Down syndrome, global developmental delay, and mental health issues. ""We complement our home-based programme with support for schools and therapy centres to create an ecosystem of support. This also helps to build awareness and acceptance, particularly in schools,"" he adds. According to him, after three years in the R&D phase the company launched its programmes early this year and have touched the lives of 1,000+ families so far. Mom's Belief wants to touch 10,000-plus families in the coming years in multiple countries."

With admissions for the pre-primary classes getting underway, Secretary, Punjab Education, hit the road and went door to door asking the parents to send their kids to government schools. This unusual drive is part of the department's efforts to ensure that admissions in pre-primary classes cross the figure of one lakh students.

In past four days since the admissions began, over 25,000 children between ages 3 to 6 have been admitted in the pre-primary classes.

On Saturday, Secretary Education, Punjab, Krishan Kumar, along with the staff of Education Department visited homes in Mohali District area to make the parents aware about pre-primary classes being offered at government schools.

""It is quite unusual as hardly any senior officer would go door to door like Secretary, Education, who is one of the senior most officers of Punjab not only in Education Department but otherwise,"" said a teacher who accompanied the secretary along with several other staff members, adding that due to his efforts over several government schools in Punjab have already got a much better infrastructure.

The teacher added that by the end of this year over 4000 schools would be given the same facelift.

Those accompanying the Krishan Kumar carried a placard that read: ""Na koi fees, na koi basta, sarkari school sab ton sasta (no fee nor bag, government schools are the cheaper places to teach you wards), in their hands. He appealed the parents do teach your children. He also said that each one should bring one child to school.

Pre-primary classes were started in the 12,500 primary and elementary schools of Punjab last year when 1.70 lakh children were admitted in nursery and kindergarten classes.

A range of bags adorns one wall of a small store in Dhamani village in Pune district. Mangal Wagh arranges newly acquired beauty products on a shelf along the other. Passersby slow down to wave or call out a greeting to her.

Three years ago, Ms. Wagh (39) would step out of her house to work as a daily wager to look after her family of four. She had to take up work after her husband became paralysed. Today, Ms. Wagh owns a shop that offers wallets, handbags, schoolbags and beauty products, which are popular with women in the village.

Ms. Wagh owes her financial independence to the Ernst And Young Foundation and the Srinivasan Services Trust (SST), the social services arm of TVS Motors. The two organisations have been empowering women by setting up self-help groups in over 100 villages in Pune district.

Three years ago, Ms. Wagh took a loan of ₹20,000 and rented a shop in her village. Today, she teaches five children to make bags and is looking to expand her business. She said, ""I want to learn micro design in embroidery to sell more items. Hardly any shops offer these services here, so people come to me.""

Roopa Sanghuri from Wafgaon village shares a similar story. From being the owner of two cows and a few goats, Ms. Sanghuri now runs a beauty parlour after borrowing ₹10,000 from the self-help group in her village. ""I wanted to save for my daughter. Now, the parlour is running well and I earn around ₹300 per day and save ₹700 a month,"" Ms. Sanghuri said.

Financial independence has changed not only the lifestyle of these women, but also their outlook and standing. They are more confident and are respected in their villages. Sridhar Iyer, national director, EY Foundation India, said, ""Economic independence has a major role to play in women's social empowerment. We are trying to solve monetary issues of rural women by educating them on formal borrowing and low cost, sustainable means of livelihood.""

The self-help groups meet every month and discuss solutions to issues faced by women and their villages. The Gulani village, for instance, was facing water scarcity for seven years due to irregular monsoon, and the lake in the village could not meet the needs of 250 families. Most people had to fetch water from other villages, and the chore fell to the women, who had to walk two to three kilometres every day to get water.

With EY-SST's guidance and help, the women desilted the lake in May last year at a cost of ₹4 lakh. The women met 60% of the expenses through crowdfunding, while EY-SST provided the rest. The village now has water, and the fertile soil from the desilting work resulted in a better crop for farmers.

EY-SST has also helped renovate government primary schools in Khed taluka. Trees were planted, toilets built and school walls painted, prompting parents to withdraw their children from private schools and send them to government schools. The EY-SST operates self-help groups in 2,000 villages in 10 States with the help of local non-profit organisations, and 478 groups in 162 villages in Pune district."

It cannot let recent incidents undermine its progressive ethos.

In the last few months, Kerala has been witness to disturbing incidents related to women, their entry to a temple, diktats of religion, caste and so on. Has Kerala changed? To put it differently, can religion be politicised even in this state?

When Swami Vivekananda reached Thiruvananthapuram on December 13, 1892 and spent time with the royal family, it was an unplanned visit. For him, this journey through Kerala was shocking. Vivekananda's original plan was to visit Mysore, and then Madras, and end his tour of India in Rameswaram.

Who was responsible for changing Swami Vivekananda's original travel plan? Dr Palpu, a medical practitioner in Bangalore who had a degree from Madras and had also studied in Europe. He was not allowed to take up the medical profession in Kerala because he belonged to the ""untouchable"" caste -- Ezhava. In Bangalore, Palpu got an opportunity to meet the Swami and explain to him the prevalence of the horrific caste system in his state. At Palpu's request, Vivekananda cancelled his travel plans to Rameswaram and went to Kanyakumari, travelling by train, bullock cart and boat from the north to the south of Kerala. While in Thrissur, he was eager to visit the Kodungallur temple. But even after waiting for three days, Vivekananda was not allowed to visit the temple mainly because his caste was not clear to the temple authorities. Referring to the dehumanising caste system, Swami Vivekananda said that Kerala is a lunatic asylum, a mad house of casteism. His criticism became a talking point all over the world.

More than 125 years have passed since the Swami's visit. Over the years, Kerala saw radical social change because of two factors: One, the people were exposed to global society and two, education became the primary driving force in society. The floodgates were opened when Rani Parvathi Bayi declared on June 17, 1817, in Travancore that all children must go to school and the cost of their education will be borne by the state.

As Amartya Sen puts it: ""The totality of foreign exposure, including Christian, Jewish and Islamic elements, drawn from the Arab world and the Mediterranean, side by side with indigenous Hindu, Jain and Buddhist ancestry, must have had its impact on this part of India. Tolerant pluralism is itself an educational influence, and by opening the door to other people and other cultures, a host society remains alive to learning from other traditions and other ways of living, including the uses of education and schooling elsewhere.""

Kerala began to feel the impact of these twin factors through Palpu, Sree Narayana Guru, Chattampi Swamikal, Ayyankali, Mannathu Padmanabha Pillai and others from all castes and religions. The radical changes towards a secular ethos were evident when Sree Narayana Guru said: ""One caste, one religion, one God for all."" No one attacked him; on the contrary, he became a hero. His ideas led to the people of Kerala travelling all over the country and beyond; a growth in radical writings and an efflorescence in the cultural sphere, especially in theatre and cinema, followed. The novels, stories and writings of thinkers led Malayalees to become a debating, argumentative community. No one was a ""victim"" of radical thinking.

When Vayalar Ramavarma wrote in a Malayalam song, that ""man created the religions, religions created the gods; and man, religions and gods together shared the land, they shared the mind"", he was not attacked -- instead he became a well known poet. K J Yesudas sang this song for the film Achanum Bappayum in 1972, which reverberated across Kerala.

All this was made possible by a sense of community which began to be forged centuries ago. This community bonding led to secularisation. That is, Kerala is not bound in the iron frame of a religious or caste ""community"". The secular identity is strong in Kerala.

Kerala has been transformed over the years and is viewed as an icon of secularism and socialism. Two events that have occurred since 1980 are acid tests of secular Kerala.

First, there was a serious conflict between Hindus and Christians over Nilakkal, where according to the Christian tradition, St Thomas, disciple of Jesus, built a church in the first century. There a cross was said to be found and it soon disappeared. This sparked serious communal tension in March 1983. There was a war cry from a section of a Hindu organisation to save the Nilakkal temple and church leaders wanted to save Nilakkal for Christians. This dispute went to the extent of some predicting that the cross found and lost would become the crucifixion of Kerala's communal harmony. But there was no violence; not a drop of blood was shed and after eight months, the social fabric of Kerala regained its original texture.

The second was the 1987 election to the Kerala Assembly when the BJP-Hindu Munnani (Front) claimed that communalism had entered the state. They contested 122 seats out of 138 in the state with the support of a section of resourceful, upper-caste Hindus. But the people of Kerala elected the Left Democratic Front and the BJP-Hindu Munnani could not win even a single seat.

Swapan Dasgupta, writing about electioneering in Kerala in The Statesman (March 18, 1987) stated that in Kerala, ""the gulf between politics and social relations is striking"". The state now finds itself at a critical juncture. God's own country can't afford to fail."

With just three months left for the conclusion of the current academic year, Samagra Shiksha, Keralam, is gearing up to utilise the funds allocated for various projects for school students on time.

The Union government merged the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shikshak Abhiyan to form Samagra Shiksha early this year.

Improvement of academic standards as well as infrastructure development at schools from pre-primary to Class 12 were brought within its ambit. However, there had been a delay in convening a meeting of functionaries of the new entity, which also resulted in many projects getting stuck. As the non-utilisation of allocated funds this academic year may lead to the Centre reducing the funds next year, a State-level workshop is now being held in Kozhikode.

K.J. Harikumar, State Programme Officer, Samgra Shiksha, Keralam, told The Hindu on Sunday that it had been decided to conduct a 'Mikavulsavam' for students of Classes 1 to 7 in aided and government schools to improve academic standards. English teachers in higher secondary schools will be given special training. They would be given Malayalam translations of history, geography and economics textbooks, he added.

According to sources, coordinators of the programme from 14 districts and Block Resource Centre functionaries are participating in the workshop. It has been decided to complete the construction of science parks in all aided and government schools under the aegis of Samgra Shiksha, by the next academic year. The ongoing projects to improve the efficiency of students in science, mathematics, and English, Malayalam and Hindi will be modified and rearranged, if necessary."

Ghanaian children living in villages across the Volta region must swim or forge through at least one river daily to reach the nearest school - holding tightly onto basins with their uniforms and books. This commute is particularly dangerous during the rainy season, three months every year, when the currents run high and strong.

Over the past several decades, flooding has become one of the most harmful natural hazards in the Volta River Basin. In 2018 alone, more than 30,000 people in at least 225 communities in the Upper East and North regions have endured floods. Although no direct correlation can be made to flooding, these regions also report the lowest overall primary and secondary school attendance rates in Ghana. Not all the children know how to swim in the flood-affected regions. Those who cannot swim usually ford streams by holding onto logs and bending tree branches, risking a fall and the waters carrying them away. Children are often late for classes and tired. In some cases, parents decide that crossing rivers is too dangerous, so they simply refuse to allow their children to attend school.

Frank Darko, 27, was moved to action in 2017, after seeing a documentary and news reports about the children's plight. He invented a water bicycle to help children and others living in river regions to traverse bodies of water. ""There are no canoes to carry them,"" he notes. ""But even if there is a canoe, it is very risky as it can capsize at any time putting the life of the children in danger. The water cycle is designed to be stable on the water.""

He called his invention Chario, a name inspired by the word ""chariot"", a carriage driven primarily through horsepower, and insists the rig is safer than a canoe. It took him more than a year to come up with the concept and design the water cycle. He had other ideas at first, including building a bridge, but these proved to be beyond his financial capabilities.

Such entrepreneurial endeavors are far from singular in Ghana. According to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor report based on a countrywide survey of more than 1,200 young people, 66% of young Ghanaians have started their own business. Most operate in the informal sector due to cost and lack of market access. The median age in Africa is around 20. More than 35% of Ghana's population is under the age of 14 - compared to the global average of 25%. In Ghana, as in other parts of Sub Saharan Africa, this is partly due to the government's inability to provide jobs for its citizens as well as an increasing demand for local innovative solutions by banks, insurance companies and manufacturing firms.

Darko's invention could be useful throughout Ghana, as many communities contend with heavy rainfall and flooding. During the two rainy seasons, in spring and autumn, children and workers often cannot reach their daily destinations. The Chario could also be useful in other countries facing similar problems, including Togo and Benin or India.

Darko used aluminum, wood and a propeller as well as cork which keeps the Chario afloat. With no financial support from either investors or the government, Darko invested around $100 out of his pocket to develop the cycle. Again, according to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor report, this is not unusual in Ghana, with 90% of the young people surveyed indicating they had not received government or private support.

The Chario is easy to operate and Darko says there is no need to know how to ride a bike. Other people, including a popular radio anchor, tested the water cycle at sea, although children in the Volta region have yet to try out the Chario.

The young entrepreneur is currently perfecting his model. The current version only accommodates one person, and he plans for the next one to ferry five people: ""Four at the back and the rider. The children are not going to ride the machine by themselves. Someone will carry them to and fro on the water surface. They will be at the back and the rider in front, just like a regular chariot.""

For his next version, he wants to use more expensive, durable materials for water resistance, including stainless steel, mahogany, leather and kapok, a tropical tree native to West Africa. For the new model, he is immersing the propeller to avoid splashing water onto the children or driver. This will make the device faster, lighter and more efficient. This time, he hopes to attract financial supporters for his efforts.

Darko lives in Takoradi in the Western Region of Ghana. During his final year of studies at the Takoradi Technical University, where he studied graphic design, personal financial challenges disrupted his education. In response to his invention, though, the university awarded Darko a full scholarship, giving him the opportunity to finish his studies and conceptualise inventions that might contribute to solving challenges faced by Ghanaian society and the world. The university also expressed interest in supporting Darko in improving his water cycle - and established an entrepreneurial and innovation incubator to assist all its students to explore their creative ideas and transform them into business ventures. As mentioned by former United States President Barack Obama during the 2015 Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Nairobi, Kenya, ""entrepreneurship creates new jobs and new businesses, new ways to deliver basic services, new ways of seeing the world - it is the spark of prosperity.""

Darko says he would be proud to employ other Ghanaians and contribute to reducing the unemployment toll in his country, described as a major driver for migration and brain drain. Ghana's official unemployment rate is 2.5% nationwide, with the youth unemployment rate more than double that, while the literacy rate is about 80% and GDP per capita is about $1,800. The water cycle is the young Ghanaian's first invention, but he already has several ideas for others, including using unconventional materials in the fashion industry as a designer, that he is eager to explore."

CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

CRIMINAL APPEAL No(s). 2229 OF 2011

STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH Vs PREETAM

R. BANUMATHI, J.:

Citation: AIR 2018 SC 4212 : 2018 (4) JLJR 24 : 2018 (4) PLJR 62 : 2018 (11) Scale 120

(1) This appeal arises out of judgment and order dated 6th

January, 2010 passed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at

Jabalpur in Criminal Appeal NO.228 of 1995 in which the High

Court reversed the verdict of the conviction under Section 376

I.P.C. and also the sentence of imprisonment of seven years and

acquitted the respondent-accused.

(2) Despite service of notice, the respondent has not chosen

to appear and contest this appeal. Accordingly Ms. Nidhi,

Advocate, has been appointed by the Supreme Court Legal

Services Committee as amicus to contest the appeal on behalf of

the respondent.

(3) We have heard Ms. Swarupama Chaturvedi, learned counsel

appearing for the appellant-State and Ms. Nidhi, learned

amicus, and also perused the impugned judgment and the

evidence/materials on record.

(4) The facts of the case in a nutshell are as follows. On 6th

March, 1993 at about 9.00 p.m. the prosecutrix (PW-1) along

2

with her two sisters i.e. Hirkanbai (PW-3) and Anitabai had

gone outside the village to a field to attend nature's call and

while returning back the respondent-accused is alleged to have

forcibly taken the prosecutrix to the field and committed rape

on her.

(5) Since the Moti Ram (PW-2) who is father of Hirkanbai (PW-

3) and also uncle (chacha) of the prosecutrix was not in the

village, on his return a complaint was lodged on 8th March,

1993. The prosecutrix was medically examined on 9th March, 1993

by Dr. U.S. Vasnik (PW-6), who has noted that the hymen of

prosecutrix was torn; swelling was present on the edges of torn

hymen. Dr. U.S. Vasnik (PW-6) has opined that though vagina of

the prosecutrix was admitted two fingers easily, the

prosecutrix felt pain and the doctor (PW-6) has opined that the

prosecutrix was subjected to sexual intercourse within 2-3 days

of examination.

(6) Based upon the evidence of prosecutrix (PW-1) and

Mangrulal (PW-4) who went to the place of occurrence after

having been told by Anita and saw the accused running from

there and also on the evidence of Dr. U.S. Vasnik (PW-6), the

trial court convicted the respondent-accused under Section 376

I.P.C. and sentenced him to undergo imprisonment for a period

of seven years.

(7) On appeal, the High Court has reversed the verdict of

conviction on the grounds:- (i) There was no external injury on

3

the person of prosecutrix (PW-1) which is indicative of her

consent for the sexual intercourse and, therefore, the story of

forcible rape does not find support from the medical evidence;

(ii) There was delay in registration of the FIR.

(8) As pointed out earlier as per PW-6-Dr. Vasnik's evidence

the hymen of the prosecutrix (PW-1) was torn and swelling was

present in the vagina having redness. Doctor has noticed that

even though vagina admitted of two fingers, the prosecutrix

felt pain which is suggestive that the prosecutrix was

subjected to sexual intercourse only in the occurrence.

(9) It is fairly well-settled that in the absence of external

injury on the person of the prosecutrix, it cannot be concluded

that the incident had taken place with the consent of the

prosecutrix. It depends upon the facts and circumstances of

each case. In B.C. Deva alias Dyava v. State of Karnataka,

(2007) 12 SCC 122, this Court has held that absence of injury

on the person of the victim of rape does not lead to an

inference that the accused did not commit forcible sexual

intercourse. It was further held that even in the absence of

external injury, the oral testimony of the prosecutrix that she

was subjected to rape, cannot be ignored.

(10) In the present case evidence of prosecutrix (PW-1) is

supported by the medical evidence and also by the evidence of

Mangrulal (PW-4) who saw the accused running away from the

scene of occurrence. Insofar as the consent of the prosecutrix

4

(PW-1) pointed out by the High Court is concerned, we find it

difficult to agree with the view taken by the High Court. In

her chief examination, Dr. U.S. Vasnik (PW-6) has stated that

the age of the victim could be between 13 and 17 years. Of

course in her cross-examination, Dr. Vasnik has agreed to the

suggestion that the age of the victim could be 17 years.

(11) In our considered view, the answer elucidated in the

cross-examination of Dr. Vasnik (PW-6) cannot be taken as a

final opinion on the age of the prosecutrix (PW-1). It is to

be relevant to note that before the trial court the prosecution

has examined Bhaulal (PW-8), Head master/Head teacher of

Primary School Chor Pind Ke Par, District Balaghat. In his

evidence, Bhaulal (PW-8) has stated that the date of birth of

the prosecutrix (PW-1) was 16th May, 1981 which means that on

the date of the occurrence i.e. 6th March, 1993, the prosecutrix

(PW-1) was only aged about 12 years. The trial court has

neither acted upon the evidence of Bhaulal (PW-8) nor on the

school certificate on the ground that the person who has

admitted the prosecutrix in the school was not examined.

(12) In our considered view, the approach of the trial court

was not correct. In each and every case the prosecution cannot

be expected to examine the person who has admitted a student in

the school. The school registers are the authentic documents

being maintained in the official course, entitled to credence

of much weight unless proved otherwise. In our view,

considering the evidence of head master, Bhaulal (PW-8), and

the school certificate produced by him i.e. Ex.P/13-A, age of

the victim has to be taken as 12 years at the time of

occurrence.

(13) Of course, Dr. U.S. Vasnik (PW-6) in her chief examination

has stated that the age of the prosecutrix would be between 13

and 17 years. At the most, adopting the doctor's evidence, age

of the prosecutrix at the relevant point of time can only be

around 15 years. As per Section 375 I.P.C. a man is said to

commit rape, Sixthly - ""With or without her consent, when she

is under sixteen years of age"". The prosecutrix being aged 12

years at the time of the occurrence, her consent or otherwise

was of no relevance to bring the offence within the meaning of

Section 375 I.P.C. In our considered view the High Court

ignored the material evidence adduced by the prosecution and

erred in reversing the conviction of the respondent-accused.

(14) So far as the other ground of acquittal - delay in

registration of the F.I.R. is concerned, it has come on the

record that the uncle of the prosecutrix, Moti Ram (PW-2), was

not in the village and returned back to the village only on 8th

March, 1993 and on his return his daughter-Hirkanbai (PW-3),

has narrated the whole incident to him as to what happened to

the prosecutrix (PW-1) and a complaint was lodged on the same

day i.e. 8th March, 1993. After medical examination of the

prosecutrix (PW-1) on 9th March, 1993, F.I.R. was registered on

10th March, 1993 and the delay in registration of the F.I.R. has

been properly explained, which has not been considered by the

High Court.

(15) The impugned judgment of the High Court reversing the

conviction of the respondent to acquittal, cannot be sustained

and the same is liable to be set aside and the judgment of the

trial court convicting the respondent under Section 376 I.P.C.

is to be restored. The trial court has sentenced the

respondent-accused to undergo imprisonment for a period of

seven years.

(16) Prior to the Amendment Act 13 of 2013 (w.e.f. 3rd

February, 2013) under Section 376(1) I.P.C. the sentence of

imprisonment for a term shall not be less than 7 years

extending for life. However, as per the proviso to 376(1)

I.P.C. (prior to amendment) discretion is vested with the Court

to impose imprisonment for a term of less than seven years for

adequate and special reasons to be recorded in the judgment.

In this case, the occurrence was of the year 1993 i.e. about 25

years ago. Having regard to the passage of time and other

facts and circumstances of the case, the sentence of

imprisonment of seven years imposed on the respondent-accused

is reduced to a period of four years.

(17) Accordingly the appeal preferred by the State is allowed

and the conviction of the respondent-accused under Section 376

I.P.C. as passed by the trial court is restored. However, the

period of sentence of seven years, as noted above, is reduced

to four years.

(18) In case the respondent has not already undergone the

sentence of imprisonment of four years, he is to surrender to

custody within a period of fours weeks from today to serve the

remaining sentence failing which he shall be taken to custody.

(19) A copy of this order be sent to the concerned trial court

for necessary action.

Since then, Kharjana started making the rounds of the school, seeking some clarity on how his marriage could be grounds for removal.

With no clear response from the school administration, Kharjana moved the Meghalaya high court.

""At the outset, I expressed my anguish and displeasure over the whole matter. No authority can stop inter-caste marriage or intersect marriage.

Nongpok Sanjenbam village, about 15 km east of Manipur's capital city Imphal, is clean, with a lot of greenery. Spread over ten acres of land, a weaving unit and a poultry farm provide employment to most of the villagers.

The village in Imphal East district was mired in poverty, lacking basic facilities. Most of the villagers worked as agricultural laborers. Presently it is a model in development, as it ensures sustained economic growth through various programmes, involving the community.

Bringing community together

Nongpok Sanjenbam has about 135 households, with a population of about 500. It has Khunou, Khullen, Sangsabi and Kambongput colonies. As a pilot, Langei project adopted the Khunou colony. Telem Arunkumar (42), a native of Nongpok Sanjenbam village, who had a successful business in Imphal, returned to his village to develop the same. He brought the villagers together and initiated the Langei project, langei meaning pool of wealth. The motto of the project is 'together we can'.

Initially, many villagers thought that he had an ulterior motive, when he discussed his ideas for developing the village into a sustainable development model. Being a native of the same village subsequently helped him connect with the village administration council and the community. Once convinced, the villagers started participating in the project. The village council donated ten acres of unused community land for the project. The villagers helped the Langei project take off, by helping with all the planning and construction activities.

Weaver women

Around 200 women were at the looms in a huge hall, weaving the phanek, the traditional women's wear, besides other traditional clothes. The women need no training, as they are skilled traditional weavers, their skills having been passed down through generations. Langlei chose loin loom weaving as the primary income generation activity, as the women are adept at weaving on the loin looms. This not only generates income, but revives the traditional weaving, that was slowly disappearing, with the onslaught of modern technologies in weaving.

Moreover, the products are in good demand. ""One phanek fetches around Rs 2,000,"" one of the weavers told VillageSquare.in. Dyeing and making yarn have also been integrated into the weaving unit.

Earlier every household had a loin loom but not now. In the Langei unit, there are more than 150 traditional looms. ""We make about 40 phaneks everyday,"" said Arunkumar. This are sold in and around Manipur, sometimes in other cities as well.

Rearing poultry and cattle

Close to the weaving unit, at the foothills, there is a large pond with about 5,000 ducks. Close by is a chicken farm, where an equal number of chickens are being reared. The farm has separate hatching units with incubators. Every day, the farm supplies about 1,000 eggs to Imphal, bringing sustained income.

The farm provides employment to about 30 villagers. Though most of the villagers are engaged in the Langei works, the project envisages independent economic activity for the men, specifically livestock rearing.

Water and sanitation

The village did not have drinking water facility. At present, a reverse osmosis plant that can treat 2,000 liters per hour supplies drinking water. The water is supplied to every household free of cost.

If a household needs more water, as in the case of functions and the like, a token amount is charged, to prevent misuse. ""This is the first of its kind drinking water supply model in Manipur,"" Arunkumar told VillageSquare.in. In line with Swachh Bharat Mission, residents of Nongpok Sanjenbam village take up sanitation and cleanliness drive voluntarily, in addition to waste management. Biodegradable wastebaskets made of cane and bamboo are kept at roadsides and key places. The village is free of open defecation, claimed Arunkumar.

Safety and security

Nongpok Sanjenbam has a solar street light system in the Khunou colony and the lanes of the village. A total of 350 streetlights have been installed, to ensure safety and security. The street lights have a central control system. ""In villages, people, especially women, do not venture out in the dark , so this helps in better mobility of the villagers,"" said Arunkumar. In order to ensure safety and security, Langei project has installed CCTV cameras in key locations. The village has 32 such CCTVs that monitor the entire village round the clock. This has reduced social ills such as alcoholism, and theft.

Public address system has been installed for communication and information sharing. This is also used for mobilizing the public. A series of loud speakers installed at key locations is connected to the main administrative office. This helps in emergency situations. ""When we observe something unusual in the CCTVs, we make a call through the PA system,"" said Arunkumar.

Social development

Under the Langei project, a Langei Sports Academy has been started. More than 100 youth in the age group of 8-18 years are enrolled in the sports academy, half of them being girls. ""The objective is to nurture young talents,"" Arunkumar told VillageSquare.in. ""All those enrolled in the academy have been adopted by the Sports Authority of India, under their 'Come and Play program'."" Three of the players from the academy play in the under-19, East Bengal football team.

The village has a large playground for the youth. Every day a bus takes the young sportspersons to Khuman Lampak Sports Stadium in Imphal, so that they can hone their skills under expert guidance. Future plans for the village includes a school, a primary health center, a biogas plant and creation ecotourism centers.

In June 2017, when newly-wed Anu­radha reached her in-laws' home in Gajipur village in Bihar's Nawada district, she was shocked to learn that while the family owned a car, they had not built a toilet in their house. Both her father and her husband, Kundan Kumar, a BTech employed in Delhi, had not revealed this fact to her before the wedding.

Forced to defecate in the open, the feisty young woman protested, fought with her husband and shifted to her parent's home until a toilet was built. But her demand faced opposition from the entire village. The aversion to toilets was rooted in the superstition that building a toilet at home would bring misfortune. So much so that the entire village did not have a single toilet. Even the facility at the government primary school had been sealed by villagers with brick and sand.

""In the eighties, two families in the village constructing toilets lost their sons to sudden illness. It created fear that building a toilet would bring misfortune,"" says Shyam Sundar Singh, a villager. ""Then in 2016, the block development officer, Radha Raman Murari, who was motivating villagers to build toilets, met with an accident. This strengthened our fears further.""

The entire village had accepted the 'tradition' of making do without toilets at home. The panchayat had even demarcated open defecation zones for men and women. ""Women had to leave their homes before sunrise, when it's still dark. It was horrible,"" recalls Anuradha.

In August 2017, Kaushal Kumar, a young IAS officer, took over as the district magistrate of Nawada. ""I was surprised to learn about the tradition in the village. But we handled it sensitively as the superstition was strong and deep-rooted,"" he says.

Kaushal visited the village with district officials and interacted with the people. The exercise was done regularly. ""It took a few months to convince villagers to build toilets,"" says Naushad Ahmed Sidiqqui, the block development officer of Akbarpur. Soon, government agencies got involved in the construction of toilets. The first one came up at the house of Anuradha's in-laws in November 2017. Soon all families followed suit. Today, every house in the village has a toilet. Gajipur has been declared open defecation-free."

The practice, especially amid pre-primary admissions, has not gone down well among the city's parents. According to parents, the schools continue to violate rules laid out even by the government in this regard.

Despite a government rule against personal interviews with children during pre-primary admissions, many schools across the city continue with the process, activists working for educational reforms said.

Vijay Kanojia, a parent said, ""My children, who are twins, were interviewed in one of the schools for admission to the pre-primary section. On one hand, we instruct them to not speak to strangers or accept gifts or chocolates from unknown people and on the other hand, schools take them into separate rooms to interact. Kids, who follow parental guidance, might not perform well. Some kids may speak but, some may not. Despite a government ban on such a practice, schools keep on violating the norms.""

Another parent, Sabiha Ghiasi, who recently took her daughter to a school for admission to the pre-primary section, said, ""I wrote to the principal because I shed a few tears after the my daughter's interview. My daughter was ill and yet, was locked up in a room with four strangers. I asked in the e-mail, if they were teachers. They lured her in with the promise of chocolate. This was surprising because, no where did the notice mention that we were to bring our child along after applying for admission. No where did it say there would be an interview for a baby. We heard her wailing through the door, but the staff at the door chose to ignore our concern. This went on for the longest two minutes of our lives. My daughter is two years and four months old. She was sent out later, unceremoniously, like a play thing; and the door was shut again. So, I did a little research and asked my peers if I overreacted. I asked three mothers of school going children if this is the norm in this city. All three of them answered in the negative. I then decided to tell the principal that what they had done was not okay. There was no empathy for my daughter's distress.""

Education expert Swati Popat Vats, President of India's Early Childhood Association, said, ""Schools should have changed themselves by now. Many parents still wonder and worry why schools conduct interviews for young children even though they have an online form submission process."""

TOI had reported on how a stern warning was given to teachers who had not yet joined their new postings about stoppage of entire salary.

Ganar, who is MLC from teachers constituency, jumped to the defence of teachers saying he will not tolerate 'innocent teachers' being victimized. ""I have gone through the regulations and it is crystal clear that the education department has to release salary of all excess teachers. It is also the department's duty to ensure that such teachers find appropriate postings,"" said Ganar.

When TOI pointed out that there are some teachers who are themselves not joining new postings, either because of distance or other issues, Ganar said such claims can't be taken at face value. ""Let the education prove beyond a reasonable doubt that teachers are refusing to join. We hear these loose statements from the officials that teachers are refusing to join duty.

A look at the organisations working to ensure zero food wastage in India","The Financial Express",FALSE,"In a country where around 196 million people remain undernourished, the issue of food wastage is a grave one. But there is hope in the form of a few startups and organisations that are working towards ensuring a 'no-food-waste' future for the country.

According to the United Nations Development Programme, up to 40% of the food produced in India is wasted every year. Reportedly, the quantum of food that Indians waste in any given year is equivalent to the amount of food the UK consumes. These figures are all the more shocking for a nation where millions go hungry every day and many more are undernourished. Food wastage occurs at two stages -- primary and secondary. The primary stage includes wastage of grains and uncooked food, while the secondary stage encompasses throwing away cooked food prepared at mass gatherings, restaurants, households, weddings, etc. Last year, the government's Comptroller and Auditor General found that 4.7 lakh tonnes of wheat -- valued at '700 crore and meant to be distributed among the poor via the public distribution system -- was wasted in Punjab in 2015-16 due to lack of storage facilities. ""Our biggest problem is that we don't know how to manage the glut. I was looking at how the US deals with its surplus. In the past, the US government has bought surplus tomatoes and strawberries from farmers and distributed them in schools. Has that ever happened in our country? Why can't we move our surplus onion/potato production to schools? There has to be a mechanism to facilitate that kind of transfer which is missing,"" says Chandigarh-based agricultural expert Devinder Sharma.

This symbolises a deep problem in a country, where at least 195.9 million people remain undernourished, as per the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation's report titled State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2018. For a developing nation that ranked 100 out of 119 countries on the 2017 Global Hunger Index, the problem of food wastage is one that requires urgent attention. According to a report this year by Boston Consulting Group, by 2030, the annual food loss and waste in the world would hit 2.1 billion tonnes, a staggering increase from the current 1.6 billion tonnes. That wastage would be worth $1.5 trillion against the backdrop of rising inflation, the report adds. ""Food loss and waste are projected to increase in most regions around the world, with a significant spike in Asia in particular,"" the report adds. While the above figures paint a rather grim picture of the world, and specifically India, there is hope in the form of a few startups and organisations that are working towards ensuring a 'no-food-waste' future for the country.

Tech to the rescue

Since the past couple of years, scientists have been working on ways to prevent food wastage. A key, and often ignored, facet contributing to the issue of food wastage is lack of optimum packaging material. Researchers from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, US, have, however, taken a step towards solving that problem by developing 'super slippery' packaging -- it basically enables consumers to squeeze out every last drop of a food product from the package, reducing food wastage, according to a study published this year. ""Small amounts of sticky foods like condiments, dairy products, beverages and some meat products that remain trapped in their packaging can add up to big numbers over time even for a single household,"" the study notes. The hydrocarbon-based polymers used in the packaging are not only very slippery, but also self-cleaning, the study adds.

In addition to scientists, entrepreneurs, too, have invaded the space, developing applications and websites to help restaurants manage their surplus food by making it readily available to those in need. One such initiative has been undertaken by Pune-based Sanjeev Neve, who, in 2016, launched Food Dosti app, a comprehensive zero-food-wastage platform that brings together eateries, customers and non-profits. The app provides partner restaurants a platform to 'publish' information on the surplus food they have. NGOs and non-profit organisations that have signed up get notifications and can then collect the surplus food, depending on their need. The Food Dosti network has partnered with most restaurants in Pune, its base city, and has now also expanded operations to Mumbai, Neve says. Besides, Food Dosti also rewards customers who visit partner restaurants by giving cashback whenever they finish everything that they order. I t also gives customers the option to order partial portions of food to reduce wastage and lets them order the remaining portion free of cost on their next visit to any partner restaurant.

""We are told all our life that we shouldn't waste food, but there is no incentive given for it. So we thought that if we incentivise people for not wasting food, that may attract more active action or cooperation from them,"" says Neve. In the next eight-10 years, he plans to partner with 200 restaurants in each city across the country. According to Neve, the issue of food wastage originates from 'lack of respect' and 'problem of plenty.' ""Food is not respected that much as it is available easily to people with means... if we go a little deeper, it's a problem of plenty,"" says Neve, adding that the government should guide farmers on what proportion of which crop to grow, so that we only have required proportions of everything and massive quantities are not lost in transit.

Community effort

Individuals and communities across the country, too, are working towards bringing about change. Minu Pauline, the owner of Kochi-based Pappadavada restaurant, set up a community fridge in 2016, the first in the country, outside the restaurant premises to provide people a medium to donate. Taking cue, Gurugram-based Rahul Khera, too, installed a refrigerator outside his society last year in Sector 54 with the help of other residents. ""After our initiative, nearly five such societies in Delhi-NCR also installed a refrigerator outside their societies,"" says Khera, an IT professional.

Many first-generation entrepreneurs are also setting up volunteer-led organisations to transport excess food to places and people in dearth. Delhi-based non-profit Feeding India is one such organisation that began operations in April 2014 to work towards the ""cause of hunger and food wastage"". The organisation has partnered with around 3,800 shelter homes across the country where it provides food as an incentive to assist people to get out of the poverty cycle. ""We give food to people in shelter homes as an incentive to come to school or a skill development centre... the aim is to not make them dependent on us giving them food... that way, they won't work... the food is given so that these people get out of the poverty cycle eventually,"" says Srishti Jain, co-founder, Feeding India.

Robin Hood Army, a volunteer-based organisation, is another frontrunner in this domain, helping surplus food reach the needy with the help of volunteers whom it calls 'robins'. While Feeding India is present in 65 cities across the country, Robin Hood Army has its presence in over 80 cities globally. Conceived and conceptualised in 2014 by Neel Ghose, Robin Hood Army has tie-ups with restaurants in cities it is operational in. Ghose was inspired by Portugal's Re-Food Program that has volunteers collecting surplus food from restaurants and distributing it among the needy. Similarly, the 'robins' collect food from the food partners and serve it at shelter homes, bastis, to people living under flyovers, outside hospitals, etc. ""Our mission is simple: eradicate food wastage and world hunger,"" says Aarushi Batra, co-founder, Robin Hood Army.

Another interesting initiative has been taken up by the dabbawallas of Mumbai who are famous the world over for delivering tiffins to around two lakh people daily for the past 125 years. In December 2015, the dabbawallas took up the cause of feeding the needy. Under their 'Roti Bank' initiative, the dabbawallas collect surplus and leftover food from weddings, etc, and give it to the hungry and homeless in Mumbai, feeding roughly 150-200 people everyday.

Not just community organisations, hospitality leaders are also working for the cause. From installing water recycling plants to waste converters, they are doing their bit too. In June 2016, ITC Maurya in Delhi set up an on-site waste recycling plant -- Bio-Urja -- which uses leftover food and minimal water to operate. ""Leftover food from the banquet is used in the plant, which is installed on the hotel premises. The gas from it is used in the employee cafeteria as cooking fuel. Soon, it will be a chain-wide initiative,"" says Manisha Bhasin, senior executive chef, ITC Maurya, Delhi.

Changing mindsets

One of the biggest hurdles, however, that organisations like Feeding India and Robin Hood Army admit to facing while setting up base is to convince restaurants and people to come onboard. ""In India, there is this stigma associated with jhootha khaana (leftover food)... no one wants to donate that,"" says Jain of Feeding India. That, and the problem of lack of awareness, were the biggest hurdles, she says. ""Initially, we faced a lot of problems in convincing people to donate food. There were many big corporates that had excess food and yet were reluctant to donate... now, people have become more aware,"" Jain adds. Batra of Robin Hood Army agrees: ""They (restaurants) weren't sure where the food was going and it took a little bit of convincing and showing them pictures and selfies we took during our drives,"" she adds.

Another challenge they continue to face is the perishable nature of food, especially cooked food that has a higher tendency to turn bad, and hence must be distributed and consumed in a certain time frame. Neve of Food Dosti app has, however, devised a way out. ""We have a contractual obligation with NGOs that whenever they collect food, they must upcycle it within two hours. We also have contracts with restaurants that whatever food they give must stay good for at least six hours,"" he says. ""That gives us enough time to ensure that whatever food is donated is always in a good condition. Also, the non-profit organisations collect food if and only if they have someone to feed right then,"" he adds.

Feeding India, on the other hand, works with the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India to ensure that the food received is fit to be distributed. Even with all the challenges, however, these organisations are going full steam ahead. And they don't just distribute food, they also work towards educating and empowering those at risk. Feeding India, for one, runs a 'Poshan to Paathshala' initiative under which it provides nutritious meals to children during school hours across India, thereby incentivising their attendance at school. They also run awareness workshops, mentoring sessions and computer classes across India for the holistic development of children.

Robin Hood Army, too, started Robin Hood Academy, which provides basic primary education to children it serves food to, in 2016. ""We piloted it in one city and expanded our scope to not just educating, but also facilitating admission for these kids in government schools. The idea went down extremely well with other RHA (Robin Hood Army) cities and now we have academies in over 23 cities with 500-plus kids having been admitted into schools,"" says Batra. They also help the poor get Aadhaar cards and also organise health camps, providing the poor health checkups.

Problem at procurement level

While all these organisations and initiatives are tirelessly trying to curb the food wastage menace in India, one glaring issue that remains largely unchecked is the post-harvest loss of grains. Year-after-year, a large amount of post-harvest produce gets 'ruined' prior to distribution due to lack of proper infrastructure. The Food Corporation of India, the central agency assigned the task of procuring foodgrains from farmers at minimum support price for distribution under the PDS system, has, in fact, faced massive criticism for wastage, misappropriation and fraudulent payments over the years.

From 2012 to 2014, the annual value of harvest and post-harvest losses of India's major agricultural produce was estimated at '92,651 crore (at average annual prices of 2014), according to a 2015 study by the Central Institute of Post-Harvest Engineering and Technology (CIPHET), Ludhiana. Nearly 27% of the cereals -- including paddy, wheat, maize, bajra and sorghum -- were wasted following production (the value of loss stood at '20,698 crore). In the case of pulses, 29% of pigeon pea, chickpea, black gram and green gram (valued at '3,877 crore) were lost at the post-harvest stage. The estimated loss of oilseeds stood at nearly 33% of the total produce. Losses in fruits ranged from 6.7% in post-harvest produce of papaya to nearly 15.88% in guava produce. ""Considerable losses during storage in market channels showed the need for multi-crop storages. Cold chain is essential to reduce the losses of fruits,"" the CIPHET study noted. The study also reported that 7% of poultry meat (valued at '3,942 crore) was lost -- of this, about 60% was lost during storage.

""After the grains reach the mandi is when the real problem begins. Both the private and government sectors are responsible for the losses that occur at that stage,"" says agricultural expert Sharma. ""We have the Agricultural Produce Market Committee and its task is to provide a platform for farmers to sell their produce. If a farmer goes there and finds lack of storage facilities and the grains rotting already, who do we blame? There should be a proper policy in place, delegating duties to the government and private sectors, which has not happened in our country.""

In an August 2016 release, the ministry of food processing industries said it had implemented the schemes of mega food parks, integrated cold chain, value addition and preservation infrastructure and setting up/modernisation of abattoirs to curb losses in the supply chain. ""The mega food parks scheme aims to provide modern infrastructure for food processing units in the country on a pre-identified cluster basis,"" the release noted. ""Under the scheme, grant-in-aid is provided at the rate of 50% of the eligible project cost in general areas and 75% thereof in difficult areas and hilly areas, subject to a maximum of '50 crore per project,"" it added.

As of the other schemes, the aim of modernisation of abattoirs was to provide hygienic finished meat and its products to consumers. ""So far, 41 abattoir projects have been sanctioned,"" the release said. The objective of the cold chain, value addition and preservation infrastructure scheme is to arrest post-harvest losses of horticulture and non-horticulture produce and provide remunerative prices to farmers for their produce. ""The scheme is primarily private-sector-driven and proposals under this scheme are invited through expression of interest,"" the release said.

Union food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, in a recent interview, acknowledged the gravity of the issue of wastage of food grains in the country and called for international collaborations to help tackle it. In India, food gets wasted even before it reaches the plate, she said, as opposed to the West, where wastage occurs at the consumption stage. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, too, signed memorandums of understanding with Denmark (known for its sustainable food practices and reduced food wastage) in the fields of animal husbandry, food safety and agricultural research, with the aim of taking cues from that country and working on its flaws. Time will tell whether these efforts will bear fruit, but for now, a lot needs to be done on this front."

Loan waivers are the new flavour of the season for politicians, the panacea that will win them elections. Typically, they don't address the real problem, just apply band aids to a very deep wound. The reasons for the anguish in rural India are many and vary from region to region: overproduction, lack of market access, the unproductive size of holdings, poor irrigation, drought or badly implemented government schemes. As over 68 per cent of India lives in its villages, the well-being of rural India is crucial to the country. As Mahatma Gandhi said over 80 years ago, ""If the village perishes, India will perish too.""

And the words of the Mahatma are becoming increasingly relevant in today's India, whose people are wrestling with multiple paradoxes. A five-fold increase in grain production since Independence has fortunately consigned famines to the history books. Yet, there's a flip side to grain surpluses-farmer suicides. Government statistics estimate one farmer suicide every half hour over the past two decades. Agriculture is marked by abysmal productivity rates-over 60 per cent of the country is employed in agriculture, but it accounts for only 17 per cent of the GDP. While the cities are growing, rural India is wrestling with agrarian distress and stagnant incomes. The sluggish single-digit growth of rural India's mainstay has fuelled an exodus towards urban areas. Understandably, a majority of rural Indians don't want to be farmers and that's one reason for urban overcrowding.

These are fundamental problems that require enlight­ened leadership and much time to change. However, progress creeps in silently. I've noticed when I travel to the interiors during election time how the crowds in the rallies have changed. They all have footwear, their clothes are not torn, their children look healthier and there are thousands of mobile phones. This was not the case two decades ago. A welter of projects have, over the years, transformed the more than six lakh villages of India, ushering in roads, electricity, irrigation and telecommunication. The telecom revolution has plugged villages into the global mainstream. Rural roads have increased access to quality education and healthcare. One major milestone this April was a government announcement that it had electrified all of India's villages. The latest buzzword is rurban-where the government aims to provide urban-like civic infrastructure to villages.

India Today's 43rd anniversary issue, 'Naya Bharat', tracks some of the most profound economic and development changes sweeping rural India over the past four decades.

We have a cornucopia of stories from rural India. We track the social warriors making a difference across the rural landscape and, in the manner of the Mahatma, leading their communities to self-sufficiency. From the mushroom farmer in Sitamarhi empowering rural women to the engineer from Hyderabad who's pioneered low-cost drinking water solutions. Our section on rural youth icons includes, among others, the patent lawyer from Pune who's GI-tagging fruits and vegetables and the social worker from Jodhpur who is waging a war against child marriage in Rajasthan. Our segment on design and fashion spotlights artists putting issues of caste discrimination and identity on canvas and designers who are redefining rural chic. Our rural sports stars include the heptathlete from West Bengal and the sculler from Nashik.

Our comprehensive rural number crunching throws up interesting trends. There's been an explosive growth in mobile connections, a surge in the dairy, poultry and pisciculture sectors. Primary school enrolment has grown substantially, 90 million rural toilets have enhanced sanitation, and taps and piped water are replacing hand pumps and wells. These are just a few of the changes sweeping rural India.

I must say our correspondents and photographers have done marvellous work in discovering those not-so-well-known individuals who are making a difference in their own and the lives of others around them. These are stories which go beyond the rhetoric of politicians, the apathy of bureaucrats and the incompetence of the government. Stories you are unlikely to have seen anywhere else. Stories that give me hope for a vibrant and progressive India of tomorrow."

Or me. Most urbanites (I grew up in Bengaluru) have had some experience of Bharat-the other 69 per cent of Indians who live in the hinterland. I have vivid memories of visiting my maternal grandfather in Bhagamandala, in the foothills of Talacauvery in Kodagu where the mighty Cauvery bubbles forth as a tiny spring.

From 1965 onwards, I regularly went to Cherangala, his village, to stay with him while he was alive and to pay res­pects at his grave after he died. We had to go by foot to his house from the bus stop in Bhagamandala. It was a five kilometre walk through lush paddy fields bisected by the gurgling Cauvery, which was more of a stream than a river. The house did not have electricity and we lit kerosene lamps at night. Food was cooked using firewood-the akki (rice) rotis baked on them were delicious. We plucked cashew fruit from the garden, roasted the seeds on burning wood and ate the kernel piping hot. We bathed in a pond surrounded by a thatched enclosure. There were no toilets, we took refuge in the nearby bushes, always watching our backs for snakes and other wildlife. It was only in the early 2000s that change became visible in the village. We did not have to walk to the house any more, we could use the motorable road that passed right by it. Electricity poles had come up and, when the lights failed, the hum of gensets echoed across the hills. Houses with thatched roofs were replaced by ones using cement, concrete and tiles. When I last visited two years back, my relatives cooked food using LPG cylinders. The houses had attached toilets and bathrooms with water coming from the taps. Everyone had smartphones and stayed in touch on WhatsApp. They kept abreast of cashew, coffee and cardamom prices in India and the world on the internet. The issues they faced, though, were no different from what my grandfather complained about when he was alive. The price at which they sold the surplus paddy they grew remains unremunerative. Rates for coffee, the main plantation crop, continue to fluctuate widely even as finding labour to tend the plants has got costlier. Loss of tree cover and climate change are making agriculture a risky venture, forcing some members of the family to find work in town and supplement the family income.

TRADITION VERSUS MODERNITY: A farmer couple cultivates land near Udaipur in Rajasthan. (Photographs by Purushottam Diwakar)

Welcome to the New Bharat which, like Kodagu, has experienced transformational change along with extreme contradictions since india today magazine came into existence 43 years ago. Even as it prospered, the countryside experienced equal distress, particularly on the farm front. The paradoxes are evident. In these four decades, the Central and state governments have combined their resources to build a record 30 lakh kilometres of black top roads that now connect the 640,867 villages to the nearest town. By last year, virtually 100 per cent of India's villages had been electrified, and almost 83 per cent of rural households now have electric bulbs lighting up their nights. Under a scheme to provide housing for the needy in villages, 1 crore houses have been built in the past four years, a six-fold annual increase from before. The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has seen over 9 crore toilets being built since 2014 and 5.3 lakh villages have been declared open defecation free. With 5.8 crore new LPG connections given since 2016, cooking gas is fast replacing kerosene stoves and coal- or wood-fired chulhas in kitchens, covering almost 50 per cent of rural households. Mobile phone coverage and usage have reached the poorest of the poor. Joining the white revolution that saw India become the world's largest producer of milk are the silver (poultry) and blue (fisheries) revolutions. And the number of those living below the poverty line (BPL) in rural India has dropped dramatically, from 50 per cent in 1993-94 to 25.7 per cent today.

Yet, even if the transformation has been nothing short of revolutionary in many areas, on key welfare indicators such as health and education and on the economic front, the situation remains grim. While infant mortality levels have dropped significantly since Independence, they are still at a higher level than in neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh. Almost 35 per cent, or one out of three, children in villages still suffer from malnutrition. In education, while enrolment in primary and secondary levels is near universal, dropout rates for high school are extremely high and only 11.6 per cent pursue an undergraduate course. Even for those enrolled in schools, several studies have exposed how poor the standards of learning are. In agriculture, production levels have reached record levels in foodgrains and pulses, making India self-sufficient in food. But this has triggered a problem of plenty that has seen farmers across the country rise up in strong protest against the low returns. Farmer distress is compounded by the huge slowdown in manufacturing and industry in the country. That has resulted in not enough jobs being generated to absorb the underemployed from agriculture. Agricultural workers now constitute 54 per cent of India's total work force, but their productivity is only half that of their urban counterparts.

So, to paraphrase Charles Dickens, it is the best of times for village India and also the worst of times. Why do we still call it Naya Bharat when much of it could still be described as the old India with all its familiar woes? The big difference is that no more are those living in village India willing to resign themselves to their fate. Or depend on doles from the government to lift them out of the abyss. That change is visible, particularly among rural women, who are looking to go beyond being homemakers or work as subsistence farm labourers. In what is possibly the world's largest self-employed movement, over 10 crore women have formed 717,689 self-help groups (SHGs) and now collectively engage in a wide spectrum of economic activity that gives them income and, more importantly, an identity of their own. They organise themselves in clusters to leverage small loans from banks to fund the jobs they are engaged in, whether in livestock management or in tailoring. They have a strong record of repaying loans. And they are bringing about a silent but profound revolution.

All across the country, as India Today correspondents found, there are inspiring examples of how villagers have worked against debilitating odds to bring about change, not only in their lives but for others as well. Ruma Devi, who features on our front cover, got married at the age of 17 with few skills other than stitching and embroidery. To supplement her income, she formed a self-help group to make handicrafts. When its members found that rather than rely on middlemen, they could directly buy their raw material and sell their finished products, they took a bank loan and expanded their business. Ruma Devi then joined an NGO called Gramin Vikas Evam Chetna Sansthan that trained artisans and rose to become its president. It now operates in 75 villages and has trained over 11,000 artisans. Ruma Devi inspired her team members to diversify into making tops, skirts, dupattas and salwar suits using traditional motifs. Their work caught the attention of top designers who have started purchasing the clothes they make. At 30 years of age, Ruma Devi is an outstanding example of the success of empowered women. In the following pages, we feature many more such heart-warming stories.

The recent rising tide of farmers' protests is also an expression of rural self-assertion and awareness. Farmers are now demanding more than band-aid solutions like loan waivers that make them look like villains and benefit only those who can game the system. Their demand is for an INCOME REVOLUTION, not a green, blue or white one. They are not taken in by the promises from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to double farm incomes. They insist on speedy delivery and fundamental reform. They also want ""ease of doing agriculture"" rather than just seeing all the government's concessions go to industry. This tragedy could have been averted if agricultural practices had also seen a paradigm shift with the economic reform process that began in 1991. It didn't happen. Policy-makers continued with the single-minded focus on production and self-sufficiency. They were averse to taking major risks for fear of offending India's largest vote bank. In contrast, China ushered in major reform so that only 18 per cent of its population now is dependent on agriculture as compared to India's 43 per cent.

Among India's follies was the failure to amend the various land acts. As a result, the fragmentation of land holdings has reached critical levels, with a majority of farmers working less than one hectare of land. With no enabling legislation being passed towards easing the land crisis, contract farming, innovative technologies and economies of scale have not taken hold. What was also neglected was agricultural logistics, post-production processing and marketing of products. For instance, the shortfall in cold-chain infrastructure for storage and transport of high-value crops such as fruits and vegetables is anything between 85 and 95 per cent. There were other mistakes. There is a clear need to link agriculture to domestic and industrial consumption and diversify crops based on need. But the mindless focus on foodgrains saw close to 50 million tonnes being stored under the Public Distribution System-more than twice the ann­ual food entitlement of all the BPL families in the country. To cite another example, we need only 25 million tonnes of sugarcane for domestic consumption, but we produce 30-36 million tonnes. Yet, till July this year, government policy restricted its diversion to non-food uses like ethanol production. No matter which party comes to power in 2019, one must hope its manifesto will include undertaking major agrarian reforms to end the farmers' agony.

In the other key areas impacting rural progress, both the Central and state governments have thankfully learnt from past errors. Providing rural housing for the needy is one such. Housing programmes have been around since 1985, but their implementation has been tardy, and corruption rampant. When the NDA government under Narendra Modi came to power, it rev­am­ped the programme and ren­amed it the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana. The size of the houses to be built was increased from 20 square metres to 25 square metres and the grant increased from Rs 70,000 to Rs 1.2 lakh. But what was critical was how corruption was curbed using digital and communications technology. At the time of the payment of the first instalment, the recipient has to upload his photograph along with pictures of the plot of land his house is to come up on. Then, the person has to send photographs of each major stage of construction stipulated to get the next instalment. The subsidy money is transferred directly to the recipient's bank account, ensuring it is not diverted. This has cut down corruption by local officials from 50 per cent to around 12 per cent. It has also seen a record number of houses being built in the past four years. One fallout: with no slush money coming to them, many of the panchayat-level officials are not pushing the programme too enthusiastically.

A DIFFERENT TREATMENT: Patients crowd a makeshift clinic in Patna in Bihar. (Photo: Purushottam Diwakar)

Another welcome development has been the move to integrate the various services under diff­erent schemes. So, under the housing scheme, a person can also avail of the subsidy for toilets under Swachh Bharat, get a cooking gas connection under the PM Ujjwala Yojana and an electricity connection under the rural electrification programme. With all money transfers going to bank accounts, the opportunities for corrupt officials to withhold or divert payments has been dramatically reduced. It remains critical to ensure that, having provided these amenities, the quality of service is not compromised. It is not enough to bring electricity poles to a village, there must also be quality supply of power. In subsidised LPG, cooking refills have to be made easily available and not given as a premium.

In the PM Gram Sadak Yojana, an important innovation is that, apart from building the roads, there is a built-in five-year maintenance contract the constructor has to abide by. He has no choice then but to ensure that good quality material is used for making the road. Some of the other government schemes have provided amazing results in the past too. When M.G. Ramachandran was chief minister of Tamil Nadu in 1982, he introduced the mid-day meal scheme. I had written an article about it for the magazine at the time, dismissing it as a populist scheme. But its impact turned out to be revolutionary. Infant mortality rates in the state began to drop significantly a few years after the scheme was introduced. Then the government cleverly extended it to pregnant mothers who came to drop their children to school. They were not only given a meal package but also medicines to ensure a safe pregnancy. It was followed up with post-natal care and benefits. That saw maternal mortality rates drop perceptibly in the state. And to the astonishment of social planners, Tamil Nadu's total fertility rates began to fall significantly within a decade, reaching levels only achieved by Kerala.

Maternal care has been another success story. When I visited Rajasthan in the 1980s for a health story, only two out of 10 babies born were institutional deliveries. The other eight were delivered at home with the help of the rudimentary equipment used by traditional midwives or dais. Today, eight out of 10 babies in Rajasthan are born under institutional care.

A DIFFERENT TREATMENT: Patients await their turn for free tests at the primary health centre in Bharoti village in Rajasthan. (Photo: Ranjan Rahi)

Yet, while these are laudable success stories, it is not enough for governments to be content with providing the basics alone. In the mid-1980s, the then prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi, launched the rural water mission. The government improved the quality of the hand-pumps being installed and had them mass produced. It then made provisions for speedy boring of wells and installation of pumps. There were still issues as to how many wells had to be sunk in each village, including separate ones for Dalits and Muslims. But it transformed water availability in rural areas where women had to walk long distances to fetch water. I travelled across several states during the great drought of 1987 and found that the hand pumps provided major relief and enabled the Rajiv government to successfully tackle the crisis. While villagers then were willing to gather around hand-pumps to collect water, now they are all clamouring for piped water supply to their homes, having seen their urban counterparts enjoy such facilities. Yet, this is not going to be easy to deliver both in terms of costs and availability. The situation calls for innovative solutions and people's involvement and cooperation to accept and implement them.

There were good reasons why my parents left their respective villages in Kodagu to work for a living in professions other than agriculture. Reasons that continue to send droves of migrants from villages in search of jobs to urban India. For the new Bharat to prosper, there will have to be major reforms in every aspect of the lives of the 83.3 crore who live in it. That remains India's biggest challenge."

It's a nippy evening in Sivagangai. Dark clouds hover over the horizon and a brisk breeze brings a steady drizzle to the ochre-red earth. Off the Madurai-Karaikudi highway, our car trundles on to a dirt track flanked by paddy fields, leading to the village of Kollukudipatti. Soon, an archway with birds drawn on it announces we have reached Vettangudi Bird Sanctuary, confirmed by the cacophony of bird call that rents the air.

Spread over 38.40 hectares, Vettangudi is said to be the oldest bird sanctuary in southern Tamil Nadu, and home to roughly 20 migrant varieties, ranging from the common storks, ibis, grebes, egrets, herons and cormorants to comparatively rarer ones such as the yellow wattle lapwing and lesser whistling duck.

So many birds might not have flocked here were it not for an unusual gesture on the part of the Kollukudipatti villagers.

Some three decades ago, the village decided to stop bursting firecrackers during Diwali. ""We noticed chicks falling out of their nests disturbed by the loud sounds. We discussed it at panchayat meetings and imposed an informal rule forbidding firecrackers,"" says P. Arumugam, former Panchayat president. At first, the youngsters rebelled. But soon, it became a self-imposed habit. ""Today, not not a single person in the village bursts firecrackers,"" says Arumugam.

Just like guests

And the ban is not just for Diwali. Even for weddings, temple festivals or funerals, firecrackers are a big no-no in Kollukudipatti. Most heartening is how even children follow the practice. ""It's the birds that have put our village on the tourism map. We feel proud when foreigners stop by on their way to Karaikudi. The birds are our guests and it's our duty to help them raise their chicks safely,"" says Santhosh, a Class IV student at Singampunari Panchayat Union Government Primary School.

The villagers take turns to stand at the entrance to the sanctuary to greet visitors and guide them. The day we visit, it's the turn of the frail V. Mayavan, 88, who is wrapped in a shawl and standing under a lone banyan tree. Flashing a toothless smile, he asks where we are from, then explains about the sanctuary. ""Please enjoy watching the birds without disturbing them. The chicks are still small,"" he says, before we climb the watch tower on the bund. ""In the absence of the forest guards or wardens, we make sure no intruder reaches the birds,"" he says.

Safe haven

With three big rain-fed tanks and centrally located on the migratory route of birds, Vettangudi is a sought-after nesting point. ""The pocket attracts a wide variety of waders and water birds from September to February,"" says Manivannan, doctor-turned-birder, who lives in Karaikudi.

Now, the birds return to the safe haven of Vettangudi year after year. ""During the annual census five years ago, we counted almost 25,000 birds,"" says Manivannan. This year, the numbers were considerably lower but the poor rainfall might have something to do with that, villagers say. ""Rain has played truant this year, but with the arrival of the birds, we hope to get some good showers in the coming months. In September, we had huge flocks, but quite a few of them left within a week,"" says Mayavan.

All's not well yet. A monkey menace has recently begun, with some 30 of them taking up residence in the village. ""When the waters in the tank recede, they cross over and climb up the trees in the middle and feed on the eggs,"" says Arumugam. ""The monkeys should be translocated.""

Realising how much the villagers have contributed to conservation work, the Forest Department distributes sweets during Diwali, besides fruit trees, tree guards and RO plants. An eco-tourism project is also on the anvil. ""We plan to train villagers as eco-guides to ensure local participation and generate income for them,"" says Nihar Ranjan, Conservator of Forests, Virudhunagar Circle."

Furthermore soon after the incident was reported, several children in Classes 2, 3 and 4 began to vomit.

Immediately they were rushed to the local Primary Health Centre where they were treated for food poisoning. Accordingly Karnataka Food Commission had stated that Akshaya Patra's food was bland and monotonous as they did not use onion and garlic in the meals. Reportedly this had led to children not eating the food and the commission had also noted that Akshaya Patra was not providing an adequate quantity of food as prescribed by the Karnataka government.

Earlier on Wednesday, the state food commission had met with representatives of Akshaya Patra in Bengaluru. Krishnamurthy, the Chairman of the Food Commission said ""Akshaya Patra representatives said that they would find nutritional replacements for onion and garlic. They denied allegations of the food being bland. The government is testing the food quality and taste in every district. Once the test results are out, we will know how to proceed further"".

It was a solo trek, and on the third day, she began to face extreme difficulty breathing and walking. The low oxygen in the altitudes as high as 16,100 feet had given her Pulmonary Edema.

She needed to rest, and with the help of two passing trekkers, she decided to spend the night at a remote village --

""A village which has no road access, is reachable only after a day's walk, and one which boasted of just one home with three occupants. I had neither medicines, nor the ability to call my family, nor access to medical care,"" says 50-year-old Sahu, a resident of Gurugram.

The first primary school -- Sku-Kaya -- had five students and two teachers. It had two rooms which were being rebuilt. While one teacher had stayed in the village, the other had gone to Leh to get uniforms and mid-day meal supplies for the school.

The second school had eight children and three teachers. It was two of them who had stopped to help Sahu when she was feeling sick. They had been walking back to Leh for textbooks and uniforms

The children were being taught from English books, which was very alien to them as they had no electricity or TV or telephone connectivity and thus, had no idea what the outside world was like. Having never set foot out of their villages, the exposure level of these children was very low.

.In Ladakh, even the summer months were bitingly cold but that didn't stop the kids from coming to school to learn. ""One of the children even brought his little brother along, who was barely two years old and the love and care with which all the children and the teacher took care of the child was a lesson for me,"" says Sahu.

What really hit her on that fateful Ladakh trip was the sheer drive of the Ladakhi people there to keep growing and improving their circumstances.

""Their determination to come to school and learn, the eagerness of the teacher to learn something new to teach his students, and the aspiration of the parents to educate their children was my inspiration to drop everything and help these amazing people,"" says Sahu.

From a regular school teacher to Ladakh's 'Iron Lady'

""My experience with the schools in Ladakh gave me a path to follow, one that I knew I could contribute to,"" says Sujata Sahu, who had spent 12 years in the corporate world before starting to work with children.

But she had been working at the Shri Ram School for just two years at the time, and leaving this job was the hardest decision she had to make in her life.

""I was planning to take on a seemingly herculean task, in possibly one of the toughest terrains of the world. I had no idea about where I would get the funds from and was also not very clear on how much of an impact I alone could make,"" she says.

Moreover, no one had done something like this before her in Ladakh. But thankfully, she found with herself two strong founding partners -- her husband, Sandeep Sahu, who had been trekking in the region for almost 35 years, and Dawa Jora, a Ladakhi businessman, all of whom had the strong conviction that something like this was really needed for the region.

In 2011, unable to find other NGOs to partner with, the three founders went on a three-day trek to one of the most isolated villages in Lingshed (in Ladakh), carrying 1500 kg of education material on 25 horses, and crossing three mountains at extreme temperatures as low as minus 15 degrees.

The treacherous and steep pass they crossed at an altitude of almost 17000 ft inspired the name of the '17000 ft foundation'.

As she started off on her mission to provide Ladakh schools with the right resources to further the education of their students, she realised this wouldn't be very easy.

""One of our biggest challenges was convincing corporates that even remote areas with extremely scattered and small populations needed support,"" says Sahu.

For the first two years, the foundation worked only with the founders' own funds and kind contributions of friends and family members.

""Though no non-profit organisations were willing to take on Ladakh as a region, we were given support in the form of knowledge, pedagogy and even a large donation of books for our first 100 libraries,"" she says.

Sujata Sahu's undying passion to help the people of Ladakh earned her the nickname of the 'Iron Lady'.

How Ladakh poses a unique set of education problems

India is a geographical anomaly as it has every type of topographical setup, each of which comes with its own challenges. This makes it extremely difficult for the government to cater to every type of problem that can arise in this vast country owing to accessibility issues, extreme weather conditions etc.

Ladakh has almost a 1000 schools across Leh and Kargil, spread across 60,000 sq km of harsh mountains. Catering to a school going population of under 40,000 children, the average school strength of these schools is barely 25 students across the two districts, explains Sahu.

Teachers themselves come from remote villages and have to travel long distances for training, school supplies and even basic administrative functions, leading to long absences and shortage of staff, she adds.

Also, ""While teachers are given basic residential training during winters as well as in-service training, most of the trainings are not contextualized for the uniqueness of the Ladakhi education system,"" she says.

The extreme weather also adds to the problems with schools being shut for severe winters for three months in a year when the roads become inaccessible due to thick snow and temperatures as low as minus 35-40 degrees.

""Incredibly, despite the remoteness of the region, every little hamlet which has even 10 school going children has a tiny government school with teachers in attendance, thanks to the local administration. A little wonder then, that 89% of the schools in Ladakh are govt schools with the private schools present in just a handful of the larger villages,"" she says.

""What is commendable is that all these 900 plus schools are functional and have qualified teachers in attendance. What is even more remarkable is that every child in every village goes to school, managing to at least complete middle school,"" Sahu adds

However, it is only the larger villages which have middle schools and after passing class 5, children have to walk around two hours to get to school to continue their education. Public transport isn't available in such terrain and the army provides army vans for commuting.

.Despite the presence of these govt schools, the community here wants a better life and quality education for their children so they can get better jobs. This aspiration makes them send their very young children, often as young as three years old, to be enrolled in private schools, often extremely far away from their homes.

""Cut off from their villages and parents for months in a year, these children grow up in dormitories, hostels or with other families. Lacking the care and guidance they need in their growing up years, this leads to large-scale dropouts and a population of youth who are unable to go back to their villages,"" Sahu explains.

17000 ft works in these remote villages by improving existing govt schools so that parents would have faith in them and stop sending their children away so far that it disconnects them from their roots.

How voluntourism is helping 17000 ft foundation grow

Sujata Sahu started her non-profit organisation with just the founders and a few volunteers who were given the task to survey the entire length and breadth of Ladakh.

The team mapped around 600 schools after a seven-month-long study. Some of these schools had been bomb shelters during the Kargil war and the buildings had to be shifted multiple times.

The success of the volunteer programmes helped the foundation grow and each of these schools has been geo-mapped for travellers to find.

""We, very early on, piloted our volunteering programmes to involve outsiders in the work of our organization and to also understand if people could be encouraged to donate to such a cause. The enthusiasm and support shown by complete strangers told us that we were on the right track,"" says Sahu.

""Our volunteers, who are our brand ambassadors, then carried the story of our work into their workplaces and CSR then became our main source of funding. Voluntourism, as it is called today, still forms a good 25% of our annual budget and helps us maintain our backend costs,"" she adds.

Why playgrounds are so important in Ladakh schools

Though the govt schools all over Ladakh have proper buildings, they lack the proper facilities that make a school a happy, joyous and welcoming place for children. And in a remote location with rugged ground, a playground comes as a blessing.

""In these remote villages, where nothing is available, there are absolutely no options for children to play with. Though these schools have well-qualified teachers and very low pupil-teacher-ratio, parents often judge the performance of a school based just on the facilities they provide,"" says Sahu.

Thus, parents see the existence of a playground in govt schools as a very good incentive to not send away their kids to far-off private schools.

""Today, 17000 ft foundation has setup playgrounds in 140 schools with colourful swings, slides, see saws etc. many of which the team had to carry over horseback for days to reach our remotest schools,"" she says.

Solving the problem of no native language storybooks in Ladakh

A big aspect of Ladakh education that surprised Sujata Sahu was how the kids learned in English medium schools even though they have no exposure to the foreign language. Their native language was Bhoti.

""To add to this burden, children also have to study their local language as well an additional Hindi/Urdu from grade 1,"" says Sahu.

To enable the children to read better and get comfortable with the number of languages they have to deal with, 17000 ft set up libraries in 230 schools with simple and easy to read story books in English, Hindi and Urdu.

""However, sadly, there are absolutely no story books in Bhoti for children to read. Sensing this gap, we undertook a mission to translate storybooks from English to Bhoti.""

""In 2015, we launched our first phase where we translated 21 titles and published 21,000 storybooks for distribution into 300 schools,"" says Sahu.

This year again, the organisation not only translated another 20 titles, but also added illustrations and changed narratives to make them more relatable to the children of Ladakh.

What has 17000 ft foundation achieved so far?

In the span of just six years, Sujata Sahu's organisation has accomplished much.

""Today, 17000 ft works with 250 govt schools across Leh and Kargil and we are already seeing a reverse trend of children coming back from private schools back to the govt schools in their villages,"" says Sahu.

The organisation has set up libraries in 230 schools, playgrounds in 140 schools, and trained over 1500 teachers in various methodologies with a team which is in Ladakh every winter for training teachers.

17000 ft foundation has conducted multiple community workshops in 125 villages with over 10,000 villagers contributing to our workshops and programmes in the schools.

Recently, the organisation electrified and digitized 120 schools in Leh and Kargil, providing solar electricity and tablets with customized digital learning content, a TV, and a server to provide offline data syncing.

The DigiLab project is the non-profit's most ambitious programme bringing offline hybrid digital learning solutions to the remote villages.

The well-furnished digital labs supported by workshops from the team throughout the year can help the students learn independently with guidance from their teachers.

How crowfunding is helping 17000 ft foundation

Crowdfunding is increasingly coming up as a very important resource collection measure.

""17000 ft has been involved with ImpactGuru.com in multiple projects, the latest being the funding of a Playground for a very remote school in Kargil. We had also fundraised for our Bhoti Book Translation project through ImpactGuru.com and managed to raise more than we needed,"" says Sahu.

Fundraising platforms are great for helping nonprofits fund small projects that have tangible goals and timelines. It is an excellent way to help get the word out to potential supporters and garner more support for the non-profit, says the Iron Lady of Ladakh.

Future of 17000 ft foundation

Before 17000 ft was established, there was little or no attention on the remote schools of Ladakh, and today with all our work and efforts and the participation of the local communities, govt schools are looking and performing better and we are seeing a reverse trend of children coming back to their villages and govt schools.

""When we started, one of our biggest challenges was encouraging donors, volunteers, foundations and even corporates to focus on remote regions of Ladakh. Today, however, we are confident that our model is working and we can get the support we need,"" beams Sahu.

Sujata Sahu now wants to take this model to other remote and mountainous regions, like Arunachal Pradesh, or the remote areas of Himachal.

""We feel that we are closer now to our vision of a better life and education for all children, regardless of geography or terrain,"" she says.

""Education is getting commercialised. The government educational institutions are getting neglected. Government institutions lack basic amenities and teaching staff. Primary school teachers have been burdened with too much work. They don't even have time to take classes. The quality of education has come down.

The song Mere Naam Tu, from the recently released Shahrukh Khan starrer Zero is an exception though. A well-known name in the South Indian film music industry, for Bollywood, Abhay Jodhpurkar is a fresh voice.

Though his debut in Hindi films is with a movie named Zero, all his firsts have been with or for all Numero Uno. Have a look at his trajectory and you would what the above statement means. His first ever song was with the Mozart of Madras, AR Rahman. His first song in Hindi films was with the much sought after Ajay-Atul. The cherry on the top was his first ever Hindi film song was pictured on the king of romance, Shahrukh Khan. Could it get better? Actually no and he agrees. ""I have been very blessed. I don't believe in coincidences but in destiny yes! All this was destined and I am glad it happened"", says Abhay.

Abhay shared that he has always been in music, ""My father made sure, I listened to Hindustani Classical Music and being a Maharashtrian, Natya Sangeet was a part of my growing up too. My parents wanted music to be my primary focus, however, I wanted to study further. Thus, I moved to Chennai. The scene in Chennai was different, as the music took predominance and studies were secondary. I was exposed to Carnatic music and work of music composers like Illayraja and A R Rahman."" Needless to say, he was blown away.

While he continued to study Biotechnology, he also enrolled at KM Music Conservatory, a music school headed by A R Rahman. ""There, once I got an opportunity to sing a few lines of a qawalli in front of Rahman sir. He really liked it. Later, he signed me for my first Tamil song, Moongil Thottam from the movie Kadal.""

Since, then there has been no looking back for this youngster. He has sung for the four major South Indian languages like Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil and Telugu, along with his mother tongue Marathi.

""It is quite a challenge to sing in all the languages. Especially Malayalam, as it is known to be the toughest language. I sang a few tracks in Marathi cinema, as I knew some people there.""

The question remains, what took him so long to debut in Hindi and he says, ""It was about the right opportunity. Previously, Rahman sir tried to launch me a couple of times in Hindi and even recorded my scratch versions, but somehow it didn't work out. Also, I was so busy in Chennai recording for Tollywood, which delayed my debut here.""

As they say, it's about the right time and right opportunity and so Zero happened. ""I had done a cover of a multi-lingual medley of songs, in which there was a part where I sang Jeev Rangala Dangala from the movie Jogawa, composed by Ajay Atul. They happened to hear it and loved it too. Since then we were looking for the right opportunity to work with each other. Then they recorded my scratch version for this song. Thankfully, it suited SRK's voice and my version was retained,"" he adds.

Speaking about Ajay-Atul, Abhay says, ""I have always loved their music. I remember listening to their songs on repeat. There is a spiritual connection that I find in their music. ""

Abhay is a talent that has had the opportunity to work in South Indian films as well as Bollywood and with the bests from both the industries. He is happy to work in both industries and observes the similarities and differences, ""The overall work vibe is the same in both the industries. But South Indian industry is more disciplined and professional. Be it punctuality or payments, South Indian industry is very particular. In Mumbai, it is very relaxed and chilled. However, it is great fun to work in both.""

While he is still taking in all about the Bollywood culture, it is surreal for him that he is the voice for SRK's new romantic track. ""It is surreal to say the least. I have literally grown up singing his hit numbers. Be it Kal Ho Na Ho or Mitwa. It is funny, but my friends used to actually call me Mitwa, because no matter which competition or singing opportunity I got, I used to only sing the song Mitwa."" And now here he is singing one of the most romantic tracks of 2018.

The compliments and congratulatory messages haven't stopped. However, the two compliments that he cherishes the most are the ones from his mentors and other form his most favorite singer Shreya Ghoshal. ""Recently, on Rahman sir's show ARRived, Ajay-Atul were the guests. It was really nice to know that all three of them discussed about me on the show. It felt great.""

About Shreya, he can't stop gushing, ""She is my most favourite. Personally, I think in the history of singers, who have sung multi-lingual songs, especially those in South Indian languages, there is no parallel to Shreya Ghoshal. She has done justice to all her South Indian songs like no other singer has. Therefore, when she retweeted my cover of her Malayalam song, Shalabhamay and said good work on this and Mere Naam Tu, I was on cloud nine,"" says Abhay.

We will have to wait to hear more of Abhay's voice in Bollywood."

The Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ranchi, will evaluate the merger of primary schools in Jharkhand. The state education department has roped in the institute for a detailed study of 4,600 merged schools to find out if the reorganisation has brought about any improvement or not, department officials said.

State education secretary AP Singh said, ""IIM Ranchi would see if the reorganisation has brought any benefits for students as well as the education system. It would also evaluate if the initiative brought about any improvement in the education of those students who were shifted to other schools in the merger process,"" he said. ""We have sought a financial proposal from the institute for the study.""

The reorganisation exercise of schools had also caught the interest of IIM Bangalore, which expressed its willingness to carry out a study on the process and its benefits, said the secretary.

Merging schools with low enrolment is an exercise that has been undertake by Rajasthan and Jharkhand in the country with the support of the Union government and NITI (National Institution for Transforming India) Aayog, the policy think tank of the Government of India. Jharkhand started the merging procedure in 2016-17.

Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) director Uma Shankar Singh said that there were 39,600 schools in 2016-17 under the education department in Jharkhand. ""Of them, 18,000 schools had 60 or fewer students. These schools had an average of one or two teachers per school. Providing quality education was a major challenge. One teacher was handling four-five classes at a time. How could one expect a better education in these schools?"" he said.

The council said that a four-step process -- field inspection; cross-district verification; block and district consultation; and final notification -- was undertaken to merge the schools.

Singh said that 98% students from the 4,600 primary schools had been shifted and 96% of the students had expressed satisfaction with the consolidation. ""We faced difficulty in shifting 150 schools due to some technical reasons. Now, the issue has been resolved, and students from 120 schools have been shifted,"" he said.

The reorganisation of primary schools benefited seven lakh students, giving them better teacher availability, and cut the requirement of 4,500 teaching positions. The merger process saved the government Rs 400 crore by reducing teaching positions and infrastructure requirements, said JEPC officials. The officials added that the funds thus saved would be spent on strengthening the education infrastructure of the merged schools."

Each year on the 22 December, schools and educational institutes around the country observe and celebrate National Mathematics Day.

And while not everyone feels the need to celebrate mathematics, the day is observed not to honour the field as a whole, but a very special Indian mathematician whose trust with mathematics has inspired books, art and our tradition to commemorate the genius of Srinivasa Ramanujan on 22 December each year - his birth anniversary - as National Mathematics Day.

Born in 1887 in the charming city of Erode, Tamil Nadu, Ramanujan's earliest stories begin around the age of 12. He had mastered the dizzying logic of trigonometry and developed theorems on his own without any assistance.

His passion for mathematics and the brilliance of the world it translated to at an early age.

The wiz kid

Turning 10 years old in 1897, he aced his primary school exams in English, Tamil, geography and arithmetic with the best scores in his district. Ramanujan entered Town Higher Secondary School that year, where he encountered formal mathematics for the first time.

By age 11, he had exhausted the mathematical knowledge of two college students lodging at his home, and was lent a book on advanced trigonometry around the same time. He mastered this by age 13, by which time he was discovering sophisticated theorems on his own.

Ramanujan at 14 was being lauded with merit certificates and academic awards in a trend that weaves through his entire school career, where he also assisted the school with logistics of placing 1200 students, each with needs of their own, under the tutelage of its 35-odd teachers.

He would complete mathematical exams in half the allotted time, and unwittingly brought on comments from his peers over the years, who ""rarely understood him"" and ""stood in respectful awe"" of him in the years since.

Awakening the genius

Ramanujan at age 16 in 1903 got access to a library copy of a book - A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics, a collection of 5,000 mathematical theorems, which he reportedly studied in great detail. This book is generally acknowledged by accounts of his life as a key element in awakening his genius.

Towards his schooling's end, this earned him a scholarship to study at the Government Arts College of Kumbakonam in Tamil Nadu. His headmaster in school would introduce Ramanujan as ""the outstanding student who deserved scores higher than the maximum"". But he squandered the opportunity due to his horrendous performance in other important subjects, including English, philosophy and Sanskrit.

Without a formal degree, Ramanujan is said to have dropped out of college and pursued research in mathematics on his own, living in stark poverty, at the brink of starvation. It was in 1910 at age 23 that support from renowned mathematician Ramaswamy Iyer helped him scored a job clerking at the Madras Port Trust.

Cambridge calling

He would work at the office by day, and do what came naturally to him (theoretical mathematics, that is) in his spare time. British mathematician G Hardy wrote Ramanujan a letter in 1913, expressing interest in learning more about his work. It was ""essential that I should see proofs of some of your assertions"", he is said to have added.

Ramanujan responded to Hardy, who eventually became his mentor, on principles of mutual interest to them, saying:

""I beg to introduce myself to you as a clerk in the Accounts Department of the Port Trust Office at Madras... I have no University education but I have undergone the ordinary school course. After leaving school I have been employing the spare time at my disposal to work at Mathematics. I have not trodden through the conventional regular course which is followed in a University course, but I am striking out a new path for myself.""

G Hardy and Ramanujan ended up working together in Cambridge for five years shortly after their first correspondence. Their collaboration was a clash of different cultures, beliefs, and working styles, but his work in Mathematics made a left a deep impression on Hardy for years to come. Hardy was quoted to have said about Ramanujan in a book:

""He could remember the idiosyncrasies of numbers in an almost uncanny way. It was Littlewood (a mutual colleague) who said that every positive integer was one of Ramanujan's personal friends. I remember once going to see him when he was ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an unfavorable omen. ""No,"" he replied, ""it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.""

A self-made luminary

Born to a housewife and a sari clerk, his family home in Kumbakonam was small and modest. The modest thatched-roof house on Saranhapani Sannidhi Street has been turned into a museum in his honour.

Ramanujan was a self-taught mathematician. He contributed inordinately to the world of mathematics, and was globally popular - one of the most influential mathematicians of his time. From compiling over 3900 mathematical theorems and equations to having discoveries and streets named after him, his assertions in mathematics were unshakeable and profound to others researching mathematics."

In March, the scientific world lost one of its brightest minds in the form of cosmologist and theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking. But this was also the year scientists discovered a new cell (rosehip neuron) in the human brain. Space agencies worldwide took big steps to know more about the origins of Mars, while India laid out a blueprint for its second lunar exploration mission in 2019 and its first manned space mission by 2021.

The use and reach of artificial intelligence in our daily lives was a point of contention yet again. Gene editing -- its ethics and practicality -- remained in the spotlight, while the battle between what is fact and what is fake news continued. As expected, a lot of these issues and developments will continue to simmer and trickle into the new year. Here's a quick look at some of the biggest moments in 2018 from the field of science and technology.

Since 1889, the kilogram has been defined by a piece of platinum-iridium -- the international prototype of the kilogram -- at the headquarters of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in France. The prototype, despite being in a glass case, attracts dust and needs to be cleaned, and this handling affects its mass. In November, scientists met at the General Conference on Weights and Measures in Versailles, France, and voted to change the definition of a kilogram, tying it to a universal constant in nature, the Planck constant, measured using a machine called the Kibble balance. The change will be effective from 20 May.

In October, Donna Theo Strickland, a Canadian optical physicist, became the third woman ever to win a Nobel prize in Physics, joining an illustrious list that includes Marie Curie (1903) and Maria Goeppert Mayer (1963). Strickland shared the prize with her doctoral advisor Gérard Mourou (and Arthur Ashkin for his unrelated research on optical tweezers). Strickland and Mourou's work on chirped pulse amplification (CPA) -- it creates short and intense laser pulses -- has vital applications, including laser eye surgery and laser therapy for cancer. Doctors have already used it to perform millions of corrective laser eye surgeries.

In August, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) finally announced its policy on the use of drones or remotely piloted aircraft systems in India, specifying five categories based on weight. All civil drone users will have to acquire the unmanned aircraft operator permit. The policy that came into effect on 1 December says drones can only be operated within the ""Visual Line of Sight (VLOS), during day time only, and upto maximum 400 ft altitude""; it also lays down guidelines on their use near airports and eco-sensitive zones. The Digital Sky portal was launched soon after, where users can obtain permissions to fly drones.

The Facebook-Cambridge Analytica debacle

Facebook was caught in a massive international data scandal involving the now defunct UK-based political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica when it came out that raw data of up to 87 million Facebook user profiles was harvested by Cambridge Analytica. Things went from bad to worse for Facebook over concerns that this personal data was used to influence the course and outcome of the 2016 US Presidential elections and the Brexit vote. By the end of March -- almost two weeks after the privacy data scandal was initially exposed -- Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized for it by bringing out full-page advertisements in prominent US and UK dailies. ""This was a breach of trust and I'm sorry we didn't do more at the time,"" Zuckerberg wrote. Currently, Facebook is in the eye of the storm again after The New York Times reported that the social media giant had shared user data with more than 150 companies, among them Netflix and Spotify, including, possibly, users' private messages.

Apple and Google spent this year trying to outdo each other. While the latter released the successor to its Pixel 2 smartphone, Apple launched much-awaited, upgraded models. The company's smartphone line-up for the year included the iPhone XR (starting from ₹76,900), XS and XS Max. Google introduced the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL. Both companies released a host of other products at their flagship events, but it was the smartphones that made headlines. Simultaneously, the OnePlus 6 and 6T, Huawei's P20 Pro and Mate 20 Pro, and Samsung's Galaxy S9 presented quite a challenge to the Pixels and iPhones of 2018.

The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) made significant strides this year. Apart from launching the heaviest satellite it has ever built -- the GSAT-11 -- in December, the space agency successfully launched the PSLV-C43 mission with 30 international co-passenger satellites on board in November. On the November mission, PSLV's 45th flight, the primary satellite was the Hyperspectral Imaging Satellite (HysIS), an earth observation satellite built by Isro. According to the space agency's website, data from the satellite will be used for a variety of applications, including agriculture, forestry and monitoring soil.

The most fascinating discovery about the human body this year was the identification of the interstitium -- a network of ""fluid-filled spaces"" in ""connective tissues all over the body"". The findings of the study, co-led by scientists of the New York University School of Medicine, were published in March in the journal Scientific Reports. The interstitium had remained undetected for years because of the way tissue samples were studied and were believed to be a ""wall of collagen"". Researchers used a new imaging technique to study living tissue samples, instead of fixed tissue that has been drained of fluid, which led to this discovery."

This is forcing the schools to discontinue the admissions of a few students from the Open category.

Even as admissions for pre-primary sections began in October, many schools in the city are not assuring promotion to selected children from senior kg to the 1st grade. As a result, aggrieved parents are running from one school to another to seek admission for their children.

A parent from South Mumbai said, ""Earlier, the school would give admission forms which the parents would take home to fill them up and submit the next day. But, now the schools are asking parents to fill the forms the same day in the school itself, and return them immediately. This is all because they don't want parents to click pictures of the admission forms and send it to the media to expose them. The schools are mentioning in the forms that there's no guarantee of a child getting promoted to class 1. When we went to one of the South Mumbai schools to fill the form, we saw read this and were very disappointed.""

Jayant Jain, president of Forum for Fairness in Education, said, ""Most of the schools still don't guarantee admission of children in class 1 after taking them in pre-primary as they wanted to conduct fresh admissions in class 1 and also fill the 25 per cent quota under RTE. But this is all wrong and this practice should be stopped. Parents first have to buy so many admission forms and spend so much money on them and the prospectus, and yet they have to be insecure about their child's admission.""

Experts say most schools, in order to fill the 25 per cent quota under the Right To Education, do not guarantee admissions to kids to the 1st grade despite granting them seats in kindergarten"

The Gurugram police said that they would launch a probe the allegations.

A few students also complained about men lurking outside their school and harassing them on their way home after the classes daily.

Rocky Mittal, the programme director of the government reform programme 'Ek aur Sudhaar', visited the school for an inspection on Friday and asked the girls about their problems.

Three students of Class 6 told him that the teacher of the primary school, located across the road from the girls' school, used to sexually harass them around a year ago.

""A number of girls started crying when they were asked about their issues. Even the teachers admitted how they have seen the girls being subjected to harassment by miscreants outside the school. The girls also named a teacher of the nearby school, saying he would harass them under the pretext of free tuitions,"" said Mittal.

Under the Ek aur Sudhaar project, Mittal has visited schools in 15 districts, including Gurugram, so far. Police said that they would look into the complaints. ""No formal complaint has been filed in the matter and the harassment of school girls is not restricted to one teacher. Students complained that they were being harassed on a daily basis, especially on their way home after school,"" said a senior police officer. The accused teacher, police said, had been posted with the neighbouring school for two years but the school authority was unaware of the girls' ordeal.

Like an imminent surgery, an election has a way of crowding out all thoughts from the mind and turning the focus of politicians to populism and free giveaways, forgetting the difficult job of economic and governance reform. The results of the latest state elections have reminded us that Indians are by nature sceptical and not shy to change their leaders. The grand certainties of 2014 have suddenly become the grand doubts of 2019.

From earliest times, the Indian temper has been comfortable with uncertainty, beginning with ambiguity over how the cosmos was born in the famous Nasadiya verse in the Rig Veda and the doubting neti, neti ('not this, not that') method of Advaita. I believe our questioning nature is a strength in building citizenship and democracy. Unfortunately, our educational system, instead of nourishing inquiry, does everything possible to kill it through a rote learning system. The ascendance of technology, engineering and 'useful subjects' has displaced the old-style liberal education that promoted inquisitiveness. A few excellent private liberal arts and sciences institutions are coming up, and they offer some hope for the future. Most of the older ones have faded into mediocrity.

In these times when 'liberal' has acquired a bad odour, it is worth reminding ourselves that it shares a root with 'liberty'. Liberal education is a method of learning rather than mastery of specific content, teaching one to reason and providing the confidence to judge for oneself. A liberal education befits a free human being, one who is capable of governing himself and participating in collective self-government. This ability translates at election time in distinguishing a charlatan from a sensible and sincere candidate. In the recent elections, it would have exposed the disastrous idea of farm loan waivers which rewards defaulters and punishes honest farmers, aside from bankrupting the states' treasuries, leaving no money for real agricultural reform.

If a liberal education is not only about book learning but an approach to learning, any subject - even manual labour - could be part of the curriculum, and help shrink some of our caste prejudice against working with our hands. When we study something for its own sake, it reinforces our early curiosity as children and builds upon our civilisation's ancient sceptical temper. Indeed, an interrogation of the Upanishads and the epics with a modern mind can be as valuable as reading Homer, Shakespeare and Marx.

A liberal education can also help to raise the tone of our political discourse that has plunged to great depths in recent years. All parties were responsible for the shameful lack of civility in the recent elections. Rahul Gandhi contributed to it with his persistent 'chowkidar chor hai' with regard to the Rafale fighter deal. He did not censure his functionaries who made obnoxious remarks about Modi's mother's age or cast aspersions on his father. It is to Rahul's credit that he apologised for a former minister's insulting reference to Modi's occupational caste. Earlier references to 'maut ka saudagar' by Sonia Gandhi were equally 'uncivil'.

BJP is no better. Modi has been guilty of uncivil language about the dynasty. A Gujarat minister falsely accused the late Verghese Kurien of diverting funds from Amul to Christian missionaries. Modi did not repudiate this aspersion on a bureaucrat who has made India the world's largest milk producer. All parties, especially AAP and Shiv Sena repeatedly abuse opponents - for example, ""son of Khilji"" is a sickening reference to Rahul's foreign origins.

A liberal education is beneficial in cultivating the habit of respectful engagement in a community, dedicated to finding workable answers rather than resorting to insulting innuendos about the ethnic identity of opponents. It also leads generally to a centrist position in politics, eschewing the extreme right and left. The political centre is accommodative, tends to harmonise social and cultural contradictions and appeals to the average voter, especially the minorities. Hence, most elections in India since Independence have been won by moderate candidates. Even the Modi wave in 2014 was the result of Modi adopting a centrist promise of vikas and jobs, which attracted the aspirational, young voter. It is quite another matter that the promise has not been fulfilled and Modi is a worried man today.

Finally, approaching education in a liberal manner can also make us better human beings. By freeing us from the demands of getting a job and making a living, it offers the freedom to reflect upon existential questions of who we are and why we are here. It turns our attention away from ourselves to our place in the world, making us see that we are part of something larger than ourselves. This 'self-forgetting' is always good for building character. When combined with action and experience, it leads to prudence (phronesis) as Aristotle suggested - to do the right thing to the right person, at the right time, in the right manner, and for the right reason.

But how can a poor or middle class Indian family afford the luxury of not preparing its children for a job? Surely, a four-year undergraduate American liberal education is a luxury that most Indians cannot afford. Indeed it can, if you view liberal education not as content but as an approach to learning; it should begin in primary school and go right through postgraduate education. Liberal education is not an end but a means to prepare a young person to become a thoughtful member of society. It does not exist in isolation from making a living or becoming a good citizen. It merely reminds us that there is more to life than consumption and production."

Of the more than 20,000 houses in the Perumbakkam TNSCB tenements, over 13,000 have been allotted. Officials estimate there are over 8,000 children and of this, around 3,000 are studying in schools in and around the colony.

However, in order to get an exact figure of the number of school going children and to find out their needs, the school education department is conducting the survey.Over 160 teachers will take part in the survey exercise that will start at 8.30 a.m. The TNSCB has requested at least one member of the family to stay at home. ""The teachers will go door-to-door to find out the number of children and if they are going to school. They will also understand the needs of the children including the medium of education they prefer and what is lacking in the schools in the colony,"" said an official from the school education department.

Based on the survey, the School Education Department will conduct a meeting and decide upon amenities in the schools and upgrading the existing ones. Proposals for the same would be sent to the government.

""We have directions from the government to start a primary school immediately, if necessary. If the students need English-medium schools, we will send proposals for the same,"" added an official from the department. According to the TNSCB officials, the exercise will be carried out in other resettlement colonies soon.

Meanwhile, parents said the main problem they face was the improper functioning of government schools. ""They don't complete the syllabus on time. Besides, the special care given in government or Chennai schools in the city is not found here. This is the reason why many take loans and shift their children to private schools,"" said a parent."

As one of the cool kids at school, I started a coin collection in fifth grade. I remember going on trips to the bank with my mom for rolls of coins to sort through, looking at dates and years to fill in the slots in my blue coin-collecting albums. That, alongside my parents owning a business, sent me on many trips to local banks. But over time, my number of visits to the bank have dropped to zero.These days, I stick with an online-only bank as my primary bank. I don't have a single branch available. While it seemed strange at first, it was easy to grow accustomed to.

Let's look at the pros and cons to help you better understand if you could survive with online-only banking.

Online account offers from our partners:

With online-only banking, you are the teller and new accounts representative for yourself. Instead of going into a bank branch, you handle your own banking transactions from your computer or smartphone - like you could with many traditional banks, too.

Online banking uses secured connections, so as long as you use strong, unique passwords, it's totally safe to bank online. The best accounts allow you to deposit checks from your phone, transfer funds to or from any account at any bank with no fees, pay bills online, and avoid fees common to traditional brick-and-mortar banks.

As long as you get paid via direct deposit or check, as opposed to cash, online banking should easily meet all of your financial needs. Now, let's take a more detailed look at how some of the features work so you understand how the replace your old banking experience.

Once logged in, you can view balances, pay bills, make transfers, and deposit a check with a photo. If you have other accounts at the same bank, such as credit cards, loans, or investments, you can manage and make transfers to those accounts as well.

With online banking, it is easy to have all of your accounts under one roof. But even if you don't, it's easy to manage everything through convenient mobile apps.

The only real downsides of online banking are losing the in-person banking option and depositing cash with a teller. If you have a job where you are paid mostly in cash or tips, like a restaurant server or valet parking attendant, online-only banking probably isn't viable for you.

Taking cash out of an online bank account, though, is easy. Most online banks charge no fees for any ATM access, and some reimburse fees charged by other banks' ATMs. Some popular accounts that offer no-fee ATM access include Ally Bank (up to $10 per month reimbursed) and Charles Schwab Bank (unlimited reimbursements).

To deposit cash, you may want to consider pairing your online banking account with a favorite local credit union. Most credit unions offer a basic no-fee checking and savings option, which you can use to deposit cash and transfer to or from your online bank account.

Even online banks that don't charge fees usually offer a large network of free ATMs. Through memberships in various banks networks, Capital One (39,000 free ATMs), Discover Bank (60,000 free ATMs), and others typically have a convenient location near your work or home.

For example, most big banks charge huge fees for overdrafts. Online banks charge lower fees, if any. Capital One gives you four options for how to handle overdrafts to help you avoid or manage fees. Simple and Chime don't charge those fees at all - in fact, the only fee online bank Simple charges is for foreign debit card use. Otherwise, you won't pay them a cent. Ever.

Capital One and Ally typically stand at the top of the leaderboards in terms of interest rates, but other online banks don't lag far behind. Online savings rates are commonly around 20x better than what you get from the big, nationwide traditional banks.

If the idea of better interest rates, lower fees, and managing your own banking online is tempting to you, online banking may be the right choice.

To get started, you can keep an old account in addition to your new online account, slowly shifting your banking. Alternatively, you can get an online account and keep a local credit union account for physical banking needs. The truly bold dive in without looking back.

Online banking may feel new to you, but it has been around since the early 1980s. It's safe and secure and the future of managing money. As long as you don't need to regularly deposit cash, online-online banking may be a great decision for your money needs.

If the user removes the AirPods, the iPhone automatically pause the music. Users can also access Siri by double tapping the AirPods to select and control the music, change the volume, check your battery life or perform any other Siri task.

With an additional accelerometer in each AirPod, it intuitively knows if the user is speaking, enabling a pair of beam-forming microphones to focus on the sound of your voice, filtering out external noise to make your voice clearer.

Another noteworthy attribute of the AirPods is its ultra-low power consumption. Apple W1 chip operates at one-third of the power of traditional wireless chips, enabling the AirPods to deliver up to 5 hours of listening time on one full charge.

A student of drumming since infancy, Floyd is now a prodigy who has a Grade 8 certificate with distinction from the Trinity College, London. He has also expanded his achievements in music education by earning two diplomas: Licentiate of Trinity College London (LTCL) and Associate of Trinity College London (ATCL) before he turned 17 this year. What followed in its wake is a National Child Award for Exceptional Achievement in 2017 which he received from Indian President, Ram Nath Kovind. If you are wondering why you haven't already read about him or seen him perform with the big shots in the music industry, here is his answer, ""I believe that you shouldn't be in the spotlight up to a certain age. You will develop an ego and will end up placing yourself on a higher pedestal, which won't end well .""

Floyd definitely owes it to his father, who would take him along for jamming sessions with his friends when he was younger. ""Luckily, my parents saw something in me and signed me up for classes in National Academy during my lower primary school's summer holidays. I trained at National Academy and then I moved to Jam Music School,"" informs Floyd, who has been under the tutelage of renowned trainer Mathew Joy since then. Citing names like Dave Weckl and Mike Portnoy as his inspirations, he has developed a liking for playing challenging styles like progressive rock over the years. ""Whenever I feel unmotivated, I try out new styles of music like jazz or classical,""informs the instrumentalist.

Alongside pursuing another diploma, Floyd is currently set on expanding his musical knowledge by learning mridangam to delve into the complexities of rhythm. He has also been taking western vocal and guitar lessons for over a year to grow into a musician rather than be just another great drummer. Keen to develop his drumming skills further, he is contemplating training with Mumbai-based drummer Gino Banks or looking for scholarships abroad."

After merger of 4,600 primary schools, the Jharkhand government is planning to shut over 6,466 middle schools (classes 6 to 8), having less than 100 students.

These schools would be merged with upgraded high schools in phases, starting with the institutions, which have less than 50 students, education department officials said on Thursday.

Initially, 3,732 middle schools having less than 50 students would be undertaken for merger. The process of merging has already been started.

""Merger is an effort to provide quality education to students in a better educational ambience. Jharkhand has around 411 such middle schools where number of students is less than 10. If these schools are merged with high schools, students would get better education,"" said state education secretary AP Singh.

""As per the rules in the right to education (RTE), there should be at least three trained graduate teacher (TGT) in middle schools where number of students is less than 100. It means, we would have to afford additional Rs 18 lakh on teachers' salary even in the schools where number of students is less than 10, which is not logical,"" he added.

The decision comes at a time when the opposition parties and critics have been criticising the state government for merging the primary schools. Several ruling party elected representatives have also been lobbying with the government against the move. There have been protests in several parts of the state as well, against merger of schools.

The officials, however, argue that, ideally, there should be one middle school and five to seven primary schools in a panchayat. As many as 6,466 middle schools have been identified in Jharkhand, which could be merged with high schools within a 5-km radius in a panchayat, Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) officials said.

The state government has decided to offer bicycles to the students, who would be shifted to other schools so that they do not face any trouble in commuting to the school.

Meanwhile, the JEPC officials said they have completed the merging exercise of 4,600 primary schools.

JEPC director Uma Shankar Singh said there were 39,600 schools in 2016-17 under education department in Jharkhand. ""Of them, 18,000 schools had 60 or few students. These schools had an average of 1 or two teachers per school. Providing quality education was a major challenge. One teacher was handling four to five classes at a time. How could one expect a better education in these schools,"" he said.

The council said four-step process including field inspection, cross-district verification, block and district consultation and final notification to merge the schools.

Singh said 98% students from the 4,600 primary schools have been shifted and 96% students have expressed satisfaction with the consolidation. ""We faced difficulty to shift 150 students due to some technical reasons. Now, the issue is resolved and 120 students were shifted,"" he said.

The reorganisation of primary schools benefited seven lakh students with better teachers' availability and reduced the requirements of teachers by 4,500. Besides, the process saved government's Rs 400 crore through reduced teachers and infrastructure requirements, JEPC officials said.

Education Dept ropes in IIM Ranchi for merged school evaluation

State education secretary AP Singh said the department has roped in Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ranchi, for evaluation of the merged schools. The IIM, Ranchi would see if the reorganization process brought any difference in improving the education of students, who were shifted in merging process.

He said IIM Bangalore has also expressed willingness for a study of the reorganization process and its benefit."

The next best performance of the government was on 'Agricultural Subsidy for seeds/fertilisers' with an average score of 4.32. Therefore, the government performed well in the agricultural sector.

Next, the average score of the government on 'Beeter hospitals/Primary Health Care Centres' was 4.21.

'Availability of water for agriculture' and 'Strong Defence/Military' come in next with an average score of 4.20 and 4.08 respectively.

'Empowerment of women and their security' was relatively poor at 2.90.

'Terrorism', 'Training for Jobs', 'Eradication of Corruption' and 'Water, River, Lake Pollution' were poorly performed with the respective average scores of 2.34, 2.24, 1.05 and 1.05.

The worst performed sectors were 'Sand and Stone Quarrying/Mining', 'Encroachment of Public Land/Lakes', and 'Reservation for jobs and education' with the average score of 1.05, 1 and 1 respectively.

The performance of the Chhattisgarh government was best on 'Electricity for Domestic Use', 'Better Roads', 'Better Law and Order/Policing' and 'Better Public Transport' with respective average scores of 4.15, 3.92, 3.48 and 3.39.

The next was 'Better Hospitals/Primary Health Care Centres' with an average score of 3.32.

'Drinking Water' and 'Empowerment of Women and Security' were relatively poorly performed and had respective average scores of 2.25 and 2.09.

The worst performed sectors were 'Subsidized food distribution/Ration', 'Noise Pollution', 'School Education', and 'Reservation for jobs and education' with respective average scores of 1.51, 1.44, 1.38 and 1.25 respectively.

The survey identified the important factors that people take into account before voting for a particular candidate. Issues like whether the candidate matters the most or other issues like caste/religion of the candidate and CM candidate of the party.

The survey asked respondents about the reason they vote for a particular candidate. They were given five choices - candidate, party, party's chief ministerial candidate, religion and caste. Respondents had to rank each of these as either very important, important or not important. Taking the weighted average across respondents for each of these factors, we can gauge the aggregate importance of each of the five factors across all voters.

It is interesting that, according to the survey, the most important factor for voters is the CM Candidate, followed by the Candidate's party and the candidate. The least important factors were the distribution of cash, liquor, gifts, etc. and the Candidate's caste or religion."

Thereafter I'll write a TOI blog post on this topic.

Who are these economists?

Thirteen senior economists, including former Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan, IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath and Sajjid Chinoy of JP Morgan. Others are: Abhijit Banerjee, Pranjul Bhandari, Maitreesh Ghatak, Amartya Lahiri, Neelkanth Mishra, Prachi Mishra, Karthik Muralidharan, Rohini Pande, Eswar Prasad and E. Somanathan.

Unfortunately, I've not heard of any of these economists apart from Raghuram Rajan and read none of them before. I read only the world's best economists (with Hayek and Friedman being my benchmark), and no Indian economist comes in that category. And given what these economists have produced in this report, I will not be reading their work anyway.

In this report, they're OK on labour reforms, ordinary on most issues and pretty hopeless on agriculture, education and healthcare. Most importantly, they have totally missed governance reforms although they repeatedly point out the massive failure of government in every field. A major blind spot these economists need to fix.

The Imperative for Strong, Equitable, and Sustainable Growth

India is one of the fastest growing large countries in the world, having grown at an average of almost 7 percent for the last 25 years. There have been many notable reforms over this period - most recently, the co-operative fiscal federalism that has brought the Goods and Services Tax into being, the enactment of the Indian Bankruptcy Code, and the dramatic dis-inflation of recent years, partly as a result of a move to an inflation targeting regime.

While commendable, we should not be satisfied with this. India is still one of the poorest countries in the G-20, and poor countries ought to grow faster because catch-up growth is easier. As important, the benefits of growth in India have been distributed extremely unequally, with top incomes rising much faster than the rest. [Sanjeev: The real issue remains extreme poverty] We have seen new environmental challenges, in the form of sharp increases in both local pollution levels and in CO2 emissions [Sanjeev: CO2 emissions are GOOD, not bad] that, if unchecked, threaten to stall or reverse progress. India is also not creating enough jobs: even though data on employment in India are both low quality and controversial, the recent news that 28 million applied for 90,000 low level railway jobs suggests we are not satisfying the demand for jobs.1 Unfortunately, we are not well-positioned to follow the export-led growth path that allowed many Asian countries to climb out of poverty. Despite abundant cheap labor, we are not part of many global supply chains. Even as global firms seek to diversify away from China so as to reduce political risk, India is rarely seen as an obvious alternative. [That's because socialism has messed up everything in India]

Given India's continental size, it need not follow the export-led path. It will, however, have to ensure that growth generates jobs and incomes across the skill spectrum, in the process

There are tremendous possibilities for reforms that will take us towards faster and more equitable growth, as this report will lay out. However, we have to allocate scarce resources carefully to make sure that there is enough investment in sectors such as infrastructure to create jobs. India's aggregate fiscal deficit (state plus center) is still close to 6.5 percent of GDP, higher than almost any in the G-20, and not significantly lower than levels that existed five years ago. However, our investment rate has fallen sharply in recent years. Despite that, our external financing requirement (as measured by the current account deficit) increased appreciably earlier this year, increasing vulnerability. Moreover, to the extent that India grows while being more reliant on domestic demand than were other Asian emerging markets, it needs a much greater focus on macroeconomic stability than they did. For all these reasons, it needs to prioritize government spending better, focusing on filling clear investment gaps and protecting the vulnerable. It also needs to increase revenues by making the tax system more progressive both in taxes levied as well as through more effective collection from rich non-payers, by bringing more people into the tax net, and by charging users for government services where appropriate.

A key factor in spurring growth will be reforms that alleviate ""supply side"" constraints on growth and job creation. We have to enable both the industrial sector as well as the service sector to operate at larger scale. This involves embracing highly overdue labor reforms including allowing for a rich menu of contracts with workers that allow for more possibilities than just permanent workers and short term contractual labor in firms [Agree]. Such additional contracting possibilities could give workers more job security, give firms the incentive to train and invest in their skilling, even while giving firms more reason to scale up. Similarly, cleaner title to land, as well as a land acquisition process that protects the seller while simplifying acquisition, will reduce the cost of developing land, a critical need if we are to create jobs [Agree, but these economists should ask why Indian governance system can't perform this most basic function]. A more predictable and better regulatory environment - which prunes redundant or unnecessary regulation, carefully sets regulations in new areas necessitated by our development, and enforces regulations effectively and impartially - will create a much better environment for business. We must also improve the capabilities as well as strengthen the independence of our regulatory institutions. [Agree, but why is India's governance in such a mess even today?]

Scale is also key for productivity growth which, in turn, is essential for India to expand its share of world exports. The ongoing reorientation of the United States away from dependence on China provides India with a great opportunity to position itself as a viable alternative for cheap sourcing of goods and parts. But this would require macro and industrial policy reforms of the kind just outlined that remove existing impediments to India becoming a valued partner in global supply chains. Rolling back the recent increases in import tariffs along with a renewed commitment to resisting protective policies would be a good way of signaling this goal. [Agree]

In outlining an economic agenda, we have to recognize government capacity is limited - the number of government employees is often low relative to the tasks they are assigned [Sanjeev: TOTALLY DISAGREE here. The issue is SHEER AND TOTAL INCOMPETENCE AND CORRUPTION]. This is often compounded by low staff motivation and relatedly high absenteeism, as well as inadequate training. Government takes on too much, while delivering too little. Yet for growth to be equitable, a must in our democracy, effective and well-targeted government engagement is essential. [Why are these economists not talking about governance reforms?]

One partial solution is more decentralization, with more powers and funding delegated to the states, and perhaps more importantly, within the states to municipalities and panchayats. It will allow for a much more dynamic decision-making process, resulting in government policies that are more sensitive to local conditions, as well as more local democratic control of officialdom. [This is fine in principle but totally fails to account for the fact that the SAME bureaucracy and political incentives will lead to the SAME outcome.]

The strategic use of technology has the potential to help here as long as we are careful not to make a fetish of technology, are mindful of the human dimension of transactions, and deploy technology with enough safeguards. Technology can make it easier to monitor flows of funds and uses of funding locally, allowing for more devolution of funding, something that has been proposed by previous Finance Commissions. More generally, effective use of technology can also help substitute for government manpower, increase the points of access to government services, help monitor service provision, and reduce leakage in the system.

The debate on whether the public sector should occupy areas that can be done by the private sector will no doubt continue, and there is an obvious case for exiting areas where the public sector contributes little while draining the exchequer and distorting competition. [Sanjeev: Why is government involved in ANY business at all? And this is not a specific recommendation: a motherhood statement] The government should also reconsider its interventions in areas where it adds noise and uncertainty - for instance, the constant fiddling with agricultural import tariffs, the unpredictable closures or opening of export and import windows, and the inability to procure agricultural commodities or release them effectively, does significantly more damage than good to agriculture. While actions are taken in the name of the farmer or the consumer, it is the middleman who often benefits. [Sanjeev: there's nothing wrong with the middleman benefiting in a competitive and open market. But the market is not open. This recommendation fails to recognise the huge blockages on agriculture sector trade.]

Moreover, even when the consumer benefits from high farm production and low agricultural prices, which also help contain inflation, the cost to the farmers can be significant. The case of pulses is revealing. In 2016-17 for example, India witnessed its highest ever domestic production - close to 23 million metric tonnes -- likely reflecting a combination of a normal monsoon after successive droughts and the farmer response to higher market prices and MSPs. This was sufficient to fully satisfy domestic demand. Despite that, India imported a hefty 6.6 million tonnes of pulses (almost a third of total domestic production) at zero import duty - leading to a massive domestic supply glut, and a sharp and sustained fall in pulse prices over the next two years which continues to this day, with prices currently 30% lower than their 2016 peaks.

In addition to getting the government out of areas it should not be in, there is an equally urgent task of strengthening the government in areas it does poorly or is virtually absent in - for instance, regulating and certifying educational or medical service providers, apprehending and successfully prosecuting economic offenders [What about non-economic??!!], or regulating haphazard development and environmental despoliation without blocking growth. [When even murderers like Modi can remain on the loose, then what hope of justice? This was the opportunity to talk about governance reforms.]

For growth to be equitable and sustained, we have to reform our education, skilling, healthcare, and welfare systems significantly. Our record on primary education is dismal, with only about half of the children in class five able to do math or reading at the second-grade level. Parents have responded by increasingly migrating to private schooling, but private schools are only slightly better than government schools, and in their current form will not solve the problem of low education quality. [This is a TERRIBLE comment to make - to downplay private enterprise, the only thing that is working in India for the POOR] It does not get better at higher grades -- our PISA scores were so low that we refused to participate again in that international benchmarking exercise. The poor quality of human capital may already be constraining growth (industry is increasingly concerned about the large and growing skill deficit), limits its inclusiveness and prompt a premature move to replace workers with machines.

Healthcare is another area of major concern. In particular, the public system has largely been abandoned by the patients seeking regular primary care. They prefer paying for private treatment even though many practitioners are unqualified and prescribe the wrong treatment in more than 70% of the cases. This is partly a consequence of the failure of the public sector -- public sector practitioners are often absent, and when present they put very little effort into treatment. It is unclear how the recent Ayushman Bharat insurance scheme, which is the main current effort to deal with healthcare issues, will address this issue. [Sanjeev: with the BLATANT failure of government staring in the face, where is the talk about governance reforms?]

This is especially a problem because dealing with the large growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and the many, only partly-solved, child and maternal health issues, relies heavily on getting frontline providers to lead the charge. Similar concerns apply in the education sector. A failure to ensure high-quality education and health care provision means that a substantial proportion of our future labor force will grow up underequipped with skills needed in the labor market and suffering from the long term consequences of stunting and wasting. Much of the middle-aged population will be dealing with debilitating diseases that could have been prevented or controlled. This obviously limits the sustainability and the inclusiveness of growth.

The environment is, of course, a critical challenge to the continuation of our growth and to the extent to which growth translates into improved quality of life. Many of our cities are increasingly experiencing levels of pollution that border on the toxic. If we cannot manage the environment at our present level of development, greater growth will make matters far worse. [Sanjeev: once again, this points to severe government failure - but no mention of the need for governance reforms] The consequences of environmentally myopic policies are reflected, for example, in the rapidly falling water table in many parts of the country, which threatens the sustainability of our agriculture. Relatedly, climate change is already having very significant effects on productivity and the quality of lives in India and we need to be at the forefront of global efforts to combat it. [Sanjeev: this claim is, of course, CRAP]

That our current policies do not add up to an inclusive and sustainable growth agenda is reflected in growing agitation across our society. Agrarian unrest, and the constant demand for loan waivers, is now compounded by demands for some form of government support from sections of society that are nowhere near the poorest. This reflects Indians' growing anxiety about their future and that of their children in an increasingly winner-take-all society, where they often end up on the losing side. Our welfare schemes like the MGNREGA and Pradhan Mantri Gramin Awas Yojana are mostly directed towards the very poor (the one exception being the public distribution system), so they do not serve the purpose of protecting those outside that group. Without stronger, sustainable, and inclusive growth we simply do not have the resources to expand our welfare schemes significantly, [Sanjeev: BUT WHY SHOULD WELFARE BE EXPANDED?] but if we do generate that growth, not only will there be less demand for welfare but there will be more resources to service any demand.

The bottom line is that while we have performed creditably in the last 25 years across different administrations, we cannot be complacent about our economic challenges. They are mounting. We are a group of economists, each with different specializations and interests, who have come together to offer proposals for the way ahead. Some of us are based in India, some outside, but we are all closely engaged in, and concerned about, India's development. We do not belong to any party, nor are we from the government. We hope this non-partisan analysis of our situation, while not intended to be comprehensive, will help spur debate as India moves to elections. The rest of this note summarizes our proposals, and offers our consensus view on some of the key issues we face. We then append individual notes by members of the group, which offers more details of individual views and proposals. Each note reflects the view of the author(s) in their personal capacity, and does not necessarily represent the institution they are affiliated with.

Macroeconomic stability: a prerequisite to sustainable growth and job creation

India's economic history is replete with the same lesson: preserving and protecting macroeconomic stability is an essential prerequisite to strong and sustained growth. Every time macro stability has been traded off to boost growth, the economy has been pushed towards a crisis, the consequences of which have undermined the very growth that was the initial policy focus.

Ensuring macroeconomic stability has at least three elements to it: maintaining low and stable inflation, ensuring the consolidated fiscal deficit leaves enough space for private investment, and ensuring that the current account deficit is sustainable and can be financed largely through stable capital inflows, to help insulate the economy from sudden swings in global sentiment. High and variable inflation constitutes a regressive tax, with the poor bearing the biggest brunt, since their incomes are typically least indexed to inflation. It also dissuades foreign investors from investing in rupee assets. Similarly, large and unsustainable fiscal/external imbalances impart significant macroeconomic and financial market uncertainty, push up borrowing costs and risk premia in the economy and threaten financial stability. All this impedes private and public investment.

Fiscal consolidation to creating space for more investment

The economy has made significant progress in combating inflation in recent years. Over the last 4 years inflation has averaged just over 4% versus almost 10% in the previous five years, and household inflation expectations are getting progressively anchored. The same, however, cannot be said of the fiscal side.

While the center's fiscal deficit has been steadily brought down, the combined deficit of the states - even after adjusting for UDAY - has continued to widen in recent years and, thereby, largely undone the center's consolidation. Consequently, the consolidated fiscal deficit in 2017-18, stood above 6.5%, not very different from its levels five years ago. Our primary suggestions to make progress on this difficult issue:

De-risking the external sector

India's heavy dependence on oil imports often results in ""boom-bust"" cycles on the balance of payments when crude prices change. For example, the CAD narrowed to 0.7% of GDP in 2016-17 as crude prices fell and was then tracking close to 3% of GDP in 2018 when crude prices bounced back up. This resulted in a large balance of payments surplus in the first instance and a large deficit in the second. These sharp swings complicate monetary policy, as well as exchange rate and liquidity management, and create undue external and fiscal volatility (since oil prices also alter the fiscal math). We should:

Fixing the Stressed Sectors

Careful but quick policy reforms are needed for the sectors/areas that are stressed. These include agriculture, infrastructure (including power), exports and banking. There are common themes in any revival. Typically, we need to redeploy government effort in each of these sectors, focusing it on areas where it is truly needed to play an enabling role, while freeing the sector of excessive bureaucracy and intervention, which results in inadequate access to markets, distorted prices, and poor incentives. While the recent focus on improving India's ranking on the World Bank's Doing Business measures is commendable, we should guard against the temptation to focus on the specifics of the World Bank measures, while neglecting the broader impediments to producing in India. [Agreed] We now consider each of these sectors in more detail.

Agriculture & the rural economy

We need deep rooted transformation of agriculture, treating it not as a sector that has to be propped up through repeated sops, but as an engine of India's job creation and growth. For that, it is imperative that we thoroughly reform agricultural and land policies. In particular, a key source of agrarian distress in recent years has been that the terms-of-trade confronting farmers has turned progressively more adverse, partly as a result of policies to combat food inflation. While low inflation is desirable in itself, the impact on farmers also needs to be taken into account. A policy priority should be to reduce distortions in farm product prices as well as input prices. Another important enabler is technology, both in educating and informing farmers, as well as in opening access to markets. Some specific proposals include

Infrastructure

Accelerating the pace of the infrastructure build-out will help in a number of ways; it will create jobs in construction and new economic activity around the resulting roads, ports, airports, railways, and housing; it will promote inclusion as it connects interior rural areas to markets; it will make our exports (and import-competing manufacturing) more competitive as it reduces input costs such as land (as cheaper areas are connected) and power, as well as improves logistics and reduces transportation costs; it will open up India to both domestic and foreign tourism, which can be a tremendous source of semi- skilled jobs. This will require

Power

Despite having some of the largest reserves of coal, as well as having substantial unutilized power generation capacity, India is both short of coal as well as short of power. These are policy self-goals, arising from both the dominant presence of government in coal mining and power distribution as well as populist impulses in pricing. Nevertheless, our low base allows us to choose a path that is both more energy efficient as well as less polluting as we reform the system for the twenty first century. For this we need:

Exports

India's non-oil, non-gold current account has deteriorated by almost 3% of GDP in the last three years, suggesting an urgent need to improve the underlying competitiveness of the tradable sector. Boosting exports should be the lynchpin of that strategy. [Sanjeev: Any economist who says this is simply not a good economist. Refer to Kautilya, and the best economists who agree that IMPORTS are the key. Let consumption be the focus of economists, and exports are a minor subset of this production process.] The existing constraints in the export sector appear to be reflective of more general problems in manufacturing: low scale of production, low productivity, bureaucratic impediments, high cost of inputs like land and power. We have suggested ways to address these earlier. In addition,

Financial Sector

Given the non-performing asset (NPA) build up in the banking system, it is imperative we make the banking system more robust and well capitalized [Sanjeev: HOW? By taxpayer subsidy??], expand its capacity to extend credit, and improve incentives to lend to the most productive sectors. While the recent travails of the NBFCs are a matter of concern, some of their problems stem from an overly rapid expansion of their balance sheets as they grew to substitute for banks. Stability in the banking system will help spread stability to other parts of the financial system as, of course, will the reverse.

The main challenges for the banking sector are to improve governance, transparency, and incentives in the banking system. Key measures should include

The non-bank financial sector needs a strong banking system as well as deep equity and bond markets, supported by liquid secondary markets and a robust regulatory and legal infrastructure. Key priorities include:

Making growth inclusive and sustainable

A good job is often the most important form of inclusion. In addition, we need to help individuals obtain the human capabilities that will enable them to secure and hold that job, as well as protect those who cannot get jobs. Let us now turn to proposals on inclusion.

Education

The single greatest limitation of the Indian education system is its inability to deliver universal functional literacy and numeracy in primary school. Several studies show that students who fail to achieve basic skills by the end of class 3 learn very little in subsequent years even if they are enrolled in school. Our top education policy priority is therefore:

The Right to Education (RTE) Bill's input-based approach to education quality was unlikely to succeed given the extensive evidence that most school inputs are neither necessary nor sufficient for improving learning outcomes. RTE has led to an unnecessary and disruptive closure of several low-cost private schools that parents were choosing of their own accord. In many cases, even government schools are in violation of these input-based norms. We therefore recommend:

While improvement in schooling is a key building block to education, we cannot neglect either vocational training/skilling or college education. Both will be critical to providing our youth with the wherewithal for the jobs of the future. High quality research universities will be essential, both to train the teachers for our colleges as well as to fuel the innovation needed for the next stage of our growth. [Sanjeev: GET THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF THESE]

Dealing with the skills shortage

There is wide recognition that the current models of publicly subsidized skilling are not performing very well even though skills are extremely scarce. What seems to work better is the skilling provided by private firms that are training their own labor force. However, under current laws, firms can employ workers for up to one year after which they either have to fire them or make them permanent. Since there are significant costs and inflexibilities in making workers permanent, many firms keep workers on short contracts and terminate them before they can become permanent. This state of affairs serves neither the firm, which has to hire new workers frequently and has no incentive to train them, nor the worker, who has no security of employment, and who is not trained. At the same time, since the government is often the only employer that offers secure jobs, young people spend their twenties applying for these jobs rather than working. However, these jobs are extremely expensive thanks partly to the munificence of the Pay Commissions and therefore there are too few of them. As a result, a cynic could argue that the government and the private sector lack manpower, while young people sit at home filling applications and preparing for tests. We propose that:

Women's labor force participation

There are clearly both supply-side issues-families not allowing women to work, women feeling disempowered -- and demand-side issues -- lack of women-friendly jobs in the private sector as well as discrimination. Some useful first steps here:

Healthcare

There is much to be done to reform the healthcare system in India. Increasingly, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer play a much bigger role, so healthcare needs to be reoriented to address these.

Environment

Even while business complains about the difficulty of getting environmental approvals, the quality of our environment leaves much to be desired and with climate change looming we should be thinking in terms of reaching peak emissions within the next decade or so and then sharply reducing them. For all of this we need to get more professional about the environment and climate change, as well as more transparent about the regulatory process.

Social Protection

India has more than 400 separate social protection schemes. A vast majority of them are funded at very low levels and do very little. However, they absorb some amount of bureaucratic capacity. And despite the wide variety of schemes available on paper, as the many protests make clear, people do not feel protected. In particular while MGNREGA provides some support for the rural landless, most other relatively poor people have only the PDS to fall back on. This is one reason that it is so difficult to remove any government scheme, however inefficient. There is a clear need to create a reliable pipeline for providing compensation for losers, as we move towards a more rational system of social protection. The Direct Benefits Transfer is a good starting point and building on it by being credible in compensating losers will be key. Specifically we suggest"

But where to find them? Deal, no deal or even another referendum?

While #Brexit has dominated much of public debate and Government time, #Metoo and #gigeconomy have also featured prominently in public debate though they are assigned to the Government's growing list of ""future legislative reform needed if we just had time"" pile - shame JK Rowling couldn't make Hermione's time turner a reality.

The Government has repeatedly stated that it intends to maintain current UK employment laws so that existing workers' rights are unchanged following exit day, this could of course change, as political fortunes change ('Fantastic [Brexit] Beasts: the [G]rimes of Grindel[gov]'). The reality is that it is unlikely the Government will change its mind and repeal all EU-derived employment law or make large-scale changes to employment law in the aftermath of Brexit. There may be scope to tweak some provisions within the current legislation, but political considerations make it relatively unlikely that core employee rights would be reduced significantly following Brexit.

John Whiting, now CBE, is the writer's personal favourite taxman for this simple and honest statement, which continues to be true. Like last year, determining worker status in modern workplaces has once again been a hot topic in 2018.

Back in February we finally saw the delayed Government Response to the recommendations of the Taylor review of modern working practices; and the answer to the tricky employment status issue is...more consultation and thinking!

The Government has rejected Matthew Taylor's recommendation for introducing a 'worker status by default' presumption and is instead revisiting the possibility of a new statutory test to determine employment status. As acknowledged in the latest consultation which closed on 1 June, codification of the test for employment status would involve trade-offs. On the one hand, a simple and clear formula will give more certainty. On the other hand, the current case law based framework provides the nuance and flexibility often needed when applying the test to different circumstances which are inevitable in the labour market.

Ultimately, employment status is a complicated subject because employment relationships are just that - complicated. A status test set down in legislation rather than case law doesn't change that fact. Trying to encapsulate the nuanced factors developed over years of case law into legislation will be no easy feat. But have the courts been any more helpful this year?

Since the 2016 landmark tribunal decision (and 2017 Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) judgment) that Uber drivers are workers (despite Uber's best efforts at drafting bamboozling contractual clauses) there has been a seemingly endless supply of successful new claims predominantly concerning couriers [Insert your choice of courier company name and you will most likely find a case].

In June, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment in Pimlico Plumbers Limited & Anr v Smith on whether a plumber who was self-employed for tax purposes was nonetheless a worker for employment law purposes. In relation to the personal service requirement for establishing 'worker' status, the Supreme Court confirmed that a limited or occasional power of delegation could still be consistent with personal performance. The 'dominant purpose' of the contract remained one of personal service.

The Supreme Court's judgment significantly decreases the importance of the right of substitution as a determining factor. A substitution clause in and of itself does not magically prevent worker status. On the other hand, integration in the business appears to be a factor of increasing importance in the current wave of worker status cases.

The Supreme Court has tweaked the judicial test by succinctly articulating the 'dominant purpose' factor. But this is more judicial test evolution rather than revolution. Unfortunately, for hopes of world peace, arguments over the required elements of worker status are far from over. Whether and to what extent 'mutuality of obligation' between assignments is relevant to a person's status during assignments is still up for grabs. 'Mutuality of obligation' is a crucial factor to establish 'employee' status, but is it required and if so, to what extent, for establishing 'worker' status? As the Supreme Court said there is no easy answer to this question and it will have to await appraisal on another occasion.

The further appeal in the Uber case was heard by the Court of Appeal on 30 and 31 October. Will the judgment, when handed down, provide an answer? No doubt whichever way the judgment goes, the losing party will further appeal.

Unfortunately, we are not much closer to tackling world peace!

Last year in Jones v Birds Eye, the employment tribunal reminded us that following the 2013 EAT decision in Moran v Ideal Cleaning, the number of agency workers potentially falling within the provisions of the Agency Workers Regulations 2010 was significantly lower than originally anticipated. Following Moran, not all agency workers are protected; it is only those supplied to work temporarily. Those placed indefinitely (meaning open-ended in duration) are not placed 'temporarily' and are therefore outside the scope of the Agency Workers Regulations (AWR).

In both Moran and Jones the agency workers were found not to be temporary and so not covered by the AWR. Conversely this year in Brooknight Guarding Ltd v Matei we have an example of an agency worker placed temporarily. The EAT agreed with the tribunal, that while a relief security guard mainly worked at one site, it was as a 'cover security guard'. Each 'as required' assignment was on a temporary rather than on a permanent or indefinite basis.

In Kocur v Angard Staffing Solutions Ltd, an employer breached the AWR in providing an agency worker with fewer enhanced contractual days' holiday and shorter paid rest breaks than comparable permanent employees, despite the agency worker receiving a higher hourly wage. The EAT rejected the defence that the agency worker's higher rate of pay offset his inferior holiday entitlement and rest breaks - the AWR require a term-by-term comparison not a package approach.

For a part-time worker to establish less favourable treatment under the Part-Time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 (PTW) they need to identify an actual full-time worker comparator who is: employed by the same employer under the same type of contract and engaged in the same or broadly similar work having regard to level of qualification, skills and experience.

In Roddis v Sheffield Hallam University, the EAT considered what constitutes the 'same type of contract' for PTW purposes in the context of a claim by an employee working under a zero hours contract. The University argued that a lecturer's zero-hours contract was not the 'same type of contract' so he could not compare himself with a full-time lecturer on a permanent contract of employment.

A good academic try? Well no. The EAT had no trouble in rejecting this argument. It cannot be that a zero-hours contract of itself constitutes a different type of contract for the purposes of the PTW, since the consequence would be that an employee on a zero-hours contract would never be able to compare themselves to a full-time worker. As the EAT points out, if a contract of employment containing a zero-hours clause was a distinct type of contract under the PTW, the PTW would be self-defeating.

Back in June 2013, the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 was revamped. Significant new provisions were introduced. The changes included introducing co-workers' liability for victimisation with corresponding employer statutory vicarious liability.

In November, the Court of Appeal in Timis and Sage v Osipov confirmed that an individual's personal liability for detriment which they cause to a whistleblower colleague can extend to liability for that colleague's dismissal. Where a distinct prior detrimental act done by a co-worker results in the whistleblower's dismissal, the whistleblower can still recover compensation for losses flowing from the dismissal - a so-called 'dismissal consequent on detriment' claim. In this case, it leaves two wrongdoer directors on the hook for just over £2 million of losses, the employer company being insolvent.

For there to be a qualifying disclosure under the whistleblowing legislation, there must be a disclosure of information, not a matter of opinion or an allegation. In practice, information and allegations are often intertwined. In June, the Court of Appeal clarified that the question is whether the disclosure has ""sufficient factual content and specificity"" (Kilraine v London Borough of Wandsworth).

This year we have also learnt on the whistleblowing front:

Common law vicarious liability is a principle of strict, no-fault liability for wrongs committed by another person. In an employment relationship, an employer may be liable for the wrongs committed by an employee where there is a sufficient connection between those wrongs and the employee's employment. This is a very long-standing legal principle with the foundation of the 'modern' principle going back to 1912 (Lloyd and Grace, Smith and Co). But have 21st century developments expanded its scope?

Following a number of appellate level 21st century judgments, when considering whether an incident has sufficient connection with the employer, it is not merely a question of whether the employee was 'at work' in a strict sense. Instead it is whether the employee was otherwise 'clothed in the employer's authority' or ''acting within the field of activities assigned to them'.

For example, an employer was liable for a Managing Director's violent assault of a colleague at an impromptu post-Christmas work party after-party as the MD 'chose to wear his metaphorical managing director's hat' at the time of the incident. Another employer was vicariously liable for a data breach by a rogue employee as access to the data was within the field of activities assigned to him. The fact that the rogue employee's actions were designed to harm the employer was irrelevant.

July saw the Court of Appeal hand down one of the most significant judgments of the year - a combined judgment in Royal Mencap Society v Tomlinson-Blake and Shannon v Rampersad t/a Clifton House Residential Home. In a single judgment, the Court of Appeal has effectively overturned the precedent value of numerous EAT judgments concerning the treatment of 'sleep-in' shifts for national minimum wage (NMW) purposes.

Where a worker is required to work a number of 'sleep-in' night shifts at the employer's premises (to be available in case of an occasional emergency but otherwise expected to sleep all or most of the shift), does the full night shift constitute 'working' for the purposes of the NMW? The Court of Appeal has now answered this question ruling: ""the only time that counts for NMW purposes [during sleep-in-shifts] is the time when the worker is required to be awake for the purpose of working"".

Quite simply the only time that counts for NMW purposes is the time when the worker is required to be awake and actually carrying out work. Time spent sleeping/relaxing does not count. Factors previously found to point towards NMW being payable for the entire sleep-in shift are now irrelevant. The sleep-in exception in the NMW Regulations applies to cases where ""the essence of the arrangement is that the worker is expected to sleep"".

Turning to on-call time for Working Time Directive purposes, until this year Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) case-law has tended to focus on the worker's location during stand-by periods and whether it is at a place determined by the employer. Early this year, in Ville de Nivelles v Matzak, the CJEU considered whether on-call time is 'working time' for fire-fighters on-call at home but with a duty to respond within eight minutes. The CJEU has held that such time is 'working time'.

Perhaps a bit counterintuitively, this judgment still reaffirms the importance of proximity to the workplace. In this case, the obligation for the firefighters to remain physically present at the place determined by the employer (their homes) and the 'geographical and temporal constraints' resulting from the requirement to reach their place of work within eight minutes, limited the opportunities which the firefighters had to devote themselves to their personal and social interests. The situation of the firefighters in this case could therefore be distinguished from that of a worker who, during his stand-by duty, must simply be at his employer's disposal inasmuch as it must be possible to contact him. While being on employer premises during on-call time is not required, the proximity of the worker to the workplace at a place determined by the employer (even if it is the worker's home) is still a key factor.

In what is now a perennial favourite, holiday leave accrual, carry-over and pay calculations have once again featured heavily over the year.

Working out holiday entitlement for term time only workers, casual and zero hour workers can often prove to be an administrative headache. The Working Time Regulations (WTR) require holiday pay to be calculated on the basis of the average hours worked in the preceding 12 weeks immediately before payment is made. However, many employers have instead worked out holiday pay by using a 12.07% of annualised hours shortcut as set out in ACAS guidance (5.6 weeks is equivalent to 12.07% of hours worked over a year for a full time worker).

While the 12.07% method is accurate in many cases, it isn't always. In March, the EAT in Brazel v The Harpur Trust confirmed that calculating holiday pay for variable hour, term-time workers based on 12.07% of annualised hours is incorrect. The express provisions contained in the WTR cannot be overridden for ease of calculation. As shown in Mrs Brazel's case, the shortcut did not work accurately for part-time term time workers. Employers using a 12.07% of annualised hours calculation as a shortcut need to review their holiday pay calculation practices or face potential claims.

In Gomes v Higher Level Care Ltd, the Court of Appeal was asked whether compensation for failing to provide rest breaks can include an injury to feelings award. If yes, this would significantly increase the value of rest break breach claims.

The Court of Appeal has confirmed that compensation for claims for failing to provide rest breaks does not extend to injury to feelings, being akin to a breach of contract claim.

While compensation for failure to provide rest breaks and annual leave does not extend to awards for injury to feelings, not all WTR claims are excluded. In contrast, compensation for injury to feelings may be awarded in working time detriment claims since they are more akin to a statutory tort (South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service v Mansell & ors).

We have also had yet another EAT judgment on overtime and holiday pay calculations. The EAT in Flowers and others v East of England Ambulance Trust, once again confirmed that for a WTR claim ""normal pay"" is that which is ""normally received"". Focusing on whether overtime is or isn't ""voluntary"" is irrelevant. The key is regular receipt. But also check the contractual provisions. If there is a contractual right to have overtime included, there may not be a need to establish a regular pattern. In Flowers, regardless of the WTR claim, the claimants were entitled under a contractual clause to have any overtime pay received in the preceding three months included in their annual leave calculation whether or not the overtime worked was part of a regular and settled pattern.

In two German references, Kreuziger v Land Berlin and Max-Planck v Shimizu, the CJEU held that a worker who does not apply for paid annual leave during employment does not automatically lose the right to an allowance in lieu of untaken leave on termination. The worker must have been given an opportunity to take that leave. While employers are not required to force workers to actually exercise their right to take paid annual leave, a bit of nagging may be needed. It is for the employer to show that it encouraged the worker to do so, while informing them, accurately and in good time, of the risk of losing that leave at the end of the applicable reference period.

The CJEU has confirmed that the Working Time Directive (WTD) does not require holiday leave accrual during the taking of parental leave (Tribunalul Botoşani v Dicu). Parental leave (in the UK 18 weeks' unpaid leave to care for a child) is distinguishable from sickness absence and maternity leave. If national law suspends the employment contract during parental leave, then annual leave entitlement does not accrue during the taking of that parental leave. Parental leave is not equivalent to a period of actual work for determining the duration of paid annual leave.

In the UK, legislative provisions which apply to maternity, paternity, adoption and shared parental leave expressly state that during the leave period the employee is entitled to the benefit of all the terms and conditions of employment except remuneration - so holiday leave accrual continues during these leave periods. However, there is no corresponding legislative provision in relation to EU law derived parental leave.

If an employer unilaterally imposes a contractual change, it is possible for employees' agreement to be implied if they continue to work without protesting after the change has been imposed. But this is risky. Careful analysis of all communication from employees (both verbal and written) is necessary to ensure nothing has been communicated that suggests or evidences objection to the changes. Where the change imposed does not have immediate effect, silence would not be considered to be agreement simply as a result of the passage of time.

In April, the Court of Appeal in Abrahall and ors v Nottingham City Council reminded employers just what risky business it is to assume agreement. In this case, the Court held that a group of employees who continued to work following their employer's imposition of a pay freeze did not agree to a variation of contract. Although the employees did not bring tribunal claims until two years later and did not individually communicate protest, they had protested through their trade unions at the time. The employees continuing to work could not be taken as unequivocal acceptance of a change that was wholly to their disadvantage. A decision by the union not to take industrial action over the imposed change did not equate to accepting the variation.

Also in April, we received Supreme Court clarification on when contractual notice of termination served by post takes effect (Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust v Haywood). In the absence of any specific contractual provision, contractual notice takes effect only when the employee personally takes delivery of the letter containing the notice (so not date recorded delivery signed for by a family member). In this case, the date of termination was crucial because it determined whether the notice period expired on or before the employee's 50th birthday, which affected her pension entitlement by some £200,000.

This judgment now aligns the contractual law position with the statutory position in respect of the effective date of termination (EDT) under the Employment Rights Act 1996.

Lesson: when dismissing an employee, it is usually best to inform the employee in person (written confirmation being simply that, confirmation, and not the mode of first communication of the actual decision). This will remove any ambiguity about the date of dismissal.

From this year's crop of unfair dismissal judgments we have learned:

A head teacher's failure to disclose to school governors a close personal relationship she had with a registered sex offender was misconduct justifying dismissal (Reilly v Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council - Supreme Court). This judgment is of particular note as Lord Wilson questions how useful is the long-standing Burchell v BHS reasonableness test, but without reaching a conclusion. The Supreme Court has, in effect, invited argument in a future case.

Misconduct does need to necessarily amount to gross misconduct for a fair dismissal. There is no magic in labelling something as gross misconduct rather than as serious misconduct for unfair dismissal purposes. As ever, each case will be fact specific to determine whether the employer acted reasonably in treating that reason for dismissal as sufficient to justify dismissal (Quintiles Commercial UK Ltd v Barongo - EAT).

The deemed extension of the effective date of termination by statutory minimum notice does not apply where the employer is entitled to immediately dismiss (summary dismissal) by reason of the employee's conduct (Lancaster and Duke Ltd v Wileman - EAT)

An employee's letter giving 'notice' was not an unambiguous resignation. The context for the letter was that the employee was expecting to take up a different role in another department (although that role was subsequently withdrawn) and the tribunal was entitled to read it as giving notice of intention to leave a particular role rather than to terminate employment (East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust v Levy - EAT).

Where an employee is contractually entitled to receipt of Permanent Health Insurance (PHI) payments, absent any over-riding express terms, the courts will imply a term preventing an employee being dismissed where this would deprive them of the benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled under the PHI scheme. While an employee may use the implied term in a breach of contract wrongful dismissal claim, tribunals must not allow that breach to automatically dictate its conclusions on unfair dismissal. Having said that, breach of the implied term will still be a very important relevant factor when assessing fairness (Awan v ICTS UK Ltd - EAT).

It is automatically unfair to dismiss an employee for taking part in the activities of an independent trade union. Union officials who are also employees will lose this protection where they are found to have acted wholly unreasonably or maliciously in carrying out their functions. But where is the line drawn?

The Court of Appeal confirmed a trade union official was automatically unfairly dismissed despite misuse of confidential information. In the Court's view, it is not uncommon for a union representative to be given, without soliciting it, information that he or she realises has been obtained without the owner's consent. Although it might be said that the only correct course in such circumstances would be to decline the information or destroy it, the court was 'not here concerned with an ethics seminar'. Instead the key question was whether the very limited way in which Mr Morris made use of the obviously illegally obtained information (forwarding it to HR and insisting on a meeting to discuss the contents) was a 'sufficient departure from good industrial relations practice to take his conduct outside the scope of 'trade union activities' .

The Court held the line had not been crossed. At most, some sort of warning for storing and not deleting the information might have been appropriate. The official's conduct was not outside the scope of 'trade union activities' and he was therefore entitled to the statutory automatic unfair dismissal protection (Morris v Metrolink RATP Dev Ltd).

On the tax front, since 6 April the way that termination payments are taxed has changed. All payments in lieu of notice are now treated as earnings subject to tax and class 1 NICs. Effectively, employers are required to subject to tax an amount equivalent to the employee's basic pay (as defined in the new rules) if notice is not worked. However, planned changes making termination payments above £30,000 subject to class 1A NICs (employer liability only) have been postponed even further to April 2020, which is good news for employers.

While case law on transfers of undertakings has been relatively quiet this year we have had some interesting cases and some rare examples:

A renewed warning that if a parent company takes over the day-to-day running of the business of a subsidiary, this may result in a TUPE transfer of the subsidiary's employees to the parent. Significant care should be taken when a parent company decides to show more of an interest in the business of its subsidiary (whether following a share acquisition or otherwise). If the parent starts making decisions and issuing directions in a manner which suggests that it has assumed control of the subsidiary, it could inadvertently become the employer. In Guvera Ltd v Butler a parent company learned that lesson at some considerable cost, with awards for failing to inform and consult on the intra-group transfer amounting to £3.5 million having been made to the numerous claimants in this case.

European case-law in line with existing UK case-law that a temporary cessation of activities prior a transfer does not necessarily prevent the existence of a transfer of undertaking (Colino Sigüenza - CJEU).

A reminder that in assessing whether there has been a service provision change (SPC) to multiple new providers, the effect of fragmentation must be considered when identifying the relevant activity. In some cases, the way a service is carried out post-transfer will be a relevant consideration in determining whether the activities are fundamentally the same as those carried out by the outgoing contractor. It is important to assess the issue of fragmentation early on in the analysis, because in some cases the fragmentation will be so acute that it will no longer be possible to say that there has been a service provision change (London Care Ltd v Henry and others - EAT).

EAT guidance on the meaning of 'undertaking', 'economic entity' and 'administrative function', which is rarely seen in domestic cases. A useful round-up of case law (both domestic and European) in relation to services or entities performing functions within the public sector (Nicholls and others v London Borough of Croydon).

A rare example of a permitted change to terms and conditions following a TUPE transfer. A transferor was not prevented from withdrawing a travel time allowance. The genuine reason for its withdrawal was that it was outdated and unjustified, not for a reason related to the transfer (Tabberer v Mears Ltd - EAT).

It was hard to miss that on 25 May, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) together with the new Data Protection Act 2018 came into force introducing a raft of important changes to the data protection regime. Key changes include:

In July we received Court of Appeal guidance on the balancing test needed when dealing with a ""mixed data"" Subject Access Request and when a third party objects to their data being disclosed (B v General Medical Council):

Although the decision concerns the DPA 1998, it will continue to have relevance under the DPA 2018 and GDPR regime.

This year employers are reminded that checking references given by applicants is an important part of any recruitment process. Especially where experience equates to safety, doing so is critical.

In Francis-McGann v West Atlantic UK Ltd, a pilot applied for a captain position with a freight airline. He falsely claimed to have previously worked as a captain and gave as a referee Mr Desilijic Tiure - in hope that the reference would never be checked. The pilot was appointed as a captain before his references were checked and provided with training based on him already being an experienced captain.

The person who initially decided to hire Mr Francis-McGann was clearly not an obsessive Star Wars fan. When his references were checked, it became obvious that Mr Desilijic Tiure was fictitious, being Jabba Desilijic Tiure, better known as Jabba the Hutt of Star Wars fame! However that was merely the first Episode.

After being summarily dismissed, Mr Francis-McGann brought a tribunal claim for three months' unpaid notice pay! The tribunal had no qualms in dismissing his claim and allowing the employer's cross claim for recovery of training costs in accordance with a contractual clause in the sum of £4,725. The force was clearly not with Mr Francis-McGann.

In July, the EAT gave a warning to prospective employers considering withdrawing a job offer following the receipt of an unsatisfactory reference criticising an applicant's levels of absence in their previous job without first considering whether there was an underlying disability.

In South Warwickshire NHS Foundation Trust v Lee a prospective employer was liable for discrimination arising from disability when it withdrew a job offer after receiving and relying upon two unsatisfactory references. One of the references was unduly negative and inaccurate because it heavily relied on disability-related absences. The tribunal found the discriminatory reference had more than a minor influence on the new hirer's decision-maker. As such, it did not matter that the non-discriminatory reference may in and of itself have been sufficient cause to withdraw the job offer (although this may be relevant when awarding compensation). Lesson - consider references critically to assess whether any adverse comments in references may relate to disability necessitating follow-up enquiry.

Do employers need to match enhanced maternity pay for fathers taking Shared Parental Leave (ShPL)?

Early in April, the EAT in Ali v Capita Customer Management confirmed that it is not direct sex discrimination for employers to offer 14 weeks' enhanced maternity pay but only statutory ShPL pay.

While this case is in line with Government guidance and the traditional view, it is notable that Mr Ali's case concerned an enhanced maternity pay period of only 14 weeks which happens to be the minimum maternity leave period required under the EU Pregnant Workers Directive. As such, a question mark remains where enhanced contractual maternity pay period exceeds 14 weeks.

While we received at least a limited answer on the question of direct sex discrimination (subject to a pending appeal), the question of indirect sex discrimination is still very much up for grabs. Three weeks after the EAT handed down the Ali judgment, the EAT handed down its related judgment in Hextall v Chief Constable of Leicestershire Police.

In Hextall, the same question was considered through the prism of an indirect discrimination claim. In this case the EAT held the original tribunal incorrectly analysed the question of comparators and also failed to correctly identify the particular disadvantage. The case was therefore sent back to the tribunal. The question of indirect discrimination continues to be unresolved and we wait a further tribunal decision (determined on the correct legal basis). Like Ali, Hextall too is subject to a pending appeal.

While large private sector equal pay claims against several large supermarkets are making their way through the tribunal system and the usual endless preliminary issues, this year we have learned:

'Discrimination arising from a disability' is still a relatively new concept first introduced by section 15 of the Equality Act 2010. Over recent years we are gathering a body of case-law on the intricacies of this concept which involves the employer treating the employee ""unfavourably because of something arising in consequence"" of the employee's disability. Section 15 entails two distinct causative issues: The first involves examining the employer's state of mind: did the unfavourable treatment occur because of the employer's attitude to the relevant 'something'? The second is objective: is there a causal link between the disability and the 'something'?

This year we have learned:

In Donelien v Liberata UK, the Court of Appeal reassures employers that they can rely on the advice of occupational health advisers in determining whether an employee is disabled, so long as appropriate questions are raised and further clarification is sought where necessary.

An employer does not necessarily need to take every step possible to establish whether an employee is disabled in order to avoid having constructive knowledge of disability. The test is what an employer could reasonably be expected to know. In this case, the employer had not relied solely on an occupational health report stating that the employee was not disabled. It had also taken into account 'return to work' meetings and letters from the employee's GP. An employer's efforts need not be perfect and, in the circumstances, the employer had taken reasonable steps to ascertain the nature of the employee's illness and could not reasonably have been expected to do more particularly when dealing with an uncooperative employee.

To establish an indirect discrimination claim, the employee will need to show that the employer applied a ""provision, criterion or practice"" (PCP) that puts, or would put, those of the employee's protected group at a particular disadvantage compared to other groups. In Carreras v United First Partners Research, the Court of Appeal held that an expectation that an employee would work late does not have to be presented as an instruction to cause a disadvantage. If the disabled employee can establish the existence of a long-hours culture, this may be enough to amount to a 'practice' under the Equality Act 2010.

In Colt Technology Services Ltd v Brown, the EAT decided an important point regarding the effect of PHI on discrimination compensation, where the employee has had the opportunity to choose different levels of PHI cover through a workplace flexible benefits scheme.

The EAT considered the 'insurance exception' to the general rule that claimants should only be compensated for actual loss. The policy behind the exception is that an employer should not be able to benefit from an employee's prudence in taking out insurance, and so insurance pay outs are not set off against the employee's financial losses in those circumstances. In the context of a flexible benefits package - where an employee can choose the level of their insurance benefits in exchange for foregoing extra salary - this principle must be apportioned. The portion paid for by the employer without the employee foregoing extra salary will be offset (in this case 50%) and the portion for which the employee had foregone extra salary will not (in this case an additional 25%).

In relation to a claim for unlawful victimisation under the Equality Act 2010, ""giving false evidence or information, or making a false allegation, is not a protected act if the evidence or information is given, or the allegation is made in bad faith."" But does an ulterior motive for making a victimisation claim show bad faith?

In Saad v Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust, the EAT confirmed that honesty not motivation is key. The primary question for victimisation purposes is whether the employee has acted honestly in giving the evidence or information, or in making the allegation, that is relied on as a protected act. The existence of a predominant ulterior motive, while potentially relevant, is not the focus of the enquiry. In this case, just because the allegation was raised as a means to deflect criticism during a performance process did not automatically mean it was done in bad faith.

In Unite the Union v Nailard, the Court of Appeal reminds employers that harassment can be committed by inaction was well as action. Failure to act in relation to third party harassment which is brought to the employer's attention, may itself amount to harassment. If the reason for the failure to act was influenced, consciously or unconsciously, by the relevant protected characteristic, then that failure to act may itself amount to harassment. Employers should ensure that they train staff on dealing with harassment issues, make it clear that harassment from suppliers, clients and customers is not tolerated and keep clear records of issues arising.

In Bakkali v Greater Manchester Buses, the EAT point out that in harassment claims, context is a crucial element. Conduct ""related to"" a protected characteristic (in the test for harassment) is wider in scope than conduct ""because of"" a protected characteristic (in the test for direct discrimination). It requires a broader enquiry, involving ""a more intense focus"" on the context of the offending words or behaviour.

The Holy Grail: financially sustainable access to justice.

Following last year's abolition of tribunal fees by the Supreme Court, the number of claims has been steadily increasing. While the number of individual tribunal claims overall has not yet returned to the pre- 2013 introduction of the fees regime level, we have reached an important statistical milestone. September's quarterly statistics revealed that single-claim receipts are, for the first time, at a higher level than when fees were first introduced.

While the number of claims is set to rise over the near future, the Ministry of Justice in November announced that a new fee regime ""balancing tribunal funding and access to justice"" was ""in development"".

Four years after the introduction of mandatory ACAS early conciliation (EC) we finally have appellate level confirmation on how to apply the 'stop the clock' provisions. In April, the EAT confirmed the widely accepted view that the time limit to present a claim should always be extended by the number of days it takes to complete the EC procedure (Luton Borough Council v Haque).

There are 320 students in the Primary School, Pipariya in Bhojipura block of Bareilly district.

To inculcate the concept of banking and savings in children, a teacher in a primary school of Bareilly has set up a 'school bank' that is run by students and is meant to meet their stationery requirements during their stay on the campus.

To run this bank, students voluntarily contribute Rs 2 each while teachers also willingly make donations. There are 320 students in the Primary School, Pipariya in Bhojipura block of Bareilly district.

""This money is used in buying pencils, erasers, sharpeners, rulers, few books and kept in a cupboard in the principal's room, which they call green counter. Earlier, when students forgot to bring stationery, they used to go home to bring it, and in the process, often missed the class,"" explained assistant teacher Saurabh Shukla who has introduced the concept.

But all these are things of past. Now, on a day when students don't bring their pencil box, they don't go home. Instead, they walk into the 'school bank' and are allowed to borrow the same at zero interest for a day, he said.

Due to availability of stock in the 'school bank', the students are able to continue with their studies without any hindrances. The class also does not get disturbed. However, while going home after the school gets over, they are required to deposit the same back in the 'school bank', which is managed by students, said the teacher.

One Nikhil, a Class 5 student, has been appointed as manager of the 'School Bank'. But a teacher will assist him. ""The school teacher explained the concept. Everybody was convinced that it will be of great help for everyone. After whatever little money we could raise, teachers opened their wallet and heart to bridge the deficit. The school bank is now doing wonders,"" said Nikhil.

The 'School Bank' follows simple rules. Students of any class may avail the facilities of this bank. If a student fails to bring any stationery, he is not required to go back home and bring it. He just has to go to the bank, make an entry of the borrowed item in the register and attend class.

In case a student misplaces the borrowed item, he is supposed to give it back to the bank within 30 days. ""But below poverty line students are exempt from this rule. Students will be allowed to borrow things twice a week and seven times a month so that they do not make borrowing a habit,"" said Rinki, a student of the school.

The 'school bank' manager will be appointed from a senior class at regular intervals. Candidates with good academic record will be considered for the job, said the teacher.

The basic education department has appreciated the initiative of the school, and if found feasible, the same can be replicated in other schools too, said an official.

Published in Drug and Alcohol Dependence, the study indicates the need to develop interventions for patients who have positive urine drug tests in order to keep them engaged in care.

Office-based addiction treatment has become a key strategy in combating the opioid epidemic in the United States, where patients get treatment for their disease in a primary care setting with close monitoring during their recovery.

However, one of the questions in the current practice of is how best to monitor for illicit substance use, especially when patients do not report it. There has also been a lack of data regarding how frequently patients in these programs report substance use compared to finding a positive result by urine drug testing (UDT).

""It is important for providers to understand more about how the lab results compare to what patients tell us in a visit,"" said Sarah M. Bagley, MD, the study's co-author who is an internist and pediatrician at BMC and assistant professor of medicine and pediatrics at Boston University School of Medicine.

The researchers correlated the frequency of patients' self-reported substance use and the results of their UDTs. It showed that 76 percent of UDTs positive for cocaine and 57 percent of those positive for opioids occurred when patients did not disclose substance use in their treatment visit.

Additionally, rates of positive UDTs without self-reported substance use were higher earlier in treatment, possibly reflecting growing trust between the patient and the treatment team over time. Overall, the study reinforces the current guidelines that call for using UDTs to monitor for substance use in office-based addiction treatment but encourage less frequent testing as patients become stable in their recovery.

""Patients may not be self-reporting substance use early on in their treatment due to concerns about being discharged from programs if they disclose use, or they may feel shame about relapse and do not want to disappoint their care team"", said Bagley, who also serves as director of BMC's CATALYST Clinic for treatment of addiction in adolescents and young adults.

""These results provide important information for us, as providers, to improve how we treat patients with addiction both in the short and long term.""

For instance, mobile applications and websites that save customer data and offer real-time personalized services in response to changing customer habits. Furthermore, the omnichannel product experience that allows customers to initiate the transaction on a device and complete on another is one of the factors that drive the market. This has led to a responsive web design with a source code that adjusts based on the limitations of the screen or device.

The partnership and collaboration between the banks and fintech companies are the primary factors supporting the market. Most banks have launched their own online services to cater to the demand for the digital banking solutions. They are collaborating with the fintech companies and online service providers to enhance their customer base. For instance, in 2016, Clydesdale Bank & Yorkshire Bank collaborated to launch ""B"", a bank operating online only which provides a current account with debit and credit card facilities and contactless payment through mobile wallets such as Apple Pay and Android Pay. Other banks, such as Commercial Bank of Dubai, HSBC, and BNP Paribas, have also launched their online banking services to capitalize the growth in the fintech industry.

Castes of the students were found written before the names of the students in the attendance register of both the schools. In Vaishali school, they were even segregated in classrooms on the basis of their religion and caste.

Education department primary director Giriwar Dayal Singh suspended acting principal of GA Uchha Madhyamik Vidyalaya Meena Kumari at Lalganj block in Vaishali district and Kamlesh Kumar Swalambi of Uchha Vidyalaya Tenua at Kalyanpur block in East Champaran district after the district education officers of respective districts submitted a report in this connection.

In case of GA Uchha Madhyamik Vidyalaya, district education officer Sangita Sinha on her visit to the school found that the attendance register had caste of students mentioned before their names. The school also had separate sections for students belonging to separate castes. Acting principal Meera Kumari said, ""This practice was prevalent since 2014 and it was started by former principal Phool Chand Ansari as a tool to save time and quick implementation of government schemes catering to particular caste."" She added they had no intention of hurting the sentiments of anyone.

In case of Uchha Vidyalaya Tenua, no separate classroom was found. However, students had their castes mentioned before their names.

Calling the incident as unfortunate, state education minister Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma said, ""Such things cannot be tolerated. CM Nitish Kumar is working for the welfare of the common people and we do not believe in caste and religion"". He also ruled out a report that one student Anjali Kuamri of GA Uchha Vidayalaya, who took the matter to Vaishali DEO was deprived of the benefits. ""She will be honoured for her bold step,"" said Verma."

The market dynamic forces have been determined after conducting a detailed study of the Global Recycled Metal Market.

Europe recycled metal market share is projected witness gains of more than 4% during the forecast timeframe. This is primarily due to stringent laws and legislations imposed by environmental regulatory bodies in Europe, which has triggered metal recycling to reduce the carbon footprint and help save the environment from hazardous waste generated. For instance, Directive 2008/98/EC imposed by European Commission defines basic concepts related to waste management.

Sample copy of this report @

www.gminsights.com/request-sample/detail/2792

According to a new research report by Global Market Insights, Inc. Recycled Metal Market size is forecast to exceed USD 125 billion by 2024

Industry Growth drivers are

* Rapidly growing construction industry in the Asia Pacific and the Middle East

* Strong product demand from electrical & electronics industry in North America

* Stringent & supporting legislations for metal recycling in Europe

It signifies terms and conditions related to waste, recycling and recovery. Moreover, Directive 2012/19/EU prevent the generation of electrical & electronic waste and to promote reuse, recycling and other forms of recovery to reduce the quantity of waste to be eliminated, whilst also improving the environmental performance. These trends are likely to make significant impact on the reprocessed metal market size by 2024.

Recycled non ferrous metal market size was valued more than USD 90 billion in 2017. Non ferrous metals such as aluminum, copper, lead, precious metals and other metals such as nickel, zinc, tin, palladium, etc. These metals find wide-ranging applications across construction, electrical & electronics, transport, consumer goods, industrial machinery, nuclear, military and several other end-user industry. For instance, lead is widely used electronics in batteries, ammunition, cable sheathing, etc.

Lead batteries are used in transport industry and constituted approximately 35% of the total industry share in terms of volume in 2017. These trends will help boost the global recycled metal market share by 2024.

In terms of volume, recycled metal market share for building & construction constituted close to 45% of the total business share in 2017. It is mainly due to comprehensive recycled metal applications in the building & construction industry. For example, ferrous metals (iron and steel) are broadly used in the construction of large steel frameworks in the building, bridges, drainage components and various other architectural frameworks.

Furthermore, non ferrous metals including aluminum, copper and lead are also utilized in the building & construction sector. Lead sheets are used for roofing, cladding of vertical walls, soundproofing in partitions and ceilings in office, school and hotel buildings. These trends will help make considerable contribution to reprocessed metal market size by 2024.

North America electrical & electronics industry is on the rise which is due to consistently changing consumer's preferences and continuous technology upgradation. For instance, the electrical & electronics industry was valued more than USD 900 billion in 2016 and accounted for a total of 21% of the global electrical & electronics industry. These trends will drive reprocessed metal demand owing to its wide spread applications in metal plating electronics via electrodeposition. It provides improved corrosion resistance, enhanced electrical conductivity and improved solderability which helps in protecting against wear.

Furthermore, precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum, rhodium, etc. are also widely applicable in the electronics industry owing to its unique physical and chemical properties which provides reliability to the electronics sector. It will help attain significant gains to the global recycled metal market share by 2024.

Ineffective metal reprocessing is a key constraint which is probable to impede the global reprocessed metal market size by 2024. For instance, only 40% of the total copper produced is attained from recycling and 33% of the total aluminum produced is attained from recycling process. Nevertheless, rising emphasis on metal processing and reusability to reduce carbon footprint and impact of hazardous waste will generate plentiful opportunities for the reprocessed metal market size by 2024.

Key reprocessed metal market players are Sims Metal Management, Steel Dynamics, European Metal Recycling, Nucor Corporation, ELG HanielGmbh, Schnitzer Steel and Novelis. The market players are expanding their capacity to process metal to attain profitability in the market. For example, Novelis announced to build flat-rolled aluminum plant in January 2018 in Kentucky U.S. for USD 300 million.

And this is exactly the situation that we are facing today in our Khasi-Pnar society. And who could possibly feel the direct threat and impact of this situation are the innocent citizens who are not politically or materialistically ambitious in life. From various incidences that have happened in the state recently and during the past few years, we see the breakdown of the rule of law and flouting of the law despite many prohibitions that are in place which I need not elaborate. Even though we always stake claims on customary laws that govern our society, they are mostly in oral form lacking the appropriate authority and power of modern jurisprudence. And the fact that the Khasis never had their own scripts is just another analogy to indicate the nature of hesitation of the people to come under any contract law or agreement but to rely solely on the conscience and conduct of the person, which is not suitable for the administration of justice in a modern state.

On the issue of leadership crisis, this is not a new development but is as old as the community itself. The primary reasons are perhaps that the Khasis have migrated to these hills not as a whole bunch of community or tribe but as individual clans in different times and seasons. And if this is the case then obviously there were frequent conflicts and misunderstandings on governance, land for settlement, etc. Hence, in some instances, these problems have percolated to every subsequent generation and its nature is also being inherited by many individuals and groups till date. But the prominent among these was on who should be the in leading roles because all clans are equal in status. Therefore, the most ideal situation is to have a third person to preside over them such as the 'Chieftain' or the 'Syiem'. Thus in most cases the Syiem is always from outside their circle or an outsider.

As a community we have not been able to raise good leaders for the society because we are so divided politically and culturally into various groups of different thoughts and ideologies which is a result of that crisis. And the reason why I am saying this is because I do not see any capable Chief Minister from among the Khasi-Pnar community as of now and in the near future. The root of the problem lies in the fact that people at large have never understood the basic principles and values of leadership. And those who think and see themselves as leaders are relying exclusively on external factors such as finance, qualification and strategies which can be easily acquired but yet are not intrinsic human characters that will define true leadership. Self-styled leaders may be plenty but genuine and systematic leadership comes from the system within. We have therefore failed as a community and the state as a whole in this aspect.

Apart from this traditional nature, another major modern factor that has contributed immensely to this ongoing leadership crisis is the exemption of this topic from the entire educational curriculum. Right from the very inception of our educational system, this issue was perceived as academically irrelevant and unnecessary. The reason I am saying this is because nowhere in the past, during our school and college days have we ever come across the term leadership. And the primary goal of education was and is to get a government job at any cost in any capacity be it technical, clerical, secretarial and teaching as a security for life. Leadership is such a term which is strange and unfamiliar to the learning community during the past generations and in the present as well. Therefore, there is a lack of leadership skills in every department and sector of governance to ignite the mechanism of growth and development. Leadership et al is only learned in other courses of higher studies and prominently in the Management Institutes. Thank God for such institutions that are now available in our state but how many students from the native state are getting the privilege to enroll in these institutions. The CBSE on the other hand has gone much ahead by introducing leadership right from the primary level. This is outstanding because the opportunity to experience and taste the idea, concepts and challenges of leadership should begin from a very early age. Here again we can question the wisdom of our education policy and the competency therein in the mission and vision to shape the lives of our children and the future generation.

Look at the political parties that are functioning in our state and their leaders. Do we have any hope on any of them? They are there only for the sake of power and position during elections and when they lose the elections they just vanish into thin air. I just happened to watch a programme in a local TV channel attended by our Deputy Chief Minister as Chief Guest on the anniversary celebration of one local church where he unfortunately said, 'Katba nang bun ki balang, katta nang bun ki jingsniew' (the more churches, the more the crimes). What a silly statement from the Deputy CM! Does he mean to say that churches are propagating crimes? As a responsible person he should have put things the other way round. Just because he is in a position of power he has no authority to define things lavishly. It is here that leadership is also like an image that reflects the entire quality of an individual because a simple statement may ruin and damage the whole community thereby hurting the sentiments of many sincere adherents.

We always blame lack of unity for the sorry state of affairs, but in fact unity is the synchronization of each and every effort where we are all components of that effort. The concept of leadership as perceived by many especially the rural population is the strength of financial muscles. What a pathetic situation when money decides who gets elected and who forms the government. So what can we expect from people who pay money for votes? Nothing much, except that they will do all they can to recover their investment in the next five year.

Therefore, there is an immediate need to inculcate the values and qualities of leadership right from the primary level of schooling in order to build the state and community for the future."

These days, Sagar Singh frets about the academic future of his daughter who studies at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Delhi's Cantonment area.

""There are hardly any teachers there. She often tells me that kids sit clueless as teachers are forced to teach subjects they themselves don't understand well. I wonder if she will remain underprepared for challenges ahead in life, he said.

Singh sums up the crisis in Delhi government schools which have only 35,034 regular teachers against a sanctioned strength of 64,096. A shortage of 29,062 regular hands (45.34 per cent) has left the teachers exhausted and students vulnerable. A total of 15,04,627 students are enrolled in 1,024 schools run by the AAP government.

There are 22,016 guest teachers that take the existing number to 57,050 but they work on daily-wage contracts that must be renewed every year. Even if guest teachers are factored in, Delhi government schools are short of 7,046 (10.99 per cent) teaching hands.

Saroj Sharma, a primary teacher at a Greater Kailash school said, On several occasions, I have had to teach higher-secondary class subjects. We are overworked and stressed. We are filling in for many others. School heads are aware of the crisis, but nothing has been done.

Neeru Loriya, a teacher coordinator at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in RK Puram Sector 4, also said that several subjects are not being taught properly. Barkha Kumari, a Class VI student at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Rohini said, My Class has 50 students. We need more teachers to ensure we're taught well. It's not that the government isn't working at all. After the Aam Aadmi Party came to power in Delhi in 2014, the government has built 48 schools.

But where are the teachers? We have sent several reminders to the government. Nothing has happened, said a teacher at a Pusa Road school. Most regular posts are filled through promotions. But they have not happened since 2013, he said.

Sanjay Goel, head of the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) told Mail Today, We're aware of the problem. Each year, guest teachers are being enrolled to minimise the shortage. Avdhesh Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, also said, There is a problem. But the government is hiring guest teachers to tackle it.

But facts tell a different tale. In July, the Delhi government had announced that schools would get 9,000 guest teachers by mid-August. It did not happen. Hiring guest teachers is anyway no solution to this huge crisis, said Ajay Veer Singh, general secretary of the last Government School Teachers' Association (GSTA) elected in 2014. GSTA elections have not taken place since 2014.

So its demands have not been heard effectively, its office-bearers claim. We have asked for elections. But education department officials have not paid any heed. The future of government school teachers is dark, said Singh. GSTA has a three-year term.

On Wednesday, The Indian Express reported that the north and south bodies had pulled out of the survey, claiming it was being done with a ""political motive"" by the Delhi government with the intent ""of showing corporation schools in a bad light"". The three primary areas on which schools are being evaluated are safety and security; teaching and learning; and community participation and social integration.

Distancing itself from the Delhi government, the DCPCR stated that ""the commission is an independent statutory body created by an Act of Parliament, over which the Government of NCT of Delhi exercises no administrative control"". It further stated that evaluation is being conducted by the Quality Council of India -- a Government of India body -- and that the commission's involvement in the data collection exercise is minimal.

Countering allegations of discrimination, the letter states that all bodies are being evaluated on common parameters and the standards against which Delhi government schools are being evaluated are ""more stringent"" as they include parameters which do not apply to MCD schools like CBSE results, career counselling, bullying incidents and menstrual hygiene.

Claiming that both civic bodies have been part of discussions and decision-making processes regarding the school evaluation project since November 2017 -- when the proposal was first tabled -- the DCPCR also said it oriented 230 heads of schools from the North body on the evaluation process. It said it had offered to do the same for the South body, but received no response. ""This shows that the commission is not interested in mere evaluation or find(ing) faults, but a serious improvement in the functioning of the schools"", it said.

The commission said ""the (evaluation) teams shall keep visiting the schools, expecting fullest cooperation,"" and sought a copy of the order or resolutions passed by the house or education committee within two days.

North body chairperson of the Education Committee Ritu Goel said she is yet to read the letter and can comment only after she does. Her counterpart in the south body Nandini Sharma didn't respond to calls and messages."

About 25,000 schools -- including primary, upper primary and high schools -- will get the biometric equipment. Already, the Aadhaar biometric attendance system was being used in 9,349 government-run schools in 12 districts across Telangana. Now, the Directorate of School Education decided to extend the system to all government-run schools and sent a proposal to the State government seeking budgetary support for installing the machines.

The department tied up with Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) and Telangana State Technology Services (TSTS) for implementing the Aadhaar biometric attendance. One biometric machine was being provided for every 100 students, with managements being directed to record attendance of teaching and non-teaching staff twice a day -- morning and evening -- and for students, before serving the mid-day meal.

""The attendance recorded on the biometric machines will be matched with the bills submitted by school managements to ascertain the number of students consuming the mid-day meal. As it is linked with Aadhaar, the managements cannot duplicate admissions,"" an official said.

The machines and software were designed in such a way that biometric fingerprints captured are immediately verified with the biometric details available with UIDAI using Internet and is reflected in the dashboard of the School Education Department's website. A software was being developed to transmit the captured details offline or when network is available in the schools located in remote areas.

""Most students and teachers in schools where the machines are already in use are giving their attendance on it. The department sent a proposal to the government seeking budget for implementing the system in all schools from the next academic year,"" an official said, adding that there were some network issues in certain schools located in remote areas with these being sorted out."

Malnutrition is the most widespread condition affecting the health of children. It is concerned primarily with the part played by nutrients in body growth, development and maintenance; food means not only proteins, fats, minerals, vitamins and other nutrients- but much more; it is part of security and civilization. Nations and civilizations are linked together not only by ideas, but also by bread. Hunger and malnutrition are problems everywhere and have harassed mankind and threatened peace throughout history. Malnutrition has been defined as ""a pathological state resulting from a relative or absolute deficiency or excess of one or more essential nutrients"". The effects of malnutrition on the community are both direct and indirect. The direct effects are nutrition deficiency diseases and indirect effects are a high morbidity and mortality among young children. According to data collected by National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau in 10 states in India, the percentage of preschool children suffering from severe, moderate, mild and no malnutrition was 8.4, 34.4 and 14.3 respectively. Today, malnutrition is less visible. We need more sophisticated understanding of this dangerous problem. Children of all shapes and sizes can be malnourished, since nourishment is dependent upon nutrient intake not body weight. Physically, these malnourished children do not appear nutrient deficient. They are malnourished, because their foods lack the nutrients their bodies need. Since their bodies are still growing, children are particularly affected.According to food production, it is said that there will be very little malnutrition in India today if all the food available can be equally distributed in accordance with physiological needs. Health and other services like nutritional surveillance, nutritional rehabilitation, nutritional supplementations and health education are the key elements in identifying the realistic picture of nutritional status and its development. The surviving underweight children likely to be stunted will suffer from frequent illness; lower mental ability and achievement, in schooling are more likely to drop out of primary school.

The diets and nutritional status of urban slum children is far away from being satisfactory. The nutritional status of slum children is worst amongst all urban groups and is poorer than the rural average. Three fourths of the world's malnourished children are Asian.

Improved healthcare system

Infections like malaria, measles and diarrhea are prevalent in our society and they precipitate acute malnutrition among children and infants. A good health care system that provides immunization, oral rehydration, periodic deworming, early diagnosis and proper treatment of common illnesses can go a long way in preventing malnutrition in the society.

Nutrition education

People can be educated on

* The nutritional quality of common foods

* Importance and nutritional quality of various locally available and culturally accepted low cost foods

* Importance of exclusive breastfeeding for six months and continuing to breast feed up to two years or beyond.

* Damage caused by irrational beliefs and cultural practices of feeding

* Recipes for preparing proper weaning foods and good supplementary food from locally available low cost foods.

* importance of including milk, eggs, meat or pulses in sufficient quantities in the diet to enhance the net dietary protein value.

* Importance of feeding children and adults during illness

* Importance and advantages of growing a kitchen garden

* Importance of immunizing their children and following proper sanitation in their day to day life.

Early detection of malnutrition and intervention

* The longer the developmental delays remain uncorrected, the greater the chance of permanent effects and hence intervention must occur during pregnancy and first three years of life.

* A well recorded growth chart can detect malnutrition very early. Velocity of growth is more important than the actual weight at a given time

* If growth of the child is slowed or is arrested as shown by flat curve on the growth card, physician should be alerted and any hidden infection or any reason for nutritional deficiency must be evaluated and taken care of.

* If growth chart is not maintained, anthropometric indices like, weight, height mid arm circumference, and chest circumference etc. can be measured and used for evaluation of nutrition.

Nutrition supplementation

Usually, biologically vulnerable groups like pregnant women, infants, preschool going and school going children are targeted by various welfare measures conducted by the government. Calories, proteins and micronutrients like iron, vitamin A and zinc can be supplemented.

Direct nutrition and health interventions

Infections like malaria, measles and diarrhea are prevalent in our society and they precipitate acute malnutrition among children and infants. A good health care system that provides immunization, oral rehydration, periodic deworming, early diagnosis and proper treatment of common illnesses can go a long way in preventing malnutrition in the society.

In both schools, students reported to having seen a lizard in the food they were served. What is strange, however, is that the two incidents were reported from two different districts of the state - Bagalkote and Ballary.

In Chikkamagi government higher primary school in Hunagunda taluk in Bagalkote district, one student spotted a lizard in the food that he was served. A few other students are said to have started eating by the time he had alerted his teachers.

Those students who had already eaten were made to throw up the food immediately. A hundred and five students from the school were then taken to the hospital for observation.

""All of them are out of danger. As a precautionary measure they were all brought to the hospital. Out of them, 101 were discharged. The other four would be discharged by Friday,"" Ananth Desai, DHO, Bagalkote, told CNN-News18.

Following the incident, three cooks at the school have been dismissed.

""Until Monday, meals won't be provided at the school. The students will now have that fear. We will speak to the students and parents, take them into confidence and then start providing meals,"" said MR Kamakshi, DDPI, Bagalkote.

In Agaluru, government primary school in Siruguppa taluk in Bellary district, at least 40 students were taken to the hospital after the mid-day meal was suspected to be poisoned.

""There has been allergic reaction in kids after they had the mid-day meal in school. There was lizard in it is what they have said. Some of them had vomited. They could have diarrhoea too. But they are all safe. They have been given intravenous fluids,"" Arun Rangarajan, SP, Ballary, said.

The students were taken to a primary health centre and 19 of them were later taken to a government hospital.

""One hundred and fifty nine students were present in the school at the time. Forty students who had eaten the meal were hospitalised. All of them are safe,"" said A Shridhar, DDPI, Bellary.

The accused Balakrushna Mohapatra has gone absconding and a search has been launched by the police to apprehend him. Mohapatra had allegedly sexually assaulted a Class IX student and boarder of the girls hostel the night before Ganesh Puja this year. The girl was taking part in the decoration of the puja mandap in the school when the headmaster committed the heinous act.

He had allegedly asked the other girls to leave the room and attempted to rape her. Thereafter too, he had frequently molested the girl and shut her up by threatening her of dire consequences. He had even threatened to not allow her to appear in the matriculation exams if she disclosed anything. The girl had informed her parents but they also kept quiet out of fear for the safety of their daughter's life and future.

The matter, however, came to light recently when a group of villagers complained to the Collector Parag Harshad Gavali about the nefarious activities going on in the school. The Collector asked District Welfare Officer (DWO) and Sub-Collector to inquire into the allegations. The victim had mustered the courage to reveal everything before the visiting officials. Based on their report, a show cause was issued to Mohapatra. As his reply was not satisfactory, the Collector placed him under suspension. The DWO also filed a police complaint in the connection.

Sources said in the past, Mohapatra was the president of District Primary Teachers Association but he was removed from the post after similar allegations were levelled against him. Villagers had alleged that since he was close to politicians of the area, he was not transferred for the last 18 years."

While 69% of the rural respondents found 'better employment opportunities' as an issue, only 18% considered 'training for jobs' as an issue. This shows the clear disparity between the employment available and the skill-set in the minds of the rural people.

The agricultural-based issues are 'Agricultural loan availability', 'Electricity for agriculture', 'Agriculture subsidy for seeds/fertilizers', 'Higher Price Realization for farm products' and 'Availability of water for agriculture' taking the third, tenth, fifth, eighth and ninth positions respectively with 47%, 32%, 44%, 36% and 35% of the rural respondents considering it as an issue respectively.

'Better Roads', 'Better Public Transport', 'Drinking Water', and 'Empowerment of Women and security' were all voted by 44%, 28%, 39% and 30% of the respondents respectively.

'Empowerment of women and security' was fourth at 36%.

The important issues are mainly 'infrastructure-based' with 'Better Hospitals/ Primary Health-Care Centres', 'Better Roads', 'Better public transport', and 'Facility for cyclists and pedestrians on roads' taking second, third, fifth, seventh and eighth positions with 52%, 43%, 35%, 34% and 29% of the urban respondents considering them as an issue respectively.

The survey identified the important factors that people take into account before voting for a particular candidate. Issues like whether the candidate matters the most or other issues like caste/religion of the candidate and CM candidate of the party.

The survey asked respondents about the reason they vote for a particular candidate. They were given five choices - candidate, party, party's chief ministerial candidate, religion and caste. Respondents had to rank each of these as either very important, important or not important. Taking the weighted average across respondents for each of these factors, we can gauge the aggregate importance of each of the five factors across all voters.

It is interesting that, according to the survey, the most important factor for voters is the CM Candidate, followed by the Candidate's party and the candidate. The least important factors were the distribution of cash, liquor, gifts, etc. and the Candidate's caste or religion."

VAN DHAN YOJANA

The Ministry of Tribal Affairs has launched a game-changing initiative for tribal people - The Van Dhan Yojana, with the launch of the first Van Dhan Vikas Kendra at Bijapur by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi on 14th April, 2018. It aims to provide skill upgradation and capacity building training and setting up of primary processing and value addition facility.

As per the plan, TRIFED will facilitate establishment of MFP-led multi-purpose Van Dhan Vikas Kendras, a cluster of 10 SHGs comprising of 30 tribal MFP gatherers each, in the tribal areas. This initiative is aimed at mainstreaming the tribal community by promoting primary level value addition to MFP at grassroots level. Through this initiative, the share of tribals in the value chain of Non-Timber Forest Produce is expected to rise from the present 20% to around 60%. About 3000 such Van Dhan Kendras are proposed to be set up in two years in the forested Tribal Districts of the country. To begin with, this initiative is proposed to be taken up on priority in the 39 Districts with more than 50% tribal population and to then gradually be expanded to other Tribal Districts in India.The initiative aims to promote MFPs-centric livelihood development of tribal gatherers and artisans. MFP or what may be more aptly referred to as Non Timber Forest Produces (NTFPs) are the primary source of income and livelihood for about 5 crore tribal people in the country.

Highlights of the Mahotsav were - Live demos for traditional tribal food and drink; Lac bangles; demo for 4 different schools of painting i.e. Warli, Pithora, Gond and Saura; Fashion show for tribal textiles, fashion accessories etc. Tribal products displayed at Mahotsav included heritage collection of Sarees, Men's collection including cotton, woollen and silk Jackets, Kurtas from MP, Rajasthan and Jharkhand; Bell Metal from Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh; Paintings from Gujrat, Maharashtra, Odisha and MP; Woollens from HP, Uttaranchal and J&K; Honey, spices dry fruits etc. from different States; Tribal Jewellery from Himachal, Odisha, North-East, MP, Telangana; Pottery from Manipur, Rajasthan; Home Furnishing from Rajasthan, North East, MP, UP; Bags collection from Gujrat, Telangana, Jharkhand; and Grass Mat and Coir collection from West Bengal, Jharkhand and Kerala.

NGO GRANTS

Implementation of Online application system ""NGO Grants Online Application & Tracking System"" (www.ngograntsmota.gov.in) activated for processing NGO proposals under the scheme of ""Grant-in-aid to Voluntary Organizations working for welfare of Scheduled Tribes"" has resulted in quicker information flow and smoother implementation of the scheme besides increasing the number of applications.

MINIMUM SUPPORT PRICE FOR MINOR FOREST PRODUCE

The scheme for 'Mechanism for Marketing of Minor Forest Produce (MFP) through Minimum Support Price (MSP) and development of Value Chain for MFP"" (known as MSP for MFPin short) was launched in the year 2013-14 and it then covered only ten MFP items and was applicable to the Schedule V States only. Subsequently, in October 2016 the extent and coverage of the scheme was increased by adding more MFP items and also rendering the scheme applicable country wide. The MSP of ten items that were originally incorporated into the scheme were further revised in November 2017. The issues of further expanding the list of MFP items as also further revising the MSP of the existing MFP items are being considered by the Ministry."

A Ganesh Nadar/Rediff.com brings you their inspiring story.

IMAGE: M Aaris, A M Siddesh Hariharan and I Hari Govind won six medals in the 5th Open International Semi Contact Shotokan Karate Championship held in Sri Lanka on October 6 and 7. Photographs, Videos: A Ganesh Nadar/Rediff.com

At a time when most parents in India don't mind paying a hefty donation to send their children to English medium schools in hope of a brighter future, a municipal school in Tamil Nadu is trying to do something different.

The Pallavaram Municipality Primary School in Zameen Pallavaram (also called Old Pallavaram), on the outskirts of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, is trying to build skills in students outside of academics, and excel in contact sports like karate and brainy ones like chess.

And they are going out of their way to arrange funds so that they can send their students to international competitions to gain exposure as well as win accolades.

Unlike most civic schools which are either defunct due to lack of teachers and/or students or in dilapidated shape, this school is well maintained.

It has tall and clean whitewashed buildings. There are classes from 1 to 5 with a strength of 580 students and 17 teachers.

When I visit the school, Headmaster N Karthikeyan is addressing students from class 5 who are sitting cross-legged on the ground.

As we are speaking, a young lad enters the class room.

""I want to meet Karate Anna,"" the boy, who had heard about R S Sreenivasan, the school's dedicated karate teacher, says.

""We took only three students to Sri Lanka and came back with six medals -- five gold and one bronze,"" Sreenivasan tells me later.

The three students from the school -- M Aaris (class 2), A M Siddesh Hariharan and I Hari Govind, both from Class 4 -- participated in the 5th Open International Semi Contact Shotokan Karate Championship in Sri Lanka on October 6 and 7.

Some 1,500 students from Australia, Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan competed in the championship.

At another tournament in Aranthangi, Tamil Nadu, where all the five southern states participated, this school won the overall shield and was also the only government school to have won prizes.

It started in 2016 when the government of Tamil Nadu issued a notification that schools should have karate classes for girls so that they learnt self-defence.

""If we only trained the girls, there would never be enough students. Therefore I decided to train the boys, too,"" Karthikeyan recalls how the idea came about.

A Geetha, a teacher at the school, recommended Sreenivasan's name.

A day after the government circular was issued, Sreenivasan began training the school's students.

""We told the master that we would pay Rs 100 per student. He expected at least Rs 5,000 a month for two classes a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays between 4.30 pm to 5.30 pm,"" says Karthikeyan.

""These are poor students. Some pay and some don't. I pay the difference so that the Master is not disappointed,"" he adds.

IMAGE: Young students practise karate on the school grounds.

Arranging funds for the Sri Lankan tournament wasn't easy either.

But help poured in from all quarters.

""Whenever there is a small shortage of funds I pay from my pocket and if we need more I have a few friends that help out,"" says Sreenivasan.

Tamil Nadu Education Minister K A Sengottaiyan was so pleased to know that a government school was participating in an international tournament that he called the headmaster and asked what he could do to help.

The minister sponsored the air tickets to Sri Lanka and also requested government officials on the island to look after the kids.

""We were received at the airport and well looked after. We had a vehicle at our disposal. They had arranged for our stay with separate accommodation for the kids,"" says Karthikeyan.

WATCH R S Sreenivasan train the girl students at the Municipal Primary School in Zameen Pallavaram.

It's not always the funds that bother Karthikeyan.

Just when we are speaking, a lady comes in with her son, a student at the school.

""I asked you to come because he was supposed to be here at 6 am for a tournament but he didn't come,"" says Karthikeyan.

""He overslept,"" the mother answers.

""He will oversleep, he is a child, you should have woken him up. There were 30 students, you don't expect me to call everyone of them in the morning.""

""The tournament and travel fee was Rs 300. I can't ask the tournament organisers for a refund nor can I ask the transporter. I don't mind paying as long as he participates. He did not participate, but someone else could have and maybe even won the prize there. I didn't want him to win, but I definitely wanted him to participate. Next time, don't let him sleep,"" the teacher admonishes the parent.

Karate is not the only game the students excel at. They have won medals in chess too. The Thirumal Chess Academy, Mudichur, coaches the students for free.

""We offered to pay a nominal amount, but they refused,"" said the encouraging headmaster, who proudly displays the prizes his students have won in chess and karate.

""We also have carrom here, which I teach. It's free. After school they can play as long as they want,"" the headmaster adds.

WATCH: R S Sreenivasan trains the boys at the school.

Students at the school recently participated in the national karate tournament in Kanyakumari.

""What we really require is to participate in an international tournament in Malaysia and Singapore in May 2019. The cost per child will be Rs 75,000,"" says Karthikeyan. ""We are planning to send a dozen kids and a coach. We need about Rs 1,000,000 which we hope to get from our well-wishers.""

Pics/Sayyed Sameer Abedi

If you have ever been on SV Road at Santacruz around noon, you must have seen the yellow school buses with Podar Education Complex labelled on either side. These are parked along both sides of the road leading to the RN Podar School. The chaos when school is over brings the traffic to a standstill for about an hour on weekdays, a problem that has persisted for many years.

As the school hours of Lilavatibai Podar School and R N Podar School both end within few minutes of each other, the space left after the buses are parked along the footpaths, is occupied by students catching with each other before going home. The primary section at RN Podar School ends at 12.15 pm and the secondary school ends just a few minutes later. Amidst this, are parents who arrive on their scooters, in auto-rickshaws and even in private cars to pick up their children, adding to the chaos. Due to the lack of space on the footpaths, many parents have no choice but to stand in the middle of the road while looking for their child.

Students leaving for the day chat with friends, adding to traffic issues

One-way road adds to chaos

The road between RN Podar and Lilavatibai Podar School is known as Andrews Road. Vehicles can only move in one direction on it. Many vehicle drivers, especially autos and two-wheeler riders can be seen disregarding traffic rules as they try to navigate their way through the crowd of students. Apart from the traffic congestion that creates a problem for parents, local residents, shop keepers as well as motorists just passing through the area, the safety of the children is also an issue. On the road adjacent to RN Podar School, the building that previously was the Podar International School is currently being re-developed. On December 11, a few workers could be seen lifting a massive grille from the ground. The grille dangled just above a school bus which had students sitting inside. Despite being a hazard, none of the school staff on the road seemed bothered by it.

Solutions proposed

Every school has been mandated to form a transport committee that has proposed and implemented solutions to the traffic issues. The school's principal Avnita Bir said that a transport committee which includes members of the PTA has been constituted. The committee meets with the transport department and the traffic police once every six months to find solutions to the traffic issues in the area. ""Letters from the PTA have been sent to the traffic police department repeatedly in the past and for some time they would block the road during dispersal hours. But then a few months ago, they opened the road to the traffic again. While we have the co-operation of the traffic police, it is also our responsibility to ensure easy movement on the road, and our system and guards deal with the traffic,"" Bir said."

Prevalence of obesity and growth in health consciousness have increased the adoption of fitness equipment. Furthermore, rise in the number of gym memberships, in-home equipment sales, growth in urban population, and certain government initiatives fuel the adoption of fitness equipment. One of the factors that could limits the growth opportunity is the high price of the fitness equipment. However, improvement in lifestyle, increase in youth population, and rise in per-capita income in developing countries are anticipated to ensure the overall market growth.

The global fitness equipment market is segmented based on type, user, and region. Based on type, it is categorized into cardiovascular training equipment, strength training equipment, and others. Cardiovascular training equipment is expected to dominate the market, in terms of value, throughout the forecast period on account of its greater penetration in the developed markets such as, the U.S. and Europe and the relatively higher prices over strength equipment. Users for fitness equipment are home consumer, health clubs/gym, and other commercial users. Other commercial users are further classified into hotels, corporate offices, hospital & medical centers, and public institutions. The health club/gym segment is expected to lead the market throughout the analysis period owing to the significant rise in the number of health clubs and memberships.

Based on region, the market is studied across North America (U.S., Canada, and Mexico), Europe (UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Benelux, and rest of Europe), Asia-Pacific (Japan, Korea, China, India, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Vietnam, Australia, Malaysia, and rest of Asia-Pacific), and Latin America, Middle East & Africa (LAMEA ‐ Brazil, and rest of Latin America). North America continues to be the market leader throughout the analysis period of 2017‐2025. Asia-Pacific is expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period on account of the increasing demand and a larger youth population base in the region. Australia had 3,351 health clubs with total number of memberships in the range of 3.4‐3.5 million in 2014. High prevalence of sports culture, increase in health consciousness, and rise in expenditure on fitness are the factors expected to propel the growth of the fitness equipment market in the country.

Dr. Schwartz adds, ""The findings in this manuscript provide a critical breakthrough in understanding the cause and potentially the treatment of IPF by demonstrating that excess mucus in the small airways can cause lung fibrosis, in part, by impairing the mechanism of lung clearance. In aggregate, these discoveries have provided the means to identify an at-risk population, diagnose the disease prior to the development of irreversible scarring, focus on a unique therapeutic target (MUC5B) and a specific location in the lung (distal airway), and create a novel pathway for therapeutic intervention for a disease that is currently incurable.""

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is the most common type of progressive lung fibrosis. Over time, the scarring gets worse and it becomes hard to take in a deep breath and the lungs cannot take in enough oxygen. The average length of survival of patients with IPF is three to five years, and a critical unmet need is to identify patients before the lung is scarred irreversibly.

Mucociliary dysfunction is an emerging paradigm in lung diseases. Previously considered a characteristic specific to obstructive diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and genetic diseases such as primary ciliary dyskinesia and cystic fibrosis, the importance of mucins, mucus, and mucociliary interactions has surfaced in diseases of the lung periphery, such as adenocarcinoma and IPF.

The investigators on the current study in Nature Communications hypothesized that the potential role for mucociliary dysfunction as a driver of IPF pathology is supported by unique gene expression signatures in IPF. The investigators found that a specific genetic characteristic, known as the MUC5B promoter variant rs35705950, which results in a marked increase production of mucus in the lung is the strongest genetic risk factor for IPF. They also found this is the strongest risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis-interstitial lung disease.

The findings suggest that targeting MUC5B in the terminal airways of patients with preclinical stages of interstitial lung disease represents a strategy to prevent the progression of preclinical pulmonary fibrosis.

""This study shows how genetic findings in human diseases can generate new hypotheses, such as those related to impaired mucociliary clearance, that may lead to the discovery of novel molecular mechanisms and the development of early diagnostics and more accurate treatments for pulmonary fibrosis,"" said James P. Kiley, PhD, Director of the Division of Lung Diseases at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

The ongoing program termed as 'Nisarganubhav Shibir 2018', which commenced on November 28, aims to sensitize students from local communities residing in the buffer zone villages of Pench so that they play an active role in conservation. Students between 12-18 years are being selected for this program as it is in this age that their mind can be tapped and moulded towards wildlife conservation. The Pench Foundation is organizing this event while Satpuda Foundation is the primary educational partner.

The Pench Foundation is an entity that uses funds from various sources like the park tourism income for the development of buffer zone villages and its people. While the foundation is funding the whole event and taking care of logistics including transportation, lodging and boarding, Satpuda Foundation is responsible for planning and scheduling of the event and imparting awareness and education to the students.

""The students are made to go through various activities like jungle safari, nature and birding trails, nature games, movie screenings, competitions, lectures, presentations, etc through which they are made to realize the importance of saving their local flora and fauna and safeguarding the forests near their villages,"" said Kishor Rithe, president of Satpuda Foundation.

""These nature camps are residential in nature and thus there is enough time for learning, fun, rest, revision and feedback. The teachers who are accompanying the students are also involved in some of the activities and requested to carry out nature and environment related activities in their school regularly,"" says Giri Venkatesan, executive director of Satpuda Foundation.

Rithe said various gifts are being distributed to the students along with certificates like books, pencil boxes, field guide on birds etc. The students are showing great enthusiasm and have promised to remember the learnings that they have imbibed here. Some students were so inspired that they took guidance from the forest department officials and the resource persons regarding how to prepare for examinations like UPSC and MPSC and work for the forest department by becoming IFS/ state forest service officials after completing their education.

Over 15 such camps are being conducted with 40 students in each camp. The students that show great leaning towards nature will be selected for a second round of more comprehensive and rigorous learning camps later to shape their desires and career goals in a phased manner.

Moreover, the schools that participated in this event will be given certain small environmental projects to start with that will be later taken to the community members to find solutions for existing local problems and devise community-based models driven by these students.

School education department officials have begun the work on opening kindergarten classes in the middle schools in the district and they are expected to chalk out a blueprint at the earliest.

The state government had on Monday passed an order to introduce LKG and UKG classes in 2,381 anganwadi centres functioning in the government middle schools across the state and equip them with teaching aids.

School education department officials said the order would be implemented after taking the strength of each anganwadi centre into account.

""This is an initiative to provide primary education to prepare the children for Class 1. The district will have 122 middle schools with kindergarten sections and further details will be disclosed after a meeting with the members of Integrated Child Development Services. Arrangements would be made to implement the government order at the earliest,"" said a top educational official, who didn't want to be named.

An anganwadi worker, meanwhile, said they had already started to inform parents about the move. ""Parents are eagerly waiting to enrol their children to the KG classes, she said.

""It's a good news for all the parents. I am from a middle-class family and I can't afford high fees in the private schools. I am glad that I need not change my kid's school until Class VIII. I will be happier if the medium of education in the kindergarten section is English,"" said K Kausalya, mother of a two-and-a-half-year-old boy, who had already joined an anganwadi.

Another parent T Ramya said she was excited about her kid taking school education similar to other private school children. ""I won't prefer private schools anymore. I was thinking about my daughter's studies and now I am not worried. I will be glad to let her continue her studies in the same school from LKG to Class XII, if the school gets upgraded to high school. I would suggest introducing bus facility, as it is hard to drop and pick daily.""

Parent-teacher association (PTA) also welcomed the government's move. ""Many parents want their children to be in kindergarten classes. They would initially put their wards in private schools and took admission in government schools after Class V, as they can't afford high fees.

A video shot at the hospital on Tuesday has gone viral on social media in which Imran is shouting at a group of doctors, who according to him were sitting in their room, not in causality. He has used words like ""bloody and b..ls..t"" at the scene in anger.

""I am paying you and you are sitting in the room. Try to tell the people who are from villages. I will... bloody fire you and then go to the court,"" he is seen asking the doctors in the video. ""I am not ready to listen to the ""bloody b...ls..t. I want care for patients as per your duty,"" the angry Deputy Mayor is seen asking the doctors in the video.

The video has triggered outrage from doctors from across the valley. However, Imran Wednesday in a press conference said he will mend his mistake.

""If b..ls..t and bloody word is unparliamentary, I apologize and I am extremely sorry for that. I was emotional when I saw a dead patient there,"" he said.

In the presser, the Deputy Mayor took a dig at CD Hospital authorities stating that the hospital was worst hit and ""it has taken a toll on patient care.""

""The hospital faces lift problem, it has an improper heating arrangement, dog menace is rampant and it is without any fence. There was no ABG analyzer when I went to the hospital,"" he said.

As a mark of protest, the doctors at CD hospital Wednesday observed a pen-down strike for one hour.

""The uploaded video is edited one. Whatever happened behind scenes is not in the video. He has not shown all things. A patient expired at that time when the Deputy Mayor forced a doctor to walk from ward-to-ward. The patient was to be referred to the emergency,"" said a doctor at the hospital.

The video has triggered outrage from doctors and netizens, who condemned Imran's remarks, called it unfortunate and sought action against him.

Doctors Association Kashmir (DAK) called Deputy Mayor's remarks as ""unruly behaviour"" and expressed a strong resentment.

""It has now become a routine as ward members, Panchs, Sarpanchs and now Deputy Mayor is interfering in hospital affairs to get political mileage, because hospitals remain flooded with patients,"" said DAK president, Dr Suhail Naik.

He said the on-duty doctor was busy and was filling a referral form of a 60-year-old female patient at the hospital.

""It was better for him to focus on hospital sanitation and electricity. We warn them to mind their own work and not interfere in technical issues of the medical profession,"" Naik said.

""From his physical and verbal gestures, it seems he has received education from a western country. It was better for him to get moral education from some primary school here,"" he said.

DAK urged secretary Health and Medical Educations, Atal Dulloo to take strong note and act against the erring and unruly behaviour of Deputy Mayor.

Society of Dental Surgeons J&K (SDSJK) has also condemned the Deputy Mayor's behaviour stating that he surpassed service domain and was blatantly indecent in his approach.

""His primary job is to look beautification of the city and not to gain political mileage. His approach was totally uncalled for. He humiliated doctors by his unparliamentary behaviour,"" said president SDSJK, Dr Imtiyaz Banday.

""The inhuman behaviour shown by him clearly depicts that State's machinery does not run as per the rules and anybody can ride it for its vested interests,"" he said.

Banday appealed the Medical Superintendent CD Hospital to formally lodge FIR against Deputy Mayor so that he is booked for his 'unethical, illegal and rogue' behaviour.

Doctors Association Kashmir headed by Dr Nisar Ul Hassan has also criticized the behaviour of the Deputy Mayor and demanded an independent inquiry into the matter.

""He should have contacted the hospital administrator if he had a problem or there was an issue. There is a way to talk to a doctor,"" said its spokesperson Dr Riyaz Ahmad Daga.

Condemning the incident, he said the doctors are leaving Kashmir because of these reasons, mental torture and harassment faced by them in the hospitals.

Medical Faculty Association of Government Medical College, Srinagar and Government Dental College Srinagar also condemned the behaviour of Deputy Mayor towards the doctors on duty in CD Hospital Srinagar."

The school was invited for lunch in the village. The lunch was arranged with the elders in attendance, and the whole community present. The public (government) primary school was doing good work, led by its lone teacher, Sachin. It's his fire that had changed the school.

At the door of the house where the lunch was arranged, some of the students were told not to enter, but sit outside and eat. These children were from Dalit families. Sachin spoke to the organizers. He wanted that there be no discrimination; in the school there was none. The organizers would not let the Dalit children eat with those from ""upper caste"" families inside the house. The teacher did not relent. As the argument escalated, he decided to stop the lunch. Either all of them ate together or they would go back to the school. Frantic negotiations started among the organizers. In the end, the kids sat together.

This teacher is an exception. Even those who never discriminate between their students on any ground inside the school find it hard to take the battle out of the school. They and their students face such conflicts daily, on every dimension of prejudice and discrimination -- caste, gender, religion, poverty and more. This is not a trivial issue. We expect school education to play a crucial role in developing an equal society. But the school is fully embedded in this very world of discrimination. Teachers have to have the understanding and the courage to battle this inside the school and outside. What can support and enable the teacher, to develop this understanding, and have the tenacity to fight these battles day on day?

On a hot September evening, 53 teachers were watching the television screen showing Shyam Benegal's Samvidhan. The room in the government upper primary school was about 600 sq. ft, and sweltering. My colleague Ravi was running the third episode of the 10-part series on the screen. The full series was scheduled to be screened on 10 consecutive days. This was in a small town called Dhorimana. This is 55km from Barmer, Rajasthan.

Ravi would pause the show at crucial moments, throwing a question at the gathering. There is a particularly poignant moment when Rajkumari Amrit Kaur and Hansa Mehta discuss the depth of patriarchy that even they have to face. Ravi paused the show and asked, ""How are things today, almost 70 years after the Constitution?"" It sparked a furore. There were 10 women in the room. But the debate was not divided along the lines of gender. A few men admitted that despite progress in these 70 years, patriarchy and gender discrimination were alive, even within themselves. The discussion moved to caste and then to religion. A minority confessed to the seams of discrimination and prejudice running on all these dimensions. Ravi brought it to a close; the intention was to light a few sparks, not to conclude.

The next time he stopped was after an intense segment where B.R. Ambedkar, Alladi Krishnaswamy Iyer, Syama Prasad Mukherjee and others debate the right to freedom of expression. Till one man spoke, seemingly there was agreement that we had secured freedom of expression for all in the past 70 years. He said, ""What about that woman Gauri Lankesh? She was killed for expressing her views, wasn't she?"" I was surprised to hear that in Dhorimana. But it did spark a fiery 15 minutes. Ravi managed to end the session, without the intensity going down, but with no animosity remaining.

Thirty-five teachers attended the show across the 10 days on an average, with a low of 20 and a high of 58. They came because they were interested, there was no order or incentive. It was an intense 10 days of exploring the Constitution. All in the context of the reality that they live in. Much after the 10 days had ended, we asked the teachers the value of Festival of the Constitution. Understanding the Constitution was only a part of it. The real matter was the discovery of like-minded colleagues. A peer network, which could provide sorely needed support on conflict-ridden matters. This sense that there was someone close to you was a spur for action in the school and outside.

Policies and curriculum mostly enable the teacher. But that is inconsequential, when confronting all this within her community and social relationships. There are those few like Sachin who may have the inherent courage. Many of even those wilt over time. Most who would like to battle discrimination find it hard to act, even within the school.

These biases are deeply ingrained in our society. The question to ask of ourselves is: What supports the teacher (or anyone else) in her daily life in the quest for our Constitutions' ideals? There doesn't seem to be much. Most of those who battle to bring our Constitution to life, in the Dhorimanas of this country, feel alone. They need not, because they are not really alone in Dhorimana. Once they get talking, they build a coalition for the Constitution. But this has to be done, it doesn't happen on its own. We cannot await Godot, we have to do this ourselves."

Data from the 68th round of the National Sample Survey revealed that the proportion of households in urban India with casual labour and self employment as the dominant income source was the highest among Muslims at 15 per cent and 50 per cent respectively. The workforce participation rate among Muslims, Sikhs and Jains was lower than the national average according to Census 2011.

The NITI Aayog recommends that the primary responsibility for a number of schemes currently being implemented by the ministry of minority affairs (MoMA) may be vested with the relevant line ministries. ""MoMA should be involved with the finalization of physical and financial targets by the line ministries.

Now CM Kumaraswamy wants the people to help resolve the matter.

Bengaluru: The Karnataka government has been at loggerheads with NGO Akshaya Patra over the question of serving onion and garlic in mid-day meals, and Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy is now ready to take the vexed issue to the people's court.

Speaking to ThePrint, Kumaraswamy said he was ready to open the issue for public debate, and let the people decide whether or not they want the ISKCON-run NGO's onion-and-garlic-free food served to their children.

The Akshaya Patra Foundation, a non-profit organisation, is a midday meal partner of the Karnataka government in five districts -- Bengaluru, Mysuru, Ballari, Hubli and Mangaluru.

The Karnataka State Food Commission conducted a survey of government schools, and found that onion and garlic were absent from the meals served at schools where Akshaya Patra was the providing agency. The panel urged for them to be included to make meals tastier and more nutritious.

Akshaya Patra refused, owing to its belief in the Ayurvedic principle of providing 'sattvic' food -- cooked with organic, vegetarian ingredients. Onion and garlic are considered 'tamasic', that is, items that can trigger lethargy and negative emotions.

Naveena Neerada Dasa, ISKCON's head of strategic communication and projects, told ThePrint that it is Akshaya Patra's ""endeavour to promote good health and nutrition"", and that it ""will continue to follow the prescribed norms set by both the state and central government"".

The state government, meanwhile, began facing pressure from civil rights organisations like the Delhi-based Jan Swasthya Abhiyan and the Right to Food Campaign to cancel its contract with Akshaya Patra. They insist that Akshaya Patra has no right to decide what food has to be served, and cannot impose ""religious diktats"" on a scheme that embodies one's right to food.

The organisations have also spoken about the question of nutrition, though dieticians say onion and garlic only enhance taste -- their nutritional value can easily be replaced by nuts or fibres of different kinds.

Also read: Karnataka civil society groups want govt to dump ISKCON NGO over onion-garlic row

The Union Ministry of Human Resource Development, which oversees the midday meal scheme, does not specify what items are to be provided to children, be it eggs or onion or garlic.

The ministry's guidelines merely state that a primary school child be served food which has a nutritional value of 450 calories -- 12 grams of protein, 100 grams of food grains, 20 grams of pulses, 50 grams of vegetables, 5 grams of oil and fat, and salt and condiments as per need.

For upper primary schoolchildren, the intake is supposed to be 700 calories -- 20 grams of protein, 150 grams of food grains, 30 grams of pulses, 75 grams of vegetables , 7.5 grams of oil and fat, and salt and condiments as per need.

The Karnataka government has been reluctant to cancel its contract with Akshaya Patra, since the midday meal scheme has helped increase the number of admissions in government schools.

It seems to have decided that the only way this matter can be resolved is if it is opened to public debate, rather than be coerced to take a decision based on the observations of civil rights organisations.

Kumaraswamy has now decided to seek the opinion of various stakeholders, including school teachers, headmasters, food scientists and dieticians, on whether there is an absolute need to add onion and garlic in the food that is being served.

""The question we are raising is whether it would cause any major deficiencies to children if (onion and garlic) are not added to their midday meals. We will be able to take an informed stand only after we receive adequate information on it,"" said Kumaraswamy.

""We will ask food experts, doctors and nutritionists on these aspects, and then take a decision. Let's not rush into any decision.""

While this controversy rages, officials at the Department of Primary and Secondary Education have come up with a new idea to bypass the onion-garlic question and yet enhance children's diet.

Preliminary discussions are on to add fruits to the menu, so that children can have a well-rounded meal.

Sources in the department also said the Mysuru-based Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) has been asked to analyse the nutritional value of onion and garlic, and find if there are alternative fruits or vegetables that can provide the same nutrition."

The study was released by Tamil Nadu State Palmyra Workers and Rural Artisans Union on Monday.

It was conducted among a sample of 396 migrant workers' families in 11 settlements in Kadaladi Block in Ramanathapuram. There are around 10,000 families that depend on palmyra tapping for a living in the block alone, the study said.

Out of 577 children studied, 397 could not go to school as they had dropped out to become child labourers, it said. That is, 69 per cent of children drop out of school to work. Palmyra workers, who have to cut the tip of the palmyra's inflorescence at least thrice a day to prevent drying of sap, live within the palm groves for easy access. ""We start slicing it by 1.30 am. Then we have to do it thrice. On an average, we work at least 15 hours a day,"" said Anthony Rayappan, an elderly palm worker.

He cannot live far from the grove in order start work that early.

Large palm groves are situated at about 10-20 km away from the nearest urban areas, often isolating them with little access to education and health care, said Arivahagan Rayan from the union.The study showed that a majority of the children, had to travel 10 to 20 kilometres to go to school.

According to the study, 80 per cent of children who go to Anganwadi, 53 per cent of children who go to primary schools, 67 per cent who go to middle schools, 73 per cent to high school and 77 per cent who go to higher secondary schools have to travel at least 10 km to reach their institutions.

""Public transport facilities are denied for these school going children as the main road is more than three km distance for 62 per cent of the children,"" the study said. The migratory population also faces a similar lack of access to health and other social facilities.

In order to alleviate their life and livelihood, the government must provide roads through vast palm groves and transport, urged members of the union, adding that schools must be constructed closer to their settlements in accordance with the Right to Education Act.

They also added that government must work pro actively to prevent child labour in the population."

The research also reveals how poor understanding of the dangers of extreme heat or cold also affected how well older adults adapt to adverse weather conditions such as a heat wave or cold snap.

The research from Warwick Medical School used an asset-based approach to determine how capable those adults were in adapting to the negative effects of extreme weather conditions. An asset-based approach involves categorizing all the resources, both tangible and non-tangible, that individuals need to maintain their health and wellbeing and assessing their access to those and ability to utilize them.

Older adults (aged 65+) are considered a high-risk group to the impacts of extreme temperatures. Direct and indirect effects of heat waves and cold waves are associated with an increase in respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. This contributed to an estimated 50,100 excess winter deaths in England and Wales in 2017-18 and an estimated 1,246 excess deaths in June to July 2018 according to recent figures from the Office for National Statistics.

The findings of this research have national and international relevance, and it recommends implementing a number of measures to policymakers to respond to temperature extremes:

Lead author Dr. Raquel Nunes from Warwick Medical School used over 45 interviews with older adults living in Lisbon, Portugal, conducted in both summer and winter. She said: ""The findings of this research are comparable to that in the UK, France, US, New Zealand and internationally that also found that low educational levels, low income, lack of mobility, lack of housing insulation and weak social networks had adverse consequences on older adults' ability to respond to extreme temperatures.

""We show that the vast majority of older adults face restrictions in availability and access to assets that impact on their ability to respond to extreme temperatures. Despite this, participants in this research revealed a range of opportunities for enhancing their adaptation strategies, drawing on assets that they would welcome.""

The research identified a strong sense of independence in older adults, which helped to enable those people to adapt to changing weather conditions. However, expenses such as high electricity and gas prices and low income/pensions were seen as constraints, as well as a general misunderstanding of the risks and cost-effectiveness of technologies such as heaters and fans. As a result, older people did not prioritize investing in cooling and heating their homes, with tenants often more affected than homeowners.

Participants with the lowest literacy (primary school education or less) and with a poor understanding of what to do during hot/cold weather preferred personalized advice provided by specialists (i.e., GP, Nurse, Community or Council officers) to general advice such as leaflets or information in the media. Social interaction with family, neighbours, and services were perceived as a 'lifeline' as their advice was seen to be more trustworthy.

Dr. Nunes added: ""Addressing issues such as electricity and gas prices, as well as subsidies for older adults living with low pensions, are considered to be essential opportunities in reducing the pressure on finances and would support individuals in adapting to extreme weather.

""Local and community organizations and institutions would be most appropriate to implement adaptation measures, as they are closer and more accessible to older people. These organizations and institutions could aim to work together to examine particular aspects and characteristics of older people's lives that are crucial to respond to during temperature extremes, and implement suitable measures.

""The asset-based approach that was used and the concept of assets allow a better understanding of the factors shaping older adults' adaptation strategies and can help us understand the challenges they face during extreme temperatures.

""To increase all types of assets requires sufficient funding and political commitment for the short-, medium and long-term, and an investment in tailored national and local policy decisions and interventions.""

The move comes after a wall collapsed in Noida's New KM Public School in Salarpur village, killing two children and injuring three students. The BSA said they will demolish all unsafe government school buildings and identify illegal private schools to close them down.

""We have written to block education officers to ensure that the private agencies are selected in each village to demolish unsafe government school buildings and construct new ones. The private agencies that will build the new school buildings will be finalised through an open auction in the respective villages. Earlier, due to technical reasons, we could not hire private agencies to reconstruct government schools,"" Balmukund Prasad, BSA, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.

According to officials, there are several government primary and middle schools in various villages across the district that are operating in old, unsafe buildings.

The education department has also written to the block education officer in Dankaur to inspect private schools and shut them down if they are violating norms.

As per the education department, there are 174 illegal schools in the Gautam Budh Nagar district. Over two lakh students study in these schools, that are housed in illegal buildings with no safety measures in place, officials said.

""After a 2017-18 survey, we identified 174 illegal schools in district. Most of them were shut down. Now, to identify more illegal schools, we have formed two teams that will submit monthly reports. The allegations of parents that we were aware of all illegal schools operating in the district are false and baseless,"" Prasad said.

""The block education officer needs to inspect Children's Academy in Chhijarsi; Dayanand Public School, Bahlolpur; Vivek Vidyapeeth, Chhijarsi; Gyandeep School in Chotpur, HI Public School in Chhijarsi; Geeta Public School in Chhijarsi; Jagriti Public School in Chhijarsi and Naveen Gyan Hari Singh Public School. If these schools are illegal, then we will shut them down immediately,"" Prasad added.

The other schools that are to be inspected by the education department are CBSE Public School, Prayag Public School and Sai Public School in Yakubpur village; and Royal Public School, Gayatri Public School and Beena Public School in Sadarpur village.

Pradeep Yadav, whose son was killed when New KM Public School's wall collapsed on Monday, said,""If these 174 schools were illegal and unsafe for children, then why did the education department not act earlier. We demand that the UP government file an FIR against education department officials for laxity.""

Prasad said,""Parents are responsible for checking whether schools are approved or not before they admit their wards. We have decided to seek information from the public about schools they think are illegal as well. We will inspect them and take appropriate action.""

According to him, there are nearly 1,000 legal schools in the district, including private and government schools."

As per the inquiry, the school head, education department officials and the doctors who examined the girl did not report the matter to the police. Copies of the letters are with TOI.

In November, TOI had reported that the commission has refrained itself from recommending action against the persons in question for delay in reporting the case as suggested in the Juvenile Justice Act and had left it to the concerned authorities to decide the punishment. Notably, this is the first time that the child rights commission has shown leniency in a serious case and not recommended FIR against every person from doctors to school heads and education department officials who did not report the matter to the police as per the Act suggests.

As per the information, this was done because the school authorities were found to be unaware about the law that applied in such a case.

In 2015, CCPCR had acted the other way and recommended FIR against the school management of a private Chandigarh school for delaying to report the molestation case of a pre-primary student. The conductor of the school bus had molested a kindergarten student in the bus. Recently, the Punjab and Haryana high court had directed a lower court to proceed against a the school principal who had failed to act even after knowing about the molestation.

The JJ Act states under Section 19 (1) that any person who has the apprehension that an offence is likely to be committed or has the knowledge that an offence has been committed, should bring the incident to the notice of the special juvenile police unit or the local police. The failure to report such an offence is punishable with imprisonment or fine or both.

Failing to report the commission of an offence under Section 19 (1) or failing to record such offence under section 19 (2) is punishable under Section 21

(2) which states that any person, being in-charge of any company or an institution (by whatever name called) who fails to report the commission of an offence in respect of a subordinate under his control, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year and with fine.

CCPCR chairperson Harjinder Kaur could not be reached for comment."

The study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, investigated primary care physicians' views on AI's looming impact on health professions.

When it came to predictions about the future of medicine, British general physicians (GPs) were generally sceptical that they could be entirely replaced by AI.

""To our knowledge this is the first national survey that explores medical professionals' opinions about how AI will impact the future of a medical specialty,"" said Charlotte Blease, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Harvard Medical School in the US.

""The results suggest a disconnection between the views of experts in medical AI and practicing physicians: the overwhelming majority of general practitioners were unconvinced about the potential for technology to replace them especially when it comes to empathetic patient care,"" said Blease.

The researchers asked physicians about the likelihood that future technology would be able to fully replace the average GP in performing six different medical tasks.

These tasks include diagnostics, prognostics or evaluating when to refer patients to specialists, formulating personalised treatment plans for patients, providing empathic care, and updating patient documentation.

About half of GPs surveyed believed it likely or very likely that AI would be able to replace them in making patient prognoses in the future.

Eighty per cent of respondents believed it likely or very likely that future technology would be able to fully undertake duties related to patient documentation, such as updating medical records.

However, the overwhelming majority of UK GPs studied (94 per cent) believed it was unlikely or extremely unlikely that technology will be able to provide empathic care to patients as well as or better than the average GP.

Nearly seven in 10 UK GPs surveyed believed that it was unlikely or very unlikely that future technology would be able to outperform the average GP when it came to diagnosing patients.

Over 60 per cent of GPs believed it is unlikely or very unlikely that technology would ever be able to replace doctors in decisions about when to refer patients to specialists.

A similar number of GPs was cynical about replacement when it comes to formulating personal treatment plans for patients.

Against their general scepticism about AI, the study found that GPs appeared optimistic that future technology could undertake certain automated tasks, such as paper work.

""Overwhelmingly, general practitioners also believed that artificial intelligence could never replace them on empathy -- yet this is a skill that does not require special medical expertise,"" said Blease."

Veer Arjun Singh meets Indians from other states who have made the beach state their home.

Photograph: Kind courtesy Pixabay

It's mid-August in Goa. The sand is damp beneath my feet as I walk along Candolim beach. The skies are grey and empty. And so is the land.

I finally spot one gentleman at a distance. He's armed with a stick and seems to be persuading strays to move along. He glares at me as I draw closer.

""Private beach area, sir,"" he says.

He proves to be the guard at the Taj Holiday Village and Spa resort, a touristy extravagance that brings thousands to Goa every year.

Once he loosens up, I ask about the empty beach and he says simply, ""Off-season."" I'm not convinced.

Where are the tourists, the backpackers and hippies, who legendarily swarm around Goa's beaches all year long?

A day later I meet someone who may be among the last of that generation. French-born Leo Cecil Michaud came to Goa as an 18 year old in 1992. ""There weren't any famous bars back then,"" says Michaud. ""The city was tripping on something entirely different."" He decided to stay.

In 2006, he opened a restaurant called Baba au Rhum, named after the French dessert, which retains a certain hippie charm. But Michaud says that almost 80 per cent of his guests are Indians, many of them recent immigrants to Goa from Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru.

Before I leave the restaurant, I try a new beer, the Susegado. A Goan cliche, the word is still a fitting name for a seasonal brew. The word has come to mean many things Goa.

Like the waters of the Arabian Sea, Indians have been hitting the shores of Goa regularly for years -- most holidayed and left; some returned to build holiday homes; and a handful stayed on to live and work and build a new life.

To the first wave of Indians who had come looking for a new home, susegado meant restfulness; a reprieve from India's rapidly expanding cities. These cities have now grown to bursting point.

After living in New Delhi for more than 10 years, artist Nityan Unnikrishnan decided he'd had enough. He moved to gentler Goa in April 2017, and waited for his wife, Rukminee Guha Thakurta, to overcome her apprehensiveness and make the move too.

""As a freelance design consultant, my work is entirely dependent on the Internet and staying connected,"" says Guha Thakurta. ""I told Nityan my living in Goa would depend on the Internet connectivity!"" She finally joined him in October 2017.

Nearly a year later, not only is Guha Thakurta still in Goa, she's as busy as ever. ""The Internet here is better than in Delhi,"" she laughs.

In her spare time -- and there's considerably more since she spends fewer hours on the road -- she's become a fond tender of fruit and vegetable plants on the multiple balconies of their sprawling first-floor apartment in Porvorim, sometimes gleefully sending pictures of dewy melons and dusky chillies to her city friends.

Guha Thakurta and Unnikrishnan are now looking for land where they hope to build a modest home of their dreams.

Noted photojournalist Prashant Panjiar and co-founder of the Nazar Foundation recently managed that particular feat, having built a 300 sq m modernistic house in Moira. He loves the fact that he can wear shorts almost everywhere. He says he's nowhere close to retiring.

""I am doing the same amount of work as I was in Delhi,"" says Panjiar, echoing Guha Thakurta. ""But I don't feel anxious.""

Caught in the frantic pace of city life, he says, people often feel like they are running out of time. ""Maybe I am relaxed because now I can see all the trees I want to see from my balcony.""

Not all fed-up city-dwellers have the luxury of taking the radical decision of moving cities, of course. Crucial is choice of profession -- no one with ""mainstream"" jobs can make the shift seamlessly, given that tourism and mining remain the mainstays of Goa's economy.

Being an artist, writer or freelancer of some description helps. Over the past few decades, the move was also more easily made by single people or couples without children, since Goa did not have many schools that offered ""quality"" education.

Even 15-odd years ago, though, some disagreed. ""More options in a city like Mumbai is an illusion,"" says Karan Manral. Distance and cost, he says, make many inaccessible. Manral himself grew up as a navy kid in South Bombay. But by the late '90s, the population explosion and traffic snarls had made him restless.

By 2002, he had quit his job as editor of Digit and Chip magazines and moved to Goa. ""The city I loved when I was growing up was moving too fast,"" says Manral. He met his future wife Yogita Mehra in Goa.

Their daughter Tara, 6, attends the Shiksha Niketan primary school in Saligao. Manral, who went to school in Mumbai, claims there aren't more than five schools in that metro that can match the quality of education his daughter receives. ""This is what we need for her foundation,"" he says.

Things have changed since Manral moved. Not only are there mainstream schools such as the Delhi-affiliated Ardee School, unconventional schools are gaining popularity.

Paradise School in Aldona is just two years old, and it's filling up with children of erstwhile Delhiites and Mumbaikars. Its Internet-based, alternative teaching method, SOLE (Self Organised Learning Environment), and International Cambridge Board is attracting expats, too.

Lisa Chowgule moved to Goa in 1989 from Mumbai. Since 1992, she's been running the Keshar Academy of Learning in Tiswadi, another alternative school, which follows the Waldorf teaching approach, and is also affiliated to the IGCSE or Cambridge board.

""There are no periods, no bells, no restriction of movement and no exams,"" says Chowgule.

For many who have made the move, Goa has also been about starting afresh. ""Goa is an opportunity to choose an alternative career,"" says Puja Mitra, who started Terra Conscious last year, an enterprise that promotes marine conservation and eco-sensitive tourism.

While Mitra arranges for boat-rides to discover the biodiversity of the Indian Ocean (especially the Indian humpback dolphins), her husband and co-founder Roshan Gonsalves gives scuba diving lessons. They have been living in Goa happily since 2012.

Manral and Mehra too built a new ""career"". In 2008, the couple started Green Essentials. They help people set up their own organic kitchen gardens, conduct workshops on sustainability and sell organic supplies at their store in Porvorim.

The drive to find a new vocation for all of these immigrants has in turn fed a cosmopolitan, alternative-thinking and culturally vibrant ecosystem.

Bhagyashree Patwardhan's Paper Boat Collective is a significant metaphor for the change wrought by newcomers. She too moved from Mumbai in 2012. ""Moving to Goa means a life spent less on the road and more at work.""

Now, her immaculately curated lifestyle store in Sangolda features clothes by revivalist designers such as Santanu Das, ceramics from Bengaluru emigre-turned-Goa resident Thomas Louis and a range of crafts. Paper Boat draws everyone with a taste for the chic and the ethically produced.

Designers Orijit Sen and Gurpreet Sidhu belong to the earlier wave of naturalised Goans. Circumstances took them back to Delhi for some years, but now their People Tree boutique, inside a beautiful old Portuguese villa, combines with the Gunpowder restaurant to bring a taste of big-city sophistication to a quiet, leafy village. The unit is named for the address -- simply, 6 Assagao.

The intermingling of old and new immigrants with locals happens at places like House No 248 in Sangolda, often over curated meals and jazz performances, or at annual multidisciplinary events like the Serendipity Arts Festival. Both Sen and Panjiar exhibited different aspects of Goa at last year's event.

For every person or family that hesitated before taking the plunge, Goa's lower cost of living has often been a decisive factor. Thanks to the wealthy Indians who built or bought second and third homes, about one in every five houses in Goa is vacant, according to the directorate of census operations.

Real estate prices are still climbing, especially at gated communities -- Sun Estates Developers's Solidago villas by the Nerul river start at Rs 40 million -- but rentals are low.

Manral and Mehra run Green Essentials out of an old, Portuguese villa, which is surrounded by enough land for their organic farming. The rent is Rs 20,000. They pay Rs 16,000 for their two-bedroom apartment nearby.

Anushya Sharma, a painter who moved to Goa from Assam in 2002, also lives in an old, Portuguese villa in Arpora, which she and her husband Jochem Vanderzwan, who works in restoration, rent for Rs 25,000.

Children from the neighbourhood often wander into their house to learn a thing or two about painting. ""Goa is about community living,"" says Sharma. ""But blending in takes time,"" she warns.

""I seem to meet someone I know who has moved here virtually every week,"" says Shrayragi Israni, who works with environmental action groups. But the sense of community bonding is so strong it can border on the oppressive for those who fled the big city in search of peace. ""This like-minded-people thing, well..."" sighs the reclusive artist Unnikrishnan.

Goans have been largely accepting of city folks, but there is some resentment. Goan lifestyle is not flamboyant, and gated colonies with luxury villas and swimming pools are viewed with suspicion.

Israni says the problem with the new settlers is that they continue to be urban customers who demand prompt services. ""Not all are aware of the kind of pressure they are putting on Goa's people and resources,"" she says.

Veteran Goan architect Dean D'Cruz feels that government neglect of essentials such as the Mapusa or Panjim bus stands and new focus on the proposed Mopa airport is breeding anger. But, says D'Cruz, ""A majority of settlers who are taking up old homes in villages are sensitive to the issues of the local people and the environment.""

Conservationist Joanna Pyres, who has a Goan pedigree but was born and raised in the UK, uses her engagement platform, Circlewallas, to bring together locals, Indian migrants and expats to find solutions.

""The know-how of a local, or the exposure of a settler, could be the missing piece to the jigsaw puzzle for a lasting solution,"" says Pyre, who has been in Goa for over ten years.

Journalist Vivek Menezes says that there are adjustment issues between locals and migrants the world over, but Goans are more tolerant.

""Despite the challenges, Goa is among the few places in the country where an outsider can become a local,"" he says.

It's an inviting idea. And many are accepting the invitation."

In almost 14 schools, more than 5,000 students are forced to sit on floors, as there are no desks and benches, and around 44 schools do not have Jal Board's water connections.

Nandini Sharma, the South Corporation Education committee chairperson, said, ""The files have been moved. Tenders are being invited, and work orders will be issued. We are expecting to get things moving by February.""

She cited lack of funding as the reason for the woes of school and said, ""We received Rs 46 crore instead of Rs 89 crore in funds. We are giving Rs 500 instead of Rs 1,100 to students as a subsidy for uniforms""."

3. No Takers for Steel Bridges

Lack of response to call for tenders has thrown a spanner in the works for construction of two proposed steel bridges near Indira Park and Nalgonda Crossroads by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC). The corporation had, before elections, invited bids from agencies for construction of steel bridges on two stretches, one from the Indira Park to VST Junction (2.61 km), and an extension thereof from Ramnagar to Baghlingampally (0.84 km), and the second, from Nalgonda Crossroads to Owaisi Junction.

Both projects were to be taken up as part of the Strategic Road Development Plan. The Nalgonda Crossroads-Owaisi Junction flyover was touted to be the city's longest steel bridge with over a four-km span, and costing close to Rs 300 crore. The cost of Indira Park-VST Junction-Baghlingampally elevated corridor was estimated at Rs 426 crore, for which administrative sanction has been granted by the government.

4. 'Why Should I Strip to Prove My Gender?'

Draconian and regressive - the transgender community in Hyderabad sums up the newly-passed Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2016, with the use of these two words. Irate at the bill's poor understanding of transgender issues, the activists of transgender and intersex communities especially condemn the much-controversial clause in the bill that makes a doctor's certificate requisite for one to be pronounced a trans person.

""The cis men and women are not forced to strip open their clothes in front of a doctor to prove their gender and sexual orientation. Why should we? This practice dehumanises our community, and now the government is going to enact a law that encourages this,"" alleges Chandramukhi M, a transgender activist.

In addition to archaic clauses such as this, the bill also has no specific roadmap on how to tackle the primary issues faced by the community.

5. Four Apprehended for Planning to Sell Infant

The Malkajgiri SOT apprehended four persons for allegedly selling an infant. The accused have been identified as Syed Shanawaz (27), Md Ibrahim (30), A Harish (22) and Md.Noori Begum (32). The four were allegedly planning to sell the baby for Rs 1 lakh.

Police said that Shanawaz scouts for couples without children. Upon identification, he approaches poor people and convinces them to sell their children to such couples. He then calls buyers to Gandhi Hospital where he strikes a deal with them. Acting on a tip-off, the SOT apprehended all four accused. The infant was later sent to Shishu Vihar.

While rooting out such illegal schools is something governments have to do on a war footing, the condition of some state-run schools in the city is no better. Buildings with roofs partially caved in, cracks running across walls, leaking ceilings, broken urinals in washrooms and crumbling walls are what several government schools serve to the hundreds of students who turn up for classes every day. District elementary education officer Prem Lata Yadav, when asked about the state of infrastructure of government-run schools in the city, said, ""The reason behind the poor condition of school buildings is lack of funds. We've written to the education department to look into the issue.""

Government Senior Secondary School , Islampur

Concrete chunks can be seen falling off the ceiling, with cracks running across the walls, at GSSS Islampur. The building has 15 rooms with 550 students in classes VI-XI. Washrooms were stinking, there were no faucets and urinals were broken. The school principal accept the condition of the school's infrastructure is not good. ""A proposal to rebuild the school building has been placed before the authorities. This building will be brought down soon. MCG officials have taken measurements for the new construction a few months ago,"" said Kanwal Nain, principal. ""This building is small, old, and built on low land, because of which, at times, water accumulates at the entrance,"" he added.

Government Primary School, Satlaka

The 46 students of GPS Satlaka have to brace a school building falling apart at its seams. There are five classrooms, but all classes take place in only one, as the condition of the rest is terrible. ""One can spot cow dung on the floors, broken benches, blackboards and doors. Across the building, the seepage is so heavy that during monsoons this year, the roof of one classroom collapsed,"" said Virender Singh, guest teacher.

TOI also spotted dogs roaming in the classrooms. ""This entire building is unsafe and unfit for tiny tots. Since there is no guard, cows wander in and take shelter inside at night. I'm not paid to clean up the dung,"" said Rahisa, the school's sole sanitation staff. Since the building was constructed in 1972, no teacher has spent more than a year in this school.

Shivji Park Primary School

Shivji Park Primary School doesn't even have its own building. It operates out of Government Senior Secondary School Kadipur, whose classrooms are in a shambles. ""Students are forced to sit in the school hallway or even in the open, as none of the eight classrooms we've been allotted are usable,"" said head teacher Satpal. Even teachers of the Kadipur school are unaware when the crumbling walls were last repaired.

Govt Primary School, Kadipur

One look at the building of GPS Kadipur is enough to tll you that a disaster is waiting to happen. ""There are 180 students in this school. Every now and then, chunks of plaster fall off, making it dangerous for them. The old building has been declared a threat, and a new building is being constructed. Unfortunately, construction work stopped six months ago,"" said a teacher, requesting anonymity.

Govt Primary Feroze Gandhi School Shivaji Park

The 70 tiny tots who study in GPFGS Shivaji Park, have to cross mounds of garbage and pools of stagnant water to enter the premises every day. ""Every day, locals throw trash in front of the school. We've spoken with the authorities, but this doesn't stop,"" said a teacher, requesting anonymity."

Pics/Sneha Kharabe

The 155-year-old St Stanislaus School, among the oldest educational institutions in the city, is located bang on Bandra's bustling Hill Road. But, despite slotting different school hours for primary and secondary sections, the traffic congestion here continues to be a giant headache for parents and local residents alike.

Autorickshaws, vans and other vehicles ferrying children crowd the entrance to the school buildings every morning and evening. A row of auto rickshaws can be seen parked on both sides of the road. As St Stanislaus School doesn't offer transportation services, parents depend on these vans and autos as a more reliable and economical mode of transport. While some are able to find space close to the gate, others have to park on the opposite side or on the adjacent road, adding to the chaos.

Children and parents crossing the road in the middle of traffic adds to the general chaos

As soon as the bell rings, students of the primary section race to the gate. The auto drivers then wait until they have found all the students who will be crammed into their vehicles, holding up traffic in the narrow lane. At the gate of the high school section, one can see a long line of students crossing over the divider to get to their autos parked on another road. Due to the absence of the traffic police at the junction, motorists and the bus drivers can be seen stopping traffic even when the traffic lights are green.

Barring the safety factor of the students who cross the road on their own, a majority of the parents who come to pick up their children have a scooter and tend to park right in front of the gate. Most of the parents don't stop for longer than a minute, but multiple scooters lined up waiting outside the gate results in a massive traffic congestion on the busy road.

An illegally operating auto crammed with schoolchildren are a common sight in front of the school gate

PrincipalSpeak

Principal Anna Correa said, ""At the beginning of the year, we had set up a traffic committee, mostly made up of willing parents and some teachers. Parent volunteers come in the morning, at the lunch break and after school to help at the gate. Along with the school, they have worked out a way to reduce congestion problems. For instance, no parking is allowed at the main gate and vehicles have to be parked either before or after the gate. The senior boys enter through gate number 3 and the younger ones use gate number 1. Our disadvantage is that our main gate is common for both St Peter's Church and the school. It is not possible for us to control people from coming in for church services. While the traffic department agreed to send two officers to help, they only send one in the morning as they are understaffed.""

Major problems

. Autos, vans, crowding the school entrance

. Parents parking their scooters or stopping their rickshaws to drop off or pick up kids, causing a traffic jam

. Long lines of students crossing the road to get to their autos parked on the other side, holding up traffic

. Absence of a traffic cop when students come out"

The move comes a day after two children were killed and six others injured in a wall collapse at a private school in Noida.

According to police, the school building in Salarpur was ""too old and deteriorated"" and its wall collapsed due to the impact of some construction activity that was going on ""without any official approval"" in the adjoining plot.

""Earlier we found 174 unregistered schools in the district, of which 93 were shut down immediately and 22 more were closed after imposition of Rs 1 lakh fine on each.

""We are now trying to detect more such schools which may be operating without valid permissions,"" basic sikhsha adhikari (BSA) Bal Mukund told TOI.

""Sometimes these owners reopen the unregistered schools by changing their names. So two teams with two officers and two junior staff each will do the inspection. And if we find such violators, we will lodge police complaints against them and register FIRs for illegal operation of business in the name of schools,"" he said.

""Schools will be given recognition only when they meet all educational and safety parameters,"" the BSA added.

However, Mukund also acknowledged the need for more schools in the district to cater to the educational needs of every child.

""We have 685 government schools in Gautam Budh Nagar. However, these are not enough to meet the needs of a huge migrant population. At the same time, we cannot allow safety to be compromised,"" he added."

That is not all, cold drafts blowing in through gaps make comfort impossible in these schools, which are maintained by the UT and have been running for decades.

The education department is aware of the state of affairs but is yet to replace the sheds housing primary and pre-primary students with a proper building. The remaining classes do run in buildings but lack the space to accommodate these students.

There are eight rooms under the shed in Hallomajra. These include all sections of Classes VI, VIIA and VIIIA. In the evening, all sections of Class I are also conducted under the roof.

In Hallomajra, one class is held in the midday meal room. The block under the tin roof is located on a separate premises. A rickety fence passes off for a boundary wall, leaving students vulnerable to insects and snakes.

Cracked walls in GMS, Palsora Colony make it impossible to warm the room. ""In such uncomfortable surroundings, students cannot focus on studies,"" said the parent of a school student.

Schools with concrete buildings do not have it easy either. Water seepage is a common problem. Leaky roofs, damp walls and rotting blackboards are common. School officials said they have informed authorities but the process of repair is slow.

Authorities from other government schools said these buildings have never been renovated.

The district education office itself is grappling with the problem of water seepage on the top floor, where water accumulates on the roof.

""We have to save documents after the rain as the roof leaks. So many letters have been written but nothing has been done,"" said an official, requesting anonymity.

""There is hardly any school that does not have the problem of water seepage and leaking roofs. One room or the other is always facing a problem,"" said Savinder Singh, chairman, Joint action committee of teachers.

As per the preliminary discussions going on in the department, seasonal fruits could be served every day or every alternate day to the children. Officials say this idea emerged after questions were raised over the Akshaya Patra Foundation excluding garlic and onion in the food preparations, for which the department issued the non-profit organisation a notice.

The department has now written to the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), seeking information on the nutritional value added by garlic and onion in the meal, and which food, vegetable or fruit can replace that.

The study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, investigated primary care physicians' views on AI's looming impact on health professions.

When it came to predictions about the future of medicine, British general physicians (GPs) were generally skeptical that they could be entirely replaced by AI.

""To our knowledge, this is the first national survey that explores medical professionals' opinions about how AI will impact the future of a medical specialty,"" said Charlotte Blease, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Harvard Medical School in the US.

""The results suggest a disconnection between the views of experts in medical AI and practicing physicians: the overwhelming majority of general practitioners were unconvinced about the potential for technology to replace them especially when it comes to empathetic patient care,"" said Blease.

The researchers asked physicians about the likelihood that future technology would be able to fully replace the average GP in performing six different medical tasks.

These tasks include diagnostics, prognostics or evaluating when to refer patients to specialists, formulating personalised treatment plans for patients, providing empathic care, and updating patient documentation.

About half of GPs surveyed believed it likely or very likely that AI would be able to replace them in making patient prognoses in the future.

Eighty per cent of respondents believed it likely or very likely that future technology would be able to fully undertake duties related to patient documentation, such as updating medical records.

However, the overwhelming majority of UK GPs studied (94 per cent) believed it was unlikely or extremely unlikely that technology will be able to provide empathic care to patients as well as or better than the average GP.

Nearly seven in 10 UK GPs surveyed believed that it was unlikely or very unlikely that future technology would be able to outperform the average GP when it came to diagnosing patients.

Over 60 per cent of GPs believed it is unlikely or very unlikely that technology would ever be able to replace doctors in decisions about when to refer patients to specialists.

A similar number of GPs was cynical about replacement when it comes to formulating personal treatment plans for patients.

Against their general skepticism about AI, the study found that GPs appeared optimistic that future technology could undertake certain automated tasks, such as paperwork.

""Overwhelmingly, general practitioners also believed that artificial intelligence could never replace them on empathy -- yet this is a skill that does not require special medical expertise,"" said Blease.

""Our findings raise important questions about how current and future physicians integrate and harness the power of artificial intelligence, which could ultimately improve the delivery of care to patients,"" he said."

With only a couple of months of his term remaining, they are yet to have a glimpse of their MP, let alone initiation of any project for development of their villages.

Despite being located only about 30 km from the district headquarters Koraput, 10 km from Semiliguda block headquarters and adjacent to the State Highway, Pitaguda has been out of the development map for decades. With 769 households and a population of nearly 3000, majorly tribals and scheduled caste, the panchayat comprising three revenue villages has been languishing in absence of basic infrastructure and amenities.

""We came to know of the SAGY programme and adoption of our panchayat by the MP as late as 2017. But till date, there is no sign of any project being initiated by him for development of the villages. Not a single penny has been funded by the MP from his MPLAD funds,"" said Subhadra Nayak, a woman leader of Pitaguda.Hikaka, however, said there was no separate support or special funding for SGAY which made it impossible to concentrate on a particular panchayat.

""The programme is creating differences between panchayats and thus I did not pursue it,"" he reasoned.

The Opposition attacked the MP for neglecting his adopted village stating that it was due to politics.

However, the owner of the school, who identifies himself as a leader of Samajwadi Party's youth wing Yuvjan Sabha, is absconding.

The principal, Sanjeev Jha, an original resident of Sitamarhi district in Bihar, was arrested by Sector 49 police from near Arogyadhan Maharshi Ashram, Sector 107 on Tuesday.

While Amit Bhati, who identifies himself as the state secretary of Yuvjan Sabha, is the chairman and owner of KM Public School, his uncle Deshraj Bhati is the owner of the adjacent plot where an earthmover was levelling the land, resulting in the wall collapse.

The students were sitting near the wall in the open and writing an exam when the wall collapsed on them. While two students died, five others were injured.

So far, Sector 49 police has booked Amit Bhati, his uncle Deshraj Bhati, Deshraj's son Sumit Bhati, school manager Raghvendra Solanki, principal Sanjeev Jha and the unidentified driver of the earthmover.

Meanwhile, a visit to the spot indicates that Amit is well-known in the area. A board installed at the entry of the lane to his three-storey house reads: Amit Bhati, pradesh sachiv (state secretary), Samajwadi Party Yuvjan Sabha. He is also well-known as the owner of multiple properties in the village, most of which have been given on rent.

Since Monday morning, when the tragedy struck, Amit and his kin have gone missing while his house remains locked. ""They are not here. The family has gone missing since the incident,"" said a neighbour.

Asked whether Amit was active in the party's youth wing, Gajendra, a villager, told TOI that Amit was seen during different campaigns and activities of the party. ""You can see the board installed here right at the entry of the lane. The family belongs to the village and owns land here,"" he said, pointing to the board.

In the village, many don't want to talk about Amit and his family.

""We live in the building rented out by the family. They own many buildings here,"" said the aunt of one of the children who got injured in the wall collapse.

While the party has officially denied that Amit was a member, some leaders admitted that he had indeed been associated with the party's activities and had even participated in meetings of the Yuvajan Sabha in Noida prior to the disbanding of the youth outfit last year.

""He used to follow a cabinet minister from the state and was actively involved in the party prior to the feud between the Shivpal and Akhilesh factions,"" said a local leader.

Surendra Nagar, Rajya Sabha MP from the SP, told TOI that Amit does not hold even primary membership of the party. ""There are some people who tend to use the party's name. However, he is not even a primary member,"" he said.

According to villagers, the school had been running for the past years but its responsibility was handed over to Solanki and Jha on profit-sharing basis. The responsibility to manage the school was handed over to the duo after changing its name from Khajan memorial to KM Public School last year.

Meanwhile, the students who had been recuperating in two different hospitals are out of danger.

One of the children, Akash (9), who was seriously injured, underwent two surgeries at Yatharth hospital on Tuesday in his right leg and thigh and a rod has been inserted in his leg.

Akhilesh Kumar, father of seven-year-old Amit told TOI that the children -Amit, Naitik and Ashish -- are yet to recover from their injuries. SSP Ajay Pal Sharma told TOI that the teams are out to hunt for the other accused."

In convocations, we should celebrate people who did not accept big jobs and decided to do something that will generate jobs,"" said Manish Sisodia.

Envisioned to be an extension of the Happiness Curriculum, Education Minister Manish Sisodia Tuesday announced that 'Entrepreneurship Curriculum' will be launched in the upcoming academic year for secondary and senior secondary students in the city's government schools. The aim is to create an ""entrepreneurial mindset"" in young people so they become ""job creators"" and not ""job seekers.""

The Happiness Curriculum was launched in July for students from nursery to Class VIII, to encourage mental well-being and ""human-centric education"".

During the first convocation of Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women on Tuesday, Sisodia announced that entrepreneurship classes will be held for one period of every school day for classes IX-XII. He said: ""We train all our focus on preparing for jobs -- this is a discourse we need to change. In convocations, we should celebrate people who did not accept big jobs and decided to do something that will generate jobs.""

The need for institutions to produce graduates who will generate jobs had earlier been raised by Sisodia at the convocation of Delhi Technological University last week, where he had called the act of generating jobs ""nationalist."" Speaking to The Indian Express, he said: ""Our schools only teach students to transfer pre-learnt knowledge, and not to think out of the box. Young people are afraid of being wrong, they have a fear of failure because of which they seek the security of a job. This needs to be done away with. That is one of the primary focus areas of the curriculum.""

The curriculum will not be a skill-based programme and will include components like ""personality and communication development"" and ""professionally inspiring stories"". Its framework is being charted, said officials.

Sisodia added that he has informally identified a team from the education department -- which he will formally select within a week. Inputs from domain experts will also be incorporated, Sisodia said.

""Models of entrepreneurship training already exist but they are not for children and are concentrated into shorter periods like two months. I want to extend these over a period of four years by weaving them into our school pedagogy to reshape their orientation and encourage innovation,"" said Sisodia. These classes are to be conducted by government school teachers themselves, for which they will receive training, said officials."

The factors involved washed away the dust particles suspended in the air. But the city was 40 units more polluted than Delhi.

Tea, coffee to ward off sleep

Lucknow is set to extend its hospitality to drivers on the Lucknow-Agra Expressway by offering them free tea and coffee during the night hours soon so that they can ward off spells of sleep while driving. The step is aimed at helping reduce the number of accidents on the Expressway, particularly during the foggy season. Data shows that the majority of the accidents on the expressway take place between 10 pm and 6 am, after the drivers fell asleep. Tea and coffee stalls would be set up at intervals of 30 km. The driver and one more occupant of the four-wheeler would be served tea or coffee free of cost. If the number of passengers increases, then one would have to pay for every cup.

The district administration's first-of-its-kind initiative aims to provide a platform to budding sportspersons from rural areas and give them the needed push to excel at the state and national levels. Participants in the age group of 10-16 years will play as juniors and those in the 17-30 age bracket will be treated as seniors. Of the 32,000 registered candidates, 10,000 will participate in the 100-metre sprint. Besides, there will be over 1,056 teams for kabaddi, 144 teams for volleyball, and 734 kho kho teams.

Parents' corner

The government is now targeting primary schools to popularise its welfare schemes. Soon, there will be a parents' corner in all government primary schools to inform parents and community members about various government welfare schemes, so that they could benefit from them and improve their living standards. The added advantage of the corner would make parents keep a tack of their child's progress. The inspiration came from a successful experiment undertaken at a government primary school in Gonda district. It helped increase the participation of community members in the school's activities.

The city is in the grip of a cold wave, with the mercury plummeting significantly. Sunday was the coldest day of the season so far, with the minimum temperature plunging to 6.5 degrees Celsius, three degrees below normal. Strong winds from Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir brought down the temperature. Muzaffarnagar was the coldest in the state at 3.4 degrees Celsius.

What one couldn't have missed was the way they handled their roles with a professional touch. It was nothing, but a dedicated show to come out with quality educational videos.

Educational videos are an attempt by the State Council of Education Research and Training (SCERT) to make classes more exciting with innovative teaching methodologies. A team of 40 school teachers from across the state have been deployed for the project and they have made about 3,000 videos on various subjects so far.

One of the students, who participated in a shooting in the city recently, said making of educational videos was itself a joyful experience. Just imagine what could be in store for fellow students, who would learn by watching these videos.

""I was scared at first. But during and after the shooting, I was very happy. My parents, teachers and friends have watched my videos in smart phones and appreciated me,"" said Kiruba S, a student who acted in one of the videos.

""Ten students from our school have participated in the shooting of a Tamil poem. The video was completed in a day. This is a digital warm up for our children. The videos give the children an opportunity to see things and learn. For example, there is a chapter about sea turtles in English. Showing videos of them would be the best experience for the students than showing them pictures,"" said A Saravanaselvi, teacher with a panchayat union middle school at Kinathukadavu block, Dasanayakenpalayam.

Another primary class teacher with the CCMA government high school said even parents were happy with the initiative. ""Little children are more attracted to the background music and are happy to learn from the videos. Seven girls from our school have attended the shooting. Parents are overjoyed,'' said Uma Rani S, assistant head master of the school.

The State Council of Education Research and Training has provided QR codes in the textbooks. Once the QR code is scanned using a mobile phone, the video links will open, allowing teachers to help students see and learn. Approximately 2,500 videos have been linked to QR codes for textbooks of Classes I, VI, IX and XI, and the remaining videos are at the editing stage.

Making of videos for the third term is under way and the process is expected to be completed by December-end.

""We have pushed aside the traditional methods of theoretical training and started with digital methods. The videos will be application oriented to inculcate concept visualization.

Over the last 30 years, India has done a remarkable job ensuring its citizens have access to education. Beginning with State-level policies such as the Andhra Pradesh Primary Education Programme and Shiksha Karmi in Rajasthan in 1984 and 1987, respectively, and culminating in the Centre's Right to Education Act in 2009, the legislative and programmatic attention to education has been tremendous. And with that, there has been a genuine expansion in access and provision at the primary level.

In the chart, historical data from the District Information System on Education (DISE) on the year a school was built have been used to show how the number of government schools across the country has increased relative to three major Central Government education policies, the National Policy on Education in 1986, the District Primary Education Programme in 1994, and the aforementioned Right to Education Act.

Given that it has now been approximately 16 years since the passage of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, the first central level effort, what has this flurry of activity brought? Encouragingly, there have been real wins over time. India has nearly universalised access to education and is now educating more people, including girls, for longer than it ever has before. The programmes have built schools, gotten children into schools, and had them stay in school for longer.

Additionally, it seems like this is also increasing employment and wages. A paper by Gaurav Khanna at the University of California, San Diego, finds that an additional year of schooling has high returns in the labour market, and that large-scale policies to expand education, such as the District Primary Education Programme, redistribute income from high-skilled to low-skilled workers. These are real achievements to celebrate. But this is about where the cheer ends.

On the learning front, the picture is far less rosy. Year after year of results from the Annual State of Education Report (ASER), released by the NGO ASER, has shown that student learning at the primary level is low and not getting better. In 2017, ASER shifted its focus from children at the primary level to ask what is happening with older children in the ages 14-18. Here, the news was no better. Math and reading ability for students in this age group were poor and well below what the government's own standards suggested they should be.

While the government's own National Achievement Survey is more encouraging, it is not by much. India's performance in the 2009 Programme for International Student Assessment (more commonly known as PISA) tests was so controversial that India did not re-enter PISA again (although India has decided to re-enter for 2021). This story of low learning levels is well known to many.

What should we make of these two contradictory findings? On the one hand, access to education has increased, and this is showing real returns on the labour market, and redistribution skills towards low-skilled workers. On the other hand, learning is low for young and older children; it is not improving, and is poor even in comparison to other countries. A new concern is beginning to emerge with the growing demographic bulge of large numbers of young adults exiting the school system and entering the workforce. The promises of the education system are failing on more than just quality, and this could have dire consequences for those promised the world.

A new genre of non-fiction has emerged over the last couple of years tracing the gap between the aspirations and realities for India's youth. Journalists Somini Sengupta and Snigdha Poonam have both written books profiling this new young aspirational class, and many of their dashed aspirations. In both, we find a number of young Indians struggling to find their place in the world. Promised much by their educational attainment, they find their hopes dashed when they emerge into the adult world, with jobs that either fall short of expectations, or a lack of formal employment altogether.

My own work suggests a similar concern -- those that have gone to school for longer are less likely to be trusting of a wide number of public institutions in India.

Using the Indian Human Development Survey, I find that those children that gained access to education as a result of the DPEP then live in households that are less trusting of public institutions. More concerning, those ""DPEP children"" are adults today with their political preferences and economic aspirations.

Why is this happening? The data suggest that while these individuals are earning more money, they are also doing this in different parts of the labour market: the unorganised and short-term contractual labour. Again, the gap between aspirations and reality has led to resentment.

Latin America has seen the rise of a cohort of youth called ""Los NiNis,meaning ""They neither study or work.""

So what can India and other countries, do? There are two solutions: fix schools or fix the school-to-work transition. While fixing schools is clearly important and there is much to be done here, placing undue faith in schools as the sole panacea for this cohort will likely not solve the larger problem of a large number of youth who enter a labour market not as rewarding as promised and cause further distrust in the education system. Schools cannot be blamed for both their own failings and the failings of the outside world.

That leaves us with fixing the school-to-work transition. And here, most solutions lie with the state. Public sector employment -- the much desired sarkari naukri -- has not grown apace with the growth in India's population. According to Devesh Kapur, public sector employment has actually decreased over the last decade.

So an expansion of the public sector is clearly in order. While this will not absorb all of those looking for employment, it will help absorb some as well as address some of India's public management issues.

Next, some combination of general training, labour market matching, and support for employers in hiring young adults is required. Here, the results for middle- and low-income countries are encouraging.

It is clear that the question of how to integrate youth into a larger society is a universal one that spans more regions than just India. The solution, however, likely does not lie with education.

While there are many shortcomings of the education system in India and elsewhere, the question for society is about how to best integrate the young when they have left compulsory schooling but have yet to find work.

It is here that further progression through the education system will run headlong into frustrated expectations as a result of poor integration into labour markets and larger society. To paraphrase WEB DuBois, the problem of the 21st century is the problem of youth employment."

Catalysis for Sustainable Development (CSD) Mission

The Indian Chemical Industry is the 3 largest contributor to the overall chemical industry in Asia and the 8 largest chemicals producer worldwide with estimated size of about US$ 100 billion contributing about 6.7% of the Indian GDP. Chemical industry worldwide relies mostly on fossil feedstock. Due to geopolitical reasons, limited availability and fluctuations in price of these feedstock, it might be precarious to depend on them for our future needs. Thus, it is imperative to focus on alternative and renewable feedstock for chemicals synthesis. This mission mode program addresses this vital issue and intends to develop chemical products and processes utilizing renewable raw materials (in-edible biomass, carbon dioxide (CO), water and shale (natural) gas) instead of the conventional fossil fuels.CSIR Mission Mode project entitled ""Catalysis for Sustainable Development (CSD)"" has been launched for duration of 3 years.

When it came to predictions about the future of medicine, British general physicians (GPs) were generally sceptical that they could be entirely replaced by AI.

""To our knowledge this is the first national survey that explores medical professionals' opinions about how AI will impact the future of a medical specialty,"" said Charlotte Blease, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Harvard Medical School in the US.

""The results suggest a disconnection between the views of experts in medical AI and practicing physicians: the overwhelming majority of general practitioners were unconvinced about the potential for technology to replace them especially when it comes to empathetic patient care,"" said Blease.

The researchers asked physicians about the likelihood that future technology would be able to fully replace the average GP in performing six different medical tasks.

These tasks include diagnostics, prognostics or evaluating when to refer patients to specialists, formulating personalised treatment plans for patients, providing empathic care, and updating patient documentation.

About half of GPs surveyed believed it likely or very likely that AI would be able to replace them in making patient prognoses in the future.

Eighty per cent of respondents believed it likely or very likely that future technology would be able to fully undertake duties related to patient documentation, such as updating medical records.

However, the overwhelming majority of UK GPs studied (94 per cent) believed it was unlikely or extremely unlikely that technology will be able to provide empathic care to patients as well as or better than the average GP.

Nearly seven in 10 UK GPs surveyed believed that it was unlikely or very unlikely that future technology would be able to outperform the average GP when it came to diagnosing patients.

Over 60 per cent of GPs believed it is unlikely or very unlikely that technology would ever be able to replace doctors in decisions about when to refer patients to specialists.

A similar number of GPs was cynical about replacement when it comes to formulating personal treatment plans for patients.

Against their general scepticism about AI, the study found that GPs appeared optimistic that future technology could undertake certain automated tasks, such as paper work.

""Overwhelmingly, general practitioners also believed that artificial intelligence could never replace them on empathy -- yet this is a skill that does not require special medical expertise,"" said Blease.

""Our findings raise important questions about how current and future physicians integrate and harness the power of artificial intelligence, which could ultimately improve the delivery of care to patients,"" he said.

For a blind person, it's a chance to see. For a needy person, it's a helping hand. For a child, it's a support system, arms stretched out, ready to believe in them.

One such ray of hope is the HOPE Project that works in collaboration with the Centre for Catalyzing Change (C3) Unniti Small Grants Program which works towards providing education to children from underprivileged sections for their better future.

The HOPE Project works from Nizammudin Basti and they have opened a school in the area where the kids are given basic primary education and are taught to develop various skills. In the first batch of boys in an all-girls school were three children- Sohail, Nimesh and Kunal.

""Nobody knew where the kids were from. The kids, when they came for the first time, had this apprehension, fear of rejection and being stigmatised. But with time, they got over the anxiety and the fear and have come out as amazing photographers and dancers and are now working towards achieving their dreams. Children who could not even think of going to school are now giving university exams."", says Richa Sundra, Manager of the Centre for Catalyzing Change Foundation.

""We at C3 Unniti Small Grants Program believe in the philosophy of redefining the conventional process of grant giving with a spirit of co-travelling with our partners. The support is small, yet highly effective in building and supporting programs , building the capacity of the organisation towards sustainability and supporting women and girls to develop their full potential"", says Dr. Aparajita Gogoi, Executive Director, Centre for Catalyzing Change.

Sundra and Samiur Rahman, Executive Director of The Hope Project foundation, came together, and brought three boys from an NGO named Katkatha, who help women and children living in the brothels of GB Road, New Delhi, to Hope Project, for an experiment, to secure a better future by bringing those children into the mainstream education.

""The mandate was that we wanted to transform the lives of the children, not even change them. Till date, we have mainstreamed the lives of about 14,000 children. A very important landmark is 37 children from Hope, are going to the university, so you can well imagine the next generation"", Rahman adds. ""Over the years we have been able to win the confidence of the community and others, especially the parents, and the guardians. This kind of population has a different kind of history and story. Its 3 years, now that boys are included in as well.""

Rehman says, ""My kids have been to the children's parliament, and last year they were even nominated to meet the Swiss president, and one of them spoke before the Swiss president. I accept challenges and I do it. Fear is nothing, and fear can never stop me from doing something correct.""

Nimesh, one among the three boys, says, ""We have been here for five years. The best thing that I like about HOPE Project is the unity here. When we first came here, we were a little anxious since we never went to a proper school before. But when we started spending time here, we started liking the place a bit more. And now, this is our favourite.""

Nimesh's one talent that he found during his time here, was photography. ""I recently had my photos shown in an exhibition here which was held for two days. I also made a documentary on the red light area of Delhi, which was awarded the first prize. I bought a camera with the prize money"", he happily adds.

Nimesh was also awarded the Ashoka Fellowship for Young Social Entrepreneurs.

Its stories like Nimesh's that show that all that a child needs is someone who believes in them, and encourages them. It's organizations that the C3 Unniti Small Grants Programme and the HOPE Project that make it happen."

The treatment was designed for patients with CEP290 mutations and a diagnosis of Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). CEP290 acts as a gate between two compartments of photoreceptor cells - a type of sensory neuron in the retina that converts light into signals that provide vision.

Primary photoreceptor blindnesses - such as those caused by CEP290 mutations - are the most common form of LCA and they are currently not treatable.

In this clinical study at sites in the United States and Europe, participants received an intraocular injection of an oligonucleotide - a short RNA molecule - created to reduce the mutant CEP290 protein levels in the photoreceptors and restore retinal function.

""It was very dramatic to see one of the patients improve from only being able to differentiate light or dark to reading many letters on an eye chart at two months following the first injection,"" said lead author Artur V. Cideciyan, PhD, a research professor of Ophthalmology. ""So, we performed a thorough interim analysis of all results from all patients.""

Ten patients received at least one injection into their worst-seeing eye. At three months after the first injection, half of the patients showed improvements in visual acuity, measured by the ability to either read letters, or distinguish direction of black and white bars.

The most basic functions of photoreceptors are to receive and then signal light. This aspect of vision was tested in patients by presenting flashes of light in the dark and measuring the dimmest flash intensity detected.

Treated eyes could detect on average more than six-fold dimmer lights three months after the injections compared to before.

The results were highly statistically significant. Evaluations with two colors of flashes suggested that it was the cone photoreceptors used for daytime vision that were improving with the treatment.

""This therapy to repair the genetic defect in LCA10 is a breakthrough in treatment strategy and will open the door for clinical trials in other patients with this condition and other similar conditions that are currently untreatable,"" said Samuel G. Jacobson, MD, PhD, a professor of ophthalmology and co-lead author of the study.

All patients enrolled so far into the study had two different CEP290 mutations. The p.Cys998X mutation causing a splicing defect was common in all patients and was specifically targeted by the oligonucleotide.

""We performed an extreme form of personalized medicine where we targeted not just a specific gene but a specific mutation in a gene,"" said Cideciyan. ""It is gratifying to see clinical evidence supporting the action of this oligo predicted from basic science.

In the future, we hope to evaluate patients carrying two identical splicing mutations to determine whether the efficacy of the injection might be even greater.""

The authors note that the clinical trial is ongoing to measure safety and efficacy of the injections long-term and the effects of further doses.

When Adith AK packed his bags and left for Majuli, an island in the Brahmaputra river in Assam, in 2017, he did not imagine that he would end up staying there a whole year. ""My backpack had clothes to last me a week; I planned on staying only that long, just having a look around,"" he said.

But something there compelled him to stay put. Back in Chennai for a story recital for Tulika Books, he narrated the reason why.

Before moving to Majuli, Adith wore many hats: storyteller, performer, theatre artiste and dancer. After working with him on a dance video, his friend's friend introduced him to Bipin Dhane, founder of the Ayang trust that runs the Hummingbird School, in rural Majuli -- a primary school providing education to around 250 students.

""Bipin asked me to come and teach whatever I could there, but I did not want to take part in the academics. I wanted to teach kids through theatre or dance. Thankfully, Bipin agreed,"" he said. The Hummingbird, he added, gives tribal communities the relevant education. Books by education boards have lessons that they can't relate to, he said.

For his part, Adith works on teaching children movement. ""I work with teachers on their students' balance, proper hand-eye coordination, especially for younger children who are still working on their fine motor skills,"" he said.

He also trains them in teaching basic subjects through role play. ""For example, we were teaching a group of students about the digestive system. So we divided them into sections and had each of them play a different organ, in rotation. Or say, if you want to do simple addition or subtraction, you role-play as shopkeepers and customers. This helps with memory retention.""

Though he wanted to concentrate on theatre and dance, he also ended up taking charge of administrative work such as fund raising, building libraries and more. ""We collected bamboo and with the help of the locals, built a stage to hold plays,"" he said. He now works with 16 Government schools in the district. He helps teachers integrate theatre into teaching practices.

Life in Majuli, which became the first island to be made a district in India, in 2016, can be slow. The tribal communities form most of the population, and agriculture is the main source of economy. The area has pockets of forests.

Said Adith, ""I was scared I would get bored of the slow lifestyle there. But after a year there, I have realised how kind the people are, and how sustainable the lifestyle there is. I have so much more to learn, I am not coming back anytime soon."""

Naspers and Canada's state pension fund have invested USD 540 million in Indian educational technology startup Byju's, the South African internet giant said on Monday.

Bengaluru-based Byju's launched a learning app in 2015 that offers tools for school students in India, a country with the world's largest number of children in primary education.

The latest investment values the firm at around USD 3.6 billion, Indian media reported.

""The investment will drive the Byju's team to further innovate, explore and set new benchmarks for tech-enabled learning products,"" Naspers said in a statement.

""The company has plans for international market expansion and will make bold investments.""

Byju's has over 30 million registered students, Naspers said, without giving details of the company's financial performance.

Founded more than 100 years ago, Naspers has transformed itself from a newspaper publisher into an USD 87 billion empire, thanks to its one-third stake in Chinese tech giant Tencent.

Naspers shares weren't trading on Monday due to a public holiday in South Africa.

The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), one of the world's biggest investors, is expanding its interests in India due to the country's young population and growing middle class, its chief executive said last week.

Other investors in Byju's include Tencent and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a charity founded by Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan."

When he received the eviction notice from CMRL a week ago, his fears became a reality. He joined 60 other residents who visited the CMRL officials last week to express their strong opposition about the displacement.

Corridors three and four under phase 2 of the Chennai Metro Rail project has received stiff opposition from residents and commercial establishments alike in thickly populated areas of T Nagar, Alwarpet, Mylapore, Kodambakkam and Nungambakkam.

Soon after they received notices from the Revenue Department to vacate their homes to facilitate Metro rail construction, residents sprung into action and forwarded written petitions to CMRL and state government, expressing their dissent.

""Around 30 shops and multiple houses on Chamiers Road, KB Dasan Road, TTK Road, and in Seethammal Colony are affected. For the sake of development, people cannot lose their houses,"" said a resident from Eldams Road, who took part in the meeting organised by residents last week in Ethiraj Kalyana Mandapam.

Traders and shopkeepers along Kutchery Road, Luz Circle and RK Mutt Road are struggling to find alternate spaces to continue their businesses. But, sources from CMRL made it clear that there will be no changes in the initial plan.

""A change in alignment is too early to decide now as the DPR is only in its initial stages. But, our team will hear all grievances put forth by aggrieved residents,"" said a CMRL official. A meeting is also scheduled on Decemeber 21 to hold negotiation talks with such residents added the official.

Similarly, 200-odd residents from T Nagar and Kodambakkam question the necessity of having a Metro station within 30 metres of Kodambakkam suburban station.

""They issued notices to all residents and shops located across 11 streets in T Nagar. But, under the owner's name, they have mentioned Ramakrishna Mission which owned this land some 60 years ago. This shows the absolute lack of coordination between CMRL, Chennai Corporation and Revenue Department,"" said Pasupathy S, member of Vivekananda Residents Welfare Association and Civic Exnora, from T Nagar.

Also, three months ago, CMRL had informed the management of Good Shepherd School in Nungambakkam that 3,300 sq m of the school's premises will be taken over for Sterling Road Station's car park and entry points. Following this, an online petition on Change.org was created against CMRL's move which was signed by 13,000 anxious alumni, students and teachers.

After the matter was taken to the Madras HC, the acquisition process was stalled. But on October 12, the land acquisition officer in charge of this issue informed the school that CMRL will not be changing its plan and will be acquiring the earmarked land. The school will be losing the ground and the primary block which houses 1,000-odd students from classes 1 to 5."

Here's your morning news brief for today.

CAG Forwards Draft Rafale Report To Defence Ministry

The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India has sent its report on the Rafale deal signed by the Modi government to the Nirmala Sitharaman-led Ministry of Defence (MoD) asking for views on it, Hindustan Times has reported. According to the daily, the draft report was sent to the ministry two weeks ago. The CAG is currently looking into a dozen big-ticket arms deals signed in the past few years. The report on the Rafale deal is one of the many such reports finalised and sent to the ministry.

Draft reports are sent to the ministry concerned as part of the standard operating procedure. When final, the report will be shared with the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and a redacted version of it will be tabled in the parliament. The main report, to be presented before the PAC, is likely to carry pricing details.

Government Unchains Ujjwala, LPG To Reach All Poor Households

The Narendra Modi government has expanded the scope of its Ujjwala free Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) connection scheme to reach all poor households, the Times of India has reported. Earlier, the scheme was meant only for those below the poverty line. The move, Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan has said, will lift LPG penetration to 100 per cent households from 90 per cent at present. In 2014, when Modi came to power, LPG penetration in the country stood at around 55 per cent, the minister said.

When launched, the scheme was only meant for families identified by the 2011 socio-economic caste census and a set of other categories. Now any poor family that does not figure in the present set of beneficiary categories can apply with a 14-point affidavit saying none of the family members has an LPG connection.

India Offers $1.4 Billion Aid To Maldives

India has offered the Maldives a $1.4 billion assistance package to bail out the country's economy caught in the Chinese debt-trap. The country's newly elected President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih is currently in New Delhi. On Monday, he held talks with Prime Minister Modi. Solih was elected the country's president earlier this year, ousting from power pro-China strongman Abdulla Yameen, who had steered the country closer to Beijing and into its bent trap. While the new government is still trying to figure out the situation, Chinese debt is estimated to be between $1.5 to 3 billion.

India's offer includes $200 million is for immediate budgetary support, out of which $50 million will be in the form of a grant. India will buy Maldivian treasury bonds for the remaining $150 million. The currency swap deal has been increased to $400 million from $200 million. The remaining $800 million will come in form of a credit line.

UP: Principal Beats Up Students For Not Wishing 'As-Salaam-Alaikum

The principal of the Bilhari Secondary School in Tilhar of Uttar Pradesh's Shahjahanpur district has been booked for allegedly beating up students for not greeting him with ""As-Salaam-Alaikum"", The Indian Express has reported. According to the report, action when Principal Secretary and nodal officer of the district, Dimple Verma, visited the school on Sunday and was told about the demand made by the principal, identified as Chand Mian. ""As-Salaam-Alaikum"", a greeting in Arabic which means ""Peace be upon you"", is a religious salutation among Muslims.

Earlier this year, it was reported that a school in Deoria district of Uttar Pradesh (UP) has been renamed 'Islamia Primary'. According to the reports, the school maintains all official records in Urdu and has a weekly off on Friday instead of Sunday. Khurshid Ahmad, the principal of the primary school, had said that the practice was in place when he joined the school in 2008.

India's Telecom Export Body Flags Huawei Over National Security Concerns

Amid concerns around the world over the risks presented by the telecom equipment manufactured by Huawei, India's telecom export body has raised alarm about the possible dangers the Chinese tech giant presents to the country's national security, Business Standard has reported. According to the daily, the Telecom Equipment and Services Export Promotion Council is planning to write to National Security Advisory Ajit Doval demanding restrictions against the use of Huawei's 5G telecom equipment in India on the lines of the bans imposed by New Zealand, Australia and Japan.

It is feared that Huawei may spy on its users and pilfer information for the Chinese Communist Party. The telecommunications behemoth was set up in 1994 by Ren Zhengfei, a former engineer in the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Earlier this month, Huawei's Chief Financial Officer (and the daughter of its founder) was arrested in Canada while in transit over allegations of dodging US sanctions on Iran.

The school was empty on the day of the shoot, so I did not get to meet anyone. However, I had met them on one occasion, around 1983/1984, when I went back to school. During that time, I was pursuing my masters in English literature. Our team from college was performing Macbeth and when I went and met my teachers, they remembered me and helped me out with whatever support we needed. I remember the classroom, the prayer hall -- everything, looks the same. There was a canteen inside the campus when we were studying, which would sell Ragi Malt for 25 paise. My father would give me a rupee and during lunch, I would go there and buy the drink. It was my favourite place to hangout, and till date, that place remains, and is

functional.

I LOVED HISTORY AND ENGLISH

Of all the classes I took up in school, my favourites were History and English. My History teacher, RRS sir, was very fond of me as I used to be good with memorising dates and events. I also loved learning English, thanks to M Michael sir. However, I was not very fond of Science and Mathematics. I would not pay attention in those classes, pass chits and keep talking -- and the result for my behaviour would be punishment. The lenient teachers made us stand on the bench and the strict ones gave us a good beating (laughs).

MAKING MISCHIEF

One of my friends at the time was a boy called Ramesh. He was very mischievous. But because he was good at cricket, and played well for the school, all his mischief was forgiven. I was not a very academically inclined student and really loved cricket. I played for the school as well. In fact, when I did play well in a match, my headmaster, Sanath Kumar, would give me a holiday. From then till now, one thing that did change this time was that I finally entered the headmaster's house. When in school, he was strict, so I was scared of him, and would have to go to his office only when I had made a mistake. He also always had a dog when on his rounds. Watching him and that dog used to be a favourite pass time.

WHEN ANANT NAG CAME TO SCHOOL

Anant Nag had shot for a film in our school when I was in Class 8. He was filming at the headmaster's quarters and because all the students were scared of him, we only watched from a distance. When I was watching them shoot, I never realised that I would become an actor one day. My dreams were different. But now, life has come full circle. I am an actor, and have acted with Anant Nag. To go back to school and think of all those things, is quite an experience. It's what people call destiny.

The directorate had instructed all private schools to upload their criteria -- with points for each criterion -- for admission in open seats, on its official website by December 14. There is, however, no clarity yet on the schedule of the EWS admissions.

The government has also set an upper age limit of less than four years to be eligible for nursery, less than five years for kindergarten, and less than six years for admission to class 1. The proposal for an upper age limit was challenged in the court last year. Though a Delhi High Court order last year had allowed the imposition of the upper age limit, the DoE had decided that the order will be applicable only from 2019 academic session. Apart from the abolished criteria, the schools have been given autonomy to come up with their own points system.

Claiming that their livelihoods were affected, more than 50 people from those families staged a protest at the collectorate on Monday. The protest kept police personnel on their toes as the protesters kept moving on the premises. They also laid siege to SUV of the collector.

More than 100 people belonging to Malai Kuruvar community were staying on the banks of Noyyal river on Noyyal road near Valarmathi in the dollar city for many years. Involving in phenol selling and bamboo weaving for their livelihoods, they were staying in tent-like structures on the roadside. The district administration had provided housing patta to all the 35 families at Mudhalipalayam but all those lands were already being allotted to some other beneficiaries.

On the eve of inauguration of a lodging facility owned by an AIADMK functionary on the same road, the corporation authorities forcibly removed the families on December 13 without allocating any houses or plots.

The success of any task or activity depends upon the quality of preplanning and whether accomplish or not the objective must be attempted to solidify. To start with a strong monitoring mechanism is imminent in the School level and a rational commitment is needed from all the stakeholders. In my 20 years of continuous selfless attachment in Service Association work like ANSTA & NSEAOA what I personally observed is a logical working system is in the offing particularly management policies at all level and emphatically requires more inputs on academic interest. And to achieve its goal a tangible policy is impending to formulate through the blessing of political will to improvise its traditional tag. In this regard I would like to lay down the following humble suggestions as a measures for improvement of academic acceleration towards qualitative education in the department.

1. Teachers Registry may be installed digitally so as to maintain the actual position of the required Teachers in the GPS, GMS, GHS across the State to balance the staffing pattern and also to check the excess and shortage Teachers in the School. While it can also help in reckoning the actual vacancies caused to be filled up without any discrepancies.

2. Teachers Code with a Working Gown or Working Identity Card may be introduced to Teachers for public recognition in honoring as Professionals. And by doing so it will incline to prevent from manipulative practices of keeping proxy Teacher in the School.

3. Teachers recruitment policy may be taken up on regular basis or conduct at least twice in a year to avoid all sorts of frequent agitation/strikes for want of backlog service regularization which is endless that hampers the daily classroom routine time and again.

4. Primary Education is the backbone of a child's foundation and this basic education must be prioritized by evolving an academic viable policy more of creativity and play way methods of child centered approach to bring about quality education. And it requires a major amalgamation in this sector to carry forward an effective and sustainable teaching learning process which can enable the child to pursue higher education at all level because that is the gate way of building the child's educational future career.

5. An Academic Cell for Primary and Elementary Education may be separately function in the Directorate and promote supervision and monitoring the academic performance of the GPS and GMS in particular. As it is the fundamental basis which can excel in Secondary and Higher Secondary Education ie, HSLC/HSSLC results and therefore more weightage can be given at this stage of primary and elementary targeting to minimize or eliminate the nil result Schools in public exams instead of blaming one another.

6. Regular School inspection with a feed back by the Inspecting Officer may be taken up as a tool for immediate measures towards academic improvement besides cleaning up all

Kinds of unwanted prevalent practices like sharing salaries, Teachers absenteeism, false enrolment of the School etc. While that may lead to minimize the worries and burden of Unions/ NGOs to do the checking indeed this responsibility is being vested to the department officers to carry out periodically.

7. Regular DPC may be held for timely promotion to fill up all the resultant vacancies of Asst. Headmaster, Headmaster at the School level and JEO, SDEO, DEO, the field officers in the Sub. Divisional / District level to upkeep the continuity of coordinating in managing their establishment courteously because these are correlated functionaries as far as administrative aspects are concerned.

8. Teachers Award may be streamlined by giving responsibility to the Heads of the School to identify only deserving genuine Teachers and not by the individual Teachers concerned to initiate by himself/ herself to be awarded. The number of State Teachers Award may be fixed and distributed to all the District on quota wise to do justice to all teaching community in the State. Besides due facilities be accorded and their services can be fully utilized as an outstanding meritorious Teachers in the department.

9. As far as possible Teachers training can be of an oriented motivational teaching learning skill and preferably during vacation so as not to disturb the regular classes.

10. The different formats related to State School Employees bio data/ particulars may be limited to only one and formulate as Unified School Education Format (USEF) inclusive of all expected requirements to fill in such as Staff position, Students enrolment and other physical related matters like building, classrooms, offices, furniture's, fencing, toilets, safe drinking water etc enabling for accessibility use by DoSE, NBSE, SCERT through data base to do away filling of numerous School formats.

11. Instead of opening new Schools the existing Schools may be standardized both in the academic performance and infrastructural facilities to really experience the quality education in the state with the available resources.

12. The Government may plan for observance of Year of Academic Excellence for School Education Department."

The wall of the private primary school collapsed on the children at around 9.30 am allegedly due to the impact of some construction activity, involving use of a heavy machine (JCB), in the adjoining plot in Salarpur village, the police said.

""The children were rushed to a hospital for treatment where two were declared dead, while three others undergoing treatment,"" the Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), Gautam Buddh Nagar, Ajay Pal Sharma, said.

The deceased were identified as Bhupendra Singh, 10, and Vivek, 7, the police said.

Six people, including KM Public School's principal Sanjeev Jha, its manager Raghvendra Solanki, owner Amit Bhati, his relative Deshraj Bhati and Sumit Bhati (Deshraj's son) and an unidentified JCB operator have been booked in this connection, they said.

They have been charged under Indian Penal Code sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), among others, the police said.

The deceased's parents briefly disrupted the traffic on the Dadri-Noida road this evening near the village, demanding compensation.

The DM, who along with SSP Sharma, had visited the hospital and met with the victims and their families, said a magisterial-level probe has been ordered into the incident.

The chief minister has asked the DM to submit a report within a week.

""We will send a preliminary report also to the government and other details would also emerge soon,"" he told PTI.

Singh said the district administration was also looking into the demand of the families seeking compensation. ""Their demands are under consideration,"" he said.

According to the FIR, the school building was ""too old and deteriorated"".

""The construction work in the plot adjoining the school was being done without any official approval from the authorities concerned,"" it stated.

Researchers from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) analysed the effects of becoming the parent of a daughter on both men and women.

A representative sample of parents from a survey spanning two decades in the U.K. between 1991 and 2012 was assessed on whether they supported the notion of the 'traditional male breadwinner', with the wife as a homemaker.

Researchers found strong evidence that having daughters decreases fathers' likelihood to hold traditional attitudes towards gender roles, a trend that became particularly pronounced when daughters reached school-age. They found that father's likelihood to support traditional gender roles typically declined by 8% when their daughters were in primary school and by 11% when their daughters reached secondary school.

Comparatively, the effect of having a daughter on mother's attitudes was not significant, confirming findings from previous studies that having a daughter affects men and women differently.

In addition to changes in attitudes amongst fathers, the authors found behavioural change occurred, as parents of school-age daughters were less likely follow a traditional gender division of work.

While researchers do not directly test the underlying reasons for their findings, they note that instead of the change occurring at the time of the birth of their daughter, the significant attitude change occurs in fathers around the time their daughters reach school age. This coincides with the period where children experience a stronger social pressure to conform to gender norms, researchers said. ""Through parenting, fathers of daughters may develop a better understanding of women's and girls' disadvantages in society, resulting in a significant shift in their attitudes towards gender norms,"" researchers said.

Mothers, on the other hand, hold less traditional attitudes to start with and appear to be less affected by parenting daughters. This may be because they 'have already been exposed to situations of disadvantage first-hand,' researchers said.

""Traditional attitudes towards gender roles can be a barrier to achieving gender equality inside and outside the workplace, so our evidence that such attitudes can change over time is very encouraging,"" said Julia Philipp, a PhD candidate in LSE."

Public image is equity. In politics, business, and entertainment. And when prominent people lose 'public image,' there is also the danger that they will lose a lot more. Mark Zuckerberg knows that. When David Fincher directed The Social Network in 2010, a film adapted by Aaron Sorkin from Ben Mezrich's 2009 book The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook, a Tale of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal, he focussed on the allegedly murky moral universe of founder Mark Zuckerberg. And told the story of the lawsuits that erupted post the success of a little venture that had been ideated in a Harvard dorm, let's not forget, to play 'Hot or Not.'

Around the same time the film released, Zuckerberg donated $100 million towards creating an educational foundation in Newark, New Jersey. The goal was to help the city's struggling school system. The thing to notice here is just how he did it - he did it on the stage of the most popular talk show on the planet. The Oprah Winfrey Show. Was he ensuring that his gesture would overshadow the bad press he would get because of The Social Network? We couldn't tell, but the timing of the gesture was not an accident.

This was of course much before Facebook ran into even rougher weather.

At the end of each year, Mark Zuckerberg writes down his resolutions for the coming year on Facebook. They have ranged from the practical ('Wear a tie every day,' 'Learn Mandarin,' 'Read a book every other week') to the precious ('Meet new people,' 'Write a thank you note each day). Last year - 'to fix Facebook.'

Oops.

2018 has become Facebook's annus horribilis. A never-ending stream of news denting Facebook's image over and over again.

In April 2018, Zuckerberg appeared before the US Congress, post the revelation that Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm linked to the Trump campaign, had harvested the data of an estimated 87 million Facebook users to psychologically profile voters during the 2016 election.

Zuckerberg's Capitol Hill testimony was about the question of accountability for the mishandling of private data without users' knowledge, Russian interference during the 2016 presidential election, and selective censorship.

What was apparent was that despite its supposed intent to connect the world, Facebook had somehow succeeded in dividing its consumers across political lines. At least it was a throwback to the motto of its early days - Move Fast and Break Things. And did they ever.

The Senators at the hearing also indicated that they weren't sure if they could trust a company that has repeatedly violated its privacy promises. If Zuckerberg - much like another 'voice of a generation' Lena Dunham - is known for one thing, it's apology tours. This time, on the biggest stage of them all, Zuckerberg's implacable face, carefully controlled gestures and robotic monotone unleashed a flurry of memes.

On this edition of Digging Deeper, we continue our stories on the biggest news events of the year. The public image of the company that got us all image-conscious is up there with the biggest ones of the year. We will not just review the damage to the trust equity of Facebook and Zuckerberg but also focus on another protagonist in this tale, the woman who asked women across the world to 'lean in,' and the woman who was supposed to be the infallible voice of conscience in the company - COO Sheryl Sandberg. A Book of Faces falling from their pedestals is our story today. My name is Rakesh, and you are listening to Moneycontrol.

Facebook's year in review

2018 has been a relentlessly difficult one for Facebook and perhaps the most unforgiving in its 14-year history. In comparison, 2010 (when after Facebook violated users' privacy by making key types of information public without proper consent or warning) seems like a bad dream that Zuckerberg woke himself up from and then went about his day with a shrug.

If the taint of unwittingly spreading Russian propaganda during the 2016 US presidential election was not enough, newer and more serious accusations of data misuse, the proliferation of fake and misleading news that was reported to even have fanned the fires of genocide in Myanmar, have been plaguing the company. Zuckerberg seems woefully out of touch with how his platform can cause harm via hate speech and misinformation. As when he saw no harm in retaining posts concerning Holocaust denial on Facebook. (For reference, Holocuast denial is illegal in 16 European countries and Israel.)

Zuckerberg and Sandberg, the faces of the company have expectedly lost goodwill during the course of the year.

As Cnet put it, the scandals have had a far-reaching fallout, with founders at companies owned by Facebook heading towards the exit door. Those who have left include WhatsApp co-founder and CEO Jan Koum; Instagram co-founder and CEO Kevin Systrom and Chief Technical Officer Mike Krieger; and Oculus co-founder Brendan Iribe.

Sandberg's conduct during this tumultuous year has not been exemplary either, and that has surprised legions who joined Team Sandberg post her genteel overtures to feminism with her theory of Leaning In. And the worldwide sympathy and admiration she evoked post a viral Facebook post about the sudden demise of her husband and the subsequent talkshow appearances she made to give messages of hope and healing to those struggling with unexpected loss. But more about her later.

Only last week, Facebook revealed that a bug could have exposed the private photos of up to 6.8 million users to outside developers.

But the annus horribilis began in March, when a joint investigation by The New York Times, The Guardian and The Observer revealed that the UK-based consultancy Cambridge Analytica, with now-proven ties to Donald Trump's presidential campaign, had misappropriated the data of 270,000 accounts of Facebook's over 2 billion users.

The way this happened is rather convoluted. And we dove very deep into it on an earlier episode.

A Cambridge professor, Aleksandr Kogan, created a personality quiz app called ""thisisyourdigitallife,"" and gained access to information on 270,000 accounts through Facebook's Login feature and then shared the data with Cambridge Analytica. It turned out later that the breach had in fact affected over 87 million users.

Here is where Zuckerberg and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg let down the users who have entrusted them with their privacy. They remained quiet during the initial days of the story breaking, although Facebook subsequently built a tool to let users know if their data had been accessed. Facebook did go on to admit that names, email addresses and phone numbers and in the case of 14 million users, even data with birth date, hometown and workplace, along with other information had been hacked.

Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica from its platform but only after much of the damage was done.

The credibility of the company is at an all-time low. Especially after Facebook executive Andrew ""Boz"" Bosworth's leaked 2016 memo made it clear Facebook thrives on expansion at the expense of user safety. The inevitable question being asked today is, What kind of a value system prevails within a company that has undermined the trust of the users who have contributed to its success. This November, as is well-known, The New York Times published a revealing investigation into how Facebook ""delayed, denied, and deflected"" the scandals besmirching it. And one figure that decidedly fell from grace post the piece was Sheryl Sandberg.

Lack of accountability

The New York Times report details Sandberg's meltdown in September 2017 post the discovery by Facebook's engineers that there was suspicious Russia-linked activity on its site and a federal investigation was looming on the horizon.

Interestingly, Sandberg's anger had little to do with the misappropriation of data but with the fact that the social network's security chief, Alex Stamos, had informed company board members that Facebook had yet to contain the Russian infestation.

We quote, ""Mr Stamos' briefing had prompted a humiliating boardroom interrogation of Ms Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, and her billionaire boss. She appeared to regard the admission as a betrayal. ""You threw us under the bus!"" she yelled at Mr Stamos, according to people who were present. The clash that day would set off a reckoning - for Mr Zuckerberg, for Ms Sandberg and for the business they had built together.""

The fact that 2.27 billion people and their personal data, photos, messages, shares and interaction had made Facebook, a Fortune 500 company and a global brand, seemed to miss her. As also the fact that her company was being used, as the piece says, ""to disrupt elections, broadcast viral propaganda and inspire deadly campaigns of hate around the globe."" Her concern was more to do with a personal loss of face.

The biggest takeaway from this New York Times piece and the bit that irrevocably taints Sandberg as also Zuckerberg is that the two despite being aware of warning signs, concealed them from public view.

When the truth inevitably came out, the company's stock price stumbled and as we said before, its trust equity suffered a walloping as well.

What followed was a massive campaign to repair the damage. New York Times again, ""In the last year, Ms Sandberg has overseen an aggressive lobbying campaign to combat Facebook's critics, shift public anger toward rival companies and ward off damaging regulation. Facebook employed a Republican opposition-research firm to discredit activist protesters, in part by linking them to liberal financier George Soros. It also tapped its business relationships, persuading a Jewish civil rights group to cast some criticism of the company as anti-Semitic. In Washington, allies of Facebook, including Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate leader, intervened on its behalf. And Ms Sandberg wooed or cajoled hostile lawmakers, while trying to dispel Facebook's reputation as a bastion of Bay Area liberalism.""

Facebook acknowledged that there was misinformation but did not attribute the misinformation and its propagation to Russia. Alex Hern, Guardian UK's tech editor said, ""It looked like it was a deliberate attempt to reduce the pushback from the Republican Party who, Facebook feared, would accuse them of batting for the Democratic Party if they said the truth, which was that there was a Republican misinformation campaign which was overwhelmingly in favour of Donald Trump.""

The New York Times report also brought out one more nugget - highlighting Facebook's link to an American political consultancy called Definers Public Affairs, which as Hern puts it, practices the ""dark arts of political campaigning, including an in-house smear factory."" A specific example of Definers' work - spread allegations that George Soros was funding Facebook's political opponents. In an environment where ""George Soros"" is used as an anti-Semitic dogwhistle, the subtext was simply, ""Jews are trying to crush Facebook."" This, let us remind you, was not a third party activity, this was what they had been hired to do - attack the opponents of Facebook.

A public statement was issued by Facebook but many felt it was a case of too little too late.

The statement said, ""This has been a tough time at Facebook and our entire management team has been focused on tackling the issues we face. While these are hard problems we are working hard to ensure that people find our products useful and that we protect our community from bad actors.""

The trouble is not over yet. Regulatory and law enforcement forces in the US and Europe are still knocking at the company's door, and a national privacy law is being mooted that may hamper the future growth of Facebook.

Stamos and some other high-ranking executives have left the company and some onlookers believe that it is just a matter of time before Zuckerberg and Sandberg have to reconsider their positions at the company.

How Sheryl Sandberg's halo slipped

The making of an icon is an interesting process. And this year saw the fall of not just Sandberg but many others. Including Myanmar State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi in whose fall, Facebook played an indirect role when it spurred the Rohingya genocide via inflammatory posts. Until recently, Aung San Suu Kyi was the celebrated heroine of the democratic uprising against the Military Junta. In 2017, she was even presented with a new rose hybrid named after her in Kunming, China. Even to those who did not know much about her politics, the image of Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi with a rose in her hair, stood for resilience and courage despite a 15-year long house arrest as a political prisoner. A time during which she was separated from her children and saw her husband only five times and lost him on his 53rd birthday.

In 1999, Time Magazine called Suu Kyi one of the ""Children of Gandhi"" and his spiritual heir to non-violence. Yet, post her ascension to the office of State Counsellor, Aung San Suu Kyi has drawn world-wide criticism over her inertia and apathy towards the persecution of the Rohingya community in the Rakhine State and her refusal to concede that Myanmar's military had a hand in the genocide. Not just that, under her watch, journalists have suffered persecution as well.

Why this story needed to be told is that in a world starved of female representation in politics and boardrooms, the fall of powerful women like Aung San Suu Kyi and Sandberg is particularly hurtful and disappointing to women who look up to them and are inspired by their success.

Sandberg was a beacon of liberal ideals. She came into Facebook with impeccable credentials - a former Clinton administration official and ex vice president of global online sales and operations at Google. Her book Lean In, published in 2013, was a bestseller despite criticism that its approach towards making workplaces and success more accessible to women was based on the experiences of white and privileged feminism unconscious of intersectionality of race and identity. Also the book's notion that women could have it all was recently and famously dissed by former First Lady Michelle Obama who said, ""that s#!t doesn't work all the time.""

Still, in 2015, Sandberg became more than just a powerful corporate success story and turned into a figure of empathy for millions when she lost husband Dave Goldberg, the chief executive of SurveyMonkey. Her viral Facebook post about the loss saw an instant outpouring of sympathy from all over the world as people saw glimpses of their own losses in lines like, ""The most powerful one-line prayer is: 'Let me not die while I am still alive.' I would have never understood that prayer before losing Dave. Now I do. I think when tragedy occurs, it presents a choice. You can give in to the void, the emptiness that fills your heart, your lungs, constricts your ability to think or even breathe. Or you can try to find meaning. I have spent many moments lost in that void. And I know that many future moments will be consumed by the vast emptiness as well. But when I can, I want to choose life and meaning. So I am sharing what I have learned in the hope that it helps someone else. In the hope that there can be some meaning from this tragedy.""

The use of Facebook for this post and the pathos in its content was a perfect example of what perhaps the platform was originally intended for. Making connections and bringing people together.

And as New York Times said in its recent piece, ""like other technology executives, Mr Zuckerberg and Ms Sandberg cast their company as a force for social good. Facebook's lofty aims were emblazoned even on securities filings: ""Our mission is to make the world more open and connected."" But as Facebook grew, so did the hate speech, bullying and other toxic content on the platform. When researchers and activists in Myanmar, India, Germany and elsewhere warned that Facebook had become an instrument of government propaganda and ethnic cleansing, the company largely ignored them.

Facebook had positioned itself as a platform, not a publisher. Taking responsibility for what users posted, or acting to censor it, was expensive and complicated. Many Facebook executives worried that any such efforts would backfire.""

In December 2015 for instance, Presidential nominee Donald Trump, reminds New York Times, posted a statement on Facebook calling for a ""total and complete shutdown"" on Muslims entering the United States. And the post was shared more than 15,000 times on Facebook, and as the piece puts it, this was an illustration of the site's power to spread racist sentiment.

At this point, Zuckerberg actually comes up looking better than Sandberg because he asked Sandberg and other executives if Mr Trump had violated Facebook's terms of service. But the fact that nothing was done contributes to the impression that both he and Sandberg let things go.

More opportunism was displayed by Sandberg when post Trump's victory, she installed a well-connected Republican Joel Kaplan in the company .

We quote, ""The company also hired a former aide to Trump's new attorney-general, Mr Jeff Sessions, along with lobbying firms linked to Republican lawmakers who had jurisdiction over Internet companies.""

The thing that would come back to haunt both Zuckerberg and Sandberg was their refusal to act when as early as in the spring of 2016, a company expert on Russian cyber warfare unearthed how Russian hackers were probing Facebook accounts for people connected to the presidential campaigns.

During the US general elections, says the piece, the team also found Facebook accounts linked to Russian hackers who were messaging journalists to share information from the stolen e-mails.

The fact that Sandberg was angry at the examination of Russian activity without approval, and not at what the activity entailed, has been fatal for her reputation.

That her pick Kaplan was against the issuance of a public paper about these findings also shows her up in an uncomplimentary light.

We quote, ""Ms Sandberg sided with Mr Kaplan. Mr Zuckerberg - who spent much of 2017 on a national ""listening tour,"" feeding cows in Wisconsin and eating dinner with Somali refugees in Minnesota - did not participate in the conversations about the public paper. When it was published that April, the word ""Russia"" never appeared.

Ms Sandberg's subordinates took a similar approach in Washington, where the Senate had begun pursuing its own investigation, led by Mr Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, and Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat. Throughout the spring and summer of 2017, Facebook officials repeatedly played down Senate investigators' concerns about the company, while publicly claiming there had been no Russian effort of any significance on Facebook.""

By August 2017, the situation had become too dire to ignore and as the piece puts it, had become a ""five-alarm fire.""

Even when Zuckerberg and Sandberg agreed to go public with some findings with a blog post on September 6, 2017, the day of the company's quarterly board meeting, they decided to go easy on the specifics.

The atmosphere at the full board gathering was uneasy with Sandberg bearing the brunt of most of the queries and later having the melt down we have talked about earlier.

We quote, ""Later that day, the company's abbreviated blog post went up. It said little about fake accounts or the organic posts created by Russian trolls that had gone viral on Facebook, disclosing only that Russian agents had spent roughly $100,000 - a relatively tiny sum - on approximately 3,000 ads."" Unquote. That Sandberg was a willing party to the suppression of truth has been now established. Her other actions have not been spared scrutiny either.

We quote Cnet, ""It turned out Sandberg asked her staff to look into Soros' financial motivations after he called companies like Facebook and Google a ""menace"" during a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Facebook's board defended Sandberg's actions, but by then her image had been tarnished.""

Zuckerberg had once described Sandberg thus and we quote, "" She's unique in that she has an extremely high IQ and EQ, and it's really rare to get that in any single person."" Needless to say, there was perhaps a system failure that somehow corrupted the head and the heart of the company.

An opportunity lost

Sheryl Sandberg is now the object of attention of many culture analysts and multiple writing exercises that try to make sense of her journey. As Anne Helen Petersen, a senior culture writer for BuzzFeed News put it, ""Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg -- the person largely responsible for the revenue behind that huge valuation -- had been figured as a kind of super-unicorn herself: the rare woman capable of wielding power while preserving her likability. In dozens of profiles and interviews about the company and Sandberg's role in it, that uniqueness was emphasized time and time again.""

Facebook board member Jim Breyer had told Bloomberg Businessweek in 2011, ""I can say very simply I have never seen anyone with her combination of infectious, enthusiastic spirit combined with enthusiastic intelligence.""

Reams had been written about her interpersonal skills and sharp intellect and her endearing ability to be playful and businesslike.

In a thriving office that had a frat boy culture, Sandberg was a breath of fresh air.

BuzzFeed news writer Ann describes her as a ""half empath, half Spock"", and that ""rare powerful executive with a soft touch"" who knew how to monetize Facebook's product without cramping its style.

We quote, ""Between Sandberg's arrival in 2008 and Facebook achieving ""mega-unicorn"" status in 2013, Sandberg developed an almost mystical reputation within Silicon Valley."" That she did all this without overshadowing Zuckerberg showed she had tactical smarts.

Ann quotes, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen who told Fortune, ""Every company we work with wants 'a Sheryl. I keep explaining to people that we haven't figured out yet how to clone her.""

Her book Lean In, as we said before, further perpetuated her aura as a successful woman who was easy going and supportive, who had it all and wanted everyone to have it all too.

But things have changed and how. The piece quotes John Herrman who said in the Times, ""Facebook is in a constant state of crisis such that its executives' responses to scandals end up becoming scandals themselves."" Unquote. And as Ann puts it, even more so than her boss, and the platform's primary architect, Zuckerberg, Sandberg's gone from Facebook's saviour to the embodiment of all that's gone wrong with it.""

The critical shift in how she is being perceived now can be traced to the destruction of the feel-good myth that she was at the behest of a higher calling.

As Ann says, people are beginning to realise that big corporations are built to make money, and consolidate enough power to keep making it -- and the executives that lead them to excel by doing so with ruthless efficiency. We quote, ""Unicorns aren't real, and never have been; the vast majority of us are not Sandberg's mentees or her friends. We're customers, and Sandberg's most pressing business has always been business itself.""

And that is exactly something her admirers are finding difficult to come to terms with. But as the piece suggests just as her glorification was excessive, her vilification is also extreme. The piece suggests that the critical pile-on against Sandberg may be sexist and may be providing ammunition to those who always argue cynically that this is what happens when women attempt to ""have it all.""

So while cultural theorists like Leo Lowenthal call her an ""idol of production,"" Zuckerberg continues to be seen as an innovator.

The fallout

In the recent times, Facebook has removed fake accounts tied to Iran with over 1 million followers but in the years to come, its role though unintentional in impacting the political climate of the world, and spreading divisive agendas will be studied by political pundits and startups hoping to connect the world further. As of now, it is facing the inevitable backlash from not just US lawmakers but in Europe where reports www.cnet.com, lawmakers and regulators were digging into the company's data practices.

We quote, ""Italian regulators fined Facebook $11.4 million for misleading users about how their data is used.And in a rare move, the UK Parliament seized internal Facebook e-mails and documents that were part of a lawsuit involving now-defunct app developer Six4Three. The documents reinforced the public's privacy concerns about the social network, which has denied selling user data.

Critics argued that Facebook, which makes billions of dollars from advertising, not only lacked an ""ethical roadmap"" but also had a history of placing its profit before user privacy. "" Unquote.So who will pay the bigger price for Facebook's failures? Sandberg or Zuckerberg? Well, your guess is as good as ours."

The primary purpose of BANA is to foster culture and education in the Greater Houston Area.

It was evening full of music, dance and play. The evening started with Ganesh Vandana by Khyatee and Anjuli, two students of Uma Nagarsheth of the Natya Upasana Dance Academy. It was a fusion of old and new beats, combining north Indian classical Kathak and displaying the vibrancy of Kathak with a modern twist. A group of 5 under 7 girls (Nandika, Raina, Mansi, Saanvi and Anusha) peformed a dance to the tunes of Deepawali and Ghoomar songs and showed mystical rotational movements. The dance was choreographed by Namita Maharana. Namita and Abhilasha peformed a Bollywood number to the tunes of the classical songs ""Paan khaye saiyan humaro"" and ""nainonwale ne"".

For the last several years BANA middle and high school children have formed a very talented musical team for orchestra. The instruments used by the team included acoustic guitar (Antara), electric guitar (Arya), flute (Pari), keyboard (Pranay), violin (Abhinav), drums (Harsh) and tabla (Shomik). This was an extremely well directed musical performance by Tanushree Mishra with her group of young singers (Sweta and Tony). Special melodiuos vocal performances by Mithuya Choudhury and Tanushree Mishra on songs from the 70s Bollywood films were another highlight of the evening. Several Bhojpuri folk songs were part of the evening and included ""Patna Se Baida Bulai Dha"" by Shikha, ""Veer Kunwar Singh"" by Mithuya and ""Sundar Subhumi Bhaiya"" by Tanushree and was very much appreciated by the audience. Another highlight of the show was a ""Lazy Dance"" by seven laziest dancers you will ever see to some popular Hindi Songs. The performers were Ravi, Binay, Atul, Rakesh, Umesh, Sanjay and Santosh. It was choreographed by Ravi Choudhary. It was the funniest and rib-tickling performance of the evening.

The second half of the show was a play directed by Dr. Chandeswar Sharma and titled ""Veer Kunwar Singh Mara Nahin"". Veer Kunwar Singh Mara Nahin was a play with current and historical context. The play had dramatic twists and several songs to keep everybody entertained. It evoked stalwart historical heroes from India's fight for freedom from the British. The play depicted that oppression and evil exist in every age but it is up to us whether we tolerate it or fight it. The actors were Dr. Chandeshwar Sharma, Praveen Srivastava, Vinay Karna, Bidhu Prakash, Binay Anand, Arvind Maharana, Rashmi Singh, Mithuya Choudhary, Amrita Srivastav and Tanushree Mishra. The music was supported by Shomik Verma, Sweta Gupta, and Joel Adimathra. The Sutradhar of the play was Soni Mishra.

The evening was emceed by four high school students, Arya, Ananya, Abhinav and Pari. They kept the entire audience entertained by their wonderful knowledge of drama, music, dance, movies, and the arts of the region of Bihar and Jharkhand. They were very well directed by Ravi Choudhury.

BANA also anounced its Annual Service Awards. The 2018 Lifetime Achievment award went to Dr. Chandeshwar Sharma and Mrs. Kunjan Sharma for their outstanding contributions to BANA in performing arts and leadership for the last twenty years. The oustanding service award went to Dr. Nazish Hoda for his continued selfless support to all BANA events for the last 4 years and youth service award went to Shikha Karna for her oustanding contributions in the performing arts for the last five years.

BANA anounced the results of the election for 2019-2020, and Atul Sinha will take over, from Dr. Santosh Verma, as President of BANA. His committee also includes Praveen Srivastava, Manish Sinha, Amaresh Mishra, Rajeev Jha, Prabhakar Sinha, and Amit Kumar."

A primary school in Kaushambi district of Prayagraj is using the popular 'Snakes and Ladders' board game to create awareness among students regarding the importance of looking beyond usual vocations while choosing their career path.

Teachers at the Primary School Perai are using the game to motivate students to be successful in life by climbing the simple ladder of hard work, without worrying too much about the hurdles -- represented by snakes. They are especially encouraging students to dream big and think beyond the professions of their parents.

In this rural area, most students hail from a humble background. Someone's father is a plumber, someone else's a carpenter, mason or daily wager. The school authorities are trying to help these children look beyond these professions that would fetch them only a meagre income.

""We help our Class 5 students aspire for more in life instead of settling for small goals. With the 'Snakes and Ladders' board game, we create awareness among them about professions of teaching, medicine and engineering, which could make their lives prosperous and help them turn around their family's fortunes,"" said principal Hari Om Singh.

""The game is simple. Rules are similar to the traditional 'Snakes and Ladders', with some additional interesting information shared to benefit the students and retain their interest. Children are told not to get disheartened if they slip down due to a 'snake bite', for they need to remember that there is always the 'ladder' of hard work available to help them make it to the top,"" the teacher explained further.

He said the idea was to make students aware of the professions they would normally not think about on account of their rural background and tender age.

""The game is very interesting,"" said Tej Singh, a Class 5 student whose father runs a shop. ""We learn so much more about professions such as being a bureaucrat, cartoonist, animator, teacher, doctor and engineer,"" he said.

Another student Manu Singh said, ""It is great fun to play the game with friends and get information about new things at the same time. We learnt a lot from this drill, especially about the various career options open for us."""

The most endearing aspect of life for 58 year old Stella Nwanganga Ntiajuka was her job as a primary school head teacher in her hometown Lagos in Nigeria. She had been thoroughly enjoying her role for many years and was very fond of her students, as they were of her. The thought of a busy day at the bustling school premises was something she woke up looking forward to, every day.

Early last year, Stella started experiencing difficulties in her throat, which started as a difficulty to swallow solid foods, accompanied by hoarseness of voice. By April 2018, she noticed the appearance of a sizeable lump on her throat. She didn't worry about it at first, but as days passed, she experienced a worsening discomfort in her throat. Even when she tried to swallow the food by flushing it down her throat with water, she wasn't very successful. This resulted in an alarming decline in weight to almost 18 kilograms.

She approached a local hospital in her hometown, expecting to be diagnosed with either malaria or typhoid. Little did she know that this would be the start of a harrowing journey from one hospital to another and from one diagnostic lab to another. Despite seeing several doctors, her illness could not be diagnosed. In July 2018, an ENT specialist at one of the hospitals referred her to a university teaching hospital.

At the university teaching hospital, she had appointments with a specialist doctor twice a week. She underwent several diagnostic tests, X-rays and even biopsy, over a period of time. Finally, the biopsy result revealed 'benign spindle tumor in the neck'. However, the hospital couldn't operate her because of the risk involved due to the critical location of the tumor. The tumor was located on her throat such that any surgical intervention would involve the risk of turning fatal.

Stella started finding it increasingly difficult to eat food, either solid or semi-solid, and to even drink water. She was unable to sleep at night, and was losing weight rapidly due to decreased food intake. When she couldn't bear it anymore, her family decided to look for options abroad. They discussed this with her son, who in turn suggested Thumbay Hospital - Ajman, based on positive feedbacks he had heard about the hospital.

She was attended by Dr Hillol Kanti Pal, Medical Director and Consultant Neurosurgeon at Thumbay Hospital, Ajman. Observing her in the OP department, Dr Hillol noticed the sizeable mass on her neck occupying the right carotid triangle, an area through which runs the common carotid artery and the internal jugular vein. After preliminary and detailed investigations, and in the light of the biopsy report from her home country, Dr Hillol diagnosed her with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). She was in the O-ve blood group, making the prospect of a surgical intervention even more complex. ""Her difficulty in swallowing food - called 'Dysphagia' in medical parlance - had caused her to lose 18 kgs of body-weight in just a few months. As we prepared for the surgery, perhaps the biggest challenge in addition to her rare blood group was that she had hardly eaten for 8 months. She also had diabetes mellitus, meaning the post-operative wounds could take longer to heal,"" Dr Hillol recounted.

Dr Hillol assembled a team of surgeons of the hospital, for the procedure. ""This was a tough task for one individual alone to perform. We also arranged several consultation sessions for the patient and her husband, with the team that would be performing the surgery. This was important to make them understand the process involved, as well as to allay their apprehensions,"" he said. The team of surgeons included Dr Rajesh Sisodiya - Specialist General Surgeon, Dr Faisal Ameer, Specialist Plastic Surgeon and Dr Rohit Gulati, Specialist ENT Surgeon.

Stella underwent 3 surgical procedures: the first one to insert a pipe through her nose, so that she could take fluid food. The second procedure was to prevent the growth of the tumor and the third one was to remove the entire tumor. The complete procedure took a total of around six-and-a-half hours. ""Only one unit of blood was used throughout the entire procedure. The happiest moment for us was when, 24 hours after the surgery, the patient was able to move her hands and she held my hand and smiled,"" Dr Hillol said.

In order to celebrate the unique characteristic of our country, Bhasha Sangam provides an opportunity to schools and educational institution (BIETS, DIETs, CTEs/IASEs, SCERTs, SIEs, School Boards, Directorates of School Education, etc.) to provide multilingual exposure to students in Indian Languages. The objective is to familiarize every child with simple dialogues in all the 22 languages under Schedule VIII of the Constitution of India, taking up one language on each working day, to enhance linguistic tolerance and promote national integration.

The initiative has been widely received and accepted by States and UTs in very positive manner and schools are introducing five simple and commonly used sentences as per their convenience without any additional load on school students. Also, more than 55,000 videos of such experiences have been shared by the schools. There are 77,510 views of these videos on YouTube and 97,83,762 impressions on Twitter.

Section 29(2)(F) of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 states that ""medium of instruction shall, as far as practicable, be in child's mother tongue"". The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005 emphasises the importance of imparting primary education in the mother tongue of the child. Since education is in the Concurrent List, States have the liberty to decide the medium of instruction in schools. The NCF also states that the 'Three Language Formula' is an attempt to address the challenges and opportunities of the linguistic situation in India. As per the 'Three Language Formula' the first language to be studied, must be the mother tongue or the regional language. In non-Hindi - speaking States, children learn Hindi. In the case of Hindi speaking States, children learn a language not spoken in their area. Sanskrit may also be studied as a modern Indian language in addition to these languages.

The Bhasha Sangam initiative under the 'Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat' aims to make the students aware about the unique cultural, ethnic and linguistic diversity of our country."

My parents had always given me the freedom to travel alone and explore new places but this time, it was tough to convince them about my plans. To reinforce their faith in me to travel to a border area was difficult, even more so to reaffirm that I will be safe.

Upon reaching, I was greeted with green pastures surrounded by an expanse of meadows. Not shockingly, I was taken in by Rajouri's exquisite beauty, and a history that harks back to many centuries; even finding mention in the travelogue of Chinese traveler Hiuen Tsang (who visited the town in 632 AD).

The same area is now marked by conflict, militancy, and everyday encounters. Strident and grueling politics of the government has hardened the line of differences between locals and the Indian state.

The unexpected presence of Kashmiri students in militant ranks has sparked a debate about the hostility against the State and the feeling of exclusion felt by Kashmiris.

I had expected to be presented with a reality which we seem to be familiar with - that there isn't an inclination to study, and students are actively taking up arms against the web of deceit spun by the government. But,

I asked myself why. That query led me to a more pertinent question - was there widespread disappointment amongst the people regarding the educational development of the state?

I was eager to get these answers. Only, they were not what I had expected.

My travel to Rajouri was largely secured and ensured by a professor from Baba Ghulam Shah Badshah University (BGSBU). Here was a university between lush green forests; disconnected from the city. It catered to a large number of students ­who were mostly from Kashmir, especially its farthest corners.

Despite initial reservations from both sides, I started interacting with the students enrolled there. Little did I know, it would shatter my pre-conceived notions of what I had heard about the university's troubled past, and Kashmir itself.

Beyond the compassion and warmth of everyone I met, what I had learned (and unlearned) about Kashmir surpassed my expectations.

Our discussions varied from exposure to Kashmiri culture to recent agitations against political authorities. The latter required discretion from both sides. Yet, there was a consensus on the degraded condition of their education system. As a student told me,

""My admission got delayed because I received my degree certificates late. These late results amongst many other factors are reasons behind frustration amongst the student community.""

Another source of frustration is the difficulty faced by the introduction of English education to their system. English language is dynamic and evolving, I was told, while Kashmiri is static. As a result, people are getting disconnected with their culture. To overcome these challenges, doctoral students are taking it upon themselves to keep their native language alive.

A student told me, ""since our language and culture is deeply embedded into our lives, some of the students are leading the programs of reviving their roots by teaching Kashmiri to primary and secondary school students.""

In fact, the university has a centre for cultural revival that teaches Urdu and Gujjari as well.

The media reports often about the closure of educational institutions due to the subversive activities across the state, that causes instability and miseries amongst the people living in border areas. But there are various other lesser known problems.

For example, I was told that there is a lack of funds provided to the state universities, complicating the matter further. This has a damaging effect on the availability of standard reading material, which has made it difficult to sustain academic spaces.

It was shocking to learn that doctoral students had barely heard about JStor and Scribd, two online databases that us students liberally use back in Delhi for academic papers.

At best, I realised how modest and sincere Kashmiri youth were. They shared their sentiments with me through which I got a glimpse of their predicament and sense of uncertainty regarding their future. The reality of Kashmiri students and their plight is far detached from the drawing room conversations outsiders luxuriously indulge in.

There are many grievances which have to be immediately addressed by the Indian government since these activities are affecting the psyche of the Kashmiri students. Till then, through cultural revival and a diverse student body, these students bring alive their aim of nation building, finding light at the end of a long tunnel.

Researchers from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) analysed the effects of becoming the parent of a daughter on both men and women.

A representative sample of parents from a survey spanning two decades in the UK between 1991 and 2012 were assessed on whether they supported the notion of the 'traditional male breadwinner', with the wife as a homemaker.

Researchers found strong evidence that having daughters decreases fathers' likelihood to hold traditional attitudes towards gender roles, a trend that became particularly pronounced when daughters reached school-age.

They found that father's likelihood to support traditional gender roles typically declined by eight per cent when their daughters were in primary school and by 11 per cent when their daughters reached secondary school.

Comparatively, the effect of having a daughter on mother's attitudes was not significant, confirming findings from previous studies that having a daughter affects men and women differently.

In addition to changes in attitudes amongst fathers, the authors found behavioural change occurred, as parents of school-age daughters were less likely follow a traditional gender division of work.

While researchers do not directly test the underlying reasons for their findings, they note that instead of the change occurring at the time of the birth of their daughter, the significant attitude change occurs in fathers around the time their daughters reach school age.

This coincides with the period where children experience a stronger social pressure to conform to gender norms, researchers said.

""Through parenting, fathers of daughters may develop a better understanding of women's and girls' disadvantages in society, resulting in a significant shift in their attitudes towards gender norms,"" researchers said.

Mothers, on the other hand, hold less traditional attitudes to start with and appear to be less affected by parenting daughters. This may be because they 'have already been exposed to situations of disadvantage first-hand,' researchers said.

""Traditional attitudes towards gender roles can be a barrier to achieving gender equality inside and outside the workplace, so our evidence that such attitudes can change over time is very encouraging,"" said Julia Philipp, a PhD candidate in LSE.

""The study shows that attitudes rather than fixed over time, can change later in life. This is a very promising finding that suggests that exposure to others' circumstances can help shape behaviour,"" Philipp said. (AGENCIES)"

With greater acknowledgement of hand hygiene in infection control, the global market for hand hygiene is likely to display substantial advancement. Practicing hand hygiene is one of the simplest, most inexpensive yet most effective ways of preventing infections and diseases. Research in healthcare proves that cleaning one's hands thoroughly can significantly reduce the spread of germs. As a result, hand hygiene is correctly termed as a 'do-it-yourself' vaccine.

Eating food with contaminated hands can result in contracting diseases such as staph, salmonella, e-coli, respiratory illnesses, and gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhea. Cleaning hands properly can significantly reduce the risk of these contagious diseases.

Global Hand Hygiene Market: Drivers and Restraints

The increasing use of soaps, hand wash, sanitizers, rubs, and disinfectants is guiding the growth of the market. The shift from conventional soap bars to liquid hand wash, growing bacterial and pathogen infections, rising number of healthcare practitioners, and healthcare associated infections are contributing towards market growth.

Preview Report @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/hand-hygiene-market.html

The U.S.-based healthcare organization, Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has introduced a campaign called 'Clean Hands Count', which empowers patients to participate in their care by reminding or asking healthcare professionals to wash their hands. The campaign addresses the various misconceptions and myths surrounding hand hygiene.

On the other hand, absence of hygiene-related training and education in several regions might slacken the growth of the market. Moreover, studies reveal that a low percentage of world population practice hand hygiene. Experts believe that the low grasp of facts about the importance of hand hygiene among people is the reason for this low percentage.

However, the persistent efforts to spread awareness about the significance of hand hygiene by several international and government bodies through campaigns and programs is expected to aid the expansion of the market.

Request PDF Sample@ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag...

The initiatives of the World Health Organization (WHO), such as 'SAVE LIVES: Clean Your Hands' campaign (2009), Clean Care is Safer Care program (2005-2015), and Infection Prevention and Control (2015-2017), that focus on the prevention of on-site infection among healthcare workers and patients will be successful in creating awareness about the importance of hand hygiene, thereby boosting the expansion of the market. In alignment with the aims of these programs, the WHO declared May 5 as the World Hand Hygiene Day

Global Hand Hygiene Market: Regional Outlook

Based on geography, the global hand hygiene market can be segmented into Asia Pacific, North America, Europe, and the Rest of the World (RoW). North America is likely to dominate the regional scenario as high awareness related to hand hygiene, training to healthcare professionals, and adherence of standard guidelines are guiding the growth of the hand hygiene market in this region.

A number of health systems and hospitals in the U.S., such as Cedars-Sinai, Froedtert Hospital, Baptist Health, and Exempla Lutheran Medical Center, have been participating in the promotion of hand hygiene by ensuring the compliance on the part of healthcare providers through education programs, hand hygiene protocols, and stringent monitoring.

Get TOC@ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag...

Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Africa furnish considerable opportunities for growth. Implementation of hand hygiene campaigns in these developing regions is a major factor promising growth, resulting from rising awareness. WASH-in-School, a program initiated by UNICEF in China, for instance, promotes the construction of drinking water fountains and toilets in schools, in addition to promotion of hand hygiene.

In India, Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL), in collaboration with Swach Bharat Abhiyaan campaign, has been encouraging every citizen to wash hands regularly, before eating and cooking and after using the toilet.

Companies Mentioned in the Report

Some of the major companies operating in the global market for hand hygiene are Whiteley Corporation, EcoHydra, Deb Group, Kimberly-Clark, Kutol, Medline Industries, Inc., and GOJO Industries. These companies provide a wide range of hand hygiene products such as sanitizers, soaps, and hand wash.

As India's development sector matures, it is increasingly getting professionalised. Leading to an increasing requirement for personnel trained and armed with the right academics, aptitude and skill set. A number of significant indicators point in this direction.

One, the organisational structure and managerial roles in non-profit organisations are getting specialised. Where talent is increasingly being sought out for roles ranging from strategy, communications, fundraising, CEOs office, managing M&E, programme leadership, CSR partnerships and COO responsibilities.

The social sector is rapidly evolving as one of the primary career destination and is moving beyond the traditional roles of volunteering or field jobs. This is a far cry from the days when organisations had more of general management roles. The narrative has become more specialised and specific to the challenges, limitations and essentials of the job description.

Second, people in the age group from 25 to 40 years are turning to the development sector for a meaningful career leading to purpose in their lives. Millennials who have just begun or are beginning their careers are opting for a career in the development sector. In the past, much of the roles in non-profits were filled up by those in the senior age of retired career brackets. That is fast changing. So much so, that talent experts suggest that recruitments in the development space are giving a run for their money to those opportunities in corporates especially the ones in the IT sector. This is, for example, borne out by the fact that ISDM (Indian School of Development Management) recently set a benchmark for placements in social sector with 90+ reputed development organizations and corporates coming to the campus to attract their first batch of 57 students. The students were offered at par or in some cases better packages than what are being offered to engineering students otherwise.

Third, with increase in funding to the social sector from newer avenues like CSR, there is a huge demand for a new generation of enthusiastic leaders and managers who can help the social sector deliver sustainable social impact at scale. The sector is offering challenges to those who are looking to build their lives working on improving the most complex social issues facing our nation. People who are passionate about these issues yet practical and innovative in providing solutions. Who can channel the available resources in the most efficient and effective manner. The sector promises a career full of substance.

The landscape of the social sector in India is widening with development organisations emerging as domestic and international NGOs, social foundations, CSR/Corporate foundations, social enterprises, social consulting organisations, funders, ecosystem creators and research organisations. Some of the leading ones in India include Central Square Foundation, Azim Premji Philanthropic Initiative, Actionaid, Samagra Development Associates, Wadhwani Foundation, Ashoka Innovators, PATH, Charities Aid Foundation etc to name a few. This has created varied opportunities for people who seek a holistic career which provides professional and personal growth along with financial stability.

Keeping the future in mind, the development sector needs leaders who can build world-class social organisations in India based on an intricate understanding of this space. It also needs a much large number of thinking and well-rounded youth to invest their time in solving some of the most challenging problems facing humanity.

Today career in social sector is no more restricted to just social science graduates. With the rise of development Management courses, surprisingly students from Science, Arts, Engineering and other backgrounds are joining the league of tomorrow's leaders and managers nurtured just for the social sector. The drive to join a meaningful and purpose driven career is leading youth to look beyond MBA and glamorous corporate sector jobs. Social sector career has moved from charity to rewards. Also a growing number of successful social entrepreneurs and impact investing is now challenging the conventional belief and method of making a career in the development space. Impact investors are investing heavily in workforce development and technology to transform social enterprises and ideas into established organizations for a larger impact.

But despite the positivism around the sector, all is not hunky dory. In a number of non-profits in India and overseas, there have been challenges of governance, ethics and leadership. Further, in many countries across the world, social sector organisations have come under the scrutiny and pressure of the respective governments. So, while the younger millennials turn to the non-profit sector where the basics of management can be imparted to them, leadership training at the senior levels are also the need of the hour.

So, while increasing numbers of professionals opt for a career in non-profits that brings more meaning and purpose to their lives, they also have to understand that it will not be a bed of roses. Only those who have the will to dive in deep and keep kicking their way ahead can be successful."

(iStock / Representative Image)

Eight-year-old Zoya Khan, weighing 39 kg, on Friday underwent a revision bariatric surgery, said the doctors from the Mumbai-based Surana Group of Hospitals, terming her ""the youngest in the world to undergo this operation"". The surgery, used to treat obesity, involved restricting the part of the stomach that gives rise to hunger.

The doctors that treated her believe that the surgery will result in a weight loss of 5-6kg within a span of 15-20 days. ""It was a one-of-its-kind case and we will publish the report in an international medical journal. We will also provide the patient lifelong treatment free of cost,"" said Dr Prince Surana, chief executive officer (CEO), Surana Group of Hospitals.

Zoya weighed 19 kg at 11 months. At the time, she had undergone a bariatric surgery.

According to her mother, Taj khatun, Zoya lost 3 kg two months after the surgery. However, she had to recently undergo a revision surgery after failing to control her weight.

Taj khatun said that as Zoya was growing up, she started consuming food once every half hour. ""By the time she was six, she already weighed 20-25kg. From that year onwards, her weight started to increase rapidly. She was unable to move or sleep and suffered from other health complications, so we admitted her to Nair Hospital,"" said Taj khatun.

Taj khatun explained how Zoya's obesity interfered with her schooling.

""Because Zoya had difficulty moving, no school was ready to admit her. Her father [Yusuf] used to carry her to her tuition classes for her primary education,"" she said.

Zoya was shifted from Nair hospital at the behest of Surana.

""I approached Samajwadi Party leader Rais Shaikh, who has knew social workers at Nair Hospital. Through him, we asked the treating doctors if Zoya could be transferred to our facility,"" said Surana.

Dr Mohit Bhandari, head of bariatric surgery, who headed the team, said that at the time of admission, Zoya's body mass index (BMI) was 35 and she consumed 2,600 calories a day - six times that of an average eight-year-old. ""She had severe sleep apnea, pulmonary hypertension [high blood pressure that affects arteries in the lungs and heart] and fatty liver. We performed a CT scan and endoscopy to realise that her stomach had dilated to the size of an adult stomach,"" said Dr Bhandari.

The team of doctors ruled out the option to conduct a gastric bypass surgery, which involves changing the size of the stomach to reduce food intake. They said it could have led to micro-nutrient deficiency.

""Since medication for weight loss is not approved by the food and drug administration (FDA) in paediatrics, we had no option but to perform a banded sleeve gastrectomy. The surgery restricted the part of the stomach that gives rise to hunger,"" said Dr Bhandari.

The team has also roped in a nutrition expert who will consult Zoya on her dietary intake following the surgery."

"498","1020169668","2018-12-17","https://swarajyamag.com/politics/how-raman-singh-became-chawal-waale-baba-for-chhattisgarh","How Raman Singh Became 'Chawal Waale Baba' For Chhattisgarh","swarajyamag.com",FALSE,"With his share of successes and controversies and lost time, Dr Raman Singh needs to be given the due credit he deserves.

""What is the name of the Chief Minister"", I asked a group of tribal women in Mahasamund. It was my first field trip to Chhattisgarh and I was a rookie with one year of experience in the development sector. With all the scepticism that new idealists could gather, I felt that women not knowing the name of the Chief Minister of the state would reflect on their agency, and hence would give me a starting point to discuss decentralised governance with them!

""I do not know his name, but 'chawal waale baba' is what we call him"". Mahasamund has always been a Congress dominated belt and the response came as a shock to me. For the next couple of hours, I went on to talk of a lot of things, but what dominated the discussion was how the women in the village zealously monitor the fair price shops and how this 'chawal waale baba' is doing some good work for them.

Few days back, Dr Raman Singh was about to face a defeat in his constituency of Rajnandgaon from which he has been contesting elections since the early 90s. He somehow managed to scrape through but the government and his party could not be saved. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been reduced to 15 seats in the state and has lost out across all demographies and geographies in the state. But, 15 years is not a small time and Dr Raman Singh has presided over the most significant period of change in the state. So what is his legacy and what is the way ahead for him, politically?

Before the arrival of the Gujarat success story by the fag end of 2014, Chhattisgarh was the state where the issue of development was front and centre in electoral terms. It was a state carved out of Madhya Pradesh to help the tribal and the Scheduled Caste communities and hence, the articulation of development here was also very different. Development in Chhattisgarh in the way Raman Singh articulated meant a turnaround in fortunes and not just a facelift.

As one of the states with the largest tribal population, abject poverty and violent Left wing extremism, Chhattisgarh needed that narrative of transition and Raman Singh was the one who provided it. And this was not the development of mega industries and four-lane highways and metros criss-crossing cities. This was the development of getting people adequate food to eat and putting the first generation of learners in schools and bringing the first pucca roads to a village. It was development from scratch.

If we look at the Chhattisgarh story since the past 15 years, there are two aspects of governance which would stand out as the legacy of Dr Raman Singh.

Social Development Legacy

The biggest success story in Chhattisgarh under Dr Singh was the efficiency of the public distribution system (PDS). Chhattisgarh took an unabashed Left route in approaching food security and increased the PDS coverage to 74 per cent. Moreover, when other states were experiencing major issues of pilferage and looting, the Chhattisgarh government undertook a slew of reforms to address the situation.

The first concern that Raman Singh identified after taking office was that more than 50 per cent of the below poverty line (BPL) population, were unable to access the food grains meant for them. The first reform he brought in was taking away the ownership of PDS shops from private businessmen and handing over control to the local community.

Then came other measures like issuing new ration cards with holograms which weeded out over 3 lakh fake beneficiaries, increased commission and even a seed fund to shop operators for making the business viable, increased monitoring and vigilance including community audits, doorstep delivery of food grains and raids and massive crackdown of corrupt rice millers. Raman Singh without any doubt made PDS the key to his re-election in 2008 and there was no other issue which worked, except 'chawal'.

The victory of 2008 was on the back of the almost transformational change in the supply chain of the PDS and sealed the tag of 'chawal waale baba'. The Chhattisgarh success story was so convincing that even some stalwarts in Sonia Gandhi-led National Advisory Council (NAC) had to use it as a template.

The success of PDS in Chhattisgarh had an expected ripple effect on the nutritional levels in the state. Food scarcity in tribal belts leads to malnutrition and stunting, and Chhattisgarh managed to address this issue thoroughly. The National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 4 data shows that the percentage of adult women with body mass index (BMI) less than normal has decreased from 43.4 per cent in 2005-06 to 26.7 in 2015-16. It is less than the figures for MP and Jharkhand and almost the same as Odisha, even though it recorded a higher incidence level than all three states in 2005-06.

Another important change has been the decrease in instances of anaemia in infants which has reduced from 71.2 per cent in 2005-06 to 41.6 per cent in 2015-16. It has now reached below the national average, while the states of MP, Jharkhand and Odisha still register more instances of infant anaemia. The final indicator which directly speaks about malnutrition is the incidences of stunting.

The following figure provides an idea of how Chhattisgarh has progressed on addressing stunting and underweight issues in children. The only state which has fared better than Chhattisgarh is Odisha but it also needs to be seen that Chhattisgarh had a much higher base in 2005-06.

This is no minor feat. With the PDS covering basic food-grains in villages, schools and anganwadi centres, the savings of the poor could be used to widen the basket of nutritious food, thus effectively tackling malnutrition. The single minded focus of Raman Singh on one issue paid off both socially and politically for him.

If Vasundhara Raje has been the most economic right wing chief minister from the BJP, Raman Singh has undoubtedly been the most towards the Left. He is known for a slew of populist welfare schemes in the state. His focus on health and nutrition extended to his CM Health Scheme whereby Rs 30,000 worth of free treatment was provided to citizens. Other welfare schemes ranged from the Saraswati Cycle Yojana for school girls to the Mukhyamantri Teerth Yatra Yojana for elderly citizens.

Combating Left Wing Extremism In The State

Since the day the new state of Chhattisgarh was born, the single biggest problem impeding the development initiatives was the 'red terrorism' plaguing multiple districts of the state.

Raman Singh has been at the centre of a lot of controversy when it comes to combating Left wing extremism and his government has been accused of custodial violence against tribals, harassment of activists like Binayak Sen and most importantly tacit support given to the Salwa Judum. Raman Singh in the past has openly defended the Salwa Judum as being the primary resistance force against the Maoists.

In 2009, just two years before the Salwa Judum was disbanded by the Supreme Court, Dr Singh had credited the members of the vigilante group as being the custodians of the republic. The formation of the Salwa Judum led to one of the bloodiest phases in the state and the tribal communities were divided and displaced like never before. It is a cross that both the Congress and the BJP have to bear. But, as the CM for 15 long years, it can never be dissociated from the legacy of Raman Singh.

While Chhattisgarh continues to be the state, most affected by Maoist violence, through the course of the past 15 years, the Raman Singh government had many big and small successes in addressing the alienation of the tribal communities and ushering in peace. From the construction of state highways to schemes like allowances for pregnant and lactating mothers, a mix of infrastructural and welfare measures had been implemented in tribal areas along with numerous awareness and sensitisation campaigns.

While the districts of Sarguja and Jashpur have now been removed from the list of Maoist affected districts, the most significant transformation has been seen in the district of Bastar. The Dandakaranya belt is the hotbed of Maoist activity in the country and has been the scene of the most dastardly acts of violence against the state. Carrying out development activities in this area and then seeing tangible returns of inclusion is no mean feat.

It is a three-pronged strategy where the security forces and the civic administration work in tandem to ensure that relative peace facilitates rapid infrastructural development and the cycle continues without further incidents. The third prong is ensuring that key entitlements to the local communities and their rights under PESA are respected. This has been a strategy that the Chhattisgarh government under Dr Singh has made moderate success in.

One of the most significant changes in the Maoist areas of the state has been the rapid construction of roads. These roads have not only ended the alienation of remote villages but have pushed the Maoists further into the jungles. Conversely, it has also been the cause behind much of the attacks in the state since 2014.

The two stretches which have seen the most attacks are the Dornapal-Jagargunda stretch and the Injeram-Bhejji stretch which are incidentally the two critical road construction stretches. Bastar, today, is being dotted with educational institutions and health care centres. There are three districts in the region which still can be counted as war zones and the Maoist threat is far from over. But, change has happened right under the barrel of the gun and for that Dr Raman Singh deserves a lot of credit.

My first trip to Mahasamund for a study was in 2013. The last one was in 2017 when I travelled to Ambikapur, Sarguja, another Congress belt. This time I was not working with women but with adolescent girls. Their concerns were different. They needed English classes and computer skills, and well-paying jobs. Some of them told me that the 'sattu' provided by the government under the SABLA scheme is used for feeding cattle, a far cry from conversations of adequate nutrition. Survival and chawal was not the topic of discussion. Aspiration and jobs were.

I again asked them about the CM. All of them knew his name, Dr Raman Singh. For the new generation with new hopes, he was not 'chawal waale baba' anymore. He was just another politician who needed to deliver on new demands. That, perhaps, sums up why the development agenda of Raman Singh did not work. There is a new generation holding the keys to power now and the old guard could not keep up with their aspirations.

While the legacy of Dr Raman Singh has been development, it has mostly been around subsistence. Food security, access to health, even footwear for tired feet! It is perhaps what the need was that point but subsistence will never be enough. With his share of successes and controversies and lost time, Dr Singh needs to be given the due credit he deserves.

It is to his credit to have governed one of the most difficult, conflict ridden states in India and gradually relieve parts of it from the backward status it had been stamped with. While a large number of districts in Chhattisgarh continue to be aspirational while the rest of the country surges forward, it is to his credit that the dreams of Naya Raipur and Naya Bastar have not been pushed to the background.

And importantly, his PDS success story has been the one which exhibits what true political will can achieve even in the face of immense odds. This could very well have been the end of his stint as the CM of the state, but the road from Raipur via Bastar may just lead to New Delhi."

Seven others have passed middle school (8th ) while 13 MLAs are matriculates or 10th pass. Among the new MLAs 37 of the 230 have a qualification of secondary school pass outs .

The figures surfaced in the analysis of the affidavits done by the non-government organisation, Association for Democratic Reforms, which works for electoral reforms.

""I am elected for the second time in the assembly. I do not face any inconvenience due to my lack of education in doing public work,"" says BJP MLA from Niwari constituency Anil Jain. Jain is also among the five newly elected MLAs who have claimed that they are just literate in their affidavits.

""I have been a sarpanch for 20 years and have been Mandi president for 5 years and with all the experience and co-operation of everyone I do not face any inconvenience due to my lack of education,"" says Congress MLA from Pohari Sanjay Dhakad, who has said that he is just a literate in the affidavit submitted before EC.

""For doing good work you need experience and it is more important than having formal education,"" says BJP MLA Prem Singh. It is noteworthy that Prem Singh is four times MLA and his highest qualification is primary pass.

As per the ADR data, three among the just literate MLAs (less than class 5) namely Prem Singh, Anil Jain, Gopilal Jatav are from BJP and Suresh Dhakad is from Congress party and Rambai Govind Singh is from BSP. Four of these five just literate MLAs are already crorepatis -- Prem Singh with assets worth Rs 5 crore is the richest among these five and Rambai Govind Singh is poorest and only non-crorepati with a total asset worth is Rs 96 lakh.

Of the other seven MLAs, whose educational qualification is just class 5th pass, six are from the Congress and one is from the BJP. All the seven MLAs who are fifth class pass are crorepatis.

And in the other seven MLAs who are middle school pass outs, five are from Congress and remaining two are of BJP. Three of these MLAs are also crorepatis.

Besides these MLAs a total of 56 MLAs are graduates and equal number of MLAs are also post-graduates. And a total of 40 MLAs are graduate professionals.

Only three out of the 230 MLAs hold doctorate degrees including Narottam Mishra MLA from Datia, Arvind Singh Bhadoria MLA from Ater and Mohan Yadav MLA from Ujjain South. All three are of BJP."

The market dynamic forces have been determined after conducting a detailed study of the Global Recycled Metal Market.

Europe recycled metal market share is projected witness gains of more than 4% during the forecast timeframe. This is primarily due to stringent laws and legislations imposed by environmental regulatory bodies in Europe, which has triggered metal recycling to reduce the carbon footprint and help save the environment from hazardous waste generated. For instance, Directive 2008/98/EC imposed by European Commission defines basic concepts related to waste management.

According to a new research report by Global Market Insights, Inc. Recycled Metal Market size is forecast to exceed USD 125 billion by 2024

Industry Growth drivers are

* Rapidly growing construction industry in the Asia Pacific and the Middle East

* Strong product demand from electrical & electronics industry in North America

* Stringent & supporting legislations for metal recycling in Europe

It signifies terms and conditions related to waste, recycling and recovery. Moreover, Directive 2012/19/EU prevent the generation of electrical & electronic waste and to promote reuse, recycling and other forms of recovery to reduce the quantity of waste to be eliminated, whilst also improving the environmental performance. These trends are likely to make significant impact on the reprocessed metal market size by 2024.

Recycled non ferrous metal market size was valued more than USD 90 billion in 2017. Non ferrous metals such as aluminum, copper, lead, precious metals and other metals such as nickel, zinc, tin, palladium, etc. These metals find wide-ranging applications across construction, electrical & electronics, transport, consumer goods, industrial machinery, nuclear, military and several other end-user industry. For instance, lead is widely used electronics in batteries, ammunition, cable sheathing, etc.

Lead batteries are used in transport industry and constituted approximately 35% of the total industry share in terms of volume in 2017. These trends will help boost the global recycled metal market share by 2024.

In terms of volume, recycled metal market share for building & construction constituted close to 45% of the total business share in 2017. It is mainly due to comprehensive recycled metal applications in the building & construction industry. For example, ferrous metals (iron and steel) are broadly used in the construction of large steel frameworks in the building, bridges, drainage components and various other architectural frameworks.

Furthermore, non ferrous metals including aluminum, copper and lead are also utilized in the building & construction sector. Lead sheets are used for roofing, cladding of vertical walls, soundproofing in partitions and ceilings in office, school and hotel buildings. These trends will help make considerable contribution to reprocessed metal market size by 2024.

North America electrical & electronics industry is on the rise which is due to consistently changing consumer's preferences and continuous technology upgradation. For instance, the electrical & electronics industry was valued more than USD 900 billion in 2016 and accounted for a total of 21% of the global electrical & electronics industry. These trends will drive reprocessed metal demand owing to its wide spread applications in metal plating electronics via electrodeposition. It provides improved corrosion resistance, enhanced electrical conductivity and improved solderability which helps in protecting against wear.

Furthermore, precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum, rhodium, etc. are also widely applicable in the electronics industry owing to its unique physical and chemical properties which provides reliability to the electronics sector. It will help attain significant gains to the global recycled metal market share by 2024.

Ineffective metal reprocessing is a key constraint which is probable to impede the global reprocessed metal market size by 2024. For instance, only 40% of the total copper produced is attained from recycling and 33% of the total aluminum produced is attained from recycling process. Nevertheless, rising emphasis on metal processing and reusability to reduce carbon footprint and impact of hazardous waste will generate plentiful opportunities for the reprocessed metal market size by 2024.

Key reprocessed metal market players are Sims Metal Management, Steel Dynamics, European Metal Recycling, Nucor Corporation, ELG HanielGmbh, Schnitzer Steel and Novelis. The market players are expanding their capacity to process metal to attain profitability in the market. For example, Novelis announced to build flat-rolled aluminum plant in January 2018 in Kentucky U.S. for USD 300 million.

"503","1020093888","2018-12-17","https://yourstory.com/2018/12/top-5-monday-motivation/","5 Monday Motivation stories that our readers loved in 2018","YourStory.com",FALSE,"From a dhaba that works as an employment exchange to a student tapping the peer teaching model, a re-look at the Monday Motivation series that encouraged and inspired us this year.

Difficult roads, they say, often lead to beautiful destinations. There may be multiple challenges, but one thing binds India's change-makers together - they view problems as means for innovation. From tackling unemployment to becoming financially independent and providing livelihoods to others at a time of personal tragedy, YourStory brings you stories of social impact through the Monday Motivation series.

As we draw closer towards the end of 2018, here are some of our top picks from the year.

Recognising the vulnerabilities of migrants who move from rural areas to urban India, Vinod Pandey started a ""tea stall"" with a difference - Rozgar Dhaba, at Shehore district's Nashrullaganj block in Madhya Pradesh. The dhaba not only sells tea and refreshments, but acts as a centre for the exchange of information on livelihood and employment opportunities.

""I am from Bihar and have seen how people from Bihar migrate to different cities in search of jobs, especially for daily wage labour. An elder cousin migrated to Punjab and died because he did not get proper work in the city; he lived in slums, without proper healthcare. The city failed him,"" Vinod says.

Started in January 2018, Rozgar Dhaba caters to over a 1,000 people a month and has hosted over 20 job fairs, and five farm produce sale displays till date. It has over 70 registered entities such as government agencies, skill centres, NGOs, district agriculture centres, grameen centres, and small local businesses that provide regular job information. The dhaba itself provides employment to almost 10 people and has revenue of Rs 8,000 to Rs 12,000.

At a time when rote learning and academic-based examination continue to dominate the Indian school system, a 21-year-old student from IIT-Madras is on a mission to change the way knowledge is imparted. Using the peer teaching model, which has Harvard University's stamp of approval, Divanshu Kumar hopes to improve the learning ability of students through his startup, Involve.

""Most of the world believes that we can improve the quality of learning and have better results by putting more qualified teachers in the classrooms. And while this is true, it fails to address one very important need: capability building of students,"" he says.

Involve's peer teaching method involves a nine-month fellowship where students from higher grades, like from Class 8, can teach and mentor juniors. By getting students who can teach and learners together in a classroom, Involve aims to create a school ecosystem that defines a student's potential not merely in terms of examinations, but through overall academic and personal excellence.

Till date, the team has worked with over 400 students across four schools in Chennai and Bengaluru. These include more than 100 student leaders.

To introduce food processing techniques and create links in the agri-business model, Balaji Balaraman, 35, started Agribolo. The startup aims to create a market linkage opportunity that can become a farm-to-fork, farm-to-mill, and farm-to-warehouse model for farmers and the ecosystem at large.

""The primary necessities include creating multiple pre-processing or primary centres at the farm or village level. That will provide a basic value addition to farmers and an opportunity to develop a cluster-based model,"" Balaji says.

The farmer engagement platform allows an individual to get an umbrella of services under one roof at his location and according to the season, relevance, demand, supply, and in a timely and efficient manner. Agribolo engages and connects farmers with experts, NGOs, and development institutes for training, capacity building, and outreach programmes.

The startup offers a platform to aggregate services in the form of farm mechanisation, plant nursery, protected cultivation, seed production, input demonstration, collateral management, financial inclusion, and local processing that could be co-owned and operated by the community at large.

The farmer is also provided an opportunity to partner with a business solution - available on the platform - that empowers him towards rural employment and social empowerment.

Josephine Arokiya Mary, a National Award winner for apiculture, started her journey with 10 bee boxes. She now has 7,000 bee boxes, and has helped create more than 1,800 entrepreneurs in her district.

In 2010, a year after her daughter's death, Mary took a loan of Rs 10 lakh from Canara Bank to start Vibis Natural Bee Farming with 1,000 bee boxes. Targeting diabetic patients, she accumulated and harvested jamun honey, which gave her good revenues; soon, Mary started harvesting honey from more than 10 varieties of bees. Apart from selling honey, she diversified her business by selling bee wax candles and the pollen bees carry on their legs.

Mary is now known as Queen Bee in her village and sells honey to 23 districts in Tamil Nadu. She offers 25 varieties of honey with flavours like jamun, neem, and amla among others, through her enterprise. She now earns more than Rs 1 lakh per month, and her venture has an annual turnover of Rs 3 crore.

Besides providing employment to over 50 people and helping over 400 women set up honey bee farms, she is training more than 50,000 people in bee harvesting under the National Honey Mission and creating awareness to save bees from going extinct.

Prem Singh's lush green farmland paints a vivid picture of sustainable farming: organic produce and homegrown compost, fruit-bearing trees, livestock shelter with water bodies, well-nourished soil, natural fertilisers, and, most importantly, a continuous source of income.

""I too was captured in the cycle of debt and crop failure; we couldn't control climatic conditions and bank loans kept increasing. And then I started thinking about our ancestors, our traditional farming methods, and knew that this was the key to success. Today, I am debt-free. I am a pragatisheel kisaan,"" he says proudly.

Advocating Avartansheel Kheti, or periodic proportionate farming, Prem Singh believes that farming has to be a self-sustaining occupation for the farmer. The practice encourages a farmer to divide his land into three parts: one-third to be used as a garden to grow fruits and crops, the second part for rearing livestock, and the third to grow timber. His approach advocates crop rotation, organic farming, animal husbandry, food processing, improving soil fertility, and seed development.

This farming method is currently followed by 28 percent farmers in his district and also has followers from the agrarian community of Belgium and France."

""As many as 16.7 per cent of primary, middle and high school students surveyed suffered difficulties that could lead to anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, conduct disorders, depression, etc. In this survey, 12 to 15 per cent high school students were found suffering from emotional and social skill issues, while eight to 10 per cent primary school kids suffered conduct and hyperactivity issues,"" said Dr Anand Lakshman, founder of AddressHealth.

Government and private schools following CBSE, ICSE and Karnataka state syllabus were part of this exercise. Teachers and parents filled out questionnaires about students' behaviour.

""Conduct issues such as bullying, not listening to the teacher, aloofness, were factors noticed more by teachers than parents. This is a screening tool and not a diagnostic one. It helped us identify who is more prone to risk. For instance, contemplation of suicide among adolescents warrants seeking treatment, which we provided later through group therapy,"" Lakshman added.

The causes included imbalance of neurochemicals in the brain, social and environmental stressors such as pressure to perform, hyper-competitive nature, overexposure to information on the internet (for example, blue whale challenge being seen as a solution to solve one's problems), nutritional aspects such as high sugar content in food eaten by hyperactive kids, need for instant gratification in terms of likes and approval on social media, etc.

""Most issues stem from childhood. It is a known fact that only 12 to 15 per cent adults seek help. Most do not take treatment due to stigma, so adults pass on their anxieties and stressors to their kids. Depression is used as a bad word. The brain is more susceptible to change when the child is young,"" a public health expert said, further adding, ""Late treatment cannot modify the way the brain works, but can only offer coping strategies to adults. We need to accept our children are at risk and intervene early."""

We were first introduced to Utarit, who's represented by the gallery Richard Koh Fine Art in Kuala Lumpur, at the India Art Fair held in January, in New Delhi, earlier this year.

At the time, Utarit had just released his hugely influential collection, Optimism is Ridiculous: The Altarpieces, following up with a more elaborate presentation extending the prevailing theme, Optimism is Ridiculous: Paintings on Figure of Speech, Paradoxes and Inward Journey in April. Even as Utarit is being hailed in art circles around the globe, his ideas are resolutely subversive and decidedly post 9/11 in context.

Concerns over the commodification of religion and the commercialisation of art fuel his works, as do matters of colonialism and imperialism and the constant interplay between European and Asian ideologies and their evident disintegration in this technology-driven age. However, on a personal level, he remains an avowed Buddhist.In an interaction, Utarit spoke about his formative ideas and warming up to concepts of globalised acculturation.

Q: The idea, 'Optimism is Ridiculous': How did you arrive at this assertion?

'Optimism is ridiculous' reflects affairs of the present day, especially those happening in my country. I like the sentence: Optimism is ridiculous. Sarcastic as it may sound, the sentence quite obviously evinces attitudes towards what happened. I myself don't have a problem with optimism. But then again, an optimistic or one-sided viewpoint can cause you far more problems than just being ridiculous.

Certainly, it concerns not only the relationship between one's self and one's perception of the outer world but also the relationship between one's self and one's perception of the inner world. As for my work, the sentence embraces my attitudes towards obscurities in social, cultural and religious beliefs that stem from changes since the post-colonial period.

My country succeeded in avoiding Western colonisation de jure, but in practice, it seems to have greatly influenced our social and cultural perspectives. My current set of paintings echo such matters via figures of speech, paradoxes and comparison, and an inward-looking way, according to beliefs of Buddhism.

Q: How do you channelise strong emotions into art?

I'm enthused by negative and gloomy feelings from news and public incidents, as well as people's emotions on Facebook. Subjects of art once used to be about beauty only. But once art expands to include other possibilities, there is a wider space for other emotions, including rage, aggression, and depression -- all consequences of the era. Things happen without warnings. It's like the elementary school shootings in the US.

Art's mission is to perceive what becomes of the world and present it via a creator's attitude. Contemporary art has raised issues, encouraging audiences to think and look back at more individualistic questions. Art exists for human ideas and spirits to gain an insightful perception of the world."

""The DDA committed to the Delhi high court to give 4,000 sq metre of land to the Directorate of Education for constructing a school. However, the size of the school has now been reduced to 1,600 sq metre, along with the number of classes that would be taught,"" Sisodia said. ""The decision was taken on the direction of the Lieutenant Governor in a meeting held by Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash a month after the high court order, without taking the Delhi government in confidence,"" he claimed.

Sisodia was referring to the Qaumi Senior Secondary School operating inside an Eidgah at Quresh Nagar in central Delhi, with around 800 students at present. The Central Board of Secondary Examination-affiliated school was then shifted to a DDA Colony, but it neither got land, nor a building. Four-decades later, the school runs classes out of an Eidgah in two shifts due to a space constraint, with primary classes held in the morning while the rest are held in the evening.

Thirteen 'classrooms', with tin, shed roofs and makeshift walls are built in an L-shape at the corner of the Eidgah's premises. A ceiling fan, a blackboard on a stand and rusted iron benches comprise each 'classroom'. School principal Mohabbat Ali was hopeful that a plot will be allotted in the next three months after completion of all formalities of the court order.

The row was sparked by a student sharing a chicken sandwich with some of his classmates, who happened to be vegetarians, during the tiffin break. Others in the class then roughed up this student, who claimed he did not know that his classmates were vegetarian, and parents got involved. The school authorities had to issue a notice asking students not to share non-vegetarian food in class.

This school may have somehow managed to resolve this incident peacefully but school authorities across the city acknowledge that they have a problem on their hand. The debate on the contents of the tiffin box may have followed the wider vegetariannon-vegetarian social and political debate, say leading schools, forcing many to frame guidelines on food.

Some schools have explicitly asked students to avoid bringing non-vegetarian food to class, but others have preferred to avoid a stricture, choosing instead to prohibit consumption of meat, fish and eggs only within classrooms; yet others have asked students to declare the contents of their tiffin box before sharing it with classmates.

A leading English-medium girls' school near Park Circus, for example, has given out a list of suggested food items that students of junior classes can bring to campus. This list does not have any non-vegetarian item though the school has insisted to parents that it ""is not forcing anything on students but merely suggesting something"". Students and parents, however, say carrying non-vegetarian food to school often evokes snide remarks and even bullying. That this problem has not had a resolution is clear from the school's request to stay ""off record while it tries to bring out a solution"".

Don Bosco (Park Circus), too, does not allow non-vegetarian food till Class II. ""Students of other classes are told to not share their food if it is not vegetarian. Students from Class VI onward can buy food from the canteen,"" principal Father Bikash Mondal said.

Food packets distributed by the school, during school events or celebrations, are strictly vegetarian, which is the practice followed by an overwhelming majority of other city schools. Rammohan Mission School, too, ""does not bar non-veg stuff but sticks to vegetarian food for school programmes"", says principal Sujoy Biswas.

Tiffin Row

Parents tense despite advisory

One of the city's oldest Catholic girls' schools in central Kolkata encourages students to have non-veg food at the canteen rather than bring it from home. Girls are not barred from having non-vegetarian food on campus, but the school makes it clear that it would rather students avoid them in classrooms. ""This preempts confusion and conflict,"" a senior member of the management said.

Another new-age school off EM Bypass-Rashbehari Connector has asked students to disclose the nature of the food they share with classmates. A parent says it has worked out well. Another school of the same group has asked parents to put stickers on tiffin boxes if they contain non-vegetarian food; it has also asked students bringing non-vegetarian food ""to move away from vegetarians"" before opening their lunch boxes.

But some parents of the school where the sandwichsharing controversy happened continue to remain tense despite the school issuing a similar advisory. ""Senior students, too, have fought over non-veg food recently. I now make sure that my son doesn't carry non-vegetarian stuff to school,"" the parent of a Class IX student said.

Modern High School for Girls director Devi Kar believes supervision is necessary to preempt such controversies. ""We closely monitor primary section students' food. There is no bar on nonvegetarian food but our canteen is vegetarian,"" she added.

There are some others, like The Heritage School, which forbid non-veg food on campus, ""but not because of any recent controversy"". ""We are a vegetarian school. We have a dietician and it is mandatory for students to have food from canteen. Around 700 children have breakfast and lunch along with teachers and no one is allowed to carry food from home,"" principal Seema Sapru said."

To tackle the taboo around menstruating, teachers have been advised similarly by Brighton Council to teach young children. However, the new rules have received harsh criticism for trying to confuse young children.

The teacher guidance, from Brighton & Hove City Council, states: 'Trans boys and men and non-binary people may have periods' and 'menstruation must be inclusive of all genders'. It says that ""bins for used period products are provided in all toilets"" for children. Also, trans pupils and students should be provided with additional support from a school nurse if required.

The emergence comes after it was reported that a state secondary in Brighton has 40 pupils who 'do not identify as gender presented at birth'. Daily Mail quoted Tory MP David Davies as saying that explaining the concept of transgender boys having periods to eight-year-olds would be 'insanity' for teachers. He said, ""Learning about periods is already a difficult subject for children that age, so to throw in the idea girls who believe they are boys also have periods will leave them completely confused.""

Stephanie Davies-Arai, from the campaign group Transgender Trend, said, ""Girls going through puberty are already having a difficult time. What they should be given is clear language to be able to talk about their bodies and their female biological functions without couching it in politically correct terms."" Campaigner Julie Bindel said, ""To tell impressionable children that boys can also menstruate sidelines girls who should be getting support when they start their periods.""

The report quoted Brighton & Hove City Council as saying, ""By encouraging effective education on menstruation and puberty, we hope to reduce stigma and ensure no child or young person feels shame in asking for period products inside or outside of school if they need them. We believe that it's important for all genders to be able to learn and talk about menstruation together... Our approach recognises the fact that some people who have periods are trans or non-binary."""

Former President Pranab Mukherjee Saturday lamented that the country does not have proper environment in its institutional system and called for the development of both infrastructure and quality of education. Mukherjee mentioned three graduates, who had been products of Indian universities but got the coveted prize while working abroad.

""After 1930 no Indian working in basic research in Indian University got Noble prize. Sir C V Raman was the first and the last (Nobel winner).

Stressing on the importance of research, innovation and total development of the faculty of the students, he said many a prominent personality, including Swami Vivekananda and Sarvapali Radhakrishnan, repeatedly pointed out that education is not just collection of information. ""That type of information is of no use. It must assimilate and along with assimilation it must build up the inherent strength of the learner, the student,"" the former President said.

Touching upon the GDP growth, Mukherjee said how India had less than one per cent of growth in the first half of the last century and reaching 7.1 per cent in 2015-16. He said important economies by and large agree that 8 per cent to 10 per cent GDP growth for one-and-a-half decades at least is needed to address the basic problem of hunger, poverty and disease. ""Therefore, it is utmost important that we must have not only educational institutions but also quality education,"" Mukherjee added.

Saying how former Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao initiated and encouraged liberalization in 1991-92 and another former Prime Minister and the then Finance Minister Manmohan Singh implemented it, Mukherjee said India has to continue its march forward and has to sustain the growth rate."
