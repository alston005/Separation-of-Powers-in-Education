Every year, authorities here announce the closure of schools with the onset of winter in the first week of December.

Closure of schools during winters becomes inevitable here given the very low temperatures and poor infrastructure of our schools which hinders the continuity of academic activities because these institutions San any kind of heating arrangements. Had been our schools equipped with proper heating arrangements, the long winter breaks could have been avoided.

That is not the case here. It will take us hundreds of years to develop our institutions on those lines. If authorities are really sincere enough to elevate our educational standards then such steps and measures should be kept in pipeline for coming future.

Traditionally, Kashmiri parents would arrange tutors for their children to overcome the academic deficit of winters. Some two decades back, winter tuition was preferably carried out in the homes of teachers or qualified unemployed youth. But, now, the concept of private coaching centers has revolutionized the concept of winter tutioning.

This coaching has become a big industry in our valley. I won't talk here about the role and contribution of these coaching centers but I would definitely talk about low access of poor children to these centres. Authorities had probably recognized the fact, and winter tutorials were made operational at selective schools, particularly during the last winter. The move of authorities was hailed by one and all particularly by the parents of the poor children.

Government schoolTeachers were deputed to teach at these centres which had been instrumental in the academic prosperity of the student community. Last year, I was part of such a winter tutorial where many hundred students of our own village and the children of adjacent of villages were taken care off.It had minimized the academic deficit of winters in our schools.

This winter, all the parents and children were waiting for such centres to be made operational. Many parents were in close touch with me for the winter tutioning of their wards. Even I too was anticipating an order in this regard but, alas ! Authorities have either linked the future of our children with unemployment or with the additional remuneration of teachers deputed at these centres. Bizzare and tragic ! The incumbent authorities should have appreciated and acknowledged the teachers deputed at these centres. Remuneration should have been increased.Even Authorities could have made it mandatory for teachers to work in these centres.

No, the case is not so. Teachers have been removed from the assignment. The children of lesser God are waiting for a compassionate direction from authorities but their wish will remain a wish only. Authorities have off late decided to run a few coaching centers in some higher secondary schools but to the utter resentment and surprise of parents, these centres are yet to be made operational. One-third part of the vacations is over. There is no clue of the people who are supposed to teach in these centres. The proposed centre at higher secondary school Naidkhai is just a kilometre away from my residence, and believe me, there is no one to teach the children.Many children from my own neighborhood are repeatedly asking me if the said centre will be made functional or not.

I can't reply them with authority. I wonder if authorities are really sincere enough to elevate our educational standards. I pity the plight of these children who are unconsciously wasting their precious time, playing with glass pebbles or marbles in the streets and alleys of villages.These children are supposed to assume the chairs of teachers, engineers and doctor of our nation. Who is jeopardizing the future of these children and the collective future of our society? Let people open their eyes.

Let people at the helm of affairs revisit their plans and policies. Don't link the education of children with unemployment or money. Let parents know that teachers are hapless to impart the education to their children.

After vacations, the teachers are blamed for all the mess in the department.When children remain out of touch with their books, how can they do well after the reopening of the schools in the March. Children are roaming like sheep and there is no one to take care of them. I don't want monetary benefits for everything. Let authorities force teachers to teach at these centres. I will be the first to volunteer myself for the cause. I hope most of the teachers of our department will turn up as volunteers but at least issue a simple order. Let you bell the cat and I guarantee people that our teachers will not give you any opportunity of complaint. I request parents and the respectable citizens of our society to stop blaming teachers alone. Let people at the helm be made accountable. Intellectuals and respected citizens of our nation must come forward for the rescue of our innocent children. Teachers are ready to face any kind of challenge lest you should test their potential.We are not lazy and shirkers but we lack a proper platform."

This article is part of Inc42's special year-end series -- 2018 In Review -- in which we will refresh your memory on the major developments in the Indian startup ecosystem and their impact on various stakeholders -- from entrepreneurs to investors. Find more stories from this series here.

""The value of an idea lies in the using of it."" -- Thomas Edison

The cup of ideas runneth over in the Indian startup ecosystem. A good idea is the genesis for any successful startup, but sometimes just having a good idea is not enough.

According to the findings of a survey by the Institute for Business Value and Oxford Economics, 90% of India's startups fail within the first five years. It added that the lack of pioneering innovation is the major reason for the failure of Indian startups -- in essence, they are copycats of startup ideas of the West, the study said.

Turns out, almost half of the Indian startups are actually not needed at all.

It is the absence of scalable ideas that makes 9 out of 10 Indian startups sink like lead balloons, despite the best intentions of founders and investors. The lack of originality is clear from this caveat -- Despite being the third largest startup ecosystem after US and China, the number of international patents India has applied for in 2015-16 was only 1,423 whereas Japan's count stood at 44,235, China at 29,846 and South Korea at 14,626.

This shows the clear mismatch between the number of startups mushrooming and the extent of innovation in the country compared to others.

As per Inc42's The State of The Indian Startup Ecosystem 2018 report, more than 10K Indian startups have shut their operations so far.

While failure is a hard pill to swallow, it is also a great teacher. For a startup founder, there is no bigger disappointment than seeing the product of their efforts come to nought. However there is also the flipside -- if you've never failed, you'll never know what works.

With 2019 just a couple of days away, we at Inc42 have compiled a list of the biggest failed Indian startups of the year. As late-night talk show host, Conan O'Brien said, ""Through disappointment one gains clarity and with clarity comes conviction and true originality""

Just Buy Live connected retailers to buy goods directly from brands across multiple categories such as food, drinks, personal care, auto, smartphones, fashion, stationery, etc. The startup also offered an unsecured credit lending to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to facilitate the transaction on its portal and provide working capital to small retailers. In August 2017, the startup raised $100 Mn (INR 699.25 Cr) Series B funding from a Dubai-based investment firm, Ali Cloud Investments.

Why it failed

Various reports claim that Just Buy Live may have shutdown due to an unscalable business model and negative cash flow. As per Entrackr's report in March this year, Just Buy Live's cofounder said that the company has temporarily been shut down and would resume operation after raising fresh funding. Its website is currently down.

Shotang was a business-to-business (B2B) online marketplace that connected retailers, distributors and manufacturers to discover, transact and manage their business online using their platform. Its main products were mobiles and apparel. It earned revenue through commissions paid by distributors per transaction.

Why it failed

At its peak Shotang had a $40 Mn (INR 279.7 Cr) market valuation. It had last raised $864K (INR 6.8 Cr) from Patamar Capital in February this year, and $5 Mn (INR 35.94 Cr) from Exfinity Venture Partners in December 2015. Techcircle cited an anonymous person saying that the money it last raised was ""primarily meant to pay off creditors, employees, partners. It tried but failed.""

It is likely that the business was forced to scale down its operation amid fierce competition from the likes of Flipkart, Amazon and Paytm Mall.

PortDesk provided an e-procurement software solution for logistics management for port-related operations such as accounting, cash management, ports DA estimate and voyage, layout and contract management.

Why it failed

In June this year, it was reported that PortDesk has shutdown its business, however, the reason is still unknown. Only a year earlier, the startup had raised $2 Mn (INR 13.98 Cr) in a seed funding round from a Singapore-based maritime services company, Alphard Maritime Group. The startup's founder Pushpit Pallav was not reachable for comments.

Undoubtedly India's largest crypto exchange, Zebpay (till its closure) enabled users to buy and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Ethereum, and Litecoin, or to purchase airtime and gift cards. According to its website, it had over 3 Mn users.

Why it failed

Zebpay decided to down its shutters in the aftermath of the circular issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on 6 April 2018, restricting banks and regulated payments companies from extending any services to crypto exchanges and wallets.

Many Indian cryptocurrency exchanges, as well as crypto groups, soon knocked the doors of the Supreme Court which, after multiple hearings, has listed the matter for further hearing in January next year.

However, amid the lack of crypto rules and regulations in India, Zebpay, on September 28, 2018 announced its closure. In a statement, it said, ""At this point, we are unable to find a reasonable way to conduct the cryptocurrency exchange business."" The crypto exchange, however, continues to allow users to deposit and withdraw coins/tokens into their wallet.

Since then, the situation has only worsened -- the founders of Unocoin, another leading crypto exchange, were arrested on October 23 by Bengaluru Police over a Bitcoin ATM installation.

Not only Zebpay, a slew of exchanges including Coinsecure, BTCXIndia, MoneyTrade, Bitconnect and more shut down for various reasons this past year.

Online parenting app Babyberry helped parents of a newborn baby to provide the best possible care for their child's holistic growth and development from physical, cognitive, social to emotional growth. The app included features such as digital vaccination chart and reminders, health records management and access to the nearest doctors based on geolocation.

Why it failed

It is uncertain as to what lead BabyBerry to shutdown its operations. Its website is pulled down, it hasn't posted any feeds on its social media since October last year, nor any queries to the founders could elicit any response. In August this year, a report had cited its founder saying that the startup is currently looking to solve technical errors on the platform after many of its customers reported the glitches. Notwithstanding, the startup had raised $1 Mn (INR 6.99 Cr) in 2016 meant for product development and marketing.

MrNeeds offered consumers an online subscription-based service for the delivery of products such as milk, bread, eggs, and other grocery items. In June 2017, ET had cited Wadhwa saying that its ""per delivery costs are 50% to 70% lower than the industry standard,"" and was serving 36K monthly orders for 9K families across Noida.

Why it Failed

The startup has pulled down its website, and is mobile application is not found anymore on Google's play store. It is, however, not clear as to what lead the startup to shut its operations. It is likely that the startup closed down its shutters amid fierce competition from the likes of BigBasket, DailyNinja, and others. Inc42's efforts to reach out to the founders have gone unanswered.

Bike rental startup Tazzo was focussed on point-to-point commuting service and charged INR 5 per km. Its mobile application was integrated using GPS technology and tracked every movement of its entire fleet in real-time, including overspeeding, theft, etc.

Why it failed

TheDearth of the follow-on funding was the main reason for Tazzo to shut down its operation. In October 2016, the startup had raised about $225K (INR 1.5 Cr) seed funding from DSG Consumer Partners, but the capital-intensive nature of the sector it catered too, and the lack of funding, forced the startup to halt its operation in September this year.

Trucks and logistics platform Ezytruk connected carriers, shippers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), to enable systematic transportation of goods. It offered services such as price comparison between carriers, real-time information of the goods, warehouse space management, etc.

Why it failed

Ezytruk had raised a seed funding of $147K (INR 1.02 Cr) from Dubai-based investors Ajith Nair and Anish K in January 2017. However, the startup could not scale and grow further as it was unable to raise further rounds of funding, reported Techcircle, which ultimately led the founders to shutdown the operation this year.

B2B wholesale marketplace Wydr offered a range of products across categories like fashion, home, automotive and electronics to manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. The platform allowed sellers to customise their requirements, negotiate prices, and instantly close deals. As at February 2018, the startup claimed to have added over 10K manufacturers and distributors across cities in India.

Why it failed

A report by Entrackr on November 3 cited ShopClues cofounder Sandeep Aggarwal and an early investor in Wydr as confirming the shutdown. The report said that ""the company (Wydr) was scaling down for the past three months and finally pulled the plug a couple of days ago."" An email query sent to Wydr did not elicit any response. Its official website (www.wydr.in) is currently pulled down.

Monkeybox provided Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) - approved vegetarian meals for kids in the age group of 3-18 at school. As on July 2017, the company claimed to be supplying over 1,500 meals per day to more than 85 schools in Bengaluru, with over 2K subscribers on its platform.

Why it failed

The Blume Ventures-backed foodtech startup shut down its operations amid much surprise and speculation. On one hand, the startup had been making quite a few acquisitions -- such as food delivery company 75 In A Box, juice delivery startup RawKing -- and, on the other, there was speculation that it was shutting down as it had failed to garner the required revenue to stay afloat amid fierce competition. On March 23, Monkeybox published a statement saying that ""the operation will be temporarily terminated.""

However, the termination was final. Its official website (www.monkeybox.in) was pulled down.

Apart from Indian startups that shut shop, there are some companies that ceased their operations in India after facing stiff competition and declining revenue. Here are the top top international companies whose India operations were shut down this year.

Walmart-owned ecommerce company Flipkart acquired the Indian arm of global retail company eBay in March 2017 for an undisclosed amount. Like any other ecommerce platform, eBay facilitates consumer-to-consumer and business-to-consumer sales through its website.

However, the big difference between eBay and the others is it enables trading on its platforms both in an auction or a fixed price sale. In a buyer's auction, buyers bid for a specific product and in a seller auction, different sellers bid their fixed price for a single product and the buyer chooses the best offer.

Why it failed

In May this year, eBay announced that it was ending its partnership with Flipkart and also forbade the latter to use the eBay.in brand. As the partnership ended, Flipkart migrated eBay India sellers and customers to its platform. Although being among the first players in India's ecommerce space, eBay couldn't actually rake in much revenue and faced fierce competition from Flipkart and Amazon.

As the company slowed down, and before Flipkart took over, eBay India had fired more than 350 employees from its Indian arm.

The reasons for eBay's failure in India have been many: the marketplace model was ahead of its time (eBay launched in 2005); there was no guarantee of product quality for either the buyer or the seller, and Indians never really warmed up to the idea of online auctions.

The company CEO, Devin Wenig, has announced eBay will be relaunched with a new business model in India.

The Alibaba-backed Chinese dockless bike rental company, Ofo, offered bicycles for rent on campuses and gated communities across New Delhi, Indore, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, Pune, Coimbatore, and Chennai. At the time of announcing its India operations, the company claimed to have completed 1 Mn rides across seven countries.

Why it failed

Ofo's move to shut down its dockless bike renting service in India is part of company's strategy to scale down its operations in international markets, including countries such as Australia, Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, and Israel.

Ofo maintains that the move is aimed at remaining profitable. Techcrunch cited Ofo France general manager Laurent Kennel as saying that the company would focus on ""mature and promising markets"" such as Singapore, the US, the UK, France, and Italy. Moving forward, it is believed to be communicating with local markets about its plans.

Tapzo was an ""all-in-one"" app that used to aggregate more than 35 different apps in one place, across categories such as cabs, food, recharge, bill payment, news, cricket, horoscopes, and more. Tapzo's numbers were definitely impressive: 14,000 daily user base, 55K daily transactions, and an annual run rate (ARR) of INR 210 Cr in GMV/bookings.

Why It Failed

Tapzo's reduced valuation at its last funding round can be considered as a trigger towards its shutdown. Tapzo raised $1.9 Mn (INR 13.28 Cr) in December 2017 from existing investors RB Investments Pte Ltd and Ru-Net South Asia at a post-money valuation of $47.3 Mn (INR 308 Cr) -- nearly 50% less than its valuation in the previous round -- $85.54 Mn (INR 600 Cr).

Around mid of 2018, in August, the startup got finally acquired by Amazon. After the acquisition, Amazon has merged the entire Tapzo team with Amazon Pay, and it was working in the backend. Media reports said that Tapzo's founders are likely to get on board Amazon Pay's team in India.

HolaChef was a food aggregator that connected customers with chefs across the city, offering a new menu selection every day as per its website. Before shutting its operations three months back, the company was managing packaging, storage and delivery of the food.

Why It Failed

The startup was shut down around May 2018 amid a cash crunch. A media report in August has suggested that Kalaari Capital and India Quotient had already resigned from the board of directors of HolaChef earlier in the year.

With the increased dominance of players like Foodpanda, Zomato and Swiggy in the online food delivery market, investors lost interest in the startup. This was coupled with a market correction to make things worse. The last funding raised by Holachef was in February this year when it raised $28,602 (INR 20 Lakhs) in Series B round.

Foodpanda pounced on the chance, acquiring the startup for cheap -- the deal was said to fetch minimal returns HolaChef investors. For Foodpanda, the acquisition was an attempt to test waters in the cloud kitchen space, which its bigger rivals Swiggy and Zomato were already exploring.

A cursory glance at the startup shutdowns reported by Inc42 in the past three years shows that of the 32 startups that ceased their operations, most of them were from sectors such as consumer services, ecommerce, and fintech sectors. However, these sectors were among the top trending sectors in 2018, attracting investment, mergers, acquisitions, and new ventures. In fact, these are sectors that are expected to do better than all other sectors as well.

Goes to prove that it's not all about the idea, doesn't it?

What startups can learn from these stories is to buckle up their business strategy, take stock and identify even the most minuscule problems, and start rectifying them, immediately. They can also sleep on the fact that an idea -- or even market demand -- doesn't alone make a brilliant startup. It's also about execution and the right time, right place. As Edison also said, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.""

Update: Holachef and Tapzo have been acquired and not shutdown as was wrongly stated in an earlier version of this article."

Delhi's oldest Ghazipur landfill and Asia's largest dumping ground - Deonar in Mumbai, continued to gather waste despite the Supreme Court ordering a closure of these landfills. Meanwhile, Delhi's biggest garbage dump- Bhalswa landfill caught fire that took three days to douse. Recently, Mumbai's second largest dumping ground - Mulund landfill was permanently closed after it reached its saturation point and then there was the fire at Ahmedabad's sole landfill site at pirana, where fumes emitting from garbage are a common sight for passersby.

While landfills continue to be an eyesore in the urban landscape and a crisis that most cities are grappling with, there were a few notable exceptions - Indore, and Ambikapur that declared themselves landfill free and emerged as benchmarks that others can follow.

According to the Central Pollution Control Board report of 2015-2016 which have the last collated figures on the implementation of Solid Wastes Management Rules, 2016, over 1.3 lakh (1,35,198.27) tonnes of solid waste is generated per day in India. Of the total waste generated, while over one lakh tonnes per day (1,11,027.55 TPD) is collected, only a fraction - 25,572.25 TPD is treated and 47,415.62 TPD is landfilled.

To make sure cities go waste free, government also introduced seven star-rating under Swachh Survekshan - a pan India exercise to assess cleanliness in urban India. The seven star rating is the first-of-its kind rating tool for assessing cleanliness of cities and towns in India, designed on a SMART approach that stands for Single metric, Measurable, Achievable, Rigorous verification and Targeted towards outcomes. The criteria to achieve seven star rating is 100 per cent door-to-door waste collection, 100 per cent waste treatment and waste free local water bodies.

The Current Status: The national capital Delhi is home to three of the biggest landfills namely Ghazipur, Okhla and Bhalswa, which have out lived their life and are now unable to take the burden and collapsing under the weight of the waste. A fact that is borne out by the recent events with the Ghazipur dump yard collapsing in 2017, claiming two lives and Bhalswa and Okhla landfill smouldering continuously. The sad part is, despite all this, little to nothing has been done in 2018 to improve the status of landfills with 60-70 metre high mountain of garbage.

All kinds of waste that is wet, dry and toxic is collected together and dumped at a landfill. Once wet waste starts rotting and decomposing then you have formation of methane gas which is not only a toxic greenhouse gas, but flammable also. Because of the same, landfills are always under fire. It is just sometimes it is huge and someone passing sees it, makes a video and posts it on social media and it becomes news, says Chitra Mukherjee, Head of Programmes, Operations, Chintan.

""In Delhi, till date, about 10,500 tonnes of waste is collected per day. 6,100 TPD still goes to waste to energy plant and this is all mixed waste. Only 200 TPD gets composted"", says Swati Singh Sambyal, Programme Manager, Waste Management, Center for Science and Environment.

The Problem: Currently, a portion of collected waste is dumped at some or the other landfill and remaining is treated at waste-to-energy (WTE) plants at Sarojini Nagar, Narela-Bawana, Ghazipur and Okhla. But are these WTE plants effective? Will they solve the problem?

Municipalities keep talking about WTE plants, but honestly they are pathetic, because all kinds of waste goes into it and is burned. WTE plants are neither meeting emission norms, nor helping in waste segregation and then recycling, says Chitra.

The problem in Delhi is lack of accountability and enforcement of Solid Waste Management Rules (SWMR) of 2016. It has been two years and not even single law has been implemented so far, reason being, as East Delhi Municipal Corporation says, lack of funds to provide vehicles and other necessary things to waste pickers. As part of SWMR, waste should be segregated at source and if not then defaulters will be penalised, but according to experts, not even single case has been registered.

Segregation of waste at source ensures that biodegradable waste like kitchen waste is composted, waste like plastic that can be recycled is sent to relevant facilities and only what remains make it way to the landfill. Unlike now where bulk of the waste is piling up at these landfills.

The Solution: To deal with the humoungous amount of waste, earlier this year Supreme Court asked Lieutenant Governor of Delhi to form a committee and come up with solutions. A 24 member team comprising children, civil society members, RWA (Resident Welfare Association) representatives, municipalities and others was formed and the committee is expected to submit its report in the first week of 2019.

Also Read: Despite New Waste Management Rules, Delhi's Ghazipur Landfill Grows 15 Metres In A Year

The committee is of the opinion that effective enforcement of SWMR of 2016 will help in managing the waste and making municipalities accountable. Being a member of the committee, Chitra knows the on ground issues and says,

The problem is citizens do not connect their responsibility with the landfill. Lot of people complain that we segregate waste at home, but waste pickers mix it. So, who is at fault? Of course, the municipalities as they do not have a dedicated stream for segregated waste.

For remediation that is to stop the environmental damage being caused by Bhalswa landfill, lifespan which lapsed in 2009 and yet it continues to be in use a decade later, a nine member Scientific Advisory Committee has been constituted under the chairmanship of Dr. Manoj Dutta, Professor, IIT Delhi. According to the committee's recommendation, adoption of landfill mining (process of excavating landfilled solid wastes and processing it) is not a viable option. In the first stage, the committee has asked the municipal corporation to carry out site characterisation under which it needs to collect data on the quantum of waste under and above the ground, type and quality of waste, and other parameters for assessing the current state of the landfill. Once it is done, the nine member committee will prepare the design of the work to be done at the Bhalswa landfill site. While the investigation and design of the project is under progress, execution of plan is scheduled for March 31, 2020 which is still one and a half years from now. If that works well, similar steps can be taken for Ghazipur and Okhla landfill, maybe.

The Experts Opinion: Talking about the steps taken in 2018 and the way forward to deal with active volcanos in the city, Chitra says,

Nothing has happened in 2018, apart from passing the buck. With the committee submitting its report to the apex court, we hope municipalities to take some action in 2019, implement waste segregation, and especially SWMR.

The Current Status: Maharashtra's capital Mumbai is a densely populated city that generates 7,000 metric tonnes of waste per day that directly goes to two dumpyards - Deonar (holding city's waste from over 9 decades) and Mulund and to scientific landfill - Kanjurmarg. After observing the condition of the Deonar and Mulund dumping grounds and noting how they have reached their saturation points, in February 2016, the Bombay High Court had ordered the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to close down the two dumping grounds. It is in October this year that Mulund dumping ground was finally closed permanently, but Deonar continues to function way past its lifespan.

There is no such saturation point for landfills. As far as Deonar is concerned, there is still some space as we have started processing waste and have more plans to manage the waste effectively in the days to come, says BMC official.

While bio-mining and capping (a containment technology that forms a barrier between the waste and the ground, shielding humans and the environment from the harmful effects of its contents) is being practised at Mulund landfill, bio-reactor (under which liquids are added to help bacteria break down the waste) and composting has been adopted at Kanjurmarg. But the question is, are these solutions sufficient and effective?

The BMC's Opinion: ""The process of bio-reactor is useful for mixed waste as well, so the good thing here is we don't have to pay heed to waste segregation. But it is not that we are ignoring waste segregation at source"", says BMC official.

With increase in waste load, BMC plans to increase the processing of waste at Kanjumarg by March end. The plan is to treat upto 5,800-6,000 metric tonnes of waste at Kanjurmarg and leave only 1000-1200 metric tonnes per day at Deonar.

While 5,000 tonnes will be treated via bio-reactor, 1,000 tonnes will be composted. We are strengthening the segregation activity which will further reduce the total generation and load on Deonar, says BMC official.

The Problem: Until October, of all the waste generated, 1400-1500 metric tonnes was dumped at Mulund dumping ground, every day. Now the same waste is being shared by Deonar and Kanjurmarg landfill, increasing the waste burden on already overstretched landfills. Deonar which expired back in 2009 is still being used recklessly and the result is constant fumes emerging from garbage, leading to instances of fires.

Though BMC has plans to treat waste on a daily basis, but what comes up as a major problem is the legacy waste. Lack of waste segregation at source comes up as another issue as without segregation the amount of waste reaching the landfills cannot be reduced.

The Solution: As experts say, decentralised process and segregation is the key to manage the mammoth waste and BMC is currently focusing on segregation. Shedding light on the same, BMC official says,

We have floated the tender, asking for vehicles with compartments to collect the segregated waste. 40 per cent of the requested vehicles are already in action and the remaining will be up soon. This will of course ease the entire process as dry waste will further get segregated into e-waste, plastic, paper, and others and treated accordingly.

Steps Taken By BMC In 2018: BMC has made it mandatory for bulk generators to treat wet waste at source. The ones failing to do so will be penalised as per the law. For residents and small scale waste generators, awareness camps, exhibitions and activities are being organised. People are being educated about the process of wet waste management at home and encouraged to practice the same.

Until and unless waste generators take the responsibility, we cannot do much. If at home you will segregate the waste, it will be easy for us to treat it as centralised processing centers cannot segregate the 7000 tonnes of waste. It has to start from your own home, building, society and colonies, says BMC official.

The Experts Opinion: ""I agree that waste generators need to take action, but decentralised process is pivotal. Like authority cannot lie in an individual's hand, entire waste cannot be managed in one way. Different kinds of waste need to be treated in different way and for the same we need different strategies"", says Chitra.

Earlier in 2013-2014, the waste load on dumping ground in Mumbai used to be 9,400 tonnes which has now come down to 7,000 tonnes and BMC further plans to bring it down to 6,000 tonnes. Can this be achieved? Given the scale of the crisis, the city sure will have its fingers crossed.

Bengaluru, the IT capital of India, is infamous for its garbage crisis and holds the title of 'garbage city of India'. A city with a population of 1.23 crore generates 4,000 metric tonnes of waste on a daily basis. The waste is majorly categorised into dry, wet and sanitary waste. While the dry waste is collected and taken to 164 dry waste collection centers, wet waste is sent to eight processing units, together capable of treating 2,300 tonnes per day and sanitary waste is being treated by a private company.

Along with this, we have organic waste converter (treatment and recycling of solid and liquid refuse material) of capacity 1500 tonnes. 30 per cent of apartments in the city are doing composting on site. Also, we have a learning center where we give lessons on how to do composting, manage waste and other things. Main aim is to encourage waste segregation at source, Sarfaraz Khan, Joint Commissioner, Solid Waste Management, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP).

As far as mixed waste is concerned, it is simply dumped at scientific landfill - Bellahalli in the city, which came into existence around three years ago. In November, the orders were given to close Bellahalli landfill within 90 days, but civic body has decided to use the landfill for six more months and then convert it into a motor racing track. As part of the functioning of scientific landfill, currently, at frequent intervals, waste is covered with a thick layer of mud.

Earlier the city of Bengaluru was known as the garbage city, but today we are proud to say that this tag does not belong to us, Sarfaraz Khan.

The reason Mr Khan proudly says this is how in past a quarry turned into landfill was transformed into a beautiful park. Few years ago, the stone quarry at Bagalur was abandoned, after which it had become a dangerous spot due to the 200 feet deep pit. Slowly and gradually, the site turned into a dumping ground, raising concerns among villagers. It is three years ago, BBMP noticed the site and claimed it for a scientific landfill site. The scientific landfill would intake 300-400 tonnes of mixed waste everyday. After every 8 - 10 feet of garbage, 8 feet of mud capping was given. This way, by August 2017, quarry was filled and saplings of neem and amla and flowering plants like crotons were planted on it.

BBMP has done a lot in 2018 to improve waste management in the city. There is a new 'Swachagraha Kalika Kendra', a composting learning center for home and community, Bengaluru is the only city to collect sanitary waste separately, black spots are being cleaned. A lot has been done, but there is still a long way to go. We have infrastructure and policies, but what is lacking is the implementation and streamlined waste collection system. I feel citizens working with officials and elected representatives makes a good combination and together they can solve the crisis, says Nalini, co-founder, Hasiru Dala.

Madhya Pradesh's Indore has managed to grab the title of India's cleanest city for two years in a row. To maintain the lead in Swachh Survekshan 2019 as well, the city took some stringent steps this year with regards to waste management. From implementing 100 per cent door-to-door waste collection, source segregation, scientific land filling, to eliminating decade old waste from landfills, the city has done it all. It is not just focusing on treating household waste, but plastic and construction and demolition waste management as well.

Indore city generate 1100 metric tonnes of waste per day and we cannot leave this enormous amount of waste just like that. To manage the waste, a decentralised waste treatment system exists at each and every hospital, school, RWA, and other such places which make waste treatment possible at source only. The waste which is not treated goes to centralised waste treatment system handled by IMC and there it is taken care of, says Asad Warsi, Swachh Bharat Mission Consultant.

20 metric tonnes of waste generated in fruit and vegetable mandi (market) is used to power its public transport buses. A bio-mechanisation plant is installed in the market which ends up generating three types of gases from the waste generated in the fruit and vegetable market - Methane, Carbon dioxide (CO2), and Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S). Methane is separated, cleaned, purified and compressed and then converted into bio CNG which can fuel 20-25 buses every day.

Can waste generate wealth? Yes, as ambikapur proves it by earning lakhs. Chhattisgarh's Ambikapur has a population of 1.45 lakh and generates 52 metric tonnes of waste on a daily basis, but instead of dumping it on some or the other dumpyard, the city converts waste into wealth and makes Rs. 20-25 lakh per month.

In the year 2015, the municipal corporation made it compulsory for citizens to segregate the waste at source. Since then, every morning, 447 sanitation workers go out, collect the segregated waste which is further segregated at 17 secondary segregation centres within the city. The segregated waste is then sent for recycling, composting and other kinds of processing, depending on the of waste.

Because of the same, the city was awarded as one of India's best city in 'Innovation and Best Practices' (population 1 - 3 lakh) category in Swachh Survekshan 2018.

The state of Chhattisgarh, which got third rank in Swachh Survekshan 2018, is on the way of following Ambikapur's zero waste model to become India's first zero-landfill state. If Ambikapur can do it, other cities of Chhattisgarh can think of doing it, then why not rest of India?, says Suryakiran Tiwari Agarwal, Municipal Commissioner of Ambikapur.

The success story of Indore, Ambikapur, and especially Kerala's Alappuzha which was even recognised by the United Nations Environment Programme for being exceptional in addressing the garbage crisis, show that managing waste effectively is possible. Decentralised system with segregation at source is a viable option and the way forward, according to experts."

This was a year for consolidating the gains that have accrued from major policy decisions taken in the previous four years, a time for monitoring of ongoing projects, tackling road blocks and adding to the already impressive pace of work achieved last year. The Ministry took a decision to complete all ongoing projects that had been awarded upto 2015-16, and placed the highest ever target of constructing at least 12,000 kms of national highways as against 9829 kms achieved during 2017-18, and make special efforts to take this length to 16000 km. Overall, more than about 61,300 km length of road projects, costing more than Rs. 6.48 lakh crore, are in progress at present. The balance ongoing works (which have been awarded, appointed dates declared and works going on at sites) are more than 30,200 kms during the year. In the first nine months of FY 2018-19, 5,759 km has been completed in 18-19 against 4,942 km up to same period in last year.

1.2 In order to achieve this target the Ministry brought in policies, guidelines and practices for expediting pre-construction activities and bringing in more efficiency and transparency in the process. The Bidder Information Management System (BIMS)was developed to streamline the process of pre-qualification of bidders for contracts on EPC Mode. BhoomiRashi portal is being used extensively for expediting the process of notification for land acquisition. The portal BIMS and BhoomiRashi portals have further been linked with Public Financial Management System(PFMS) to facilitate real time payment to beneficiaries.

1.3 On the finance front too, National Highways Authority of India did a successful financial closure of its first project under Toll- Operate -Transfer this year andoffered 586 km of national highways under the second bundle. The first TOT bundle of 9 projects, totaling approximately 681 KM of roads in two states of Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, was awarded earlier during the year for Rs. 9,681 Crore, which was 1.5 times the Authority's estimate. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) also got an unsecured loan of Rs 25,000 crore from State Bank of India for 10 years with 3 years of moratorium on repayments. This is the largest amount of loan to have been sanctioned to NHAI in one stroke by any institution. This is also the largest long term unsecured loan sanctioned by SBI at a time to any entity.

A two days long exercise was conducted to review of over 700 ongoing National Highway projects in the country, and over 300 projects were identified to be completed by 2019 achieving the highest ever construction in financial year 2018-19.

The table below details the trends of NH construction over the years.

This is the umbrella program for the highways sector unrolled in 2017-18, that aims to optimize the efficiency of road traffic movement across the country by bridging critical infrastructure gaps. 34,800 km of National Highways are to be constructed under the Phase-I of the programme between 2017-18 to 2021-22 in a phased manner at a cost of Rs. 5,35,000 crore. This includes 5,000 kms of the National Corridors, 9000 kms of Economic Corridors, 6000 km of Feeder Corridors and Inter-Corridors, 2000 kms of Border Roads, 2,000 kms of Coastal Roads and Port Connectivity Roads and 800 kms of Green-field Expressways.

Projects for 6,407 km road length have been awarded under the BharatmalaPariyojana(including residual NHDP) till the end of October this year. DPRs are being prepared for projects for the balance length. De- congestion projects have been completed for 13 out of 191 congestion points identified, and are under progress for de-congestion of 80 other points. In addition, DPRs are being prepared for 93 congestion points.Out of the 35 locations identified for Multimodal Logistics Parks, DPRs have been initiated for 7 locations and availability of land parcels is being confirmed with State Governments for the rest of the locations.

In order to ensure safe and smooth flow of traffic, Ministry has envisaged a plan for replacement of Level Crossings on National Highways by ROBs/ RUBs under a scheme known as SetuBharatam. Under this programme, out of 174 ROBs/RUBs which are to be constructed, 91 have been sanctioned with an estimated cost of Rs.7,104.72 crore. Out of 91 sanctioned, 59 ROBs/RUBs have been awarded which are in various stages of progress.

The project envisages development of easy access to the four prominent Dhams, namely, Gangotri, Yamunotri, Kedranath and Badrinath, situated in the state of Uttrakhand. These four Dhams are prominent pilgrimage centres. The project entails development of 889 km of roads with configuration of two-lane with paved shoulders at an estimated cost of about Rs. 12,000 crore. The projects are being taken up on EPC mode and the programme is targeted for completion by March, 2020.

The two projects of Peripheral Expressways around Delhi, comprising 135 km Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE), and 135 km Western Peripheral Expressway (WPE) connecting NH-1 and NH-2 from Western and Eastern side of Delhi was completed this year and inaugurated by Hon'ble Prime Minister in May 2018 and November 2018 respectively. The EPE was constructed by NHAI and WPE by Haryana Government. The two expressways were envisaged with the twin objectives of decongesting and de-polluting the national capital by diverting the traffic not destined for Delhi.

The EPE stretches from Kundli on NH 1 to Palwal on NH 2, and was constructed at a cost ofRs. 4617.87 crore, in addition to Rs. 5900crorewere spent on acquiring 1700 acres of land. It was completed in a record time of about 500 days against the scheduled target of 910 days. It is a fully access-controlled six-lane expressway with a closed tolling system. The expressway has an iconic toll plaza equipped with electronic toll collection infrastructure, ITS control system of the entire EPE and a digital art gallery, with holographic models of major structures and making of the EPE. Weigh-in-Motion equipment at all 30 entry points, solar power on the entire length, eight solar power plants with a capacity of 4000 KW, rainwater harvesting, drip irrigation and 36 replicas of monuments depicting Indian culture and heritage are major features of this expressway. This project has generated employment opportunities of about 50 lakh man-days.

The 8.36 km long Package -1 of the projects was inaugurated by Hon'ble Prime Minister in May this year. It is a 14 lane, access-controlledsection stretching from Nizammudin Bridge to Delhi UP Border, and was completed in a record time of 18 months as against the earlier expected construction period of 30 months, at a cost of about Rs. 841.50 crore. This is the first National Highway in the country with 14 lanes, and has several features that would help reduce pollution. These include a 2.5-metre-wide cycle track on either side of the highway, a vertical garden on the Yamuna Bridge, solar lighting system and watering of plants through drip irrigation only.

Package II from UP Border to Dasna(19.28 km), Package -III - Dasna to Hapur( 22.27) km and Package -IV - Green-field Alignment from Dasna to Meerut -(31.78 km) are under construction and are likely to be completed by March 2019.

The 473 km expressway will link Ahmedabad-Vadodara Expressway to Mumbai-Pune Expressway thus providing Expressway connectivity from Ahmedabad to Pune for a length of about 650 Km.

This 1250 km Expressway is being developed along a new alignment between Delhi and Mumbai, which passes through backward and tribal districts of Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat. A sum of one lakh crore rupees will be spent on this expressway.It will reduce the distance between Delhi and Mumbai from the present 1450km through NH 8 to 1250 km, and the travel time to 12 hours. The sections of proposed highway from Delhi to Dahod in Rajasthan are under tendering, while the section between Vadodara to Ankleshwar in Gujarat have already been awarded. The DPR is under progress for the remaining sections.

DPR is under progress for this 260 km Expressway. This is a green-field alignment. There are two existing roads connecting Bangalore-Chennai, one is via Hoskote (Bangalore)-AP then to Chennai & second is via Electronic City (Bangalore) Hosur(Tamil Nadu) and then to Chennai. The alignment of the proposed expressway is passing in between these two stretches.

Greenfield alignment is being explored for this 500 km long proposed Expressway.

DPR has been awarded and alignment finalization is under progress for the new green-field 940 km Nagpur - Hyderabad - Bangalore EXP.

DPR is in progress for 75 km of Kanpur - Lucknow EXP

Hon'ble Prime Minister inaugurated the 16.55 km, Rs 759.36 crore Varanasi Ring Road Phase-I and 17.25 km, Rs 812.59 crore Babatput-Varanasi road on NH-56 in November. It has reduced the travel time from Varanasi to the airport, and is proving a big relief to the people of Varanasi and to tourists providing a more convenient access to Sarnath, an important site for Buddhist pilgrimage.

The Ministry has taken up construction of a signature 4-lane Bridge to connect the mainland at Okha to Byet-Dwarka Island off the Gujarat Coast with this SignatureBridge spanning a length of 2.32 kms. The Project has been awarded on 01.01.2018 at a cost of Rs. 689.47 crores. This will be the longest span cable stayed bridge in India with the main span of 500 mtrs. The project is scheduled to be completed in a period of 30 months.

Approval has been given for a project for construction of 9.9 km long new 6 - lane bridge across river Ganga on NH - 96 at Phaphamau in Allahabad with total capital cost of Rs. 1948.25 crore. The construction period for the project is three years and likely to be completed by December, 2021. The new bridge will resolve the traffic congestion on existing old 2 - lane Phaphamau bridge on NH-96 at Allahabad. The new bridge will also facilitate to the large congregation of people at Holy City Allahabad during Kumbh, Ardh-Kumbh and other yearly ritual baths at SANGAM in Prayag. This will give a boost to pilgrimage tourism and local economy of Holy city of Prayag. This new 6 - lane bridge will also be beneficial for the Lucknow / Faizabad bound traffic coming from Madhya Pradesh via National Highway - 27 and National Highway - 76 through Naini Bridge. In addition, this project of new bridge will generate direct employment during construction for about 9.20 lakh mandays.

Approval was given to a project for construction of 6.930 km long 4-lane bridge at Phulaut in Bihar, along with approval for rehabilitation and up-gradation of existing Birpur- Bihpur section of National Highway-106. The construction of this new Bridge will fill the existing 30 km long gap between Udakishanganj and Bihpur of National Highway Number 106 in Bihar, which will provide through connectivity between Nepal/ North Bihar/ East-West Corridor (passing through NH- 57) and South Bihar/ Jharkhand/ Golden Quadrilateral (passing through NH -2), besides full utilization of National Highway Number-31.

A network of 35 Multimodal Logistics Parks had been identified for development in the Phase - 1 of BharatmalaPariyojana. The availability of the land parcels for development of Multimodal Logistics Parks has been confirmed at 7 locations and DPRs have been initiated in all the nodes.

This is a project for constructing a 14.150 km long, 2-lane bi-directional Zojila Tunnel in Jammu & Kashmir. This would be India's longest road tunnel and the longest bi-directional tunnel in Asia. The construction of this tunnel will provide all weather connectivity between Srinagar, Kargil and Leh and will bring about all round economic and socio-cultural integration of these regions.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved the construction, operation and maintenance of the 2- Lane, 4.532 Km long Bi-directional Silkyara Bend - Barkot Tunnel on Dharasu-Yamunotri section along NH -134 in the State of Uttarakhand. The project forms part of the Chardham Plan. The construction period of the project is 4 years at an estimated cost of Rs. 1383.78 crore. Once complete, this stretch will reduce the travel distance from Dharasu to Yamunotri by about 20 Km and travel time byaboutanhour.It will also provide all weather connectivity to Yamunotri, encouraging regional socio-economic development, trade and tourism within the country. The project will be implemented by National Highways & Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd. (NHIDCL).

Around Rs. 1,90,000 crore worth of projects have been sanctioned for the construction of road projects for over 12,000 km in the North East region. The projects being executed by NHIDCL are to the tune of Rs. 1, 66,026 crore, covering 10,892 km of roads in all the eight NE states. Projects costing Rs. 17,257 crore have been allotted to the respective state PWDs. Further, projects costing Rs. 7,000 crore are entrusted to the NHAI.

The Ministry has focused on completion of on-going projects along with sanction and award of new projects. A total of 73 projects (8,187 km) worth an estimated investment of Rs.1,00,000 crore wereidentified as Languishing Projects. The reasons for delay were identified and policy interventions undertaken to address the same.

The Ministry is monetizing its road assets constructed with public funds through Toll-Operate-Transfer (ToT) scheme. The scheme envisages bidding of bundled national highways for a concession period of 30 years. The first bundle comprised 9 projects, totalling 681 km of roads in Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat. It was awarded in 2018 to Macquarie for Rs. 9,681 Crore, which was 1.5 times the NHAI's estimate.The second bundle comprises over 586 kms spread over four states - Rajasthan, Gujarat, West Bengal and Bihar. The offer has 12 toll plazas across four highways.

TheNational Highways Authority of India (NHAI) signed a Memorandum of Understanding(MoU)withtheStateBankofIndiatoreceiveRs.25,000croreasa long-term,unsecuredloanfor10years.Thisisthelargestamountofloantohavebeen sanctioned by the SBl in one go. This is also the largest ever fund that NHAI has ever received in one go.

The Ministry has issued detailed guidelines for determination of proper alignment of NH projects, advising executing agencies to examine the feasibility of a green- field alignment, especially in the case of economic corridors, instead of widening existing highways. This has been done because widening involves acquisition of land for Right of Way (RoW), shifting of utilities and demolition of built up structure, all of which involves a lot of time and cost. Also, earlier highways were largely planned to be serpentine, linking all possible towns in the vicinity. This road geometry has been found to be sub optimal, especially in case of economic corridors. BharatmalaPariyojanaalso calls for a corridor approach for economic corridors. It has also been found in a few test cases that it is feasible to acquire a RoW of 60 to 70 mtrs for a green field road project at the same cost as involved in the expansion of an existing road, especially when the associated costs and time taken in utility shifting, tree felling, additional compensation for demolition of structures coming in the RoW under expansion are taken into account.

AWebUtilityhasbeendevelopedwherebythelandacquisitionprocedureforthe NH projects, including processing of all LA related gazette notifications, are being done through a common platform called ""BhoomiRashi"". The Utility has been linked with the e-gazette platform of the MinistryofUrbanDevelopment,GovernmentofIndia,forpublicationofGazette Notifications.TheuseofBhumi Rashi has helped in cutting down the processing time from 2 to 3 months earlier to one to two weeksnow.

BhoomiRashi has also been integrated with the Public Financial Management System(PFMS)platformoftheMinistryofFinancefordepositofcompensationin theaccountsoflandowners/interestedpersonsonarealtimebasis, instead of being parked with CALA.

The Ministry has developed a Bidder Information Management System (BIMS) to streamline the process of pre-qualification of bidders for contracts on EPC mode for all NH works and centrally sponsored works.BIMS acts as a data base for allbasic details of bidders like civil works experience, cash accruals and network, annual turnover etc,. This allows quick pre-qualification assessment of bidders based on evaluation parameters like threshold capacity and bid capacity from already stored data. Technical evaluationcantherefore be carried out faster using this information.

AnnualawardsforexcellenceinNationalHighwayssectorhasbeeninstitutedfrom thisyearonwardsforrecognizingconcessionairesandcontractorswhohavebeen performing exceptionally well. Applications have been invited from all the concessionaires and contractors working in the field of highways construction and tolling. These awards are designed across the fivecategories of construction management, operation and maintenance, best toll plaza, safest highway, innovation in design and construction technology.

India's first Highway Capacity Manual developed by CSIR-CRRI was launched this year. The manual is designed to be a tool for guiding road engineers and policy makers in the country. It lays down guidelines for the development and management of different types of roads, based on traffic characteristics on such roads having varying lane configurations.

The Ministry has organized a workshop on 18.12.2018 in Delhi for Regional Officers of Ministry, NHAI and NHIDCL to discuss the issues relating to land acquisition, contract document (EPC/DPR) and E-Disha (ERP projects), new standards and technical specifications. A Manual of Guidelines on Land Acquisition for National Highways under the National Highways Act, 1956 has also been released for seamless process of Land Acquisition for National Highways.

As per the Ministry's annual report on road accidents based on the data reported by Police authorities throughout India, there has been some marginal reduction in the number of road accidents and fatalities in 2017, as can be seen from the table below.

The Ministry has been making concerted efforts to address the problem of road safety through a series of measures that include improving road infrastructure, road safety audits, identification and rectification of black spots on roads and strengthening the automobile safety standards, organizing road safety awareness programmes and strengthening enforcement etc. These efforts have started showing some results.

The Ministry has so far identified 789 road accident black spots in various States of which 651 ON National Highways and 138 are on State roads. Work for rectification of these black spots is at various stages of completion.

The Ministry has been working in association with States, Vehicle manufactures and NGOs for strengthening the driving training. Institute of Driving training and Research (IDTRs), Regional Driving Training Centres (RDTCs) and Driving Training Centre (DTC) have been established which act as model Driving Training Centres with state of art infrastructure. Ministry has also launched a scheme for creating driving training centres in all the districts of the country and support refresher-training programme for heavy commercial vehicles drivers. The Ministry is implementing a scheme for setting up of Model Institute of Drivers Training and Research (IDTR) by States/UTs. So far 24 (nos.) ITDRs have been sanctioned in different States/UTs and bout 16 are complete and functioning.

The Ministry has issued guidelines associating Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) for promoting awareness about road safety under a scheme titled ""Grant of financial assistance for administering Road Safety Advocacy and awards for the outstanding work done in the field of Road Safety"". It is envisaged that the NGOs will undertake activities for creating road safety awareness among citizens.

A mobile App and Toll- free Emergency number 1033 for highway users, developed by NHAI, were launched in March this year. The SukhadYatra mobile application provides information on toll gates. The key feature of the app includes a provision for the user to enter road quality-related information or to report any accident or pothole on the highway. It also provides users with real-time data related to waiting time expected at toll plazas and various facilities like points of interest, highway nest/ nest mini, etc. The app can also be used to purchase FASTags.

The toll-free number 1033 will enable users to report an emergency condition, or highway-related feedback, across the highway. The service has also been integrated with ambulance / tow away services along the roads.

This Ministry observed the 29th National Road Safety Week from 23to 30April 2018. This year's focus was on schools and commercial drivers and the theme was ""Sadak Suraksha JeevanRaksha"". In the opening ceremony the Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways emphasized the Ministry's priorities in ensuring safety of road users in the country. Awards were given to 10 school children who won the national level essay competition on road safety. The Hon'ble Minister also administered the road safety pledge to all those present on theoccasion. A variety of programmes related to the Road Safety were also organized in several cities across the country to enlighten people on Road Safety, and Driving Rules. Many NGOs participated in the Ministry's efforts to create awareness about the issue.

The Ministry had constituted a group of State Transport Ministers under the Chairmanship of Shri Yunus Khan, Transport Minister of Rajasthan to work out interstate issues and reach a consensus on adoption of uniform rates of taxation, permits and other issues. A Group of Transport Ministers from 13 states met in Guwahati on 18-19 April this year and adopted a 9-Point Guwahati Declaration aimed at harmonization of taxes and permits, road safety measures, policy changes and measures for strengthening State Road Transport Undertakings. The most important decisions taken by during the meeting included the recommendation for One Nation One Tax for the diverse road tax structure, which would ease travel.

In order to help accident victims in getting reasonable and fast compensation from insurance companies, the Ministry revised the relevant rules of the Motor Vehicles Act according to which every accident victim or his next of kin will be entitled to a compensation of Rs 5 lakh in case of death, and uptoRs 5 lakh, proportionate to the extent of injury in case of grievous hurt and disablement. Accident victims can claim higher compensation through court if they are not satisfied, but with this rule even the poorest of the poor will get a fast and reasonable compensation.

A Central Command and Control Centre is being set up at the NHAI HQ for CCTV surveillance and Monitoring of Vehicular Congestion at 210 Fee Plazas of National Highways that have higher traffic volumes. it is proposed to be connected with Regional Offices and the project execution is on service model for a period of five years.

Three short films for generating public awareness for the need to comply with the rules of the road, eventually contributing to the cause of road safety, were launched by Hon'ble Minister for Road Transport & Highways, on 14th' August, 2018. Film actor Shri Akshay Kumar who featured in these films on pro bono basis, has also been appointed as Road Safety Brand Ambassador by the Hon'ble Minister.

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has designated the Asian Institute of Transport Development as an apex body for capacity building in the area of road safety. The objective is that this centre would act as a depository of research studies and best practices.Human resource development and exchange of knowledge form an important component of its activities. Up to October 2018, the National Centre for Road Safety has been able to train over 1,400 professionals in road safety and road safety audit by conducting 31 courses pan India.

The Ministry took several initiatives in the transport sector during the year to make road travel more convenient for people. Some of these areas under-

To improve ease in licensing, this Ministry has simplified the driving license application form. Four forms i.e. (a) Learner License, (b) Driving License, (c) Renewal of License, and (d) updation of Address - all have been consolidated into one. The new form will enable Aadhar based verification of the applicant's identity to provide online services for renewal, change of address etc. Another highlight of the new form is that it would capture an applicant's willingness for organ donation.

The permissible safe axle weight of goods vehicles was revised and increased by about 15% to 20 % for different configurations of axles. The decision was taken with a view to help in increasing the carrying capacity of goods transport vehicles and bring down logistics cost. The amendment will increase the carrying capacity of goods vehicles by about 20-25 % and lower logistics costs by about 2%. It will also bring down the incidence of overloading. While automobile technology and road construction quality have improved greatly over the years, the axle loads have remained the same since 1983 when they were last notified. There was a felt need to harmonize the axle load with international standards.

NHAI has developed a matrix-based methodology to rank the Fee Plazas on parameters such as electronic tolling, time taken in clearance of FASTag lanes, display panels, staff behaviour, cleanliness, etc. The data for the matrix is to be collected by the Regional Officers who will use the same to rank the Fee Plazas under their jurisdiction. Meanwhile, a countrywide drive was launched by NHAl on more than 300 toll plazas across the country on 10 February, 2018, to address issues that affect highway users. Officers visited toll plazas and addressed issues of user convenience and took feedback from the people.

The Ministry has revised the maximum speed of various classes of vehicles vide notification dated 6th April 2018. The notification prescribes the speed of various classes of vehicles. Thus a passenger vehicle with not more than 8 seats including driver can have a maximum speed of 120 km/hr on expressways and 70km/hr on municipal roads.

An advisory has been issued by the Ministry to all the States / UTs to accept the documents in electronic form through DigiLocker platform of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India and the mParivahan mobile app of the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways. Such electronic records available on DigiLocker or mParivahanare deemed to be legally recognized at par with the original documents as per the provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000. This will also address Grievances / RTI applications of the citizens and facilitate promotion of Digital India campaign.

With a view to enhancing the safety of women passengers, detailed standards for Installation of Vehicle Location Tracking Device (VLT) and Emergency Button on public service vehicles have been notified on October 25, 2018. The States/ UTs have been mandated to ensure compliance of the rule and check fitment and functional status of the VLT device in the public service vehicles at the time of checking of the vehicles for fitness certification. The Command and Control Centres in the States will be used to provide interface to various stakeholders such as State emergency response centre, the Transport authorities of the state and central governments, device manufacturers and their authorized dealers, testing agencies etc. The Command and control Centre will also be able to provide feed to the VAHAN database or the relevant data base of the state with regard to over speeding and the health status of the device.

As per this notification the renewal of the fitness certificate in respect of transport vehicle up to eight years old shall be done for two years and for one year for vehicle older than eight years. No fitness certification shall be required at the time of registration for the new transport vehicle sold as fully built vehicle and such vehicle shall be deemed to be having certificate of fitness for a period of two years from the date of registration.

The Ministry has issued a notification for Dual fuel usage which covers Emission of smoke and vapour from agriculture tractors, power tillers, construction equipment vehicles and combine harvesters driven by dual fuel diesel with Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) or Bio-Compressed Natural Gas (Bio-CNG) or Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) engines.

Keeping in view the need for promoting electric mobility and alternate fuels, the Ministry, vide notification issued on October 18, 2018, has exempted Battery Operated Vehicles, as well as vehicles driven on Methanol fuel or Ethanol fuel, from the requirement of permit for carrying passengers or goods.

A system has been developed and tested by this Ministry for linking of Pollution Under Control (PUC) data with the VAHAN database. An advisory dated October 1, 2018 has been issued to all the States by the Ministry wherein all the PUC vendors have been directed to comply with the guidelines and facilitate electronic uploading of emissions test data to VAHAN database.

To give a distinct identity to the electric vehicles, it has been decided that the registration mark will be exhibited on a number plate with Green background. A notification to this effect was issued on 7th August, 2018.

The Ministry issued a notification regarding the blending of Gasoline with methanol in order to reduce vehicle exhaust emissions and also to reduce the import burden on account of crudepetroleum fromwhichgasolineis produced.The Hon'ble Prime Minister had announced an ambitious target of reducing 10% import dependence of oil and gas by 2022 from 2014-15 levels. Methanol can be used as an alternative transportation fuel thereby reducing Import dependence to some extent.

The Ministry has requested IRDA and the MDs / Chairpersons of all general insurance companies on to ensure that no third-party insurance policy is issued or renewed without ascertaining the availability of a valid PUC. This has been done following orders of the Supreme Court of India.

The Ministry has notified emission standards for Construction Equipment Vehicles and Tractors. These standards would be implemented w.e.f. 1 October, 2020 (Trem IV) and from 1st April, 2024 [Bharat Stage (CEV/Trem)-V]. This would help in ensuring environment friendly construction / mining activities.

The Ministry notified the insertion of the item 'Quadricycle' as a 'non-transport' vehicle under the Motor Vehicles Act 1988. A Quadricycle is a vehicle of the size of a 3-wheeler but with 4tyres and fully covered like a car. It has an engine like that of a 3-wheeler. This makes it a cheap and safe mode of transport for last mile connectivity. Quadricycleswere only allowed for transport usage under the Act, but now has been made usable for non-transport also.

6.1 National Award on e-Governance to INAMPRO

The ""INAMPRO"" project initiated by NHIDCL, a CPSE under this Ministry, has been conferred with a 'Gold' award under Category- I ""Excellence in Government Process Re-engineering"" for the National Award in e-Governance by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances.

6.2 Electronic Toll Collection (ETC)

The Electronic Toll Collection Program has seen exponential growth in terms of number of Fastags sold and user fees collected electronically. With a total number of 440 Toll Plazas, more than 34.3 lakh Fastags units have been issued till October this year, and 25 to 27% of the revenues are being collected using the ETC mode. Use of FASTag has also seen significant growth, both in terms of user fees collected and penetration, from Rs 210.1 Cr with 13.1% penetration in April 2017 to Rs 44ó. 8 Cr with 24.8% penetration in the month of August 2018.

6.3 Linkage of PFMS with Bidder Information Management System (BIMS) and BhoomiRashi

The two IT initiatives of this Ministry, which are aimed at expediting pre- construction processes relating to bidding and land acquisition respectively, have now been integrated with the Public Financial management System (PFMS). The Bidder Information Management System (BIMS) is aimed at streamlining the process of pre-qualification of bidders for EPC Mode of contracts for National Highway workswithenhanced transparency and objectivity. The BhoomiRashiportal of Ministry of Road Transport & Highways allows for totally digital and paper-less processing of land acquisition cases, and has resulted in transparent, quick, corruption-free and error-free handling of land acquisition cases. It has alsomade the possible real-time tracking of activities and generation of reports relating to land acquisition. Revenue records of about 7 lakh villages across the country have been integrated in the portal. This digital change has drastically reduced the time taken for issuance of land acquisition notifications from 3-6 months to 1-2 weeks. Over 2000 notifications have already been issued by the Ministry in the first eight months of this financial year that while during the past two years, about a thousand land acquisition notifications could be issued every year. The process has also brought transparency in the system. Earlier the approved compensation amount used to be parked with the CALA (Competent Authority for Land Acquisition) but with BhoomiRashi portal this amount directly transferred into the account of the person concerned, through Public Financial Management System which is an integral part of the portal. In addition to this, the process is also environment friendly since there is no physical movement of files - all work is done digitally.

An advisory has been issued by this Ministry wherein the citizen can produce the transport related documents such as registration, insurance, fitness and permit, the driving licence, certificate for pollution under check and any other relevant documents, if required, in physical or electronic form, on demand by any police officer in uniform or any other officer authorized by the State Government in this behalf. This would enable the use of digital platforms for carrying and verification of the documents and is a step towards citizen facilitation and to ensure so that citizen are not harassed/ inconvenienced.

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways signed a MoU with Transport for London (TFL) on 10January, 2018. TFL is an agency that manages the transport system for Greater London, and has demonstrated its capability by creating strong and dependable public transport system in the city of London. It has created a unique system of operating buses in PPP model with over 17 operators under a single brand. The MoUis aimed at using the expertise of TFL to revamp the public transport architecture in the country.

After a long hiatus, the 2nd meeting of India-Nepal Cross Border Transport Facilitation Working Group was held at Kathmandu on 23rd February, 2018 under the India-Nepal Motor Vehicle Agreement for regulation of vehicular traffic between the two countries. It was agreed to start regular bus services on the new routes of Mahendrangar- Dehradun, Nepalgunj- Haridwar, Nepalgunj-Lucknow, Nepalgunj -Delhi and Kathmandu-Gorakhpur, through designated operators from Nepal and India. It was also agreed to start operation of bus services on Kathmandu -Siliguri and Janakpur- Patna routes. Both sides also noted with mutual interest the possibility of opening of other routes to be considered on the basis of commercial demand and availability of infrastructure by mutual consent.

Taking another step towards furthering seamless passenger vehicle movement across Bangladesh, Indiaand Nepal (BIN) under BBIN MVA signed in June 2015.Atrial run of two passenger buses from Dhaka, was conducted in April, 2018, with 43 passengers. The trial run started from Dhaka on 23rd April and reached Kathmandu on 26th April 2018. The participating countries have also agreed to conduct more trial runs for cargo vehicles under the agreement.

The first Working Group meeting of BIMSTEC to negotiate the draft text of Motor Vehicles Agreement for the regulation of passenger and cargo vehicular traffic among and between member states was held in April this year. Delegations from India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Thailand, Sri Lanka and Myanmar attended the meeting. The draft text of the agreement was discussed and amended. The member countries will further examine the amended text.

An MoU was signed between the Central Materials Laboratory (ML), Kampala, Uganda and the Indian Academy of Highway Engineers (IAHE) under Ministry of Road Transport &Highways, India, during the visit of the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India to Uganda on 24-25 July, 2018, for establishment of a Regional Materials Testing Laboratory for Highways in Uganda.

The 5th India-Japan Joint Working Group Meeting in the Roads and Road Transport Sector was held on 12th November, 2018 in New Delhi as provided under the Framework of Cooperation (FoC) between the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH), India and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT), Japan. In the meeting, information regarding the latest technological developments in ""Operation and Maintenance of Expressway"", ""Development of Mountainous Road in North East Regions"" and ""Countermeasure of Aging Structure"" etc. was shared.

The proposal for a MoU on Bilateral Cooperation in the Road Transport & Road Industry sector, between Ministry of road transport & Highways and the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, has been approved by the Union Cabinet in its meeting on October 3, 2018.

While the procurement process is under way for the development of Wayside Amenities of larger sizes in PPP mode along the National Highways, the NHAI has taken up construction of 314 numbers Highway Nest (mini). These are being developed near Toll Plazas, approximately 200 meters downstream on a 10mX20m paved platform and comprises of facilities like toilets, water, ATR, a small kiosk with Tea / Coffee vending machine and packaged food items for Highway users.

The SwachhtaPakhwada was organised by the Ministry between September 15, 2018 and October 2, across all National Highways. Several activities related to shramdaan and cleaning of schools in villages adjacent to the National Highways were also organized by the NHAI during the period. Construction of toilets, both for men and women, installation of litter-bins and hoardings at NHAI toll plazas have been taken up by the Ministry under Swachh Bharat Mission. The Ministry was conferred with a special award for its implementation of the Swachhta Action Plan for 2017-18 by the nodal Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation."

People have found astute ways of adapting to this new way of life. The 10th class annual examination results, declared on Saturday, have shown that proud dependence on schools is gone. That does not suggest that schools are no more needed for education but it definitely shows the way in difficult times.

South Kashmir, despite being the epicenter of all turmoil, has done extremely well outshining all other parts of the valley considered comparatively calm. Pulwama, the most volatile place, stands out with the highest pass percentage of 84.50 followed by equally turbulent districts of Shopian (83%), Kulgam (80.5%) and Anantnag with 78%.

Pulwama has remained shut under civilian protests and strike calls for 119 days in 2018 causing closure of all educational institutions as well. There had been 20 armed clashes between militants and government forces in the district over the period in which 35 militants were killed which prompted the street protests and strikes. Eighteen (18) civilians were also killed and around 200 others wounded during the period.

As many as 59 fresh recruits took to arms in the district.

To cap it all, the schools also remained shut for the first two months (59 days) of the year (January/February) for winter vacations. Add to it, 15 days of summer vacation, Sundays and government holidays, it could figure around 35 days more for which educational institutions have remained closed in the district.

The neighboring districts of Shopian, Kulgam and Anantnag which follow Pulwama in the performance too have remained equally disturbed and shut in 2018.

The schools just did not remain shut during the period but even witnessed raids and clashes as well. In July at Hawoora in Kulgam three persons were shot dead by army during a raid on the school in the village. Army fired on the crowd when they resisted attempts of arresting a boy from the school.

In many other cases school boys got killed in indiscriminate firing by armed forces. The savage killing of Numan Ashraf, a 10th class student of Balso village, at Kaprin on November 25 is a case in point. He was shot dead at a distance from the encounter site. Ashraf had appeared in the 10th class examination and was waiting for results. When the results were finally out on Saturday he was declared successful.

Four of the seven persons killed in the blast at encounter site in Kulgam on October 21 were also students. They were Mohammad Muqeem, a 12th class student, Uzair Ahmad in Class VI, who was barely 12 years old, Talib Maqbool Laway (19), a student at Kulgam Government College, and Irshad Ahmad (21), who had dropped out of the college some time back.

Six of the seven civilians killed by army at Sirno village outside Pulwama district headquarters onDecember 15 too were students. They were Abid Hussain Lone (MBA), Murtaza Bashir Class 7 student, Liyaqat Majeed Dar , a class 11 student, Owais Yousuf Najar (class 12th student) Mohammad Amir Pala (10th class dropout) and Suhail Rashid, a 10th class student.

These facts speak that Kashmiris have learnt the art of living not only with the death but excel too when death is around."

And the episodes within these shows are like mini-featurettes themselves, many of them serving as perfect storytelling devices or just brilliant standalone features. Take for example, Chapter One: Make Your Mark and Chapter Seven: Loud, Fast, and Keep Going of the HBO show Barry or the brilliantly trippy Teddy Perkins (from Atlanta, which won Emmys for single camera cinematography and sound editing, and was nominated for outstanding writing) -- so much has been said and/or written about the writing, direction, and cinematography of these episodes that even if you don't watch these shows, you've probably heard of or seen Donald Glover as the character Teddy Perkins, in all his ""white face"" surrealism.

My list doesn't include episodes from either Barry or Atlanta. Neither does it include any from certain well-received shows like GLOW or Pose, neither of which I unfortunately watched. Which is why, this is an entirely subjective list of the best episodes of 2018 -- picked from the shows that I watched and most enjoyed. You may not agree with them all, but here goes!

Maniac was a strange, delightful show -- it had all the oddball weirdness of Fargo (the movie or TV series, or any other Coen brothers movie, for that matter) along with the slightly off-centre, difficult-to-place hippy trippy vibe of Legion. But then it also had two bonafide movie stars in Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, which I'm tempted to believe, made the show runners want to experiment even more with the show's cinematography, visuals, and narration.

While Maniac had quite a few enjoyable moments and episodes (both Exactly Like You and The Lake of the Clouds had interesting and quirky dream sequences, and Option C was a verifiably smooth finale), my favourite episode of the entire series was episode 4: Furs by Sebastian. In what is Annie and Owen's first shared fantasy, Stone and Hill play Lin and Bruce -- a working class Long Island married couple trying to track down Wendy the lemur, as a whole lot of crazy goes down around them. It's difficult to pinpoint what's the best thing about this episode (the hair, the outfits, the accents, the way everything ties back together in the end), so I'll just say it was the lemur.

You'll be forgiven for not loving The Alienist. For those not immersed in behavioural/criminal psychology and true crime, the show may have seemed a bit meandering and muddled. Set in a time long before criminal profiling was a thing, The Alienist sputters, albeit eloquently, its way through what was then a very inefficient investigative process, before episode 5 -- Hildebrandt's Starling -- amps up the suspense and mystery in the investigation. Daniel Bruhl's psychologist/alienist character Dr Laszlo Kreizler learns that the man they suspected to be the killer, isn't actually the killer after all, leading the investigation (and investigators) to turn inward and revisit their assumptions. It's the turning point that makes a mystery even more delicious!

If you aren't watching the 2017 DuckTales reboot, you're probably doing a few things wrong in life. The David Tennant starrer (he voices Scrooge) is such a ridiculously good reboot that you might just forget that DuckTales is associated with your childhood Sundays, watching the cartoons in your pajamas. No, I'm kidding, DuckTales will always be about our childhoods, but this version brings a slightly (just very slightly) darker twist to the overall story arc, making it a bit more appropriate for 30-somethings to binge-watch, without making it seem like we're malfunctioning adults clinging to the rose-tinted nostalgia for the '90s.

In what was a stellar first season (followed by an equally promising quarter of the second season), episode 11, Beware the B.U.D.D.Y. System!, does something very few shows/movies can do effortlessly -- it packs an interesting episodic story into a superhero origin tale, making it pretty much the perfect episode. A sweet storyline about Launchpad finally getting his driver's license and wanting to show it to Scrooge meets the action-packed antagonism in the form of tech CEO Mark Beaks and his self driving car meets bumbling intern Fenton Crackshell-Cabrera's debut as the cybernetic suit-wearing robotic superhero 'Gizmoduck' (voiced by little known genius Lin-Manuel Miranda!) -- if I can just bottle the essence and charm of this episode, and spray it on every day, maybe I'll be eternally happy?

All six episodes of the first season of Derry Girls had the typically irreverent humour and madness of a British sitcom, but episode three stands out as the perfect mix of teenage silliness, familial nonsense, and the frailty of religion even for those who are apparently deeply committed to it. In this episode, our ragtag group of friends in late-90s Ireland see a dog that looks a lot like one of the girls' pet, who's supposed to be dead and buried in her back garden, according to her mother. The group follows this dog into a church and what ensues is a hilariously concocted tale of smirking and weeping statues, possibly resurrected dogs, a hot young local priest who everyone is attracted to, and a desperate attempt by the teenagers to sit out their exams. Add to the mix the awesomely anarchistic Sister Michael (who looks like an eye-roll emoji in human form) and you have an episode that has you LOLing throughout.

Westworld's second season was, erm, interesting. As the show started expanding on months-old fan theories, many viewers were disappointed that the show felt less like a vivid narrative storytelling attempt and more like confused exposition. Episodes like Riddle of the Sphinx (with flashbacks about the attempts to create human consciousness in a host body to achieve immortality) and Akane no Mai (set in the Shogun-themed park) were great, but a lasting image of Akecheta of the Ghost Nation narrating the story of his life is what really stood out through the season. Episode 8 -- Kiksuya, meaning ""Remember"" -- was a terrific episode about Akecheta's love that never was, and his attempt to find The Door.

Brilliantly acted by Zahn McClarnon as Akecheta (he'd also played Hanzee Dent on the second season of Fargo), Kiksuya was so much more than just the customary philosophical detour on Westworld -- it was a heart-wrenching episode about love, longing, and the truth, and it elevated the show unlike any other episode before it had.

Sharp Objects was, quite possibly, 2018's most unpleasant and uncomfortable series to watch. And I'm not even referring to the creepy ending (spoiler alert ahead, for those who, for some reason, haven't watched the series yet, or read the book) where we find out the teenage Amma was the cold-blooded killer, who'd built a dollhouse floor with the teeth of her victims, to mimic her mother's ivory floors (cringe!). Unlike most viewers, I didn't think Amma was very angelic or sweet, so the idea of her as the killer wasn't as shocking to me. But the slow reveal of the damage done to her by living in that god-forsaken house with her mother Adora -- that was creepy and unsettling. And Falling, the penultimate episode of the series -- does a great job of really digging into the claustrophobia and heaviness of a life lived under the exacting eye of a mother suffering from Munchausen syndrome by proxy, and who's trying to slowly kill you with rat poison!

Falling is also where Amy Adams' character Camille Preaker fully realises the depth and true nature of her mother's glossed-over-by-everyone-in-the-town homicidal tendencies. Eeks!

Big Mouth is a deliriously bold show about puberty and sexuality in all its icky crazy glory, and the teen angst that accompanies it. The second season of the show was solid, as it built on the storylines of season one and also expanded the narrative around some of the interesting recurring characters. Having dealt with issues of consent and drug-use, the show's big bold move this season was the standout episode 5 -- The Planned Parenthood Show.

Part sketch comedy, part instructional comedy, part effective after-school special, The Planned Parenthood Show was a clever look into all the services that Planned Parenthood provides, besides the commonly-assumed abortions. It begins with Coach Steve's (who's recently lost his virginity) sex-ed class, and the discussion among the students ranges from a Star Trek-like space adventure sketch in the year 2126, to help women in need of pap smears to a Bachelor-like show where one of the student's older sister Leah must choose the type of contraception that's right for her. In 2018, with all the debate surrounding women's bodies and their rights, this episode was a brilliant way to inform. And it starred Nathan Fillion, so there's that too!

A classic example of a self-contained episode that also furthers the story, Chapter VIII was essentially a two-person feature that involved Gabe ""interviewing"" Sam for his documentary Am I Racist? (a documentary which he has to do for his 'Documentary in the Age of Youtube' class, which is the most 2018 thing ever!). It cleverly dissects both white privilege and the white saviour complex, as well as Gabe and Sam's relationship, which is on the rocks by now, and not in the way a glass of well-preserved Scotch should be.

In a deftly written and constructed episode, Sam accuses Gabe of exploiting and friends and her, and also calls BS on her message being more palatable when coming from someone who looks like Gabe (i.e. a white man). ""You're Elvis, and I'm Chuck Berry. One deserved to be the biggest star in the world, and the other one got to be"", she tells him. Ouch!

12. The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story

Episode 4: House by the Lake

As a series based on real life events, The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story feels like a docudrama with brilliant casting, excellent acting, and a gripping, gritty narrative. The series has a lot at stake -- from staying true to the way the events surrounding Versace's death unfolded to tackling issues such as homophobia and HIV, among others.

On the heels of the sombre episode 3 -- A Random Killing (which portrayed serial killer Andrew Cunanan, played with uncanny perfection in a career-defining role by Darren Criss, torturing and killing Lee Miglin, a big-shot Chicago real estate developer who'd invited gay escort Cunanan over to his house in his wife's absence) -- comes the episode House by the Lake. This genuinely terrifying and sad episode delves into Cunanan's first murder -- his cold blooded, premeditated murder of his acquaintance Jeff Trail, a former US Navy lieutenant, in the loft apartment of his former lover David Madson. House by the Lake focuses on Trail's murder, Cunanan's decision to flee to Mexico with a forcibly complicit Madson, and his subsequent murder of Madson when he confronts Cunanan about his many spiralling lies. Because the series switches back and forth, we later learn in a subsequent episode that Cunanan might have really loved Madson in some way, which makes his killing of Madson unbearably sad. Also gut-wrenching is the fact that both Trail and Madson (played beautifully by the ridiculously good looking Finn Wittrock and the young-Andrew-McCarthy-lookalike Cody Fern, respectively) were nice, young men -- who were dealing with their own insecurities at that time, about their professional abilities and their identities as young gay men. It's one of those sad, beautiful episodes -- made worse in its sadness and beauty because it's all true.

Sam Esmail revels in his auteurship, especially in this episode of Homecoming. Optics, the third episode in the series, comes at the perfect time for the viewing audience -- young military vet Walter's been at the Homecoming facility, attending his sessions with caseworker Heidi Bergman, acting all nice and trusting for way too long. There has to be something more sinister going on at the facility...we feel it, how is it that he doesn't? And right on time, his fellow vet and friend Shrier convinces him to steal a van and break out of the facility to explore what's around -- how do they even know they're in Florida? Because of the palm trees? They drive around (in circles?) and when they reach an eerily deserted part of downtown, they're spooked. We're spooked too. For some reason though, Walter and his friend buy the explanation that it's a retirement community. We the discerning audience, don't. But then again, our memories aren't being altered/erased, and isn't that what's happening with everyone at the facility? Including Julia Roberts' character Heidi the caseworker.

Optics did a great job of showing us just how clueless we often are in life -- Walter's faith in the facility and the government, his trust in Heidi, her own confused willingness to move forward with her life -- and how important our instincts usually are. Even Thomas Carrasco, the DoD bureaucrat who's investigating the facility, is clueless about the broader jigsaw surrounding the Homecoming Transitional Support Centre, and that makes it even more exciting when he persists in his investigation and is rewarded with a big fat sitting duck of a clue!

As a huge fan of Amy Sherman-Palladino's writing and of the deliciously witty first season of The Marvelous Mrs Maisel, I must say I was quite disappointed with season two. What started out as the Weissman-Maisel clan's fun and stylish sojourn to Paris and continued through the middle of the season in the form of an extremely quirky summer trip to the Catskills, soon turned a bit sour and ended with a whimper as Sherman-Palladino returned to one of her favourite tropes -- where the female lead returns to her ex, because, women. Eyeroll. It's a trope that was used very often on the Gilmore Girls -- it wasn't believable when Lorelai showed up at Christopher's house when things went south between her and Luke at the end of season 6, it wasn't believable or flattering when Rory slept with a married Dean as if she had first dibs on him at the end of season 4, it certainly wasn't flattering (or even necessary) when Rory kept up her affair with an engaged Logan in the Gilmore Girls Netflix revival, and ugh it wasn't remotely believable, flattering or necessary when Midge went to her weasel of a husband Joel seeking comfort in what was meant to be a cliffhanger of the second season, while she's almost engaged to a tall Jewish chunk-of-hunk doctor who loves her, and who looks like Zachary Levi btw.

Anyway, rant over. Despite the evident flaws in the narrative, Sherman-Palladino certainly knows how to write a compellingly witty episode, and episode 5 -- Midnight at the Concord -- is a great example of that. There's a lot going on -- the families have all gathered at a resort in the Catskills, bringing a whole lot of Jewish weirdness to the fore. Susie is pretending to work at the resort (she just shows up there and walks around with a plunger in her hands, so everyone naturally assumes she's part of the plumbing crew!). Midge rushes to NY to work a shift at the department store, and she begins dating Benjamin; she even tells him about her stand-up gig, which he's totally impressed and on board with. Things seem to be going well for her until she goes back to the Catskills to perform at a club...where her father shows up in the audience! Abe Weissman is a quirk of the highest order (I mean, he's played by Tony Shalhoub) but he's also a proud man, and seeing his flustered daughter on stage spouting really dirty (and apparently funny, but not to him) things in front of strangers, bewilders him. Some of that pride is also hurt because he realises there's a huge part of his kids' lives that he knows nothing about. This episode finally brings this long-withheld confrontation before us, and does so in classic Sherman-Palladino style -- with wit and grace.

Castle Rock was a thrilling watch for fans of Stephen King, but for those unacquainted with the master of horror and suspense and his world building, this 10-episode anthology series served as a perfect introduction to the dark grey morally questionable world that King creates.

Episode 7 -- The Queen -- worked as a standalone episode that also furthered the narrative arc of the season. Ruth (Sissy Spacek in a pitch perfect role as a mother suffering from Alzheimer's) navigates through shifting timelines to try and stop the killer (The Kid) who has entered her home. As a viewer, you can sense her confusion about what's really happening in the present, but it's fascinating to watch her survival instincts (the use of the chess pieces to re-orient herself, sending her grandson Wendell away to protect him etc.) work so sharply despite her dementia, only to result in a heartbreaking accident in the end. The Queen was a beautifully shot, acted, and written episode...and it set the stage for the breakthrough episode of the series in Henry Deaver.

The Good Place is a show that keeps pleasantly surprising us in the ways it presents some of life's most complicated philosophical and moral dilemmas, and after the brilliant Trolley Problem episode of season 2, I'm never quite sure what wonderful thing Michael Schur will come up with next.

The answer is episode 10 of the third season -- Janet(s). After sucking herself, Michael, and the earthlings into a void, resulting in all the humans taking on Janet's appearance, we have multiple Janets, each with the personality of the human it has taken on the appearance of. And boy, does actress D'Arcy Carden (who has played Janet with such flair, it's uncanny really) step up to the task at hand! There's also a visit to Accounting (where we learn that nobody has been admitted to the Good Place in 521 years!), an existential crisis barely avoided, and a tender moment in the ongoing love story of Eleanor and Chidi. This episode was as irreverent as you'd expect The Good Place to be, but it's all the more striking with how utterly creative and hopeful it is.

If there was a list of the most cinnamon-roll-y sweet, sunshine-y bright, and genuinely nice episodes of 2018, all 16 episodes of Queer Eye and the special would be on that list. The show is so completely entertaining and feel-good that we sometimes forget how useful and informative some of the conversations are. Tan, Jonathan, Antoni, Karamo, and Bobby are the dream cast, and their interactions with their subjects and their extended families/friend circles have been thoroughly insightful. Remember Karamo's conversation with former Marine and NASCAR fan Cory, about police brutality, good cops, and civilians (especially black folks)? Or Bobby's interactions with anyone religious?

Episode 5 of the second season -- Sky's the Limit -- about Skylar, a trans man recovering from his top surgery, was reflective of how truly open to learning and understanding the core cast members are. Tan asked genuine, honest questions to Skylar, about what it's like to be trans, and it provided great commentary on how truly different every queer experience is, and how we shouldn't make the foolish mistake of clubbing them all together.

A lot has been said about Killing Eve: how it's unlike any show we've seen before, with characters unlike any that have been written before etc. The many nominations for Sandra Oh (who plays Eve Polastri, an MI5 officer obsessed with an assassin) and the accolades for both her and Jodie Comer (who plays said psychopathic assassin Villanelle) have certainly been justified. The first two episodes present to us the quirky and stylish world of Killing Eve -- where people are killed, sure, but they're all probably deserving of it anyway. Besides, Villanelle kills her victims with a bespoke bottle of poisoned perfume or a beautiful bejewelled hair accessory; the setting is some or the other beautiful part of (mostly) Europe; and the oddball tendencies of both the officer and the assassin are almost, well, charming.

Just as we're beginning to get comfortable with this set-up, Don't I Know You cuts through our complacency like a sushi chef cutting through a plump piece of fish. Our (slightly nervous) laughs stop by the end of the episode, as Villanelle repeatedly stabs Eve's partner and mentor Bill (David Haig) in a crowded nightclub, thereby immediately raising the stakes in this game, and letting us know that behind the quirky, stylish facade is the mind of a psychopathic killer.

""Isn't your leader the free sex guru?"" ""Free sex? We don't charge for it, if you mean that."" Such moments of levity are somewhat rare coming from Ma Anand Sheela -- the complex, can't-quite-place-her, is-she-a-victim-or-the-perpetrator second in command to Bhagwan ""Osho"" Rajneesh in Netflix's award-winning documentary series Wild Wild Country.

A provocative, no-nonsense spokeswoman and leader, Sheela's rise to the top and her eventual fall is well-documented in the six-part series, but it's Part 3 when we begin to realise the true extent of her power, and it's scary AF! Going fearlessly against the local people in Antelope, Oregon, Ma Sheela enlists thousands of homeless people to build their ranks in an upcoming local election. The politics within and outside the cult are fascinating to watch, and it's even more intriguing to watch this seemingly harmless woman come up with some rather diabolical plans to maintain her position -- within the cult and beside her beloved Rajneesh.

The fourth season of Star Wars Rebels was a terrific one -- facing off against the most menacing antagonist in the Star Wars universe, Grand Admiral Thrawn with his Imperial war machine, the Rebels (Ezra, Kanan, Hera, Sabine, Zeb, and Chopper) travel from Mandalore to Lothal, where it all began. The Sith is trying to exterminate the Jedi forever, and in their biggest casualty of the war against the Empire, in episode 10 Jedi Night, Kanan perishes while saving the lives of Hera and his friends.

Episode 13 -- A World Between Worlds -- in some way, brings closure to a lot of things. Caught in a void between time and space, Ezra (who hasn't quite mourned Kanan's death) is led to another portal which brings him to Ahsoka's season two finale battle against Darth Vader; this time, he manages to pull her into the void and saves her. He wants to do the same to Kanan, but in a heartbreaking moment, he realizes he can't/ought not to because otherwise, he and the others would perish. Kanan losing his eyesight in that season two finale was shocking for a kid-friendly animated series, but his subsequent death, Ezra and Hera's mourning of it, the way this episode brings back Ahsoka, and the arc forward from here on, makes A World Between Worlds one of the absolute best episodes of television not just of 2018, but possibly all time!

We finally see the Ring, and what a stunning sight it is! Holden and Naomi reconcile, Amos and Prax keep their bromance going, Bobbie and Alex bond -- all this while deadly protomolecule hybrids are gearing towards Mars and survival is the only thing on everyone's minds! Well, that, and some making out!

In a great season overall, Immolation was the episode that triggered a turning point for a lot of core loyalties and friendships. I'm so glad Amazon scooped up The Expanse for another season because it would've been a shame to miss out on more of this kickass group doing more kickass things in outer space.

I'm so so glad that START is how The Americans ended -- too many incredible shows have said goodbye with utter disappointments (looking at you, Dexter!). In what was arguably the best series finale ever, START capped off six seasons of slow-burn brilliance into an episode that had it all -- anxiety and nervousness about the spy game, Cold War era politics, the fast-beating heart of a family thrust into motion in anticipated-yet-unexpected ways, the cold gut-wrenching and ultimately futile reward of the FBI neighbour and friend confronting the illegals, the heart-stopping escape...and, well, unflattering 1980s wigs.

A lot happens in START -- from Elizabeth and Philip Jennings (as always, a top-notch Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys) preparing to leave for the USSR with their daughter Paige, but leaving their son Henry (who doesn't know the truth about them being spies) behind, to Stan's worst fears about his friends coming true, to the ultimate rush of escape (in disguise, of course!)...only for the older Jennings to realise that Paige had gotten off the train in order to stay behind. For a show that wasn't about cliffhangers at the end of each episode, the twists in START are very edge-of-the-seat and thrilling. The episode was also a masterclass in restrained storytelling, direction, and acting, which is something that can also be said about The Americans on the whole. Bring on the awards please!

It's almost as if someone said to BoJack Horseman series creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg that it would be impossible to improve upon the brilliance of the season 3 episode Fish out of Water, to which he said ""hold my drink"", went to his office and came back with the genre-defying genius of season 5's Free Churro.

BoJack's mother is dead, and abusive or not, he's still tasked with rendering a eulogy for his dead parent. In a 20-minute continuous scene, BoJack (and the audience) grapples with the dark reality of life with an abusive parent and how shockingly inconsequential it feels in the face of death. ""She was really good at dispensing life lessons that always seemed to come back around to everything being my fault"" -- through his words, we experience his pain, anger, disbelief, despair, and the realisation that what he thought of as a loving moment between him and his mom was actually just like their relationship -- empty and meaningless. Except for the free churro he gets because the girl at the counter at Jack in the Box felt sad for him when he told her he was feeling shitty because of his mother's death. So yes, ""No one ever tells you when your mom dies, you get a free churro."" Of course, in true BoJack fashion, it turns out that he's at the wrong funeral the entire time, speaking at a lizard's funeral instead of Beatrice's. Curtain!"

The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) will take over security of the highly sensitive Srinagar Airport. At present, the CRPF handles security here. The move comes after a proposal to handover security of all three airports in the state -- Srinagar, Jammu and Leh -- to the CISF was cleared by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) last month. As a first step, the CISF has conducted the first man-power survey at the Srinagar airport. According to officials, the agency would be initially taking charge of anti-hijacking operations.

GPS-enabled buses in Srinagar soon

The State Road Transport corporation (SRTC) will soon kick off the use of Global Positioning System (GPS) -fitted buses to ferry tourists in the state. An official said the state government is procuring GPS-enabled buses. ""It is also supporting purchases by private transporters for easing mobility and traffic congestion in the Srinagar,"" he said.

While the new buses would be added to the SRTC fleet, the private transport companies plying services in the city would be provided certain incentives for purchasing such vehicles. The move is aimed at providing better and hassle-free transport services to tourists i. The new fleet would have a two-fold monitoring system. One GPS control room would be established at SRTC while the second one would be set up at Traffic Headquarters to monitor.

Brick kiln owners asked to switch to green-tech

In order to protect the environment, the Governor Administration in Jammu and Kashmir has asked brick kiln owners of the state to switch over to eco-friendly Zig Zag technology. In zigzag kilns, bricks are arranged to allow hot air to travel in a zigzag path.

The length of the zigzag air path is about three times that of a straight line, and this improves the heat transfer from the flue gases to the bricks, making the entire operation more efficient. It ensures uniform distribution of heat, helps reduces coal consumption to about 20 per cent and also reduces emissions considerably.

School fee charged in winter months

Private schools in Kashmir charge tuition and bus fees for nearly three winter months during which the schools remain closed. By 15th of December, every school in the Valley announces winter vacations till March. However, despite closing schools, authorities charge the tuition and bus fare from the parents of the students and most of the schools force the parents to pay the winter fee in a single go before closure of schools for winter months. People have been appealing the Director School Education Kashmir to act against the schools, who are forcing parents to pay."

Sandalwood has produced over 200 movies in 2018. Like every year, the success rate is less, but the industry should be happy to see that genuine attempts are being appreciated by the audience and our content is slowly crossing the borders. The industry is gaining some foothold in the US market and a few overseas countries, while KGF has got good recognition to the industry across the globe.

Among 200 odd movies, there are handful of movies which every cine-goer should watch not just to enjoy the film, but to get an idead about the progress Sandalwood has made in the recent years. Here, we have come up with the list of top 10 movies which the audience should not miss:

Gultoo: A new-age movie that deals with data theft and exposes the way our data is being mined for money. It tries to showcase how our every single moment is recorded and has a price on the internet. In short, the movie shows how technology can bring misery to our lives but doesn't take a stand whether tech is good or bad.

Katheyondu Shuruvagide: Senna Hegde's film came as a fresh breath of air. Packed with slice-of-the-life moments, the Diganth-starrer has a simple, yet a beautiful storyline.

Aa Karaala Ratri: Greed is destructive and it destroys everything. This is the underlining message of Dayal Padmanabhan's Aa Karaala Ratri, which starred JK aka Jayaram Karthik and Anupama Gowda. The film tells how money can make a good man an evil and lure him to do a crime.

KGF: Chapter 1: Yash and Prashanth Neel's KGF has turned out to be Sandalwood's pride. The movie is dubbed into Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Hindi and Malayalam languages and has become the talk of the nation. It is a period drama which tells the story of an ambitious man, who wants to become a rich and powerful person.

Sarkari Hiriya Prathamika Shale, Kasaragod: Rishab Shetty's third directorial movie Sarkari Hiriya Prathamika Shale - Kasaragod (SHPSK) is a children's film, which portrays students struggle to save a government Kannada school from closure. The movie is centred around this issue and story is told with humour.

Ammachi Yemba Nenapu: Champa P Shetty's Ammachi Yemba Nenapu is about the patriarchal society where the men wield complete authority on women's lives. The movie has Raj B Shetty, Vyjayanti Adiga, Dr Radhakrishna Ural, Diya Palakkal and Deepika P Aradhya on lead roles, is based on Dr Vaidehi's short stories.

Churikatte: A crime story set in Malnad, it is about an aspiring cop trying to take on the timber mafia. The smart writing with strong performances from the cast makes it a must-watch film.

Tagaru: Duniya Soori's Tagaru, which had Shivaraj Kumar and Dhananjay in the leads, is a bloody battle between a daring cop and a ruthless rowdy. The non-linear narration, performance and songs struck the chord with viewers.

Raambo 2: Sharan's movies are mainly watched to get some good laughs and Raambo 2 successfully lives up to the viewers' expectations. But the movie has more to offer as it comes with a good message to the society.

The Villain: It is the first union (in full-fledged roles) of Sandalwood's heavy-weights Sudeep and Shivaraj Kumar. Kiccha's colourful avatars and acting, also the way Shivanna underplayed his role deserves huge applause. The story, though stretched to some extent, had enough twists and turns to keep the audience hooked."

The act requires covered employers to provide paid sick leave to many of their Michigan-based employees. Below are answers to frequently asked questions about the new law.

A: Persons, firms, businesses, educational institutions, nonprofit agencies, corporations, limited liability companies, government entities, and other entities that employ 50 or more individuals are covered employers. The act does not apply to the United States government, other states, or political subdivisions of other states.

Q: Which workers are eligible to use paid sick leave under the act?

A: The act defines an eligible employee as ""an individual engaged in service to an employer in the business of the employer from whom an employer is required to withhold for federal income tax purposes."" As a practical matter, this excludes independent contractors from eligibility under the act.

Q: Are there any employees who are not eligible to take leave under the act?

A: The act has 12 specific exemptions. Employees within any of these exemptions are not eligible for paid medical leave. These exemptions include (1) employees exempt from statutory overtime under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) because they are employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, or in the capacity of an outside salesman as defined by the FLSA; (2) employees in the private sector who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that is in effect; (3) part-time workers (those ""who worked, on average, fewer than 25 hours a week during the immediately preceding calendar year""); and (4) seasonal workers (those employed for ""25 weeks or fewer in a calendar year for a job scheduled for 25 weeks or fewer"").

Q: When may an eligible employee start to accrue paid medical leave under the act?

A: ""Paid medical leave . . . shall begin to accrue on the effective date of the act, or upon commencement of the employee's employment, whichever is later.""

Q: When may an eligible employee start to use paid medical leave under the act?

A: ""An employee may use accrued paid medical leave as it is accrued, except that an employer may require an employee to wait until the ninetieth calendar day after commencing employment before using accrued paid medical leave.""

Q: How does paid medical leave accrue?

A: Employees will accrue paid medical leave at a rate of one hour for every 35 hours actually worked. However, employees cannot accrue more than one hour in a calendar week or more than 40 hours per benefit year. The act defines a benefit year as any 12-month period used by an employer to calculate an eligible employee's benefits. Hours worked does not include hours taken off work by an eligible employee for paid leave, including paid vacation days, paid personal days, and paid time off, unless the employer voluntarily chooses to include nonworking time in the accrual.

Q: Can employees carry over unused paid sick days?

A: Employees can carry over up to 40 hours of unused accrued paid medical leave from one benefit year to another benefit year, but employees may not use more than 40 hours in a single benefit year.

Q: Can employers provide the total amount of paid sick days all at once?

A: Yes. An employer may provide at least 40 hours of paid medical leave at the beginning of the benefit year or on the date the individual becomes eligible during the benefit year on a prorated basis. If an employer adopts this approach, it does not have to permit employees to carry over unused leave to the next benefit year.

Q: How much are employees paid for their accrued paid medical leave?

A: Accrued leave is paid at the employee's normal hourly rate of pay or base wage. Calculation of the normal hourly rate of pay does not include overtime pay, holiday pay, bonuses, commissions, supplemental pay, piece-rate pay, or gratuities.

Q: Must an employer provide additional paid medical leave if it already provides paid leave to employees?

A: There is a rebuttable presumption that an employer is in compliance with the Paid Medical Leave Act if the employer provides at least 40 hours of paid leave to an eligible employee each benefit year, including paid vacation days, paid personal days, and other paid time off. What type of information would rebut this presumption is yet to be determined.

Q: For what purposes may an employee use paid medical leave?

A: Employees may take paid medical leave for the physical or mental illness, injury, or health condition of the employee or his or her family member; medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of the employee or employee's family member; or preventative care of the employee or his or her family member. Employees may also take paid leave if the employee or his or her family member is the victim of domestic violence or sexual assault; for the closure of the employee's place of business by order of a public official; to care for a child whose school or place of care has been closed by order of a public official; or because of the employee or his or her family member's exposure to a communicable disease that would jeopardize the health of others.

Q: Under what circumstances may an employee take paid leave in connection with domestic violence or sexual assault?

A: An employee can take leave for medical care or psychological or other counseling, to receive services from a victim services organization, to relocate, to obtain legal services, or to participate in any civil or criminal proceedings related to or resulting from the domestic violence or sexual assault.

Q: Who is part of the employee's ""family""?

A: ""Family member,"" as defined under the act, includes ""a biological, adopted or foster child, stepchild or legal ward, or a child to whom the employee stands in loco parentis""; a biological parent, foster parent, stepparent, adoptive parent, or legal guardian of an employee; a spouse; or a person who stood in loco parentis when the employee was a minor child. Family members also include grandparents; grandchildren; biological, foster, and adopted siblings; and any person to whom the employee is legally married under the laws of any state.

Q: Do employees have a right to be paid out for unused, accrued paid medical leave upon their termination, resignation, retirement, or other separation of employment?

A: No. Employees need not be paid out at separation.

Q: What is the smallest increment of time in which an employee must use accrued paid medical leave?

A: Paid medical leave must be used in one-hour increments, unless the employer has a different increment policy and the policy is in writing in an employee handbook or other employee benefit document. For example, if an employer allows employees to take leave in 10-minute increments under its existing written policy, then paid leave under the act can also be taken in 10-minute increments.

Q: What notice must an employee provide when requesting use of paid medical leave?

A: Employees must follow the employer's usual and customary notice, procedural, and documentation requirements for requesting leave, but the employee must be afforded at least three days to provide documentation.

Q: What recourse do employers have if an employee does not provide sufficient notice?

A: Employees may be denied leave and may be subject to discipline and discharge for failing to follow notice, procedural, and documentation requirements. However, employees may have protections under other laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Family and Medical Leave Act that employers cannot ignore.

Q: Who may sign medical documentation on behalf of an employee or an employee's family member?

A: ""[A] doctor of medicine or osteopathy who is authorized to practice medicine or surgery (as appropriate) . . . or any other person determined by the Secretary [of Labor] to be capable of providing healthcare services"" (as defined under the FMLA), including podiatrists, dentists, clinical psychologists, optometrists, chiropractors, nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, clinical social workers, and physicians assistants -- may provide medical documentation.

Q: What forms of documentation may an employee provide where paid medical leave is taken because of domestic violence or sexual assault?

A: A police report, a signed statement from a victim or witness advocate, or court documentation indicating involvement in domestic violence or sexual assault is satisfactory documentation.

Q: Are there any limits on the type of information an employer may require from the employee?

A: Employers may not require the documentation to disclose the details of the medical condition, domestic violence, or sexual assault as a condition of providing paid medical leave.

Q: Do employers have any duty to maintain the confidentiality of the information provided by the employee?

A: Yes. Employers must keep health information, as well as information about domestic violence and sexual assault (about an employee or his or her family member), confidential and cannot disclose the information to others without the employee's permission.

Q: What, if any, recordkeeping obligations do employers have under the act?

A: Employers shall retain, for not less than one year, records documenting the hours worked and paid medical leave taken by employees.

Q: What, if any, posting obligations do employers have under the act?

A: Employers must display conspicuously at their places of business a poster that contains the amount of paid medical leave required to be provided, the terms under which paid medical leave may be used, the employees' right to file a complaint with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA) for any violation of the act.

Q: What recourse does an employee have if his or her employer violates the act?

A: Employees may file a claim with LARA within six months of the alleged violation.

Q: What can LARA do if it discovers violations of the act?

A: LARA may recover payment of the improperly withheld paid medical leave and may impose civil fines of not more than $1,000. LARA may also impose civil fines of not more than $100 for each willful violation of an employer's posting obligations.

Q: Is there any possibility that the obligations under the Paid Medical Leave Act may change in the future?

A: Outside interest groups are likely to continue to support future ballot initiatives related to paid medical leave, perhaps in 2020. Also, the Michigan legislature could seek to amend the act in the future. There could even be a constitutional challenge in court.

Q: What should employers be doing now to prepare for compliance with the Paid Medical Leave Act?

A: Once employers have determined that they are a covered employer and that they do or will employ individuals eligible for paid sick leave, they will want to adopt or revise their existing paid time off policies. Employers that operate in other states and municipalities with paid leave laws or ordinances may have a number of different obligations.

The focal theme of the Experience at the India International Centre at the capital this year was the Northeast. It was a three day extravaganza of exposure to the arts, music and dance performances, exhibitions and above all, literature. In a way, as Dr Karan Singh pointed out, it was bringing a glimpse of the rich diversity of a region of which we still do not know much. Participating in a panel discussion among writers from the region, I was asked by one of the speakers about whether I missed Shillong. The question took me back to the four years or so that I spent in the mid-1970s teaching at the North Eastern Hill University. The central university had been set up by an act of Parliament to make higher education in a variety of subjects available to students from the region and recruitment to the faculty was on an all India basis. Its first vice chancellor was Chandran Devanesen, the former principal of the Madras Christian College in Chennai. Devanesen was a well meaning and democratic soul full of love and compassion for the region in which he worked and hoped the university would fulfil the aspirations of the people.

The setting up of the university in Shillong was a crucial decision. Initially, it was hoped the university would be federal in character and not only serve the students of Shillong and Meghalaya but also the adjacent states of Mizoram and Nagaland and in time also the state of Arunachal Pradesh too where college students were affiliated to Punjab University. A few students from Assam too sought enrolment in the new university.

Shillong was a cosmopolitan town. Capital of the composite state of Assam till 1972 when the hill state of Meghalaya came into being, it was a cultural melting pot playing host to a diversity of ethnicities, both tribal and non-tribal. Apart from the native Khasis, Jaintias and Garos, it had Mizos, Nagas, Arunachalis but also significant non-tribal communities like Bengalis, Assamese, Nepalis etc. Many of them had been living and working in Shillong for long.

Shillong provided the best educational and job opportunities in the entire Northeast with some of the best schools and colleges with an excellent medium of instruction in English. There was also a strong central presence in Shillong in the form of all the Surveys which had their offices here, the Anthropological, Zoological, and Geological. It had a military presence too in the form of the Assam Rifles, the BSF and the CRP along with the headquarters of the Eastern Air Command of the Air Force and the Army 101 Area. But Shillong never became a ""garrison state"" like Kohima or Aizawl where you had the Assam Rifles or other para military organizations breathing down your necks every 100 m or so.

I enjoyed the years I spent in Shillong marked initially by communal harmony and amity and of friendships and relationships forged through mutual respect and understanding. The book Shillong Times by Nilanjan P. Choudhury speaks about friendships amid turbulent times.

Choudhury had spent his ""growing up"" years in Shillong, his schooling and possibly some college as well. The protagonist is Debu Datta a young Bengali boy who while returning home from school is set upon by some Khasi boys who called him ""Dkhar"" (foreigner or outsider). A visibly frightened Debu returns home to learn from parents that the Bengalis and other ethnic minority communities are a beleaguered lot as ethnic violence sprang up sporadically ever since the great riots of 1979. I was in Shillong that year and can say that while violence did take place and curfew had to be imposed, it was politically instigated and was nothing that the law and order agencies could not control. The situation was very similar to what happened to the Sikhs in Delhi in 1984 and or what happened in Gujarat in 2002.

Minorities tend to live in distinct ethnic clusters and Shillong was no exception. Bengalis for the most part lived in Laban, Kench's Trace and Laitumukrah, the Nepalis in Jwalapara , the Marwari businessmen in Jail Road and so on. Debu's family lived in Upper Jail Road and his father had a pharmaceutical shop in Iewheh, the Khasi name for Bara Bazar. Debu's father had been born and brought up in Shillong ever since Debu's grandfather had moved there from what is now Bangladesh.

The agitation against illegal foreign immigrants in Assam in the 1970s had its echoes in Shillong as well. As the agitation in Assam was led by students, the All Assam Students Union (AASU), so was a similar movement mounted in Shillong by the Khasi Students Union (KSU) with one notable exception. There was no large-scale influx of illegal immigrants into Shillong from Bangladesh though Meghalaya shares a common border. But the students were encouraged by vested political interests and the minorities like the Bengalis felt threatened.

Debu's family in the present times feels threatened as well. Many have to pay ""protection"" money to feel safe as is true elsewhere. The final straw comes when Debu's father's trader license cannot be renewed unless he pays a hefty sum well beyond his means. But the real story is about the friendship forged between Debu and his Khasi friends Clint Eastwood and Audrey Pariat. It's this relationship that shines through and offers a beacon of hope in troubled times.

The friendship which begins with sharing a bowl of ""jadoh"" rice with pork forbidden in Debu's home culminates in a picnic at the sacred groves in Mawphlang in Upper Shillong. Mawphlang was also the place for delectable cherry brandy distilled by a Scot in the early years. The Khasis did adopt interesting names. Clint Eastwood's father was John Wayne Lyngdoh, obviously a great fan of the actor. In my time, we had ""Mighty Sword"" Syiem because Syiem's mother had dreamed about a sword before giving birth or my own colleague in the university ""Loving Son"" Gassah.

The book has a very filmy ending. Debu decides to appeal to Clint's father, a local headman, to help save his father's shop. In the violence that ensues, Clint intervenes to save Debu's father but is severely injured instead. A contrite father rushes Clint to hospital where Clint's life is saved. But the damage is done. Debu has to complete his schooling in Kolkata under the care of a draconian aunt.

Clint's father wants to know why his own son risked his life to save that of Debu's father, a virtual stranger. A stranger indeed. It's in that understanding that the future and hope lies.

Written by Javier C. Hernández

For months, Gu Baoluo had been looking forward to a boisterous Christmas celebration at one of China's best-known Protestant churches. He loved decorating trees, singing songs like ""Silent Night"" and watching the annual Christmas pageant recounting the birth of Jesus.

But in early December, the police shut down Gu's usual place of worship, the Early Rain Covenant Church in the southwest city of Chengdu as part of what activists said is the most severe crackdown on Christianity in more than a decade. The police confiscated Bibles, shuttered a school and seminary run by the well-known church and detained Early Rain's outspoken pastor on charges of ""inciting subversion,"" punishable in serious cases by at least five years in prison.

On Christmas Eve, Gu, 31, a rice seller, went to the only safe place to worship that he knew: a friend's home, where he recited hymns and prayed for the two dozen Early Rain members that are in detention. Fearing that he and his friends might be arrested, Gu used encrypted chat apps to share information about surveillance and harassment by the police.

""We will not forfeit our faith because of suppression by the authorities,"" Gu said.

As millions around the world gathered to celebrate Christmas, China is capping a year in which the government of President Xi Jinping has led an unrelenting campaign against unofficial churches in China, which by some estimates serve as many as 30 million people.

Xi, apparently concerned that independent worship might pose a threat to the ruling Communist Party's dominance over daily life in China, has sought to bring Christianity more firmly under the party's control. The government this year banned online sales of the Bible, burned crosses, demolished churches and forced at least a half-dozen places of worship to close.

The campaign comes as Xi, the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, has worked to more aggressively control religion across China, including the detention of thousands of Muslims in the western region of Xinjiang.

Renee Xia, international director for China Human Rights Defenders, an advocacy group, described the effort as targeting the ""heart of the underground Christian resistance."" The government has focused its campaign on unofficial Christian churches that promote ideas like social justice or have been critical of the party's grip on society.

""The message,"" Xia said, ""is that Xi can't be messed with.""

The crackdown has escalated in the weeks leading up to Christmas. The police this month shut down the 40-year-old Rongguili Church in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, which attracted thousands of worshippers. And in September, the authorities in Beijing ordered the closure of the 1,500-member Zion Church, one of the largest unofficial churches in the capital.

The government requires religious groups to register, though many still worship in unofficial churches, sometimes called underground or house churches.

Many in the party believe Christianity, which by some estimates is China's fastest-growing religion, promotes Western values and ideals like human rights that conflict with the aims of China's authoritarian government and Xi's embrace of traditional Chinese culture and Confucian teachings that emphasize obedience and order.

But the government's heavy-handed efforts to obliterate several high-profile churches have been met with resistance among Christians.

On Christmas Eve, the authorities posted a sign at Early Rain's former headquarters saying its 23rd-floor sanctuary had been converted into office space for the local government.

Li Shuangde, a teacher in Chengdu who has been part of Early Rain since 2011, said that church members had been asked by the authorities to sign letters stating that they no longer believe in Christianity. He said Early Rain had no choice but continue to exist in secret. ""We have moved underground,"" he said.

Members have continued to hold Sunday services, sometimes on the banks of a river near the church's former headquarters in a downtown high-rise. They have called for the release of detained leaders, including Wang Yi, the pastor of Early Rain, and his wife, Jiang Rong.

Wang, in a pre-written message released after his detention, spoke about the importance of disobedience.

""The Communist regime's persecution of the church is an extremely vicious crime,"" he wrote. ""As a pastor of the Christian church, I must strictly and publicly condemn such crimes.""

Wang had been scheduled to deliver a Christmas Eve sermon at Early Rain titled, ""The God Who Bestows Peace."" Instead, hundreds of Early Rain members on Monday scattered across Chengdu for services inside the homes of friends and relatives or at welcoming churches.

At Chengdu Xishuipang Reformed Church, a Protestant church with close ties to Early Rain, more than 100 people gathered inside a worship hall on the 16th floor of an apartment building.

A children's choir sang ""Silent Night,"" and a small Christmas tree, decorated with snowflakes, was on display near the lectern.

The anxieties brought on by the recent arrests hung over the ceremony.

""If you see the police, national security or community workers greet them with gentleness,"" Wen Hongbin, an elder at Xishuipang, told the congregation. ""If they try to grab the microphone, I ask the brothers sitting in the front row to please stop them.""

While he did not explicitly mention Early Rain, Wen asked those in attendance to remember ""those who are criminally detained."" Then he began a sermon about the meaning of Christmas and the sacrifice made by Jesus.

Since Xi rose to power in 2012, the authorities have led a sustained campaign against unregistered churches. In one province, more than 1,500 crosses were removed from churches between 2014 to 2016, according to advocacy groups.

This year, some Chinese cities have banned Christmas displays. But the government also allows some degree of celebration, in part to stimulate the economy. Here in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, Christmas trees stand side by side on city streets with propaganda posters, and music from ""The Nutcracker"" plays in the background at malls.

Officials in the United States have denounced the Chinese government's efforts to limit the spread of Christianity.

""China's Christians and other faith communities are under siege and treated as enemies of the state for daring to worship and peacefully live out their faith,"" Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey said in a joint statement condemning the recent detentions.

But China's growing influence in world affairs has shielded it from some criticism.

One notably silent voice: the Vatican, which in September reached a provisional deal with the Chinese government to end a decades-old power struggle over the right to appoint bishops in China. The Vatican said it sent a delegation of leaders to China this month to work out details of the agreement, but declined to comment on the crackdown on Christian churches.

Despite Xi's efforts to expand the officially atheist party's control of worship, religious life in China is flourishing. While official figures are imprecise, experts believe there are about 60 million Christians in China, with roughly half worshipping at state-sanctioned churches and half at unofficial churches.

Independent churches like Early Rain, with more than 500 members, have attracted large followings in recent years, especially among white-collar workers seeking an escape from rampant materialism at the center of modern Chinese life.

While sermons at state-sanctioned churches are often tightly scripted, independent churches boom with searing indictments of corrupt officials and rousing calls to protect the rights of the poor.

Early Rain, which Wang founded in 2008, was among the most daring. Wang called Xi a sinner, held prayer sessions each year to mark the brutal crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations at Tiananmen Square in 1989, and organized a fund to support relatives of political prisoners in China.

Gu, the rice seller, began attending services at Early Rain two years ago after finding videos of Wang's fiery sermons online. He felt Wang's concern for the poor was in line with his own view that the government was abusing workers and violating human rights by destroying their homes to make way for expensive developments. Gu was baptized last year.

""I saw injustices in society,"" Gu said. ""I saw that the government's promotion of China as a just country that enforces laws in a civilized manner was all a lie.""

Worried for his own safety, Gu recently closed his business, hoping to avoid government scrutiny. He said he has grown fearful as he has watched the police arrest his friends.

Gu has turned to the Bible in recent days for support. Sometimes, he recites a verse from the Book of Proverbs: ""The path of the righteous is like the morning sun, shining ever brighter till the full light of day."""

Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell of the US District Court for the District of Columbia ruled on Monday that North Korea should pay damages to Fred and Cindy Warmbier, the parents of the student who died shortly after being released from a North Korean prison.

Warmbier was visiting North Korea with a tour group when he was arrested and sentenced to 15 years of hard labour in March 2016 on suspicion of stealing a propaganda poster. He died in June 2017, shortly after he returned to the US in a coma and showing apparent signs of torture while in custody.

Warmbier's parents had filed a wrongful death suit against North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in April and appeared in court last week for the first hearing.

They sued the North Korean government for more than $1 billion, saying they were seeking ""closure"" and wanted to ""obtain justice for the severe injuries"" they say their son and family suffered.

Howell found North Korea liable for ""the torture, hostage taking and extrajudicial killing of Otto Warmbier"" as well as the injuries to his parents.

""An American family, the Warmbiers, experienced North Korea's brutality first-hand when North Korea seized their son to use as a pawn in that totalitarian state's global shenanigans and face-off with the US,"" the judge said.

Howell demanded from North Korea $450 million in punitive damages as well as $51 million for the personal anguish and economic loss both Warmbier and his parents experienced, the Washington Post reported.

The ruling, however, was mainly symbolic as North Korea was unlikely to pay the damages.

Before Warmbier went on what was intended to be a short visit to North Korea with a tour group, Howell said: ""he was a healthy, athletic student of economics and business in his junior year at the University of Virginia, with 'big dreams' and both the smarts and people skills to make him his high school class salutatorian, homecoming king and prom king.

It was all possible because of the efforts and foresight of Shree Durga Friends Club, Karenki, led by Prakash Anchan, a garment merchant from Bantwal.

""When most Kannada-medium schools across the state are closing down due to various reasons, we wanted to show the world that this school can be saved by adopting new teaching skills, and today we are successful in doing so. Our mission began three year ago when theschool had only 30 children. Even those who had joined nearby English-medium schools have quit, and have taken admission here,"" says an elated Prakash while speaking to TOI.

The first phase of the school with eight classrooms was inaugurated last April, and second and final phase will be inaugurated by governor Vajubhai Vala on January 5.

Anchan added that they collected all the money from generous donors, who included locals, parents and others. ""We have not taken a single penny from any government be it the Centre or state. When we proposed the same building plan, the government estimated a cost of Rs 6 crore, but we have completed the work by spending Rs 2.2 crore.""

The school has five government-appointed teachers, three guest teachers, three vehicle drivers, and Karate, dance and music teachers. About16 staff are paid by the Shree Durga Friends Club members. All the facilities are provided free-of-cost to children, including transportation.

Success story

In 2015, when the school was about to shut down, the Shree Durga Friends Club members swung into action. They made their own children quit from English-medium schools and admitted them to the school, due to which their number rose to 56 from 30. The members later sought permission from the department of public instruction to convert the medium of instruction to English. It has adopted teaching in the English-medium in a Kannada school, which is a model similar to what is followed in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The club is in a five-year agreement with the government to run the school in various capacities.

Earlier, the school had only three teachers appointed by the government. After taking over, club members have recruited additional teachers, and the club pays their salaries. It has transportation and other facilities."

Some employees of these centres, fearing job cuts, said 8,000 centres in the state had fewer that 25 students each and that the move would have an adverse impact on government school enrolment.

The nutritious meal programme, aimed at bringing children to government schools, was pioneered by chief minister K Kamaraj in the 1960s and was extended to all children upto Class X by M G Ramachandran (MGR).

Later, the Centre extended support and currently more than 50 lakh students benefit under the scheme at 43,200 centres, shows official data.

The staff strength at eEach centre, comprising a head cook, an assistant and an organiser, increases with student strength. Of the Rs 5,000-Rs 7,000 a month paid to each employee, the Centre pays Rs 1,000 and the state the rest.

Concerned over the drop in government school enrolment with more than 1,000 schools having less than 10 children, the state has decided to re-position employees to centres where there is a demand. Officials have been asked to close centres in low-enrolment schools and transport food from nearby centres to children in these schools.

Condemning this, TN Noon Meal Workers Association secretary R Noorjahan said transporting food from nearby centres would delay distribution. ""Already 10,000 cooking assistant posts are vacant and this will weaken the nutritious meal programme further. When the government is ready to pay over Rs 1lakh for teachers in low-enrolment schools, what is the big deal about paying Rs.5,000 for cooks?""

Social welfare commissioner V Amuthavalli said the order, originally passed in 1992, was being implemented now. ""The aim was to rationalise the workforce. This involves several steps and centres will not be closed straightaway.""

Experts say this will impact student enrolment and eventually lead to closure of the schools. State has already planned to merge 1,053 schools with low enrolment and another 1,950 schools face an uncertain future with funds being cut."

""It was located in a hill, which the locals refer as Murugan Kuttu. They had dug so deep that it became a safety hazard,"" said one of the petitioners.

Importantly, P. Bhagyaraj, another petitioner, said that the impact of the blasts done in the quarry was causing trouble for the villages since the quarry was located nearby.

""The Government Higher Secondary School is located in the vicinity of the quarry. One of the buildings developed a wide crack, which was likely due to the impact of the blasts. It was after this incident that we petitioned the district administration repeatedly and closed it down,"" he said.

He added that resolutions were also passed in the village committee, which had representation from all communities, and by the town panchayat of Palamedu that the quarry will not be allowed to function in the village.

""In fact, we came to know that the quarry had been opened only after we started hearing the blasts since last week.

The little girl, who plays the role of Choti, was found by me after auditioning 1,800 girls. I had the memory of a little girl who inspired me to write the novel. She was a tightrope walker, who I had met at the Kumbh Mela a couple of years ago. When I asked her why she doesn't go to school, she told me that she won't be able to survive without working and making money. She wanted to become a lawyer when she grew up. This was around the time my father had passed away and I was spending some time in Varanasi. I was looking for a closure after his death, but I didn't know I would be inspired to write.

It was hard for me to give my baby to someone else. I don't care how wrong the movie is in the technical department, I just wanted to maintain the honesty and emotions.

Nothing had prepared the two constables for the role they were to play in cricket's coincidental unmasking -- which started with their boss, Inspector Ishwar Singh, asking them to be part of an extortion investigation in early 2000. It was a textbook case of those times -- a suspected Chhota Shakeel and

D Company operative from Dubai, Shaheen Haitheley, had threatened an Old Delhi businessman to cough up Rs 5 crore.

A background check of those in touch with Haitheley threw up a Bollywood name -- Krishan Kumar, a failed actor and brother of late T-Series founder Gulshan Kumar. BSNL was roped in -- whenever Kumar's cellphone rang, a landline on the top floor of the Delhi Police's R K Puram office too came alive.

Ishwar is tickled as he recalls those early days of phone-tapping. ""It was all very primitive, nothing like the computers of today. We would strip the landline wires of their plastic cover and twist the metal wire inside tightly to a tape-recorder, that had those good old audio cassettes.""

Little did Ishwar or his men know then that this rudimentary contraption would connect them to cricket's seedy betting syndicate that dealt in hundreds of crores, and lead them to a catch that they would boast about for years to come.

Om Prakash and Ajit continued to work in shifts, hanging onto every word that Krishan Kumar spoke on the phone. With no headway, the surveillance was extended. After Kumar's Call Data Record analysis, it was decided to also closely observe his friends, Rajesh Kalra, Sunil Dara, and Man Mohan Khattar. The Crime Branch office was buzzing, the policemen were busy and the recorded cassettes were piling up.

On February 20, 2000, the Delhi Police got lucky. Kumar handed over his compromised phone to a London-based friend, Sanjeev Chawla, who had just landed in Mumbai and checked into Hotel Taj Mahal, that was also the base of the South African cricket team. Chawla was now being snooped on by proxy.

Meanwhile, the constables, programmed to look for extortion clues, were getting restless. One fine day, after another late-night vigil, Om Prakash bumped into DCP Pradeep Srivastava on the steps of the police headquarters. ""I casually asked Om Prakash about the case. He said there was no terror angle, all he got to hear was 'catch pakad liya', 'catch nahin pakda', 'out kiya'. I told him these could be code words, they might have been talking about money. He replied, 'Nahin janaab, aap hi sun lijeye (No sir, you hear yourself)',"" recalls Srivastav who, after retiring as DG, Chandigarh, lives in Delhi's Civil

When Srivastav heard the cassettes, he agreed with his junior. But what stuck in his mind was the unusual chatter. ""There was someone speaking in chiseled accented English to someone who spoke tooti-phooti angrezi (broken English). The man speaking broken English was complaining... 'You said you will do this but you didn't',"" says Srivastav.

A breakthrough came via yet another happenstance. A few days later, Srivastav was watching cricket at home when, during a game, South African skipper Hansie Cronje came to the commentary box. ""That's when it struck me, 'Aawaz jaani pehchaani lag rahi hai (The voice sounds familiar)'."" The mystery of the man who spoke that chiseled English had been solved.

Inspector Ishwar got in touch with Doordarshan for the game tapes to compare the voices. In the coming days, Om Prakash's ears would wait for the 'chiseled English' chatter to appear again. On March 14, 2000, it did. He would shout out to his senior in the next room. ""Sir kuchch English mein hai (There is something in English)!""

Ishwar still recalls Chawla's three words: ""Hello, Hi Hansie!"" And the reply: ""Hello,

Hi Sanjeev!""

Almost overnight, for Om Prakash and Ajit, watching cricket became work itself. On most days, thanks to the phone calls, they would have prior information on the playing eleven, the toss or, say, that Crookes would bowl the first over. It was watching sports without the thrill of suspense. Sometimes, when the game wouldn't go as per the pre-decided script, the landline in the R K Puram office would ring off the hook.

What was once whispered in hushed tones in the cricket circuit was now on page one of newspapers. As soon as the Delhi Police filed the FIR in the first week of March 2000, every cricket-playing nation had its eyes on India. The transcript of Cronje's conversations with bookies went viral.

Cricket's axis of evil -- the player-punter-bookie nexus -- was no longer a mere conspiracy theory. The rot, triggered by the proliferation of the game's shorter version, coinciding with the broadcasting boom and the multi-fold escalation in mobile phone users, and aided by India's weak anti-gambling law, ran deep. Anybody with a phone connection could have a syndicate of his own that was affiliated to big sharks abroad. Match-fixing had become the underworld's new ATM.

The controversy triggered probes around the world and forced the International Cricket Council (ICC) to form an anti-corruption unit. Kings Commission in South Africa and the CBI investigation in India found the game's leading lights, including Cronje, Gibbs, and Indian stars Mohammad Azharuddin and Ajay Jadeja, guilty. All were banned, for varying periods.

As for Chawla, he took a flight out of the country on March 15, 2000, four days before the final ODI. Police officials knew he was on way to the airport, but could only watch helplessly. ""The South Africans were still in India. Making an arrest would have meant naming the South African players he was in touch with and that might have meant a diplomatic issue. So we had to wait for the South Africans to leave,"" says an investigator.

The South Africans left on March 20.

Eighteen years later, Chawla happens to be the only accused in this case who hasn't been questioned by either the Delhi Police, CBI or Kings Commission; this despite figuring prominently in all the probe reports.

Arvind Kumar, then Operation Hansie's foot soldier, now ACP, Crime Branch, first calls Chawla the pivot, thinks for a while and changes it to ""sutradhar (main link)"". ""Woh Mahabharat dekha tha na TV pe aapne, Chawla 'Samay' hai (You saw serial Mahabharat on TV, didn't you? Chawla was the character 'Samay'),"" he says.

Anticipating his return, Ishwar smiles, ""Maybe he can even name a few Indian players.""

The CBI report did talk about Chawla's association with Indian players and his visits to the gym at Delhi's Hotel Park Royal, the watering hole where the key characters of this saga allegedly hung around. Everybody, from alleged punters Kalra, Dara, Krishan Kumar to players Ajay Jadeja, Manoj Prabhakar, Nikhil Chopra, reportedly regularly bumped into each other at this Nehru Place haunt. Kalra, the report also says, called the then India offie Chopra, on Chawla's insistence, before the Nagpur ODI (the Crookes game) to check if he was in the playing eleven. The CBI report, however, found nothing against Chopra.

In the almost two decades long lull, and the virtual closure of the case after Cronje's death in 2002, most of the tainted cricketers have got rid of the 'fixer' tag. They are now talking heads, coaches and selectors, and the return of the ghost from the past could be unsettling.

Chawla, 51, a UK passport holder, currently in London with his wife and two sons, tried his best to stonewall India's request. Westminster Magistrate's Court judgment shows how he raised issues of passage of time, prison conditions in India, human rights and right to family life. The hearing also discussed Chawla's wife's health issues, and mentioned the family's catering business and a restaurant let out on lease.

In his long career, Ishwar says, he has dealt with many suspects who run to court to avoid arrest. Back in 2000, Krishan Kumar too was a minor celebrity -- with hit songs like Sanam bewafa, Aacha sila diya tune mere pyaar ka, behind him, and those caterpillar-like eyebrows.

With policemen on his heels, Kumar first got himself admitted to Noida's Kailash Hospital and later moved the High Court to get anticipatory bail. The Delhi Police went to the Supreme Court for cancellation of bail.

Fifty-six-year-old Ishwar, now an ACP in the Capital's West District, remembers clearly the judge's caustically funny observation. ""R K Anand was Kumar's lawyer. The judge told him, 'Are you withdrawing the bail petition or should I pass an order? I was watching the match till 2 o'clock and wasting my time. If this isn't match-fixing, what is?' Ek minute mein bail plea uda di (He dismissed the bail plea in a minute), said go and surrender,"" says Ishwar, laughing heartily.

Srivastav too has one vivid memory from the episode. It was a line he heard in the Chawla-Cronje cassettes, after a game where apparently Gibbs was to score less than 20 runs but went on to make much more, thanks to several chances gifted by Indian fielders. ""I still remember Hansie's reply, 'If your b.....ds can't join their two hands, then what do I do?',"" Srivastav recalls, cracking up.

There was another, lesser-known character in this story: an Indian-origin restaurateur from Johannesburg who was ""the best friend"" of every Indian cricketer who stepped onto South African soil, a charismatic wheeler-dealer with that unforgettably dramatic name -- Hamid Banjo Cassim.

Touring Indian cricketers have a rather endearing nickname for men like Banjo. They are called ""Mamu"", the quintessential maternal uncles who spoil nephews during visits. These fans-turned-hangers-on-turned-groupies take a time-tested route to the heart of cricketers -- via the stomach.

On long tours, the easiest way to break the ice with India's cricketers is by arranging vegetarian food for home-sick players. If indulged, ""Mamus"" can be banked on for free SIMs and even all-paid shopping trips. In return, they ask for free match-day passes, selfies, signed memorabilia, and sometimes, a pound-and-a-half of flesh.

A giant of a man, Banjo was a school dropout and a failed entrepreneur. The father of three had a candy shop called Sweet Junction in Johannesburg's Fordsburg area, famous for a halal restaurant that served spicy curries.

Among the '90s South African players, he was the ""biltong"" man, someone who never tired of providing them the strictly carnivore nation's favourite snack, those dried and seasoned meat strips. He was more than a ""Mamu"" for the South Africans, especially Cronje. Records show he called the Porteas skipper 180 times in six months.

Indian cricketers from the 1996 tour remember Banjo for his extraordinary biryani delivery to the dressing room, lifted to the balcony from the grass banks by a rope. You could always trust Banjo to make things happen.

He told the Kings Commission that Kapil Dev was a good friend, close enough to introduce him to his wife. He wasn't lying, Kapil told the CBI about how he knew ""Hamid Mamu"" very well.

Banjo also flaunted how he arranged South African players for some friendly games that Kapil organised in India and how once, while driving the Indian star late one night in Johannesburg, he pranked his nephew. The young boy stood stunned at the counter of his truck shop seeing Kapil walk in and ask for a drink.

During the Kings Commission hearing, Banjo also said he had arranged SIM cards and phones for Bollywood stars when they visited South Africa. One pay-on-go SIM he provided to Amisha Patel -- that era's next big thing after her 2000 blockbuster Kaho Na Pyaar Hai -- was later used by Banjo to make calls to Chawla. Banjo also proudly told the Commission he had asked South African star Lance Klusener to arrange tickets for Patel for a Test at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.

So when Chawla wanted to get introduced to Cronje in South Africa in January 2000, a month before their India tour, Banjo was the obvious go-between. Details discussed during the Kings Commission hearing show Chawla was received by Banjo and taken to his shop for a meal.

A day before South Africa's tri-series ODI game against Zimbabwe on February 1, 2000, Banjo told the Commission, Chawla handed the South African skipper $15,000 at a Durban hotel in front of him. ""Mr Cronje took that envelope and I was surprised. He (Chawla) said, 'Keep this and I will talk to you at a later stage',"" Banjo said in his testimony.

During South Africa's subsequent series in India, Chawla kept talking to Cronje and, when he didn't take his calls, there was always Banjo who would mediate from Johannesburg. All through the hearing, the candy shop owner kept insisting that he was just a cricket enthusiast trying to be helpful. The advocates questioning him weren't always convinced. Chawla's return to India might add a new layer to this investigation.

This case has had a history of unexpected twists and turns. At every dead end, the Delhi Police have been lucky to find a new opening. DCP Srivastav has seen it first hand. The cold response of the government in the aftermath of the first FIR was disheartening for the team. ""My immediate superior, Joint CP, Crime, Dr K K Paul, was very supportive. But no one else was ready to believe us. The government asked why the FIR was filed prematurely, without proper evidence, and how it doesn't fall within the four walls of the law,"" he says.

The Delhi Police saw this as a case of cheating, both Chawla and Cronje were booked under IPC Sections 420 and 120B, but legal opinion was different. According to the law, cheating can only be established if somebody loses and somebody gains. Legal luminaries would ask: Whose loss is it if a match is fixed? That even if the outcome of a game was pre-decided, the spectators didn't know, they got their money's worth. Don't people pay to watch World Wrestling Entertainment, knowing those matches are fixed?

The Delhi Police tried to argue that the game wasn't ""fair"", which is what the fans pay for. ""We did register a case of cheating but there was always this grave doubt about it being tenable or not,"" says Srivastav.

And then came the turnaround. Another phone call, another accented voice. Srivastav was home for lunch when he was told by his helper that there was someone on line speaking ""angrezi"". ""I got on the line and heard English with a French accent. He was a reporter from a foreign agency. He said, 'Deputy Commissioner, you must be a very happy man. Each bit that you alleged against Hansie has been confessed by him last night',"" recalls Srivastav, adding how he will remain eternally grateful to the South African skipper for ""unburdening his conscience"".

Within minutes, the government's tone changed. Srivastav's voice has a crackle as he recalls, ""On television was then NSA himself, Brajesh Mishra. He came on screen to say: 'Satyamev jayate (Truth always prevails)... Whatever our officers were saying has been confirmed by Hansie himself'.""

Once again, the policemen gathered in front of the Crime Branch office television and exchanged amused smiles. It was a winter of crazy coincidences.

Almost overnight, for Om Prakash and Ajit, watching cricket became work itself. On most days, thanks to the phone calls, they would have prior information on the playing eleven, the toss or, say, that Crookes would bowl the first over. It was watching sports without the thrill of suspense. Sometimes, when the game wouldn't go as per the pre-decided script, the landline in the R K Puram office would ring off the hook.

What was once whispered in hushed tones in the cricket circuit was now on page one of newspapers. As soon as the Delhi Police filed the FIR in the first week of March 2000, every cricket-playing nation had its eyes on India. The transcript of Cronje's conversations with bookies went viral.

Cricket's axis of evil -- the player-punter-bookie nexus -- was no longer a mere conspiracy theory. The rot, triggered by the proliferation of the game's shorter version, coinciding with the broadcasting boom and the multi-fold escalation in mobile phone users, and aided by India's weak anti-gambling law, ran deep. Anybody with a phone connection could have a syndicate of his own that was affiliated to big sharks abroad. Match-fixing had become the underworld's new ATM.

The controversy triggered probes around the world and forced the International Cricket Council (ICC) to form an anti-corruption unit. Kings Commission in South Africa and the CBI investigation in India found the game's leading lights, including Cronje, Gibbs, and Indian stars Mohammad Azharuddin and Ajay Jadeja, guilty. All were banned, for varying periods.

As for Chawla, he took a flight out of the country on March 15, 2000, four days before the final ODI. Police officials knew he was on way to the airport, but could only watch helplessly. ""The South Africans were still in India. Making an arrest would have meant naming the South African players he was in touch with and that might have meant a diplomatic issue. So we had to wait for the South Africans to leave,"" says an investigator.

The South Africans left on March 20.

Eighteen years later, Chawla happens to be the only accused in this case who hasn't been questioned by either the Delhi Police, CBI or Kings Commission; this despite figuring prominently in all the probe reports.

Arvind Kumar, then Operation Hansie's foot soldier, now ACP, Crime Branch, first calls Chawla the pivot, thinks for a while and changes it to ""sutradhar (main link)"". ""Woh Mahabharat dekha tha na TV pe aapne, Chawla 'Samay' hai (You saw serial Mahabharat on TV, didn't you? Chawla was the character 'Samay'),"" he says.

Anticipating his return, Ishwar smiles, ""Maybe he can even name a few Indian players.""

The CBI report did talk about Chawla's association with Indian players and his visits to the gym at Delhi's Hotel Park Royal, the watering hole where the key characters of this saga allegedly hung around. Everybody, from alleged punters Kalra, Dara, Krishan Kumar to players Ajay Jadeja, Manoj Prabhakar, Nikhil Chopra, reportedly regularly bumped into each other at this Nehru Place haunt. Kalra, the report also says, called the then India offie Chopra, on Chawla's insistence, before the Nagpur ODI (the Crookes game) to check if he was in the playing eleven. The CBI report, however, found nothing against Chopra.

In the almost two decades long lull, and the virtual closure of the case after Cronje's death in 2002, most of the tainted cricketers have got rid of the 'fixer' tag. They are now talking heads, coaches and selectors, and the return of the ghost from the past could be unsettling.

Chawla, 51, a UK passport holder, currently in London with his wife and two sons, tried his best to stonewall India's request. Westminster Magistrate's Court judgment shows how he raised issues of passage of time, prison conditions in India, human rights and right to family life. The hearing also discussed Chawla's wife's health issues, and mentioned the family's catering business and a restaurant let out on lease.

In his long career, Ishwar says, he has dealt with many suspects who run to court to avoid arrest. Back in 2000, Krishan Kumar too was a minor celebrity -- with hit songs like Sanam bewafa, Aacha sila diya tune mere pyaar ka, behind him, and those caterpillar-like eyebrows.

With policemen on his heels, Kumar first got himself admitted to Noida's Kailash Hospital and later moved the High Court to get anticipatory bail. The Delhi Police went to the Supreme Court for cancellation of bail.

Fifty-six-year-old Ishwar, now an ACP in the Capital's West District, remembers clearly the judge's caustically funny observation. ""R K Anand was Kumar's lawyer. The judge told him, 'Are you withdrawing the bail petition or should I pass an order? I was watching the match till 2 o'clock and wasting my time. If this isn't match-fixing, what is?' Ek minute mein bail plea uda di (He dismissed the bail plea in a minute), said go and surrender,"" says Ishwar, laughing heartily.

Srivastav too has one vivid memory from the episode. It was a line he heard in the Chawla-Cronje cassettes, after a game where apparently Gibbs was to score less than 20 runs but went on to make much more, thanks to several chances gifted by Indian fielders. ""I still remember Hansie's reply, 'If your b.....ds can't join their two hands, then what do I do?',"" Srivastav recalls, cracking up.

There was another, lesser-known character in this story: an Indian-origin restaurateur from Johannesburg who was ""the best friend"" of every Indian cricketer who stepped onto South African soil, a charismatic wheeler-dealer with that unforgettably dramatic name -- Hamid Banjo Cassim.

Touring Indian cricketers have a rather endearing nickname for men like Banjo. They are called ""Mamu"", the quintessential maternal uncles who spoil nephews during visits. These fans-turned-hangers-on-turned-groupies take a time-tested route to the heart of cricketers -- via the stomach.

On long tours, the easiest way to break the ice with India's cricketers is by arranging vegetarian food for home-sick players. If indulged, ""Mamus"" can be banked on for free SIMs and even all-paid shopping trips. In return, they ask for free match-day passes, selfies, signed memorabilia, and sometimes, a pound-and-a-half of flesh.

A giant of a man, Banjo was a school dropout and a failed entrepreneur. The father of three had a candy shop called Sweet Junction in Johannesburg's Fordsburg area, famous for a halal restaurant that served spicy curries.

Among the '90s South African players, he was the ""biltong"" man, someone who never tired of providing them the strictly carnivore nation's favourite snack, those dried and seasoned meat strips. He was more than a ""Mamu"" for the South Africans, especially Cronje. Records show he called the Porteas skipper 180 times in six months.

Indian cricketers from the 1996 tour remember Banjo for his extraordinary biryani delivery to the dressing room, lifted to the balcony from the grass banks by a rope. You could always trust Banjo to make things happen.

He told the Kings Commission that Kapil Dev was a good friend, close enough to introduce him to his wife. He wasn't lying, Kapil told the CBI about how he knew ""Hamid Mamu"" very well.

Banjo also flaunted how he arranged South African players for some friendly games that Kapil organised in India and how once, while driving the Indian star late one night in Johannesburg, he pranked his nephew. The young boy stood stunned at the counter of his truck shop seeing Kapil walk in and ask for a drink.

During the Kings Commission hearing, Banjo also said he had arranged SIM cards and phones for Bollywood stars when they visited South Africa. One pay-on-go SIM he provided to Amisha Patel -- that era's next big thing after her 2000 blockbuster Kaho Na Pyaar Hai -- was later used by Banjo to make calls to Chawla. Banjo also proudly told the Commission he had asked South African star Lance Klusener to arrange tickets for Patel for a Test at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.

So when Chawla wanted to get introduced to Cronje in South Africa in January 2000, a month before their India tour, Banjo was the obvious go-between. Details discussed during the Kings Commission hearing show Chawla was received by Banjo and taken to his shop for a meal.

A day before South Africa's tri-series ODI game against Zimbabwe on February 1, 2000, Banjo told the Commission, Chawla handed the South African skipper $15,000 at a Durban hotel in front of him. ""Mr Cronje took that envelope and I was surprised. He (Chawla) said, 'Keep this and I will talk to you at a later stage',"" Banjo said in his testimony.

During South Africa's subsequent series in India, Chawla kept talking to Cronje and, when he didn't take his calls, there was always Banjo who would mediate from Johannesburg. All through the hearing, the candy shop owner kept insisting that he was just a cricket enthusiast trying to be helpful. The advocates questioning him weren't always convinced. Chawla's return to India might add a new layer to this investigation.

This case has had a history of unexpected twists and turns. At every dead end, the Delhi Police have been lucky to find a new opening. DCP Srivastav has seen it first hand. The cold response of the government in the aftermath of the first FIR was disheartening for the team. ""My immediate superior, Joint CP, Crime, Dr K K Paul, was very supportive. But no one else was ready to believe us. The government asked why the FIR was filed prematurely, without proper evidence, and how it doesn't fall within the four walls of the law,"" he says.

The Delhi Police saw this as a case of cheating, both Chawla and Cronje were booked under IPC Sections 420 and 120B, but legal opinion was different. According to the law, cheating can only be established if somebody loses and somebody gains. Legal luminaries would ask: Whose loss is it if a match is fixed? That even if the outcome of a game was pre-decided, the spectators didn't know, they got their money's worth. Don't people pay to watch World Wrestling Entertainment, knowing those matches are fixed?

The Delhi Police tried to argue that the game wasn't ""fair"", which is what the fans pay for. ""We did register a case of cheating but there was always this grave doubt about it being tenable or not,"" says Srivastav.

And then came the turnaround. Another phone call, another accented voice. Srivastav was home for lunch when he was told by his helper that there was someone on line speaking ""angrezi"". ""I got on the line and heard English with a French accent. He was a reporter from a foreign agency. He said, 'Deputy Commissioner, you must be a very happy man. Each bit that you alleged against Hansie has been confessed by him last night',"" recalls Srivastav, adding how he will remain eternally grateful to the South African skipper for ""unburdening his conscience"".

Within minutes, the government's tone changed. Srivastav's voice has a crackle as he recalls, ""On television was then NSA himself, Brajesh Mishra. He came on screen to say: 'Satyamev jayate (Truth always prevails)... Whatever our officers were saying has been confirmed by Hansie himself'.""

Once again, the policemen gathered in front of the Crime Branch office television and exchanged amused smiles. It was a winter of crazy coincidences.

There is no doubt that the school education sector is beset with huge problems. However, whether the dismal performance is on account of policy gap or there are other factors that are responsible for the current state of affairs is a moot point.

Let us first try to understand what has not happened in the education sector. Why has it not happened? And, how can it happen (whether through policy intervention or otherwise)?

Two things have certainly happened during the current millennium. The infrastructure (school buildings) has shown remarkable improvement though there is still a long way to go. And, thanks to the mid-day-meal, we have managed to get the child to the school.

However, what is appalling is the poor quality of education that is imparted in most of the government schools. This is evidenced by the fact that the learning outcomes have actually come down during the past decade despite enormous amount of investments. The number of teachers has gone up substantially and the average pupil-teacher ratio comes close to the required levels.

However, this does not solve the problem of quality. To begin with, a large number of teachers are not qualified to teach, yet they are teaching. According to a rough estimate, out of eight million teachers around 1.4 million fall in this category. Politics has seeped into this cadre in the most insidious manner resulting in skewed distribution of teachers in most of the States as the tendency is to hang in and around urban areas.

The Right to Education Act did precious little on this front. In fact, the legislation made the task of delivering quality education complex and difficult. The focus of the Act is primarily on 'inputs' (like infrastructure) rather than 'outcomes'. It has created an adversarial role between 'public' and 'private' schools. The Act mandates under Section 12(1)(c) that even private schools ""shall admit in Class I, to the extent of at least 25 per cent of the strength of that class, children belonging to weaker section and disadvantaged group."" The manner in which reimbursement is to be provided has created a number of problems.

The norms and standards prescribed in the schedule for a school are far removed from ground reality. What is perhaps desirable has been made mandatory. This has resulted in a phenomenal increase in the number of teachers. During 2015-16, there were 39,608 government schools that had less than 10 children but each school was mandated to have minimum of two teachers.

The budget private schools, most of whom are doing a great job in imparting education, are under enormous pressure to meet the prescribed standards or face closure. No attempt was made while enacting this legislation to look at the ground reality.

The consequences have been disastrous. On an average, an amount of around ₹10,000 per child gets spent in government schools. The budget schools do it for much less and impart as good, if not better, education. Unfortunately, the focus so far has primarily been on regulation (legislations are perhaps meant for that) and not on development of the private sector. Consequently, even after eight years of enactment, the country is none the better than what it was.

The RTE Act has done more damage to delivery of education. Section 16 of the Act provides that ""No child admitted in a school shall be held back in any class or expelled from school till completion of elementary education.""

The 'expulsion' part can be understood but not holding back a child in a class has meant that a large number of children are getting promoted without acquiring the necessary attributes. The model of 'no detention' was apparently picked up from the West and transplanted in this country without taking into account the objective conditions obtaining here.

Yet again, the consequences have been devastating as there is a huge bottleneck getting created at Class X where the pass percentage has plummeted. The States were not even given freedom to take a call on the issue. The government has subsequently decided to provide an option to the States and the amendment is under consideration of Parliament.

A new Education Policy is round the corner. However, what needs to be understood is whether there is a need for a policy to address the issues that afflict school education. Most of the action relating to education lies in the States. In any case, the country is too diverse to consider a single mandate by way of policy for the entire country. If a teacher does not go to a school in Kerala, he could well be ""lynched"" but in some of the States of northern India, they consider it their right not to go to the school. There are instances of these regular teachers employing a ""substitute"" to represent them and even teach on their behalf.

What is actually required is an action plan clearly outlining: What needs to be done? How it will be done? Who will do it? And, by when it will be done? The roles of respective entities should be clearly defined so that the performance can be assessed. One has often wondered why should only the Centre assess the performance of States? Why can't it be the other way round?

The action plan needs to focus on the teacher who plays a pivotal role in imparting education. The entire value chain needs to be looked at, understood and interventions clearly outlined. Beginning with pre-service training, to selection process, to in-service training, to transfer and posting, to engagement of teachers in non-educational activities, to their promotional avenues and morale will need to be looked at.

An action plan for each State will have to be worked out in detail, clearly outlining the roles of the Centre and the respective State government. Intervention for each State will vary from State to State. Unlike the present dispensation, there will have to be sufficient flexibility in the central schemes to accommodate the differences among States. The whole approach has to be outcome based rather than input based as has been the case so far.

Our country has been obsessed with the western world. We had looked at Finland, England, Scotland, Holland and all the lands of the world but not at motherland. A lot of wonderful work is being done within the country but has so far gone unnoticed. ""Policy"" cannot help in this regard.

What needs to be done is to facilitate identification, understanding and scaling of successful practices. If these home-grown practices have succeeded in the prevalent objective conditions, the chances of their replication and scaling are pretty high as compared to an 'imported' idea or practice.

What is also required is to learn from States, like Rajasthan, that have turned it around through some remarkable State level interventions both administrative and financial.

Policy debates provide food for intellectual stimulation but what matters is what is done on the ground. Hence, the dire need for an action plan."

""We would still like to increase the green cover and sought to acquire an additional 300 acres, but government is sitting on the request. NGT has referred the chimney stack matter to the joint committee of TNPCB and CPCB,"" he said.

'Let govt take-up health study'

Sterlite said it would welcome it if the government were to take up a comprehensive health study. NGT, in its judgement on August 8, 2013, had issued two directives to government to conduct source apportionment study in and around the SIPCOT industrial area and it constituted a six-member special committee, with MDMK chief Vaiko as a member, with a mandate to study and place on record causes for health hazards in and around the industries.

""So far, the committee has not taken-up any study. We conducted apportionment study now and found that 90 per cent of sulphur dioxide emission are from thermal power plants and only one per cent from our smelter. We conduct regular health check-up and provide the data to the government,"" Ramnath told Express.

Post-2013, fence-line monitoring system and interlock mechanism were introduced. A threshold limit, which is half the permissible level, was set and if sulphur dioxide emission crosses it, the plant will automatically shutdown.

""We invested close to Rs 500-600 crore, which is 20 per cent of plants asset value, on safety parameters,"" he said.

""Two months preparation needed to restart production""

The Sterlite official said it would take a minimum of two months to render the smelter fit to recommence production. ""We have to assess the scale of damage to the machinery in the absence of maintenance. Sulphuric acid tanks collapse if not maintained,"" Ramnath said.

Sterlite denies judgment leak

Sterlite has denied it had draft copy of NGT judgment before it was officially made public.

""We do not know,"" Ramnath said. He was responding to a private complaint filed by Thoothukudi resident Fatima Babu in New Delhi.

10 students detained for bid to protest reopening

CHENNAI: Ten students hailing from Thoothukudi were detained near Chennai Press Club at Chepauk here on Thursday for allegedly causing public nuisance by trying to organise a protest against the reopening of Sterlite unit in the wake of the National Green Tribunal's order. The protesters, belonging to a students' organisation based at Thoothukudi, carried charts and banners which bore messages against Sterlite.

Triplicane police immediately put them in a vehicle and took them to the station. A police official said the students started shouting slogans. Of the ten, three were school students and others were studying in arts and engineering colleges.

""We came to know that students from Thoothukudi will arrive at Chepauk around 10.30 am on Thursday to protest against Sterlite's reopening. We have detained them as a preventive measure and will release them by evening,"" a police official said.

On December 15, the tribunal dismissed the State government's pleas against reopening of Sterlite. Following this, various organisations have resorted to protests.

'Enact special ordinance on permanent closure'

CHENNAI: CPM has urged the State law minister C.Ve. Shanmugam to enact a special ordinance to close down Sterlite copper smelting unit at Thoothukudi permanently. A delegation of party led by K Balakrishnan, State secretary, met the minister and handed over a petition to him.

The party said a majority of people of Thoothukudi were protesting against the Sterlite plant stating that the environmental hazards caused by the unit were more than the economic benefits from the company. The petition said the order of NGT paving the way for reopening of the unit has created a flutter among locals of Thoothukudi. There is a chance of law and order issue in the district.

Hence, the State government should enact a special ordinance to permanently close down the unit, the party said.

People's desire is govt decision, says Collector

THOOTHUKUDI: Reiterating that the closure order issued by the State was an outcome of a policy decision, collector Sandeep Nanduri told the anti-Sterlite movement leaders and representatives of political parties, during a meeting on Thursday, that the people's desire is the government's decision in the Sterlite issue.

The school was opened in 1992 and the management of the residential school had obtained NOC by submitting a fake land document and other infrastructure. After obtaining NOC from the District Education Officer, Jagatsinghpur, the Board of Secondary Education gave permission to conduct examinations. Meanwhile, the villagers brought allegations of lack of facilities and harassment of students by engaging them in the agriculture field or domestic work.

They alleged that school authorities have pressed the children, including girls, in domestic work and cultivation of paddy crops in the land. The students were also tortured when they refused to do these activities. The parents also alleged that though the strength of the residential school is about 170 from Classes I to X, the stipend of Rs 1,200 was being availed against 300 students.

Acting on the complaint, Collector Yamini Sarangi sought details on the school's infrastructure like toilets, kitchen, drinking water facilities, boundary wall, safety measures and other documents in August.

The school was also asked to comply with the shortcomings within 15 days but the management failed to do so following which the administration obtained permission from the Government and closed the school.

Despite the closure of the school, the management was running it illegally.

Who are these economists?

Thirteen senior economists, including former Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan, IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath and Sajjid Chinoy of JP Morgan. Others are: Abhijit Banerjee, Pranjul Bhandari, Maitreesh Ghatak, Amartya Lahiri, Neelkanth Mishra, Prachi Mishra, Karthik Muralidharan, Rohini Pande, Eswar Prasad and E. Somanathan.

Unfortunately, I've not heard of any of these economists apart from Raghuram Rajan and read none of them before. I read only the world's best economists (with Hayek and Friedman being my benchmark), and no Indian economist comes in that category. And given what these economists have produced in this report, I will not be reading their work anyway.

In this report, they're OK on labour reforms, ordinary on most issues and pretty hopeless on agriculture, education and healthcare. Most importantly, they have totally missed governance reforms although they repeatedly point out the massive failure of government in every field. A major blind spot these economists need to fix.

The Imperative for Strong, Equitable, and Sustainable Growth

India is one of the fastest growing large countries in the world, having grown at an average of almost 7 percent for the last 25 years. There have been many notable reforms over this period - most recently, the co-operative fiscal federalism that has brought the Goods and Services Tax into being, the enactment of the Indian Bankruptcy Code, and the dramatic dis-inflation of recent years, partly as a result of a move to an inflation targeting regime.

While commendable, we should not be satisfied with this. India is still one of the poorest countries in the G-20, and poor countries ought to grow faster because catch-up growth is easier. As important, the benefits of growth in India have been distributed extremely unequally, with top incomes rising much faster than the rest. [Sanjeev: The real issue remains extreme poverty] We have seen new environmental challenges, in the form of sharp increases in both local pollution levels and in CO2 emissions [Sanjeev: CO2 emissions are GOOD, not bad] that, if unchecked, threaten to stall or reverse progress. India is also not creating enough jobs: even though data on employment in India are both low quality and controversial, the recent news that 28 million applied for 90,000 low level railway jobs suggests we are not satisfying the demand for jobs.1 Unfortunately, we are not well-positioned to follow the export-led growth path that allowed many Asian countries to climb out of poverty. Despite abundant cheap labor, we are not part of many global supply chains. Even as global firms seek to diversify away from China so as to reduce political risk, India is rarely seen as an obvious alternative. [That's because socialism has messed up everything in India]

Given India's continental size, it need not follow the export-led path. It will, however, have to ensure that growth generates jobs and incomes across the skill spectrum, in the process

There are tremendous possibilities for reforms that will take us towards faster and more equitable growth, as this report will lay out. However, we have to allocate scarce resources carefully to make sure that there is enough investment in sectors such as infrastructure to create jobs. India's aggregate fiscal deficit (state plus center) is still close to 6.5 percent of GDP, higher than almost any in the G-20, and not significantly lower than levels that existed five years ago. However, our investment rate has fallen sharply in recent years. Despite that, our external financing requirement (as measured by the current account deficit) increased appreciably earlier this year, increasing vulnerability. Moreover, to the extent that India grows while being more reliant on domestic demand than were other Asian emerging markets, it needs a much greater focus on macroeconomic stability than they did. For all these reasons, it needs to prioritize government spending better, focusing on filling clear investment gaps and protecting the vulnerable. It also needs to increase revenues by making the tax system more progressive both in taxes levied as well as through more effective collection from rich non-payers, by bringing more people into the tax net, and by charging users for government services where appropriate.

A key factor in spurring growth will be reforms that alleviate ""supply side"" constraints on growth and job creation. We have to enable both the industrial sector as well as the service sector to operate at larger scale. This involves embracing highly overdue labor reforms including allowing for a rich menu of contracts with workers that allow for more possibilities than just permanent workers and short term contractual labor in firms [Agree]. Such additional contracting possibilities could give workers more job security, give firms the incentive to train and invest in their skilling, even while giving firms more reason to scale up. Similarly, cleaner title to land, as well as a land acquisition process that protects the seller while simplifying acquisition, will reduce the cost of developing land, a critical need if we are to create jobs [Agree, but these economists should ask why Indian governance system can't perform this most basic function]. A more predictable and better regulatory environment - which prunes redundant or unnecessary regulation, carefully sets regulations in new areas necessitated by our development, and enforces regulations effectively and impartially - will create a much better environment for business. We must also improve the capabilities as well as strengthen the independence of our regulatory institutions. [Agree, but why is India's governance in such a mess even today?]

Scale is also key for productivity growth which, in turn, is essential for India to expand its share of world exports. The ongoing reorientation of the United States away from dependence on China provides India with a great opportunity to position itself as a viable alternative for cheap sourcing of goods and parts. But this would require macro and industrial policy reforms of the kind just outlined that remove existing impediments to India becoming a valued partner in global supply chains. Rolling back the recent increases in import tariffs along with a renewed commitment to resisting protective policies would be a good way of signaling this goal. [Agree]

In outlining an economic agenda, we have to recognize government capacity is limited - the number of government employees is often low relative to the tasks they are assigned [Sanjeev: TOTALLY DISAGREE here. The issue is SHEER AND TOTAL INCOMPETENCE AND CORRUPTION]. This is often compounded by low staff motivation and relatedly high absenteeism, as well as inadequate training. Government takes on too much, while delivering too little. Yet for growth to be equitable, a must in our democracy, effective and well-targeted government engagement is essential. [Why are these economists not talking about governance reforms?]

One partial solution is more decentralization, with more powers and funding delegated to the states, and perhaps more importantly, within the states to municipalities and panchayats. It will allow for a much more dynamic decision-making process, resulting in government policies that are more sensitive to local conditions, as well as more local democratic control of officialdom. [This is fine in principle but totally fails to account for the fact that the SAME bureaucracy and political incentives will lead to the SAME outcome.]

The strategic use of technology has the potential to help here as long as we are careful not to make a fetish of technology, are mindful of the human dimension of transactions, and deploy technology with enough safeguards. Technology can make it easier to monitor flows of funds and uses of funding locally, allowing for more devolution of funding, something that has been proposed by previous Finance Commissions. More generally, effective use of technology can also help substitute for government manpower, increase the points of access to government services, help monitor service provision, and reduce leakage in the system.

The debate on whether the public sector should occupy areas that can be done by the private sector will no doubt continue, and there is an obvious case for exiting areas where the public sector contributes little while draining the exchequer and distorting competition. [Sanjeev: Why is government involved in ANY business at all? And this is not a specific recommendation: a motherhood statement] The government should also reconsider its interventions in areas where it adds noise and uncertainty - for instance, the constant fiddling with agricultural import tariffs, the unpredictable closures or opening of export and import windows, and the inability to procure agricultural commodities or release them effectively, does significantly more damage than good to agriculture. While actions are taken in the name of the farmer or the consumer, it is the middleman who often benefits. [Sanjeev: there's nothing wrong with the middleman benefiting in a competitive and open market. But the market is not open. This recommendation fails to recognise the huge blockages on agriculture sector trade.]

Moreover, even when the consumer benefits from high farm production and low agricultural prices, which also help contain inflation, the cost to the farmers can be significant. The case of pulses is revealing. In 2016-17 for example, India witnessed its highest ever domestic production - close to 23 million metric tonnes -- likely reflecting a combination of a normal monsoon after successive droughts and the farmer response to higher market prices and MSPs. This was sufficient to fully satisfy domestic demand. Despite that, India imported a hefty 6.6 million tonnes of pulses (almost a third of total domestic production) at zero import duty - leading to a massive domestic supply glut, and a sharp and sustained fall in pulse prices over the next two years which continues to this day, with prices currently 30% lower than their 2016 peaks.

In addition to getting the government out of areas it should not be in, there is an equally urgent task of strengthening the government in areas it does poorly or is virtually absent in - for instance, regulating and certifying educational or medical service providers, apprehending and successfully prosecuting economic offenders [What about non-economic??!!], or regulating haphazard development and environmental despoliation without blocking growth. [When even murderers like Modi can remain on the loose, then what hope of justice? This was the opportunity to talk about governance reforms.]

For growth to be equitable and sustained, we have to reform our education, skilling, healthcare, and welfare systems significantly. Our record on primary education is dismal, with only about half of the children in class five able to do math or reading at the second-grade level. Parents have responded by increasingly migrating to private schooling, but private schools are only slightly better than government schools, and in their current form will not solve the problem of low education quality. [This is a TERRIBLE comment to make - to downplay private enterprise, the only thing that is working in India for the POOR] It does not get better at higher grades -- our PISA scores were so low that we refused to participate again in that international benchmarking exercise. The poor quality of human capital may already be constraining growth (industry is increasingly concerned about the large and growing skill deficit), limits its inclusiveness and prompt a premature move to replace workers with machines.

Healthcare is another area of major concern. In particular, the public system has largely been abandoned by the patients seeking regular primary care. They prefer paying for private treatment even though many practitioners are unqualified and prescribe the wrong treatment in more than 70% of the cases. This is partly a consequence of the failure of the public sector -- public sector practitioners are often absent, and when present they put very little effort into treatment. It is unclear how the recent Ayushman Bharat insurance scheme, which is the main current effort to deal with healthcare issues, will address this issue. [Sanjeev: with the BLATANT failure of government staring in the face, where is the talk about governance reforms?]

This is especially a problem because dealing with the large growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and the many, only partly-solved, child and maternal health issues, relies heavily on getting frontline providers to lead the charge. Similar concerns apply in the education sector. A failure to ensure high-quality education and health care provision means that a substantial proportion of our future labor force will grow up underequipped with skills needed in the labor market and suffering from the long term consequences of stunting and wasting. Much of the middle-aged population will be dealing with debilitating diseases that could have been prevented or controlled. This obviously limits the sustainability and the inclusiveness of growth.

The environment is, of course, a critical challenge to the continuation of our growth and to the extent to which growth translates into improved quality of life. Many of our cities are increasingly experiencing levels of pollution that border on the toxic. If we cannot manage the environment at our present level of development, greater growth will make matters far worse. [Sanjeev: once again, this points to severe government failure - but no mention of the need for governance reforms] The consequences of environmentally myopic policies are reflected, for example, in the rapidly falling water table in many parts of the country, which threatens the sustainability of our agriculture. Relatedly, climate change is already having very significant effects on productivity and the quality of lives in India and we need to be at the forefront of global efforts to combat it. [Sanjeev: this claim is, of course, CRAP]

That our current policies do not add up to an inclusive and sustainable growth agenda is reflected in growing agitation across our society. Agrarian unrest, and the constant demand for loan waivers, is now compounded by demands for some form of government support from sections of society that are nowhere near the poorest. This reflects Indians' growing anxiety about their future and that of their children in an increasingly winner-take-all society, where they often end up on the losing side. Our welfare schemes like the MGNREGA and Pradhan Mantri Gramin Awas Yojana are mostly directed towards the very poor (the one exception being the public distribution system), so they do not serve the purpose of protecting those outside that group. Without stronger, sustainable, and inclusive growth we simply do not have the resources to expand our welfare schemes significantly, [Sanjeev: BUT WHY SHOULD WELFARE BE EXPANDED?] but if we do generate that growth, not only will there be less demand for welfare but there will be more resources to service any demand.

The bottom line is that while we have performed creditably in the last 25 years across different administrations, we cannot be complacent about our economic challenges. They are mounting. We are a group of economists, each with different specializations and interests, who have come together to offer proposals for the way ahead. Some of us are based in India, some outside, but we are all closely engaged in, and concerned about, India's development. We do not belong to any party, nor are we from the government. We hope this non-partisan analysis of our situation, while not intended to be comprehensive, will help spur debate as India moves to elections. The rest of this note summarizes our proposals, and offers our consensus view on some of the key issues we face. We then append individual notes by members of the group, which offers more details of individual views and proposals. Each note reflects the view of the author(s) in their personal capacity, and does not necessarily represent the institution they are affiliated with.

Macroeconomic stability: a prerequisite to sustainable growth and job creation

India's economic history is replete with the same lesson: preserving and protecting macroeconomic stability is an essential prerequisite to strong and sustained growth. Every time macro stability has been traded off to boost growth, the economy has been pushed towards a crisis, the consequences of which have undermined the very growth that was the initial policy focus.

Ensuring macroeconomic stability has at least three elements to it: maintaining low and stable inflation, ensuring the consolidated fiscal deficit leaves enough space for private investment, and ensuring that the current account deficit is sustainable and can be financed largely through stable capital inflows, to help insulate the economy from sudden swings in global sentiment. High and variable inflation constitutes a regressive tax, with the poor bearing the biggest brunt, since their incomes are typically least indexed to inflation. It also dissuades foreign investors from investing in rupee assets. Similarly, large and unsustainable fiscal/external imbalances impart significant macroeconomic and financial market uncertainty, push up borrowing costs and risk premia in the economy and threaten financial stability. All this impedes private and public investment.

Fiscal consolidation to creating space for more investment

The economy has made significant progress in combating inflation in recent years. Over the last 4 years inflation has averaged just over 4% versus almost 10% in the previous five years, and household inflation expectations are getting progressively anchored. The same, however, cannot be said of the fiscal side.

While the center's fiscal deficit has been steadily brought down, the combined deficit of the states - even after adjusting for UDAY - has continued to widen in recent years and, thereby, largely undone the center's consolidation. Consequently, the consolidated fiscal deficit in 2017-18, stood above 6.5%, not very different from its levels five years ago. Our primary suggestions to make progress on this difficult issue:

De-risking the external sector

India's heavy dependence on oil imports often results in ""boom-bust"" cycles on the balance of payments when crude prices change. For example, the CAD narrowed to 0.7% of GDP in 2016-17 as crude prices fell and was then tracking close to 3% of GDP in 2018 when crude prices bounced back up. This resulted in a large balance of payments surplus in the first instance and a large deficit in the second. These sharp swings complicate monetary policy, as well as exchange rate and liquidity management, and create undue external and fiscal volatility (since oil prices also alter the fiscal math). We should:

Fixing the Stressed Sectors

Careful but quick policy reforms are needed for the sectors/areas that are stressed. These include agriculture, infrastructure (including power), exports and banking. There are common themes in any revival. Typically, we need to redeploy government effort in each of these sectors, focusing it on areas where it is truly needed to play an enabling role, while freeing the sector of excessive bureaucracy and intervention, which results in inadequate access to markets, distorted prices, and poor incentives. While the recent focus on improving India's ranking on the World Bank's Doing Business measures is commendable, we should guard against the temptation to focus on the specifics of the World Bank measures, while neglecting the broader impediments to producing in India. [Agreed] We now consider each of these sectors in more detail.

Agriculture & the rural economy

We need deep rooted transformation of agriculture, treating it not as a sector that has to be propped up through repeated sops, but as an engine of India's job creation and growth. For that, it is imperative that we thoroughly reform agricultural and land policies. In particular, a key source of agrarian distress in recent years has been that the terms-of-trade confronting farmers has turned progressively more adverse, partly as a result of policies to combat food inflation. While low inflation is desirable in itself, the impact on farmers also needs to be taken into account. A policy priority should be to reduce distortions in farm product prices as well as input prices. Another important enabler is technology, both in educating and informing farmers, as well as in opening access to markets. Some specific proposals include

Infrastructure

Accelerating the pace of the infrastructure build-out will help in a number of ways; it will create jobs in construction and new economic activity around the resulting roads, ports, airports, railways, and housing; it will promote inclusion as it connects interior rural areas to markets; it will make our exports (and import-competing manufacturing) more competitive as it reduces input costs such as land (as cheaper areas are connected) and power, as well as improves logistics and reduces transportation costs; it will open up India to both domestic and foreign tourism, which can be a tremendous source of semi- skilled jobs. This will require

Power

Despite having some of the largest reserves of coal, as well as having substantial unutilized power generation capacity, India is both short of coal as well as short of power. These are policy self-goals, arising from both the dominant presence of government in coal mining and power distribution as well as populist impulses in pricing. Nevertheless, our low base allows us to choose a path that is both more energy efficient as well as less polluting as we reform the system for the twenty first century. For this we need:

Exports

India's non-oil, non-gold current account has deteriorated by almost 3% of GDP in the last three years, suggesting an urgent need to improve the underlying competitiveness of the tradable sector. Boosting exports should be the lynchpin of that strategy. [Sanjeev: Any economist who says this is simply not a good economist. Refer to Kautilya, and the best economists who agree that IMPORTS are the key. Let consumption be the focus of economists, and exports are a minor subset of this production process.] The existing constraints in the export sector appear to be reflective of more general problems in manufacturing: low scale of production, low productivity, bureaucratic impediments, high cost of inputs like land and power. We have suggested ways to address these earlier. In addition,

Financial Sector

Given the non-performing asset (NPA) build up in the banking system, it is imperative we make the banking system more robust and well capitalized [Sanjeev: HOW? By taxpayer subsidy??], expand its capacity to extend credit, and improve incentives to lend to the most productive sectors. While the recent travails of the NBFCs are a matter of concern, some of their problems stem from an overly rapid expansion of their balance sheets as they grew to substitute for banks. Stability in the banking system will help spread stability to other parts of the financial system as, of course, will the reverse.

The main challenges for the banking sector are to improve governance, transparency, and incentives in the banking system. Key measures should include

The non-bank financial sector needs a strong banking system as well as deep equity and bond markets, supported by liquid secondary markets and a robust regulatory and legal infrastructure. Key priorities include:

Making growth inclusive and sustainable

A good job is often the most important form of inclusion. In addition, we need to help individuals obtain the human capabilities that will enable them to secure and hold that job, as well as protect those who cannot get jobs. Let us now turn to proposals on inclusion.

Education

The single greatest limitation of the Indian education system is its inability to deliver universal functional literacy and numeracy in primary school. Several studies show that students who fail to achieve basic skills by the end of class 3 learn very little in subsequent years even if they are enrolled in school. Our top education policy priority is therefore:

The Right to Education (RTE) Bill's input-based approach to education quality was unlikely to succeed given the extensive evidence that most school inputs are neither necessary nor sufficient for improving learning outcomes. RTE has led to an unnecessary and disruptive closure of several low-cost private schools that parents were choosing of their own accord. In many cases, even government schools are in violation of these input-based norms. We therefore recommend:

While improvement in schooling is a key building block to education, we cannot neglect either vocational training/skilling or college education. Both will be critical to providing our youth with the wherewithal for the jobs of the future. High quality research universities will be essential, both to train the teachers for our colleges as well as to fuel the innovation needed for the next stage of our growth. [Sanjeev: GET THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF THESE]

Dealing with the skills shortage

There is wide recognition that the current models of publicly subsidized skilling are not performing very well even though skills are extremely scarce. What seems to work better is the skilling provided by private firms that are training their own labor force. However, under current laws, firms can employ workers for up to one year after which they either have to fire them or make them permanent. Since there are significant costs and inflexibilities in making workers permanent, many firms keep workers on short contracts and terminate them before they can become permanent. This state of affairs serves neither the firm, which has to hire new workers frequently and has no incentive to train them, nor the worker, who has no security of employment, and who is not trained. At the same time, since the government is often the only employer that offers secure jobs, young people spend their twenties applying for these jobs rather than working. However, these jobs are extremely expensive thanks partly to the munificence of the Pay Commissions and therefore there are too few of them. As a result, a cynic could argue that the government and the private sector lack manpower, while young people sit at home filling applications and preparing for tests. We propose that:

Women's labor force participation

There are clearly both supply-side issues-families not allowing women to work, women feeling disempowered -- and demand-side issues -- lack of women-friendly jobs in the private sector as well as discrimination. Some useful first steps here:

Healthcare

There is much to be done to reform the healthcare system in India. Increasingly, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer play a much bigger role, so healthcare needs to be reoriented to address these.

Environment

Even while business complains about the difficulty of getting environmental approvals, the quality of our environment leaves much to be desired and with climate change looming we should be thinking in terms of reaching peak emissions within the next decade or so and then sharply reducing them. For all of this we need to get more professional about the environment and climate change, as well as more transparent about the regulatory process.

Social Protection

India has more than 400 separate social protection schemes. A vast majority of them are funded at very low levels and do very little. However, they absorb some amount of bureaucratic capacity. And despite the wide variety of schemes available on paper, as the many protests make clear, people do not feel protected. In particular while MGNREGA provides some support for the rural landless, most other relatively poor people have only the PDS to fall back on. This is one reason that it is so difficult to remove any government scheme, however inefficient. There is a clear need to create a reliable pipeline for providing compensation for losers, as we move towards a more rational system of social protection. The Direct Benefits Transfer is a good starting point and building on it by being credible in compensating losers will be key. Specifically we suggest"

Sterlite Chief Executive Officer P Ramnath said after getting the TNPCB permission, it would take about two months for making the plant operational.

""We have already approached the TNPCB. As per the NGT order, they (TNPCB) have been given three weeks to renew the consent. We have also made our request to the TNPCB,"" he told reporters here.

The state government had, on May 28, ordered the TNPCB to seal and ""permanently"" close the mining group's copper plant following violent protests over pollution concerns.

On an appeal by the company, the NGT on December 15 quashed the order, holding that it was ""non-sustainable"" and ""unjustified"".

The state government had said it would file an appeal in the Supreme Court even as opposition parties faulted it for the development.

Ramnath claimed that the company had been receiving ""massive support"" from locals for reopening the plant.

""...we have been receiving massive support from (people of) around 15 villages,"" he said.

The CEO said around Rs 100 crore would be spent in Tuticorin towards funding infrastructure schemes, an offer the company's counsel made before the NGT during the hearing.

Saying that the plant was inaccessible for the past six months, Ramnath said, ""We have to be given permission to enter the premises. For the last 6 months, there has been no steps taken towards 'care and maintenance'...We will take some time...around two months(to reopen the plant).""

On December 15, the National Green Tribunal set aside the Tamil Nadu government order for closure of mining company Vedanta Ltd's sterlite copper plant at Tuticorin, which was at the centre of massive protests over alleged pollution, saying it was ""non sustainable"" and ""unjustified"".

A bench headed by NGT Chairperson A K Goel asked the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) to pass a fresh order of renewal of consent and authorisation to handle hazardous substances, subject to appropriate conditions for protection of environment in accordance with law within three weeks from December 15.

The company said it had committed to undertake plantation of one million trees across the city (Tuticorin) and initiate a youth development scheme that includes employment, sports and entrepreneurship. Smart school, a world class hospital, desalination plant are among the slew of initiatives announced by Sterlite.

The green panel has said the company should spend within three years Rs 100 crore on welfare of inhabitants of the area.

The bench also suggested that the company take steps for safeguarding environment, like creating a dedicated website where the stakeholders can lodge their environment related grievances.

Earlier in April, TNPCB had rejected Sterlite's plea to renew the 'Consent To Operate' certification, saying the company had not complied with the stipulated conditions.Thirteen people were killed in police firing on May 22-23 and several injured after the protests against Sterlite turned violent in Tuticorin."

According to him, as ordered by NGT, the company has already set up a committee to monitor each and every project independently to ensure all developments take place at a faster place. ""We are waiting for the positive response from the state government,"" he said. Even if the state government moves SC against NGT order, we will fight it legally only, he said further.

Responding to volley of questions, Ramnath said, on an average the production loss per month is estimated to be around 30,000 tonne. ""The copper demand is growing at 9% per annum. Since our plant closed six months ago, the sulphuric acid cost has gone up three times from '3,000 a tonne to '12,000 a tonne.

Over the years, the company has invested around '600 crore on the environmental aspects and the plant is boast of one of the best production technologies, he pointed out.

He further said that due to closure of our factory, nearly 4,000 direct and contract jobs are at lost and around 25,000 indirect jobs are at stake. Nearly 1,000 trucks plying in Tuticorin for transporting goods from our factory to various places, including Tuticorin port have been left in the lurch for want of job.

The unit has been shut since March 27, first for maintenance and then due to orders from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB). Last Thursday, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) set aside the state government's later order to permanently close the unit, as not legally justified. Instead, it directed the Board to issue an order of renewal, subject to findings in three weeks, and asked the state government to restore electricity for the unit's operation.

Around Rs 30 billion was spent on establishing the plant, which catered to 35-40 per cent of copper demand in India. Prices of copper in the country had risen by around 20 per cent following the closure, the company had told NGT.

The estimated production loss from closure has been around 30,000 tonnes of refined copper. Around 25,000 families were allegedly affected, as were downstream industries, he said. The company says its estimated daily loss has been around Rs 50 million. It has also pointed to a surge in prices of the products from there -- sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid and copper -- in the period. Import of copper had jumped, it says, from around 12,000 tonnes to 30,000 tonnes a month.

On Thursday, the company announced it would set up a hospital and a school in the district, and supply water to 15 villages, as part of Rs 1 billion to be spent for welfare of inhabitants in the region, as mentioned in the NGT order. The Tribunal has directed Vedanta to spend the amount over three years -- it had been suggested by the latter during the hearing.

The background is a series of protests by locals at pollution from the unit and the death of 13 persons in police firing during related violence (on May 22).

The company has also announced the planting of a million trees and a youth development scheme that includes employment, sports and entrepreneurship.

It has also implemented measures the judiciary suggested in a 2013 order, including a system to register emission levels, air quality systems and interlocks which would stop the entire manufacturing if sulphur dioxide emissions exceed permissible limits. The company has spent Rs 5-6 billion on implementing safety measures in the recent past, said the CEO.

The state government had said the unit should be closed for breaching environmental rules. It had alleged Sterlite did not present groundwater analysis reports or removed copper slag stored around the Uppar river or analysed parameters of heavy metals in the ambient air quality around the unit. The NGT rejected all these grounds."

Sterlite Chief Executive Officer P Ramnath said after getting the TNPCB permission, it would take about two months for making the plant operational.

""We have already approached the TNPCB. As per the NGT order, they (TNPCB) have been given three weeks to renew the consent. We have also made our request to the TNPCB,"" he told reporters here.

The state government had, on May 28, ordered the TNPCB to seal and ""permanently"" close the mining group's copper plant following violent protests over pollution concerns.

On an appeal by the company, the NGT on December 15 quashed the order, holding that it was ""non-sustainable"" and ""unjustified"".

The state government had said it would file an appeal in the Supreme Court even as opposition parties faulted it for the development.

Ramnath claimed that the company had been receiving ""massive support"" from locals for reopening the plant.

""...we have been receiving massive support from (people of) around 15 villages,"" he said.

The CEO said around Rs 100 crore would be spent in Tuticorin towards funding infrastructure schemes, an offer the company's counsel made before the NGT during the hearing.

Saying that the plant was inaccessible for the past six months, Ramnath said, ""We have to be given permission to enter the premises. For the last 6 months, there has been no steps taken towards 'care and maintenance'...We will take some time...around two months(to reopen the plant).""

On December 15, the National Green Tribunal set aside the Tamil Nadu government order for closure of mining company Vedanta Ltd's sterlite copper plant at Tuticorin, which was at the centre of massive protests over alleged pollution, saying it was ""non sustainable"" and ""unjustified"".

A bench headed by NGT Chairperson A K Goel asked the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) to pass a fresh order of renewal of consent and authorisation to handle hazardous substances, subject to appropriate conditions for protection of environment in accordance with law within three weeks from December 15.

The company said it had committed to undertake plantation of one million trees across the city (Tuticorin) and initiate a youth development scheme that includes employment, sports and entrepreneurship.

Smart school, a world class hospital, desalination plant are among the slew of initiatives announced by Sterlite.

The green panel has said the company should spend within three years Rs 100 crore on welfare of inhabitants of the area.

The bench also suggested that the company take steps for safeguarding environment, like creating a dedicated website where the stakeholders can lodge their environment related grievances.

Earlier in April, TNPCB had rejected Sterlite's plea to renew the 'Consent To Operate' certification, saying the company had not complied with the stipulated conditions.

Following the recent National Green Tribunal (NGT) directive to reopen the Sterlite copper plant in Thoothukudi, the company has reapplied with the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) for consent to operate (CTO).

If given permission, the company will be able to restart operations in two months after some basic maintenance work, said P Ramnath, CEO, Sterlite Copper. It's a a big 'if', as the State government has announced it will appeal against the NGT order in the Supreme Court.

In February, the TNPCB rejected the company's CTO application for 2018-2023 due to its alleged failure to comply with the conditions imposed at the time of the previous renewal of consent order. This was the start of a series of events that led eventually to the closure of the plant.

On May 23, the TNPCB ordered the closure of the Sterlite plant with immediate effect, and directed Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) to disconnect power supply to the unit. This came two days after 15 people were killed in police firing on anti-Sterlite protesters.

Speaking to newspersons here on Thursday, Ramnath said the first thing the company needs is permission to enter the premises to examine the plant and take up various maintenance works. ""Once done, we will be able to start the plant in two months,"" he said.

Asked if the TN government's stiff opposition would come in the way of reopening, he said: ""We will abide by the court decision. We heard that the State government plans to approach the Supreme Court against the NGT order. We will face that.""

The six-month shutdown of the plant has impacted various stakeholders, including the VOC Port, which saw a significant decline in cargo throughput, he said. The closure also hit over 1,000 truck operators, he said.

Ramnath also announced plans to invest ₹100 crore to set up a 'smart' school and a hospital in the port town of Thoothukudi. He further said the company proposes to turn Thoothukudi into a 'clean and green' city by planting one million trees.

It plans to set up a desalination plant that was originally planned five years ago at a cost of ₹150 crore but stalled due to non-availability of land."

""Our plant has not been under maintenance for over five months. We are still awaiting permission to enter the plant. Once that is granted, it will take about one to two months for the company to begin its operations,"" Ramnath said.

In the wake of the police firing on 22 and 23 May that killed 13 people protesting against the plant's shutdown, the state government ordered a permanent closure of the copper smelting unit.

On Saturday, while passing its order, the NGT directed the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to pass fresh order of renewal of consent and authorisation to handle hazardous substances, ""subject to appropriate conditions for protection of environment in accordance with law within three weeks from today.""

"51","1022497333","2018-12-19","http://www.asianage.com/life/more-features/201218/mumbai-made-by-mills-migrants.html","Mumbai made by mills, migrants","The Asian Age",FALSE,"Filmmaker couple Anjali Monteiro and K.P. Jayasankar talk about their film Saacha, which is on display at the ongoing biennale.

Anjali Monteiro and K.P. Jayasankar moved to Mumbai (then Bombay) in the early 70s. Since then, they have been there witnessing each and every change of the city -- be it the Great Bombay Textile Strike in the 80s or the Bombay Riots in the 90s. Like many early migrants, they saw the cultural and political landscape of the city, the birth place of working class trade union, changing with time. These experiences led the filmmaker couple to create Saacha, a 49-minute film on migrant life in Mumbai, which is on display at the ongoing Kochi Muziris Biennale. At the biennale, the film is exhibited along with poems of Narayan Surve, a renowned Marathi poet, and paintings of popular artist Sudhir Patwardhan that rhyme with the theme.

""We started filming Saacha in 2000 and completed it in 2001,"" says Anjali. Both Anjali and Jayasankar are professors at School of Media and Cultural Studies, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, and are documentary makers and authors.

An adaptation of Saacha was an installation at the art exhibition Project Space: Word. Sound. Power. at the Tate Modern, London, in 2013; and at Khoj, New Delhi, in 2014.

""While living in Mumbai, one important milestone we witnessed was the textile strike, which ultimately led to the closure of most of the mills that were located on a vast land in the centre of the city. A culture had been formed around those mills. Once the mills shut down, it led to the erosion of that way of life. As filmmakers, who have been living in this city for a long time, we wanted to chronicle that. Thus Saacha happened,"" explains Anjali. ""For the biennale, we just technically enhanced the film.""

Words, images and music form the crux of Saacha, which uses loom as a metaphor. ""Loom is a space where dynamic forces come together to weave fabric. Hence, it is used as the metaphor here,"" says Anjali. And, vibrant, thought-provoking music has always been a part of the Leftist movement. ""We started off with the works of Sudhir, who has been documenting urban life for a long time. Then, we came across Narayan, whose poems are direct and powerful. His words reflect the same theme, but from a different vantage point,"" says Anjali, while Jayasankar adds, ""He was part of the working class culture. He was abandoned as a child. It was a mill worker who found him and raised him. Narayan was not very educated, but went on to become one of the most popular Marathi poets.""

Sudhir Patwardhan's paintings show two faces of Mumbai

English and Malayalam translations of his poem are plastered on the walls for visitors. Sudhir's paintings, which have two dimensions, show how the face of the city changed. At one side, we see workers travelling on a train; the other side shows concrete jungle that came later.

What the couple tries to communicate through their politically charged work is the significance of migrant labour in Mumbai's growth, perhaps, in all great cities' development. And, the situation goes on even now, which makes their work relevant even after all these years. ""Kerala is a classic example of migrant force. You can see it around us now,"" says Jayasankar, a native of Kochi.

Saacha further tells us how a community that contributed to the growth of Mumbai was marginalised by other forces that overtook their space. ""We want their talent, not them. That is our attitude towards them,"" says Jayasankar. ""If Mumbai is a safe city now, it is because of those working class culture. Because mills ran for 24 hours, and there were people and food outlets on streets day and night,"" he adds.

Saacha is just one element of the couple's efforts towards this issue. Rest of their research materials is available on millmumbai.tiss.edu.

Anjali and Jayasankar, who find participation at the biennale as a great honour, say, ""It is a nice experience. We are so happy to be here and have vowed ourselves to visit the coming biennales as well,"" they conclude. Saacha is exhibited at the first floor of Aspinwall House, Fort Kochi."

But justice still seems only half done.

The life sentence handed down by the Delhi High Court to Sajjan Kumar of the Congress party has, no doubt, brought a modicum of closure to victims of the 1984 anti-Sikh massacre; but it's not nearly enough considering the quantum of reprisal killings in Delhi and elsewhere, purposefully instigated by some Congress party members like Kumar.

Jagdish Kaur, one of Kumar's principal accusers, tersely termed the sentence a ""little balm applied to long time scars"". She also resignedly declared that at least one high-profile individual accused in the Sikh killings would now be jailed, in what remains the most reprehensible episode in independent India's history, in which the Congress-ruled state turned avenger.

Kaur's son and husband were amongst her five family members clubbed to death and set alight by marauding Hindu mobs under Kumar's instigation, within hours of Indira Gandhi's assassination on October 31, 1984, by her two Sikh bodyguards. Their only sin, like that of some 3,000 others like them in Delhi, was that they were easily identifiable as Sikhs, and hence fair game for mobs, some led by Congressmen, to be slaughtered.

Kumar's comeuppance also took 34 years in coming, or a time frame of one generation-and-three-quarters, to adjudicate in India's lugubrious judicial system. The tortuous lead-up to sentencing the 73-year old former Congress parliamentarian to spend the rest of his natural life in jail, too, was riddled with crafty legal and procedural wrangles manipulated by his political colleagues for decades.

Advertising

At times, the outcome of Kumar's guilt appeared chimerical as the maze of 10 inquiry commissions and investigative panels established by successive administrations into the 1984 massacre failed in indicting either him or other culpable Congressmen. A lower court even acquitted Kumar, but miraculously a dogged Central Bureau of Investigation challenged the exoneration in 1990 and, despite impediments, pursued his indictment all the way to the Delhi High Court.

Understandably, senior Congress members have distanced themselves from Kumar after his sentencing. Some feebly reasoned that he had been adequately penalised by being denied a party ticket in recent years to contest elections, whilst others said neither the Congress nor the Gandhi family had any role in the 1984 strife.

They seemed to be in total denial of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's appalling justification of the Sikh massacre by publicly declaring that the earth shakes when a great tree falls. But more importantly, these Congressmen in times of competitive pogrom politics, discounted Manmohan Singh's remorse for the 1984 Sikh killings in Parliament in 2005.

""I have no hesitation in apologising to the Sikh community (for the 1984 carnage)"", Singh declared in the Rajya Sabha in response to an Opposition-sponsored motion demanding that the prime minister seek forgiveness from the country for the inexcusable strife.

Singh went further by stating that he apologised not only to the Sikh community, but also to the Indian nation, because what occurred in 1984 was the ""negation"" of the concept of nationhood enshrined in the Constitution. ""On behalf of our government and on behalf of the entire people of this country, I bow my head in shame that such a thing took place"", said the country's first Sikh prime minister.

Congress president Rahul Gandhi, too, disavowed his party's role in the 1984 butchery. Speaking at the London School of Economics earlier this year, he categorically declared that his party was not involved. But with Kumar now sentenced, he, too, will have to do a rethink, in addition to strategising on ways to counter allegations regarding Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath's involvement in the 1984 killings. Witnesses alleging the MP chief minister's involvement are still around and as dogged as Jagdish Kaur and her family.

The wave of ethnic cleansing that consumed Delhi for 72 hours like a prairie fire within hours of Indira Gandhi's assassination was terrifying. During these three days, Sikhs were hunted down, corralled and killed. The city's entire law and order machinery had willfully collapsed at the behest of the federal and local administrations, and the capital was besieged by marauding mobs, including those led by bloodthirsty Congressmen, armed with voters' lists to target Sikh households.

Policemen magically disappeared and the handful who were visible were unwilling, or under orders not to open fire upon cowardly mobs that drew encouragement solely from their numbers and assurances of immunity from prosecution. Instances of Sikhs being necklaced were common, as rubber tyres doused with petrol were jammed around their chests and arms and set alight. The victims took some 20 minutes to die.

None of the army units summoned from cantonments around the capital were provided necessary help, guidance or logistic direction by the local authorities. Neither were the bewildered soldiers, treated little better than riot police in olive green, issued any directives or shoot-to-kill orders, obligatory under the circumstances, to quell the mobs.

And whilst unbridled mayhem proliferated unimpeded across Delhi's Sikh neighbourhoods, the killing of some 350 Dalit Sikhs, including women and children, over 48 hours in the trans-Yamuna resettlement Trilokpuri colony was, without doubt, the most brutal. The charred and hacked remains of the hundreds that perished in Trilokpuri's Block 32 on the smoky and dank November 2 evening revealed an unbelievable tale of slaughter, which I, as a reporter for this newspaper, chanced upon, accompanied by two colleagues.

The massacre took place, uninterrupted, in two narrow alleyways no more than 130 metres long, with one-room tenements on either side. It lasted over 48 hours with the murderers, never ever caught, taking breaks for meals before returning and resuming their senseless slaughter.

Thirty-four years later, the memory and stench from slain bodies and hacked limbs piled high with mounds of hair still haunts my senses. HKL Bhagat, the alleged architect of the Trilokpuri massacre, was indicted by the Nanavati Commission, but died in 2005. The families of the Trilokpuri victims will never have the closure that the court delivered to Nirpreet Kaur, Jagdish Kaur and Jagsher Singh, who testified against Sajjan Kumar.

Advertising

The judges passing sentence on Kumar sagely declared that the Sikh killings in Delhi and elsewhere in November 1984 were ""crimes against humanity"", a massacre that will continue to shock the collective conscience of society for a long time to come. It most definitely will, but in the sentencing, justice seems to be only half done. More remains."

My parents had always given me the freedom to travel alone and explore new places but this time, it was tough to convince them about my plans. To reinforce their faith in me to travel to a border area was difficult, even more so to reaffirm that I will be safe.

Upon reaching, I was greeted with green pastures surrounded by an expanse of meadows. Not shockingly, I was taken in by Rajouri's exquisite beauty, and a history that harks back to many centuries; even finding mention in the travelogue of Chinese traveler Hiuen Tsang (who visited the town in 632 AD).

The same area is now marked by conflict, militancy, and everyday encounters. Strident and grueling politics of the government has hardened the line of differences between locals and the Indian state.

The unexpected presence of Kashmiri students in militant ranks has sparked a debate about the hostility against the State and the feeling of exclusion felt by Kashmiris.

I had expected to be presented with a reality which we seem to be familiar with - that there isn't an inclination to study, and students are actively taking up arms against the web of deceit spun by the government. But,

I asked myself why. That query led me to a more pertinent question - was there widespread disappointment amongst the people regarding the educational development of the state?

I was eager to get these answers. Only, they were not what I had expected.

My travel to Rajouri was largely secured and ensured by a professor from Baba Ghulam Shah Badshah University (BGSBU). Here was a university between lush green forests; disconnected from the city. It catered to a large number of students ­who were mostly from Kashmir, especially its farthest corners.

Despite initial reservations from both sides, I started interacting with the students enrolled there. Little did I know, it would shatter my pre-conceived notions of what I had heard about the university's troubled past, and Kashmir itself.

Beyond the compassion and warmth of everyone I met, what I had learned (and unlearned) about Kashmir surpassed my expectations.

Our discussions varied from exposure to Kashmiri culture to recent agitations against political authorities. The latter required discretion from both sides. Yet, there was a consensus on the degraded condition of their education system. As a student told me,

""My admission got delayed because I received my degree certificates late. These late results amongst many other factors are reasons behind frustration amongst the student community.""

Another source of frustration is the difficulty faced by the introduction of English education to their system. English language is dynamic and evolving, I was told, while Kashmiri is static. As a result, people are getting disconnected with their culture. To overcome these challenges, doctoral students are taking it upon themselves to keep their native language alive.

A student told me, ""since our language and culture is deeply embedded into our lives, some of the students are leading the programs of reviving their roots by teaching Kashmiri to primary and secondary school students.""

In fact, the university has a centre for cultural revival that teaches Urdu and Gujjari as well.

The media reports often about the closure of educational institutions due to the subversive activities across the state, that causes instability and miseries amongst the people living in border areas. But there are various other lesser known problems.

For example, I was told that there is a lack of funds provided to the state universities, complicating the matter further. This has a damaging effect on the availability of standard reading material, which has made it difficult to sustain academic spaces.

It was shocking to learn that doctoral students had barely heard about JStor and Scribd, two online databases that us students liberally use back in Delhi for academic papers.

At best, I realised how modest and sincere Kashmiri youth were. They shared their sentiments with me through which I got a glimpse of their predicament and sense of uncertainty regarding their future. The reality of Kashmiri students and their plight is far detached from the drawing room conversations outsiders luxuriously indulge in.

There are many grievances which have to be immediately addressed by the Indian government since these activities are affecting the psyche of the Kashmiri students. Till then, through cultural revival and a diverse student body, these students bring alive their aim of nation building, finding light at the end of a long tunnel.

For Ravi Kiran, childhood was not an easy one, as his father, an industrial worker in Hyderabad, lost his job in 2007, prompting his mother to take up odd jobs to run the household. In such a situation, schooling became a distant dream for Ravi, till his family learnt about ICFAI Republic School - renamed as Ekalavya School in 2013 - that provides education to underprivileged children charging minimal fee.

Today, Ravi works as a data analyst at Wipro Technologies in the city. He owes a lot to the school, where he learnt the skills and went on to became a successful software developer.

Located in Fatehnagar in Hyderabad, the walls of Ekalavya School echo with many such success stories. Run by IIM-Ahmedabad Alumni Association (IIMAAA) Hyderabad Chapter in partnership with RBL Bank, the school in the current batch has 310 students spread across class 1-10th, of which 45% are girls. The school will be rechristened as Udbhav RBL School from the next session starting in April 2019.

The association runs another Udbhav School in Rasool Pura area in partnership with Coromandel International. The school has 523 students that have an average family income of Rs 6000-8000 a month. Their parents have to pay 10-15% of the school expenses, while the rest of the expenses are borne by the association. Giving a thrust on girl child education-the schools now has 56% of female students.

Over the years, the students at both the schools have made a mark, by winning accolades in academics, sports and other co-curricular activities. For instance, Snagannagari Pravilika, class X student from Udbhav School has won several awards in girls power lifting championship at various competitions held at district level, state level and national level in the past two years. Pravilika says that the school provided her with the facility of smart classes and, hence, she was able to dedicate extra time for practising the sport.

Both the schools, located in Rasool Pura and Fatehnagar, had been taken over by IIMAAA when they were on the brink of closure after death of ICFAI founder N J Yasaswi.

""Both our schools have only one philosophy-all the children should get the same opportunity. Our school provides all modern facilities including music lessons, dance classes, karate training, English speaking classes and all sports activities,"" IIMAAA member T Muralidharan told Education Times.

The student/teacher ratio at both the schools is 23, which Muralidharan says, is a very good average compared to other government and private schools of Hyderabad.

The association is also raising a corpus in case the IIIMAA is not there, the operations at both the school don't come to a halt. ""In next 10 years, we plan to raise a corpus of Rs 100 crores so that we can run at least 25 schools across India with over 10000 students,"" he says."

R.S. 15:587.1(C) which, in turn, covers various crimes including, but not necessarily limited to, first degree murder, second degree murder, manslaughter, various sex crimes, kidnapping, criminal neglect of family, contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile, cruelty to juveniles, and child desertion. The sex crimes include, but are not limited to, rape, female genital mutilation, prostitution, pandering, carnal knowledge, ""crime against nature,"" voyeurism, and obscenity.

Act 634 adds to existing law to prohibit hiring any person as a teacher who submits fraudulent documentation to the Louisiana Department of Education or Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (BESE) as part of an application for a teaching certificate or other teaching authorization, even if that individual neither was convicted of nor entered a no contest plea for a crime listed under La.

SB 209: This state senate bill would provide additional protections to workers facing massive layoffs. The legislature has not passed the bill.

SB 209, the ""Louisiana Worker Adjustment and Retraining Act"" or the ""Louisiana WARN Act,"" would require ""large corporations"" to warn employees of impending ""mass layoffs.""

The Louisiana WARN Act would not supersede the federal WARN Act of 1988, which applies to employers who employ 100 or more employees. The Louisiana WARN Act would apply to companies who employ between 50 and 99 employees.

The Louisiana WARN Act defines ""mass layoffs"" as the closure of a workplace (or portion thereof), modernization of a workplace (or portion thereof), relocation of a workplace (of portion thereof), or implementation or any management policy, in which the employer permanently reduces the number of employees by 50 or more during any 90-day period.

SB 209 would require the employer to refrain from a mass layoff until 60 days after the employer serves written notice of the layoff to each of the following: affected employees, the executive director of the Louisiana Workforce Commission (LWC), members of the state Senate who represent the parish (i.e. county) in which the workplace is located, members of the state House of Representatives who represent the parish in which the workplace is located, and the president of the parish-governing authority.

SB 209 would provide for limited exceptions to the 60-day notice period, such as mass layoffs due to natural disasters (such as a flood), disputes between labor unions and employers, layoffs at a construction site or other temporary workplace, layoffs that are the result of seasonal factors, layoffs which occur as a result of the completion of a particular project or undertaking where the affected employees were hired with the understanding that their employment was limited to the duration of the project or undertaking, or business circumstances not reasonably foreseeable at the time SB 209 would have required notice.

An employer violating the Louisiana WARN Act would face liability for lost wages and health benefits, as well as reasonable attorney's fees and costs, but SB 209 limits damages to a maximum of 60 days.

SB 209 is still in the Senate.

HB 126: The FLSA already requires that an employer shall compensate a tipped employee at a rate of $2.13 per hour, and if the employee fails to earn sufficient tips to bring his or her hourly earnings to the federal minimum wage rate, the employer shall pay the difference to ensure that the employee earns at least the federal minimum wage. HB 126 would create a state minimum wage rate for tipped employees and set it at the rate set by the FLSA. HB 126 would define a tipped employee as an employee who regularly earns at least $30 per month in tips.

HB 126 is still pending in the House Committee on Labor and Industrial Relations.

HB 605: Louisiana requires that women employed as public employees be entitled to the same compensation as men employed as public employees. HB 605 would extend the equal pay requirement to all persons employed in the state of Louisiana. HB 605 would also allow an aggrieved person to file suit in any district court of competent jurisdiction. Currently, since the state equal pay protection law applies only to state employees, an aggrieved employee must file suit in the Baton Rouge-based 19th Judicial District Court. An aggrieved individual must first file a complaint with the Louisiana Human Rights Commission.

In April 2018, the Louisiana House Labor & Industrial Relations Committee members voted 7-4 to involuntarily defer HB 605. An involuntarily deferred instrument may be rescheduled for a committee hearing only by motion adopted by the vote of two-thirds of the committee members present and voting. The author of HB605 vowed to continue to bring similar bills to address pay disparities between men and women.

HB 790: Currently, Louisiana law only provides for workers' compensation benefits for hearing loss when the loss is sustained in a single traumatic accident. HB 790 would delete the requirement that any hearing loss suffered must have been the result of a single traumatic accident in order to recover workers' compensation benefits.

HB 790 is still pending."

The day children became shaheed. The day children became ghazi. (Reuters)

December 16, 2014. Army Public School. Peshawar. Pakistan. Just another ordinary day, until it wasn't. There were six men, one Chechen, two Afghan, three Arabs. Armed with automatic guns and grenades they entered the school and went on a rampage. It was a massacre. Going from classroom to classroom, they sprayed children with bullets. They killed some children with point-blank shots to their head and face. They pulled children from their hiding place under their desks, and shot them. The six men killed 132 children. The total number of the dead on that day is reported to be 144-150. Survivors tell stories that chill your blood. They have scars that won't go for a long, long time.

The day children became shaheed. The day children became ghazi.

After an eight-hour long operation of the Pakistan Army's Special Services Group, all six terrorists were killed.

Three soldiers were martyred, Lance Naik Mohammad Altaf, Naik Nadeem-ur-Rehman Anjum and Soldier Naveed Iqbal.

There is nothing worse than burying your child. (Reuters)

Said to be the ""revenge"" of the TTP for Pakistan military's targeted clean-up of their strongholds in the region, the deadliest attack on the children of Pakistan in its history became the rallying point for all of Pakistan. The National Action Plan came into existence, and things changed. Apparently, hopefully, for the better.

Omar Khorasani, the mastermind of the attack, is said to have been killed in a drone attack in October 2017 in the eastern Afghanistan.

It is not Pakistan's 9/11. It does not have a name, a description. It is beyond binaries. It is the lowest of humanity. It is heroism like no other as some children, staff members and school personnel lost their life trying to save others.

It is pain that is forever. There is nothing worse than burying your child. A child killed by the bullet to his head.

May no life ever be lost to terrorism.

May you find your closure. (Reuters)

Four years of inerasable images, of the soul-crushing senselessness of the loss of a loved one that still needs closure, of justice that is still awaited, of memories that haunt, on December 16, 2018, there is just one thing that makes any sense: prayer.

Even writing about it is a pain like no other. I send prayers for those who mourn, every day, for their loved one. May Allah give you strength to live with your loss the enormity of which is beyond imagination.

May you find your closure, your answer...
