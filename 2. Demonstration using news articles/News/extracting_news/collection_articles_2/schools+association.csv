The minister has even assured us that the government will cancel the CCE pattern and bring back the earlier examination process, in which the final exam will be conducted for a total of 100 marks. However, the officials made some cosmetic changes in the existing examination pattern now, which is ineffective.""

As per the current CCE pattern, a maximum of 20 marks will be allocated to a student as internal marks based on the average from four formative and one summative assessments and it will be added to the marks out of 80. The officials have changed the exam pattern after noticing that a few private school managements are giving more internal marks to students to manipulate their GPA."
