In the 1940s and 1950s, western scientists saw ageing as mainly bio-medical, with implications for productivity and national security. Non-western oncologists like Vasant Ramji Khanolkar and Theodore Gillman investigated the effects of poverty, malnutrition, diet, and infections -- not employment, even in uranium mines -- on ageing, and thereby undermined the often racist theories then underlying gerontology. Western anthropologists, nevertheless, identified enduring patriarchal networks and the unsettlement which industrialisation and urbanisation were already causing in agrarian societies.

It was extremely difficult, however, to establish chronological age in cultures where age and status were marked mainly by events like circumcision or initiation rites. After 1947, Indian officials tried to determine age by people's recollection of, say, famines (the author's inference that the officials were trying to shape national memories is somewhat implausible). After the war, gerontological associations expanded. U.S. anticommunism dominated policies, and in the early 1970s oil-price rises caused sharp cuts in state funding for public services. Neoliberals criticised the so-called failure of development, but obscured two key points -- the specifiable global successes of post-war social democracy, and the documented managerialist hijacking of social-democratic institutions in the 1980s.

Challenges to neoliberalism were ignored, including Irene Taeuber's demonstration that transitions to low-fertility societies would not be globally uniform, and Simon Szreter's exposure of the fallacy that population control alone enables development. The author says development itself is perhaps the best contraceptive, though she could have shown more clearly that in neoliberal doctrine, family matters are private. None of the 62 recommendations made at the 1982 U.N.-sponsored World Assembly on Ageing in Vienna was carried out.

Governments around the world make the family responsible for the aged. India was publicly criticised for its Vienna statement that it had ""no problem of the aged,"" but its Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act 2007 lays a duty on adults to support their parents. Secondly, the author's comment that the private sector's increased involvement is ""pragmatic"" seriously understates that ideological takeover.

The Indian statute, in effect, restates social and moral orthodoxies. Sivaramakrishnan notes organisational improvements within NGOs, but her comment that many of them do not evaluate states' and international bodies' welfare priorities is unfair; India often threatens to expel world-renowned NGOs.

The text is unfortunately diminished by many grammatical and other errors, but the author shows that ageing must be seen in the context of practices, cultures, and histories; those, however, are as challengeable as earlier gerontologists' racist assumptions."

There is a ""learning crisis"" in South Asia where only about half of the primary-aged children are receiving education with minimum standards, the UN's Children's Fund Unicef warned on Monday.

Investing in children is critical to achieving the sustainable development goals, Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli said as he inaugurated a three-day South Asian Conference on 'Learning Generation and Delivery Approaches', organised by UN Children's Fund (Unicef ) in Kathmandu.

Nepal's Constitution guarantees right to education to every child, Oli said.

Regional director for Unicef South Asia Jean Gough said: ""While impressive strides have been made in achieving universal primary education, we have a learning crisis in South Asia with only about half of primary-aged children receiving education with minimum learning standards.

""We need much greater investment and increased quality education for girls and boys alike if we hope to see the next generation reach their full potential"".

A report, 'The Learning Generation: Investing in Education for a Changing World', was released by the Commission in 2016.

If the ever-worsening learning crisis left unaddressed, it will lead half of the world's 1.6 billion children and youths out of school or failing to learn by 2030, the report has warned.

The conference is being attended by some 75 participants including government officials, educational experts, development partners and civil society leaders from eight countries -- India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

Now we need to fix the system. Better pre-service teacher training coupled with transparent and merit-based recruitments is the lasting solution

Maninder Kaur Dwivedi

January 2018 saw the release of two educational surveys -- one privately sponsored and the other by the government. The non-government survey was the 12th round of ASER, conducted for the first time with secondary school-level children, as opposed to elementary level in earlier rounds. Meanwhile, NCERT released the fifth National Achievement Survey (NAS), done simultaneously for classes 3, 5 and 8. Earlier rounds of NAS were done at three-year intervals so that a cohort could be followed, as it progressed through classes 3, 5 and 8. NAS informs districts what is the average number of children who have mastered specific competencies.

While the specific headlines announcing both survey results may seem marginally different from before, the underlying message of both exercises remained the same as earlier editions -- that the country faces a learning crisis. This manifests in children's low levels of learning outcomes and inequity in education. In none of the survey findings so far is there a narrative as to how the previous exercises have been used to find solutions, to realise educational promise for reaping our demographic dividend. These assessments of varying methodologies have red flagged the issue yet again. We need to move forward from there, instead of being caught up in repetitive cycles of tweaking the methods, samples or indicators -- as if the means were the end.

So who is going to fix the system we have been told repeatedly needs fixing? After all the hype has subsided, it can only be the teacher. The assessments do not capture the teacher availability or the average instruction time for any class. The results are averages over large samples, so are dip stick of health of the system. The individual teacher has to make a change in her classroom for averages to change. The teacher is the only one who interacts with the child, who has to teach at the level of the child, so as to ensure that each one moves forward in his/her learning journey. Good teachers would not have been surprised by any of the findings, they would intuitively know the students' levels. The typical administrative reactions of more monitoring, more tests, extra classes, etc, will have limited value. Nuanced action is required.

In the short term, effective teaching time has to be ensured. Schools in most parts of the country open in April, and for Board classes it is expected that they will complete the syllabus by November. Deducting summer vacations, internal assessments, sundry holidays and activities, this leaves 25-28 weeks for active instruction. Breaking this up into hours, as per assigned subject periods, each teacher gets 120-150 hours with a class.

Given such timelines for Classes 10 and 12, the task before the teachers is difficult to say the least. It is made more challenging by the various 'events' and 'abhiyans' schools and teachers get routinely roped in to participate, as each takes time away from the limited instructional period. School autonomy and functioning should be sacrosanct, free from all events, rallies, human-chains and melas the state administration may be conducting.

In the medium term, school-wise pupil teacher ratio, including subject-wise at secondary level, should be mandatorily enforced. Ideally, assessments should be limited to such schools, till deficit of provisioning is made up in rest of the schools. It is a given that up to 80% of any educational budget in developed countries will go for teacher salaries. This should neither be a deterrent to adequate teacher provisioning nor grudged while planning budgetary outlays, for no country has built an educated skilled populace without a strong public education system.

Another medium-term intervention is making the sectoral manpower policies teacher-friendly.

Teacher shortages and poorly qualified teachers are both a cause and effect of poorly paid and managed teaching cadres. A few states have introduced better policies like transparent transfer mechanisms, which urgently need upscaling and strengthening. After adequate teacher positioning, school autonomy and teacher collaborations have demonstrated in many pilots to be the catalyst that transforms the education system. Teacher's own collectives or networks built collaborations and institutional capacities of teachers.

There are numerous examples like in Jhunjhnu in Rajasthan or Channapatna in Ramanagaram district, Karnataka, where school teaching learning has transformed as a result of investment (which is of time and trust, less financial) in the social capital of teacher's networks. In the long term, better pre-service teacher training coupled with transparent and merit-based recruitments is the lasting solution. There is a remarkable lack of awareness amongst youth about career paths, as the ASER team documented. They enroll in courses without knowing the prospects or progression.

If the teacher education sector is brought within the ambit of the University system, where subject knowledge is learnt along with a course in teacher education, it will improve the academic quality of new teachers, compress the period required, and also give alternative career options to the students. We need to reinvent our existing practices if results of future surveys have to change. Else, it's only repetitive commotion, full of sound and fury, but without any upward movement in quality or spread of education; ultimately signifying nothing.

The announcement was made by Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia in New Delhi, days after the National Achievement Survey (NAS) showed that the entire country, including Delhi, was facing a learning crisis in schools.

Under the programme which will run from April to June for Class 3 to 5 in Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) schools and for Class 6 to 8 in government's schools, children will undergo a reading level assessment based on which they will be enrolled in specialised ""Mission Buniyaad"" classes.

""For children who are not able to read, I request all parents to cancel their vacation plans during summer holidays and send their children to school for remedial classes. I appeal to parents of children to support the Delhi government and MCDs in this campaign in the interest of their children's future,"" Sisodia said in a press conference.

Officials of the education department will run the campaign in ""mission mode"" for three months from April to June this year, Sisodia said.

Manish Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio, said that the programme is being designed on the lines of Delhi government's 'Chunauti scheme', after two rounds of meetings with MCDs, the Delhi Cantonment Board and the North Delhi Municipal Council.

""The NAS survey demonstrates that close to half of all children in our schools are not able to read their grade level textbooks. In the secondary schools run by the Delhi government, various programmes we initiated have improved reading ability by about 20 per cent.

""However, children in primary schools that are under the MCD are not able to read and thereafter when they study in secondary schools they find it difficult to cope up with the advanced levels,"" he said.

The deputy chief minister said it was in the interest of the children of Delhi that the efforts made by the government be extended to MCD schools as well.

""The municipal bodies that run primary schools in the city will raise a cadre of teachers who will drive the program, in a manner similar to the Mentor Teacher Program run in Delhi government schools. One teacher will take care of five schools and will train teachers of these five schools on enhancing readability of children,"" he said."
