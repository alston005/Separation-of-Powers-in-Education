It's not just the freshness of the fruits and vegetables that is a draw here, but one can experience the strife and perseverance of farmers that begin in their fields and culminate here.

A Green Market (Hasiru Santhe) was organised by the District Administration this morning at Krishnaraja Boulevard to give a chance to Mysureans to visit and have a look, savour and take home as-fresh-as-it-gets vegetables and fruits. What more, while one side of the Boulevard had the Greens, the other side had Chitra Santhe (Art Market) where art lovers and youth thronged to buy paintings, artefacts and trinkets.

People gathered in large numbers to buy organic food and vegetable products, rare paintings and art works. Over 50 Farmer Associations from Mandya, Mysuru and Chamarajanagar districts displayed a variety of chemical and pesticide-free organic products.

The products on display and sale included organic rice such as Rajamudi, Kempakki (red rice), Sannavalli, Sona, Kuchchalakki (boiled rice) and other products such as Avalakki (beaten rice), pulses, organic jaggery, organic sugar, honey, coconut oil, herbal shampoo, soaps and dry fruits.

Millets such as Saame (Little millet), Navane (Foxtail millet), Sajje (Pearl millet), Baragu (Proso millet), Oodhalu (Barnyard millet), Ragi (Finger millet) and pulses were sold in huge quantities. There was a good demand for organic vegetables including tomato, lady's finger, Coccinia (tondekai), ridge gourd, brinjal, cucumber, green chilli and root-based vegetables.

Bags of buyers were bulging with varieties of green leaves like basale soppu, coriander, methi soppu, honagone soppu, dantina soppu and palak soppu. Apart from public, District Minister G.T. Devegowda, who inaugurated the event, too bought the leaves and vegetables. He also ate some of the green stuff.

People savoured food items like Puliogare, North Karnataka special puffed rice, curd rice and other snacks and drank to drink herbal juices. The star attractions of the organic fair were the display of pure cow ghee, naturally extracted edible oil, pumpkin, jaggery and coconut oil.

The other side of Krishnaraja Boulevard had thousands of college students and art lovers seeing rare paintings, drawings and art works. Students Chamarajendra Academy of Visual Arts (CAVA), Kalaniketan School, Ravi Varma School of Art and other art colleges displayed their works. Paintings on wood, glass, canvas, paper, walls, clay, sand and leaves drew crowds. Face painting was the major attraction.

Though there were very few visitors in the morning, people started to pour onto the venue after 11 am. The event will be held till 6 pm today. G.T. Devegowda said that the District Administration has planned to conduct organic fair every Sundays across the city.

Following incidents of alleged harassment meted out to girls and women during Dasara Open Street festival at the same venue there was unprecedented Police security around the Krishnaraja Boulevard this morning. So much so that in the morning, there were more men and women in khakis than the visitors.

Apart from Policemen, camera-and-drone-equipped Mobile Command Centre was stationed at the venue and over 36 CCTVs cameras were installed all along the road. All the roads leading to Krishnaraja Boulevard were blocked."

Nongpok Sanjenbam village, about 15 km east of Manipur's capital city Imphal, is clean, with a lot of greenery. Spread over ten acres of land, a weaving unit and a poultry farm provide employment to most of the villagers.

The village in Imphal East district was mired in poverty, lacking basic facilities. Most of the villagers worked as agricultural laborers. Presently it is a model in development, as it ensures sustained economic growth through various programmes, involving the community.

Bringing community together

Nongpok Sanjenbam has about 135 households, with a population of about 500. It has Khunou, Khullen, Sangsabi and Kambongput colonies. As a pilot, Langei project adopted the Khunou colony. Telem Arunkumar (42), a native of Nongpok Sanjenbam village, who had a successful business in Imphal, returned to his village to develop the same. He brought the villagers together and initiated the Langei project, langei meaning pool of wealth. The motto of the project is 'together we can'.

Initially, many villagers thought that he had an ulterior motive, when he discussed his ideas for developing the village into a sustainable development model. Being a native of the same village subsequently helped him connect with the village administration council and the community. Once convinced, the villagers started participating in the project. The village council donated ten acres of unused community land for the project. The villagers helped the Langei project take off, by helping with all the planning and construction activities.

Weaver women

Around 200 women were at the looms in a huge hall, weaving the phanek, the traditional women's wear, besides other traditional clothes. The women need no training, as they are skilled traditional weavers, their skills having been passed down through generations. Langlei chose loin loom weaving as the primary income generation activity, as the women are adept at weaving on the loin looms. This not only generates income, but revives the traditional weaving, that was slowly disappearing, with the onslaught of modern technologies in weaving.

Moreover, the products are in good demand. ""One phanek fetches around Rs 2,000,"" one of the weavers told VillageSquare.in. Dyeing and making yarn have also been integrated into the weaving unit.

Earlier every household had a loin loom but not now. In the Langei unit, there are more than 150 traditional looms. ""We make about 40 phaneks everyday,"" said Arunkumar. This are sold in and around Manipur, sometimes in other cities as well.

Rearing poultry and cattle

Close to the weaving unit, at the foothills, there is a large pond with about 5,000 ducks. Close by is a chicken farm, where an equal number of chickens are being reared. The farm has separate hatching units with incubators. Every day, the farm supplies about 1,000 eggs to Imphal, bringing sustained income.

The farm provides employment to about 30 villagers. Though most of the villagers are engaged in the Langei works, the project envisages independent economic activity for the men, specifically livestock rearing.

Water and sanitation

The village did not have drinking water facility. At present, a reverse osmosis plant that can treat 2,000 liters per hour supplies drinking water. The water is supplied to every household free of cost.

If a household needs more water, as in the case of functions and the like, a token amount is charged, to prevent misuse. ""This is the first of its kind drinking water supply model in Manipur,"" Arunkumar told VillageSquare.in. In line with Swachh Bharat Mission, residents of Nongpok Sanjenbam village take up sanitation and cleanliness drive voluntarily, in addition to waste management. Biodegradable wastebaskets made of cane and bamboo are kept at roadsides and key places. The village is free of open defecation, claimed Arunkumar.

Safety and security

Nongpok Sanjenbam has a solar street light system in the Khunou colony and the lanes of the village. A total of 350 streetlights have been installed, to ensure safety and security. The street lights have a central control system. ""In villages, people, especially women, do not venture out in the dark , so this helps in better mobility of the villagers,"" said Arunkumar. In order to ensure safety and security, Langei project has installed CCTV cameras in key locations. The village has 32 such CCTVs that monitor the entire village round the clock. This has reduced social ills such as alcoholism, and theft.

Public address system has been installed for communication and information sharing. This is also used for mobilizing the public. A series of loud speakers installed at key locations is connected to the main administrative office. This helps in emergency situations. ""When we observe something unusual in the CCTVs, we make a call through the PA system,"" said Arunkumar.

Social development

Under the Langei project, a Langei Sports Academy has been started. More than 100 youth in the age group of 8-18 years are enrolled in the sports academy, half of them being girls. ""The objective is to nurture young talents,"" Arunkumar told VillageSquare.in. ""All those enrolled in the academy have been adopted by the Sports Authority of India, under their 'Come and Play program'."" Three of the players from the academy play in the under-19, East Bengal football team.

The village has a large playground for the youth. Every day a bus takes the young sportspersons to Khuman Lampak Sports Stadium in Imphal, so that they can hone their skills under expert guidance. Future plans for the village includes a school, a primary health center, a biogas plant and creation ecotourism centers.

With the academic session ending in less than three months, students in South Corporation schools are yet to receive money for stationery, none of the schools have women security guards, and only 62 out of 344 school buildings have CCTV cameras installed.

The South Delhi Municipal Corporation had issued a press statement in June, saying it would install 4,348 CCTV cameras in 344 primary schools within four months. More than 5,000 students in 14 schools are forced to sit on floors, as there no desks and benches, and 44 schools do not have Jal Board water connections.

These details emerged during the SDMC House meeting on Monday, in response to questions asked by the Leader of Opposition, AAP's Praveen Kumar.

Kumar, the councillor from Sitapur, said: ""The (BJP) made tall promises of deploying women marshalls and CCTVs, but in several schools, teachers open gates as there are no security guards at all."" South Corporation Education committee chairperson Nandini Sharma said, ""The files have been moved. Tenders are being invited and work orders will be issued. We are expecting to get things moving by February.""

Sharma added: ""We recieved Rs 46 crore instead of Rs 89 crore in funds. We are giving Rs 500 instead of Rs 1,100 to students as subsidy for uniforms."" To which, Kumar said: ""Desks and benches will wear out every year. Preparations should have been done in advance."""

Government-run rehabilitation centres for women are being used in some cases to confine girls and young women who have eloped, while many other centres have failed to give care to the survivors of sexual assault and mentally challenged inmates, according to a survey done by the National Commission for Women (NCW) of 26 centres in four States.

The Women and Child Development Ministry runs Swadhar Greh as short-stay or temporary rehabilitation centres for adult women survivors of domestic violence and trafficking, as well as for women who have nowhere to go after being freed from jail.

The survey, conducted in August and September, found that most of these centres were not being used for the beneficiaries, and often functioned as hostels for school girls and working women; in some cases, girls and women were housed there without an order from a court or a child welfare committee.

The Ministry has now written to all the States to submit a list of Swadhar Greh after verifying their performance. They have also been asked prepare a quarterly progress report on the condition of the shelters and conduct surprise visits. The Centre has also asked that CCTVs be installed and entry of men restricted in the centres.

A home at Bhadoi in Uttar Pradesh had girls in the age group of 15-19, and most of them had eloped. The homes in Mirzaganj and Allahabad were found to provide shelter to its inmates without a court order. They also had mentally challenged women, who were rolling on the floor at the time of inspection, but there was no sign of treatment given to them.

A centre at Chikkaballapur in Karnataka was found to have a rape survivor under severe mental trauma, but it had no provision for her special care. There was no counselling for inmates suffering from depression. It housed girls who had eloped, but wanted to return to their partners.

A victim of human-trafficking was an HIV patient but a shelter in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, failed to provide her access to treatment. The report said she wanted to return to her family but was forced to stay. Many other inmates wanted to return home, but the shelter did not pay heed to their requests. In a Cuttack facility, a third of the victims were mentally challenged who needed to be shifted to a mental asylum.

Two centres in 24 Paraganas in West Bengal were found to be operating as a hostel for school girls who were in touch with their parents, the study said."
