The excess teacher transfer or absorption process, officially termed as 'samayojan' in Marathi, is currently going on in Nagpur with almost 700 teachers termed as excess. Maharashtra Rajya Shikshan Sanstha Mahamandal (MRSSM) , which is an association of trusts/societies that own schools, has written to the education minister and officials concerned asking them to desist from carrying out the process any further.

""It is contempt of court by the education department,"" said Ravindra Fadnavis, joint secretary of MRSSM. ""We have approached the court when 2016-17 absorption process was going on and the issue went right up to the Supreme Court. Other legal matters related to this are also pending and our understanding is that no absorption process can be carried out until the court gives the green signal,"" said Fadnavis.

Speaking to TOI, he made it clear that his association has firmed up plans to take legal action against any education officer who forces schools to accept new teachers from the excess pool. ""If teachers from the excess pool are not appointed then education officials threaten our principals. Don't they know that principals do not have the authority to make any appointment? It is the management alone that can take the decision. This is pressure tactics being used by the department to arm twist schools into submission. But now we will not take this lying down,"" said Fadnavis.

The MRSSM is also preparing for a fresh round of legal battle. ""We will pursue the issue to its legal conclusion, as the intimidation by the education department needs to be stopped,"" said Fadnavis."

Tension prevailed at the Government Higher Secondary School in K. Morur village near Kaadayampatti when students boycotted classes and staged a protest against the transfer of a teacher on the issue of felling trees on the campus.

Police sources said that a few trees on the campus were felled a month ago for the construction of classroom block. Based on the report of the local village administrative officer that the trees were felled without the permission of the government, the School Education Department transferred the then headmistress Sangamithirai.

The Department on Friday transferred Govindaraj, a social science teacher, for his involvement in the felling of trees.

Protesting against the transfer of Govindaraj, the students abstained from classes on Saturday and sat in dharna in front of the school.

The Theevattipatti Police rushed to the school and pacified the students, who later withdrew the agitation.

Meanwhile, Theevattipatti Police booked cases against five persons - Sinnasamy (40), Kumarasamy (37) and Maadhu (42), all local residents, Suresh Babu, assistant headmaster of the school, and teacher Govindaraj for instigating the students to stage the protest.

Sinnasamy, Kumarasamy and Maadhu were arrested and remanded in judicial custody. The police are on the look out for Suresh Babu and Govindaraj, sources said."

Following promotion counselling for block resource teacher educators in February this year, the department released a communication on Tuesday asking chief education officers to receive applications from block resource teacher educators for transfer counselling.

The communication said block resource teacher educators should produce the proof of their pirority when they apply for the counselling. The chief educational officers have been asked to appoint two officers to verify and receive the applications. ""The transfer applications should be verified and uploaded to www.tndse.com. Two printouts of the uploaded application should be taken and verified with the concerned block resource teacher educator,"" said the communication. It said the process should be completed by Friday. However, it did not mention the counselling date.

N Velkumar, district secretary of Block Resource Teacher Educators Development Association, said there were 3,894 block resource teacher educators in the state and 182 in Coimbatore, Pollachi and Tirupur educational districts.

""We have been asking for transfer counselling for four years. Only now the order has come,"" he said.

There were many vacant block resource teacher educator posts after the promotion of several block resource teacher educators as school teachers, Velkumar said. The transfer counselling should seek to effectively fill the posts in districts where there were more vacancies, he added."

A Bench of Acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice J Uma Devi pronounced this order after hearing elaborate arguments made by advocates representing scores of teachers, who challenged as many as 15 aspects of the transfer policy and the state's version defending each of the decisions.

The Bench, however, struck down Rule 4 of the policy that made the district education officers (DEOs) of the erstwhile 10 districts of the state as competent authorities for making the transfers under Presidential Order. This is because the 10 districts are now expanded into 31 and there are 31 DEOs. There is no post of DEO existing as of now that covers the erstwhile districts exclusively.

As Presidential Order does not make it compulsory for the state to identify a competent authority, the Bench left it to the state to go ahead without naming the competent authority. Telangana additional advocate general J Ramachandra Rao's statement that the state would ask its regional joint director of school education to issue transfer and posting orders on the basis of the erstwhile district as a unit was recorded in the judgment. The Bench framed several questions based on arguments of petitioners and answered them separately.

The petitioners contended that after the new districts were formed, the state got the Presidential Order amended in June 2017 integrating panchayat raj teachers and government teachers. However, upon a challenge to the same, the High Court ordered thaat status quo be maintained. The current transfers violated this status quo order. The transfer rules themselves are contrary to this HC order, they said.

Answering this question in favour of the state, the bench said that ""since the order of status quo disables both teachers working in local body schools and teachers working in government schools to be treated as an integrated cadre, it is only if teachers presently working in local body schools are transferred to government schools and viceversa, can the order of status quo be said to have been violated"". Admittedly, no such action has been taken by the state government. The bench also rejected the contention that status quo order would eclipse the amendment to the Presidential Order."

""I do not want my children to be orphans in Dehradun and I cannot leave my job,"" she is heard telling the chief minister in the video.

The chief minister, in response to her query, is seen asking her if she had signed any guarantee when she got the job to which Bahuguna said that she had not vowed to live her life in the forest. This reply annoyed Rawat, who shouted, ""Suspend her immediately. Take her into police custody.""

A teacher who asked for a transfer to Dehradun after 25 years to be with her children was turned away by Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Rawat, suspended and even arrested on charges of shouting and misbehaving at a public meeting. Turns out, Mr Rawat's wife, also a teacher, managed a transfer from a tough region within four years and has been in Dehradun without a shift for 22 years.

An RTI or Right to Information query has revealed that Sunita Rawat started working at a primary school in Paudi Gadhwal in 1992. In 1996, she was transferred to Dehradun and has since never been transferred, even after a promotion in 2008.

Uttara Bahuguna, the 57-year-old teacher who paid heavily for her argument with the Chief Minister at his public interaction on Thursday, has been working at a school in Uttarkashi for 25 years and is desperate to shift to Dehradun to be with her children after her husband's death.

But an official said she can't get an out-of-turn transfer.

""More than 58 people are posted in remote areas for longer duration than her. Her number is only 59th. The transfer is done only turn-wise,"" said Bhupinder Kaur Aulakh, School Education Secretary of the state.

Ms Bahuguna had met with the Chief Minister once before. Yesterday, she told him after so many years at what she felt was a remote outpost, she wanted to live with her children. ""I don't want my children to be orphans in Dehradun. My situation is such that I can't leave my children or the job,"" she told him.

The back-and-forth grew heated as Ms Bahuguna insisted that the Chief Minister give her justice.

""I never signed up for exile all my life,"" Ms Bahuguna said. Annoyed, the Chief Minister asked her to ""mind her language"" and then shouted, ""Suspend karo ise abhi (Suspend her immediately). Arrest her.""

In a video clip, the teacher is seen screaming at the Chief Minister and shouting ""thief, cheats"" as she is led out of the meeting.

Uttara Bahuguna was arrested on charges of ""disrupting an important gathering"". She was let off in the evening.

""I lost my husband in 2015 and my children stay here (Dehradun). I can't leave my children here,"" Ms Bahuguna said today, breaking down.

""You can see in the video. He got angry when I demanded justice. I feel helpless. Is this what I get for working honestly and diligently for years? So I called them thieves. I will tell the truth even if god comes before me."

The incident happened on Thursday at the 'Janata Darbar' of the chief minister in Dehradun when the principal of a government school in Nagaon area of Uttarkashi district made a transfer request.

According to a government release, principal Uttara Bahuguna ""showed disrespect and used abusive language"" during the Janata Darbar. She was told to put forward her request in a decent manner but she kept on misbehaving.

Bahuguna had requested the chief minister that she be transferred from the remote location to Dehradun. Her claim was that she has been posted at the remote locations for the last 25 years and she now wanted to live with her children.

On being asked by Rawat if she had given any undertaking while securing the job, Bahuguna shot back that she had not stated ""she will live in a forest throughout her life"". On this, the chief minister lost his cool and asked her to put forward her request in a decent manner but she kept on ""showing disrespect"", the release said.

The woman said that her husband had died and she did not want to leave her children as ""orphans in Dehradun"".

""My condition is such that neither can I leave my children alone nor my job,"" Bahuguna said. The school principal also reportedly hurled abuses at the chief minister going on to call him corrupt and a chor (thief), after which she was forcefully removed by women police officers. Government sources said that the principal was briefly detained and later suspended.

After the incident, Rawat said that request for transfers must not be brought to a platform meant for hearing public grievances. ""All transfers of government employees will be done under the state's Transfer Act,"" he said.

Meanwhile, after the incident snowballed into a controversy, the state's school education secretary Bhupinder Kaur Aulakh said that any further action on the transfer request will only be taken in accordance with the rules. She also said that the suspension order was for the interim and the future course of action will be decided after hearing her side.

She also said that Bahuguna was 59th in the list of transfer requests. ""More than 58 people are posted in remote areas for longer duration than her. Her number is only 59th. The transfer is done only turn-wise. She can be transferred only within the district. Her demand that she be transferred to Dehradun falls under inter-dist transfers which, as of now, isn't allowed by the rule,"" Aulakh said.

However, Bahuguna said that she has served as a disciplined employee of the government and she only retorted after the chief minister ordered for her to be removed. ""Ise le jao, ise le jao, kyu vo is tarah se mujhe bol rhe the, kya mera koi puchne vala nahi. Main ek mahila shikshika hu,"" Bahuguna broke down while narrating her ordeal.

Speaking to The Print, Bahuguna also alleged irregularities in transfers and appointments in the state. She said she was transferred from her earlier posting at Jogath after the school fell vacant. She, however, alleged that another person was appointed at the school, who continued to draw a salary for two years, to run an empty school. The posting was only cancelled after much hue and cry. Bahuguna said she will compile the data regarding those principals who have been transferred despite signing the same government bond, which she did. The bond warrants a state government teachers to be posted in schools in remote hill-stations till the government sees fit to transfer them.

The people who write such eloquent articles are highlighting concerns that are intellectual and unconnected with the news that was reported (""Viral photo of students weeping at TN teacher's transfer shows what's wrong with education in India""). The problem is that masters of the languages do not wish to teach. They are not bothered about the students. Our best guide is someone who may not be a an expert, but is a real teacher, dedicating to holistic teaching. When a lot of restrictions are imposed on the teacher by the government and the judiciary, It is only his dedication and sincerity that matters. One should not write lofty articles without first experiencing the difficulties of poor students or the lack of proper infrastructure in small schools. -V Mohan Rao

***

While in school I was influenced by teachers who were lenient towards students. I liked them and so did most other students. If the teachers are not demanding, it gives room to learn at your own pace. The teacher not only teaches a subject but also keeps the flock on the right path. When children are young, news of good teacher leaving can make the heart ache, but leaving people behind is a part of growing up. This is not an issue of the teaching skills or the state of education in our country but how children behave while growing up. - Karthik G

***

Senior teachers are transferred if they don't have political, muscle or money power. We need more such articles on the present education scenario. This will create public awareness and more people could join hands to save the system. - Prasanta Chakraborty

***

In a typical school or college run by a state government or university, most of the students come from marginalised communities. They will be overwhelmed in attending a class conducted by a suave and sophisticated subject expert. Absenteeism and dropouts follow. They need someone they can connect with, that is more important. As they build trust in the system and confidence, then an expert can be introduced. A teacher like him is an asset to any school. - Sreeram

***

To produce such sensitive teachers, we must develop an environment where teachers and the teaching profession are given adequate respect. Currently, they do not enjoy the reputation they deserve. - Pradeep

At a crossroads

Congratulations to Shivam Shankar Singh for his bold and thoughtful message to the nation and the struggle to correct the path being followed by the ruling dispensation (""Why I am resigning from the BJP: A Narendra Modi supporter and party campaign analyst explains""). The leaders who focus only on getting more power tend to ignite sycophancy and build a mutually beneficial relationship with their constituency. Alas, the citizen wakes up too late to learn that his constitutional power, his vote, has gone in vain. Course correction can be sought by voting in someone else. But even when the government changes, these patterns stay the same.

Independent social media and social movements are critical to sustaining the the spirit of democracy. With policies anchored in unbridled capitalism, the fourth pillar of democracy has become the handmaiden of the government - most media are owned and controlled by the very people who pose a threat to constitutional bodies. Hence, the power of the common man evaporates.

I chose to join fifth pillar, a movement to fight corruption. Are we able to see, even at some distance, the light at the end of the tunnel? All constitutional bodies are made to toe the official line. The Congress has not learnt from its past. It's people like this author who can challenge the rulers with inside knowledge, which carries added weight. - UR Kaliappan

***

This is an unbiased and correct analysis. The author has gone into great detail and I agree with every word. Modi twists facts and talks too much. He is blind to the problems in the country. He wastes the taxpayer's money for his own benefits and spends a lot of time on foreign tours. He made false promises and defamed the Congress to win the election in 2014. The way he is troubling Kejriwal and ignoring the burning problems of New Delhi or keeping quiet about rising fuel prices, murders of journalists and worsening law and order situation is wrong. - Krishnarao Ukey

***

The article by Shivam Shankar Singh was excellent. Spreading false news is detrimental to the nation's health and every person or agency must refrain doing so. The government of the day, if it really cares about the nation's repute and pride, should bring in appropriate legal measures including severe punishments to ward off those unethical, unscrupulous tendencies. - Aarkay

***

Shivam Singh's analysis of Modi and Shah should be an eye opener for all about the danger the country will face if the BJP is elected for second term. - Sanjeev Doddi

Delhi row

We are all talking based on assumptions (""AAP vs IAS: It is the Delhi lieutenant governor's duty and obligation to end the impasse""). No one till now knows what the real facts are. Without that, all are going by what Arvind Kejriwal is saying. Are we to understand that the prime minister routinely picks up the phone and talks to the lieutenant governor? The author mentions that it is the LG's responsibility to sort out impasse. Likewise, it is chief minister's duty to be friendly with the prime minister and get the work done, not for the prime minister to come and do the chief minister's job.

Kejriwal made a mistake and should apologise first, as he was a bureaucrat first and would have faced similar issues with politicians. Instead of blaming others, he should have been taken the initiative to sort out the issue. Setting up camp in the LG's house is not acceptable, no matter the reason he gives. Surely, it is the chief minister's job to sort out this impasse. The prime minister has nothing to do with it. - Manohar Rajan

***

Kejriwal is a former Joint Income Tax Commissioner and hence was a bureaucrat of almost the same level as the author. The crux of the matter is, if you have an elected government in Delhi, but all final decisions are taken by the LG, then why have an elected government in the first place? - R Joseph

West Bengal politics

It is unfortunate that the organisation mentioned in the article seems to have failed to grasp that in today's times, the manifestation of regional pride needs to go beyond tokenisms such as the increased use of the most spoken local language on signboards and forever harking back to the glorious past (""Bangla pride vs 'Hindi-Hindu-Hindustani': In West Bengal, a new Trinamool front to counter the BJP?"").

This outfit could do itself as well as West Bengal a big favour by shifting its major focus away from symbolism towards playing a part in addressing the biggest problem that the state faces, namely, the limited growth opportunities for its youth.

Helping create an entrepreneurial mindset among the Bengali youth, as majority of whom have always viewed entrepreneurship as a consolation prize for failing to land permanent employment, could be a good first step in this regard. - Sumali Moitra

***

This is the right platform to establish Bengali identity in the state because l have seen lot of Bengalis do not get proper posts in employment, education and the like, whereas non-Bengalis get all the posts because the ruling party supports them. As a result, people are migrating to the state and native Bengalis are migrating to South Indian states. l request all political parties in Bengal to address this problem immediately to ensure our people get due respect and don't migrate to other states. - M Appa Rao

***

I really appreciate Garga Chatterjee's efforts and this noble cause. It is now or never for West Bengal. But until the people understand the facts that liebetween politics and other hypothetical issues, no larger change can be effected. We need strong communication and a healthy movement that can restore the Bangla identity. - Sumon Banerjee

***

From what I have read about this party, it seems to be just a branch of the ruling Trinamool Congress. It will act in favour of the ruling party during the Parliamentary elections next year. So instead, they should stop the drama and merge with the political party. - Sandip Mukherjee

***

Bengal is not a separate nation. This kind of move has cost Bengal enormously in the past, leading to the flight of brain and capital from the state and perpetuating under-development. It is high time that we rise above parochialism and work for the development of the people. In the name of federalism we are encouraging anarchy and compromising national security. - Manoranjan Dutta

Trash talk

Sometimes a person may litter unintentionally. The gentleman may have thrown out that piece of plastic in the spur of the moment, perhaps distractedly (""Mumbai man who littered versus Anushka Sharma who shamed him: It's a feud now. Watch""). Also, Anushka Sharma perhaps chose the wrong place and time to admonish him. But again, no one can claim that their mind always works the way it should. Virat Kohli could have restrained himself from posting the video of the incident on social media. I am inclined to believe that none of them behaved in the right way under the circumstances. However I see in this an opportunity for them to be friends if they comes in contact again, away from the media glare. - Dilip Kumar Bordoloi

If Anushka Sharma did not abuse the person who threw the garbage and only pulled him up, she did the right thing. We should all be able to stand up to these anti-social people who have no civic sense. - Shaha Ghosh

***

As a celebrity herself and the wife of a public figure, Anushka Sharma should have maintained her dignity instead of scolding the youth. The road is public property with all kinds of people passing by. We can't afford to keep paying attention to these trifles. Is this the first time she saw someone littering, that she is retaliating in this manner? - Rupa Chowdhury

***

People need to give them a break and appreciate Anushka Sharma's effort. They don't need any cheap publicity. They behaved like responsible citizens by telling someone not to litter. We need more like her. Indians are indifferent to the environment. - Manju Rangra

***

Why are we Indians so defensive? Why can we never show grace in face of a fault and own up to the mistake? I read Arhhan Singh's post. Do you think he would have had the same reaction if he was pulled over by someone who was not famous? According to him, he should be exempt from criticism because the plastic he threw out of his car was so small that it would not have caused much damage to the already half-dead environment. What else can you conclude from his argument?

Isn't this what we always say - what difference will it make - before taking one more bribe, breaking one more signal, or in general generally closing our eyes to wrongdoing? Add to that the fact that his mother also came to his rescue.

When his mother Singh called out Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli for causing mental duress to her son, what she actually did was successfully prove once more that we Indians do not deserve outspoken celebrities like Meryl Streep and others. Because much as we expect them to, when our celebrities actually speak for any sort of cause we troll them on social media or worse. - Surbhi Bhati

***

Anushka Sharma wasn't ranting or yelling at all. And why has the youth's mother jumped in? I'm sure he can defend himself. He should have gracefully accepted the mistake and kept his mouth shut. Moreover, do Sharma and Virat Kohli need attention? Kudos to the power couple. We need more like them. - Shital

***

This is a just a way for the couple to publicise themselves. Instead of posting the video, they could have just described the incident in a message. They are not the only celebrities advocating the protection of the environment. A number of other actors also support the cause without making noise about it. - Gurpreet Kaur Bhamrah

Eligibility test

Why is there so much confusion over these announcements? That makes it seem like a gimmick (""CBSE to continue conducting national teacher test in 20 languages, clarifies Prakash Javadekar""). It is evident that the central government is trying to impose Hindi in the country, but this will disadvantage candidates from southern states. The state should assess the GDP, income generation and tax revenue from southern states and compare it to the budgetary allocation to these areas to see the major disparity. Rulers in the central government should change their attitude and consider all factors in all Indian states before taking any major decisions. - S Janardhan

World Cup fever

It was very nice to read the article on Pele ahead off the Brazil vs Switzerland match (""Neymar only needs to look towards Pele to learn how to deal with man-marking at the World Cup""). I was in England during the 1966 and the 1970 World Cups and could see Brazil in action on TV. The author's description of Brazil's exit in 1966 is accurate. Simply, Pele was not allowed to show his genius and was physically tortured. His other talented compatriot, Garincha, was also not spared from attack. In 1970, Pele and the Brazil team displayed unforgettable football skill to win the Cup. It was sheer joy to watch. Owing to old age, I am not watching the late night matches this year. Hope Brazil can rediscover its skill, led by the talented Neymar. - Amitava Bose

Interpreting 'Kaala'

I am aware of the Dravidian and Dalit idea of seeing Ravana as an innocent man vanquished unjustly by Brahmanical forces (""Pa Ranjith's 'Kaala' turns the Ramayana on its head - by making Raavana the hero""). But there is hardly any historical or even textual basis to justify this belief. The usual Periyarist rationalism falls flat when it comes to believing in such fringe theories. Chief among the translators or retellers of the Ramayana, poet Kambar, goes only so far as portraying Ravana as a tragic figure who despite all his good qualities is blind to the willful sin he committed by abducting Sita.

Compared to the Mahabharata, the Ramayana is pretty much a straightforward story. It's not about your ideology or your gods versus mine. The Ramayana war results from a woman getting kidnapped against her wishes. There is no scope for Aryan vs Dravidian struggle there. For that matter, Ravana could have been an ethnic Sinhala and Puranas consider him a son of a Brahmin and hence a Brahmin king by extension. In the original version Rama eats meat and drinks wine, shares his food with a boatman, embraces him and considers him a brother - all these make him anti-Brahmanical to the core.

There has never been a ethnographic retelling of the Ramayana until mid 20th century and it has been the non-professionals that have taken it up to see that the neo-Ramayana fits their narrative. Besides it is just mythology. You can't call Rama an element of fiction and keep looking for historicity in him.

It would have been better if the movie focussed more on how the Ramayana has been appropriated by Sangh forces to peddle their deviant ideology. I understand the Dalit indignation against Hinduism but assuming things without a rational basis is no different than what they oppose in the first place. - Ananth Harihar

Dog's world

The six-month target in Uttarakhand could lead to large-scale cruelty towards stray dogs (""Uttarakhand High Court asks state to get rid of all stray dogs in six months""). Do we need more in today's India? The government should seriously consider Animal Birth Control. Mumbai is practicing it for the last 25 years based on a (humane) directive of Bombay High Court. Strays are picked up from the road and neutered. They are put back into the same locality. This is very effective in population control. I hope local NGOs will take up this issue. The option given by Uttarakhand court is either adoption or to send dogs to a shelter. It is anybody's guess what would happen to the animal in the shelter, given the already strained resources of our cities. - Aparna Vedula

Lakes on fire

A foaming lake is a clear indication of the failure of authorities to monitor inflow of non-biodegradable detergents (""'The largest septic tank of the city': Bengaluru's Bellandur lake froths again""). Let us cut the blame game and hit the nail on the head. Bengaluru is a major hub of the garment industry, where large amount of detergents are used. Many may be manufacturing cheap detergents to boost the bottom line. There is no point in beating around the bush. Increased detergent level in sewage is detrimental to biodegradation capacity of water sewage treatment capacity. The effluents, rich in detergent and organic matter, turn into a cauldron of foam filled with methane which can catch fire if anyone ignites it. Ask authorities the right questions. Do they have a laboratory to check the sewage ? Do they have the ability to check all the parameters of raw water for natural lakes? It is major governance disaster. - Sunil Kokrady"

The Veliagaram school had 265 students and 18 teachers (including the two transferred).

Karthick, who is now in class 8, a son of a mason, called Bhagwan their ""best teacher"". ""He made English my favourite subject. He used to introduce new books to us.

For these three along with many other students of Veliagaram Government school, G Bhagwan, their English teacher was the only man who was supposed to show them the path leading to their dreams and aspirations, from their village in the border of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. The 28-year-old teacher was transferred to another school in Tiruttani, about 40 km away from Veliagaram.

Most of the students in the school, that has classes up to 10th, belong to the OBC Vanniyar community and the rest are Dalits. Parents of the students, who are mostly illiterates, even approached the local MLA to try and stop the transfer. Even singer AR Rahman tweeted about the news, which was retweeted for nearly 5000 times, even MDMK leader Vaiko reached out to Bhagawan ""to console and wish him the best"", reported The Indian Express.

For a rural school, Veliagaram had an impressive pass percentage of 82 in the Class 10 SSLC exam last year. The nearest town of the school is 40 kms away, and the students who come by bus from far away have to walk for 3kms to reach the school. Academic activities were disrupted in the school for two days after the incident went viral. A colleague of Bhagwan told IE that the 28-year-old is very emotional. ""For the students, he was everything,"" added the teacher, who was reluctant to identify himself after all the publicity the school attracted. Another one informed IE, ""Bhagawan is familiar to most parents too. Young and a bachelor, he could afford to spend a lot of time with students even after class hours."""

28-year-old G Bhagawan was one of the two English teachers at school and was transferred along with one more as part of a routine redeployment of staff to maintain the teacher-student ratio in government schools.

(HT File )

Faced with stiff opposition from the school teachers' unions, the Punjab government is contemplating to amend its Teachers Transfer Policy 2018 to drop the clause that puts a seven-year cap on stay in a school.

The policy, which was approved by the state council of ministers headed by chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh three months ago, mandated that every teacher will be compulsorily transferred after completing seven years in a school, and no teacher will be allowed to seek transfer before completion of three years in a school. The school teachers' unions were up in arms against the two clauses from the word go and launched a stir under the banner of Sanjha Adhyapak Morcha to press for their withdrawal.

Balkar Singh Valtoha, one of five conveners of the Morcha, said the government has agreed ""in principle"" to amend the policy to accommodate their demands on these two clauses. ""An assurance has been given to us by the top brass of the school education department in a meeting last week. While they have promised to do away with the seven-year clause altogether, the minimum period after which a teacher will be able to seek transfer is also being brought down from three years to one,"" Valtoha told HT.

A senior education department official also said the government is willing to take a relook at the clauses. ""These clauses were brought to provide a level playing field and end complacency among teachers. The aim of the policy is to bring greater transparency in transfers. We will not let these small issues affect the overall objective,"" he said, requesting anonymity. School education minister OP Soni is holding a meeting with the department officials on Wednesday to discuss these demands.

The official said the final decision would be taken in the meetings of the heads of teachers' unions with the chief minister on June 19. The Morcha is also demanding regularisation of contractual teachers, full pay scale for teachers on 'equal work-equal pay' principle, changes in teacher-taught ratio for secondary and senior secondary classes, and amendments in the rationalisation policy. The state government, which approved the policy on March 7, has been keen to implement from the current academic session, but had to put that on hold due to the teachers' protest.

The policy has a number of significant initiatives aimed at improving the quality of education, and gives preference to teachers who have delivered good results and those who send their children to government-run schools. In a first, transfers will be carried out online once a year, except in cases of administrative exigency such as adverse pupil-teacher ratio and disciplinary issues, on a point system. Teachers will be awarded points out of 200 on age, length of service, performance, special categories, among other criteria. The teacher earning highest points will be entitled to be transferred against a particular vacancy as per his/her preference. Special category teachers such as women, widows, differently abled, or those with ailments, will get additional points. The state has about 19,000 schools with over 1 lakh teachers."
