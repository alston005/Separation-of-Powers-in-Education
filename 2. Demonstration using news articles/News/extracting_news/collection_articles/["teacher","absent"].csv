The Board of Education at its Dec. 18 meeting voted 3-0 with two absent to approve filling two interim teaching positions: a special education teacher at Johnson Elementary and a teacher at Adams Elementary.

Both are needed because of a larger number of students than projected, said Chief Financial Officer David Frye, who added that the latter teacher is needed because the combined K-3 enrollment exceeds the state maximum. Frye said a budget amendment for both positions will be presented later.

Jacki Wolfe, director of special education, said she expects the system will continue seeing an increase in special education students because of the effects of NAS.

BOE Chariman Carrie Upshaw and Todd Golden lamented the unfunded federal mandate to provide appropriate special education services for the growing number of students needing them, although both said the system would do the right thing regardless.

Wolfe said funding for special education went up in the current budget year, while Susan Lodal said the amount of federal funding for such programs actually has decreased slightly over the past five years or so.

Golden said the general public needs to realize the effects of NAS are not just health impairments and developmental delays, but also the financial cost to local taxpayers to serve that growing population, which he said is increasing due to transfers into the city system by parents moving to Kingsport for special education services and from students who were born in Kingsport.

Wolfe said the functional academic program for grades K-2 at Johnson has grown from 15 in one classroom to 21 and is projected to go to 23. The interim fix will have the existing and interim teacher co-teach the rest of the school year and share an instructional assistant, with the situation to be examined for the 2019-20 academic year.

""I would stay this is a trend that will continue,"" Wolfe said.

Tennessee is among the worst states in the nation for NAS and opioid addition. Golden said when he and his wife had their youngest child four years ago, they were the only couple on the floor of a local hospital who didn't have a drug-addicted newborn.

The meeting was rescheduled from Dec. 11 because of snow. Vice President Karen Reed-Wright and Eric Hyche were absent."

Some teachers have opposed this decision and have informed the education ministry to refine the current state of government-aided schools, instead of focussing on starting new ones.

The current state of government-aided schools is shoddy,"" averred teachers and principals alike. Various school principals have revealed that for several months, the government has stopped providing adequate funds, leading to a financial crisis. Maintenance charges, bills, basic supply lines and even salary payments have not been facilitated by the state.

More importantly, the syllabus and curriculum has not been revised for years, according to teachers. It is the same old pattern of teaching and rote learning, teachers lament. Sukhmani Pandey, a teacher said, ""The lessons, poems and chapters have been based on the same pattern for years. There is no addition of new technologies, experimental learning, personality skills, life lessons or practical concepts.""

Creative and interactive teaching-learning concepts are absent, as state-board curriculum is based on book learning and classroom lessons. Jasmeet Barbara, a teacher said, ""For want of a practical approach, we have to stick to textbooks for lessons, there is no way to explain concepts to students through life models. This makes learning boring for students, as their attention span is minimum and there is no creative input at all.""

Outdoor education, practical focus and interactive lessons will improve the standards of state board curriculum. Shabnam Quesreshi, a senior teacher said, ""If we add few elements like interactive and fun learning, outside classroom teaching and practical application of theories, then we can match the style of international curriculum. We should formulate and teach the syllabus according to the primary needs of students so that we make it fun for them and increase their interest in state board schools."""

Supriyo Hazra moves through the different corners of the year to check out the year-long performances of the key players of tinsel town amid the high profile marriages of top stars.

Aamir Khan: It is a rare event when you have seen superstar Aamir Khan is apologizing to his fans for the debacle of his movie. Yes, this happened in 2018 when Aamir's much-awaited Diwali release Thugs of Hindostan bombed at the Box Office and left millions of his fans disheartened. Aamir, who is known for making hit movies like Dhoom3, Dangal, PK, had to apologise for the movie's poor show and hopefully we will not see another such disaster from his bag in future.

Akshay Kumar: Akshay Kumar started off with Padman where he was seen enacting the role of Lakshmikant Chauhan. The movie is based on the short story named ""The Sanitary Man of Sacred Land"" from Twinkle's book ""The Legend of Lakshmi Prasad"". Infact, it is the life of Tamil Nadu-based Arunachalam Muruganantham, who created affordable sanitary napkins for the women of his village, who has been the main driving force behind the tale. Akshay portrayed the central character beautifully. The movie released in January and entered the Rs. 100 crore club easily, based on its strong content and storyline. With the film Gold, Akshay once again turned his patriotic button on when he played the character Tapan Das, who brought the Indian team together to win the first Olympic gold as an independent nation. In late November, he came out strong with his first southern debut with 2.0. The movie also featured Rajinikanth and Akshay played a villainous character. In 2019, he will be seen in movies like Kesari and Mission Mangal.

Ayushmann Khurrana: Ayushmann had a perfect 2018 with all his movies- Andhadhun and Badhaai Ho- rocking at the Box Office. While, Andhadhun gave Ayushmann a chance to move out from his boy-next-door characters to play the perfect protagonist in the thriller, he was once again back in his usual cute avatar with Badhaai Ho. The Dusshera release was loved by people across India and the movie emerged as one of the biggest hits of the year. Ayushmann will soon be seen in Dream Girl. The announcement about the movie was made recently via an interesting video which the makers created specially by keeping in mind the impact Ayushmann is making in recent times.

Aishwarya Rai Bachchan: Ash, the Bachchan bahu, was back on the silver screen this year with Fanney Khan. After a long time, she was seen pairing with her old onscreen partner Anil Kapoor. The movie, however, failed to impress fans much and did average business at Box Office.

Anushka Sharma: 2017 was a major year in her life as Anushka, the poster girl of Bollywood, tied knots with Indian cricket team captain Virat Kohli. This year, Anushka came roaring on the big screen with a horror movie named Pari. The posters of the film, which was released in 2017, had created much thrill among fans. Pari finally released during Holi and Anushka surely impressed people with her experiment of playing a scary-yet-lovable Pari. She then arrived as the autobiographer in the biopic based on actor Sanjay Dutt's Life-Sanju. Anushka was praised for her small yet significant role in the movie. Anushka will end the year with the release of her much-awaited movie Zero where she will once again pair with Shah Rukh Khan and Katrina Kaif, her co-stars in 2012 movie Jab Tak Hai Jaan.

Alia Bhatt: Apart from her love affair with Ranbir Kapoor making the headlines in the year, actress Alia Bhatt impressed her fans with perhaps one of her best performances in Raazi. The Meghna Gulzar directorial Indian spy movie provided Alia the perfect platform to perform strongly the character of Sehmat Khan. The movie was appreciated both by fans and critics and surely provided the much needed momentum to Alia Bhatt's glowing career. Away from Raazi, she was engaged in shooting for her upcoming movies which include Gully Boy, Brahmastra and Kalank. With Brahmastra, Alia will pair for the first time with Ranbir Kapoor. Images from the set of the film have already gone viral as the actress herself shared several of them on her social media pages over the months. The movie will also feature acting legend Amitabh Bachchan. The announcement was also made about Sadak 2, in which filmmaker father Mahesh Bhatt will direct his daughter Alia for the first time.

Ajay Devgan: Ajay Devgan's major activity in 2018 was his appearance in the movie Raid. Directed by Raj Kumar Gupta, the film is inspired by the real life income-tax raid conducted by the officers of the Income Tax Department under the leadership of a courageous and upright Indian Revenue Service officer in the 1980s. The movie earned positive reviews from critics and fans. Ajay also produced the movie Helicopter Eela which features his actress wife Kajol.

Amitabh Bachchan: From turning on the comedy switch with 102 Not Out to experiment by playing the character of a warrior named Khudabaksh Azaad in Thugs of Hindostan, Amitabh Bachchan still dominated the Indian entertainment scenario with ease this year. Pairing up with his old co-star Rishi Kapoor in 102 Not Out, Big B succeeded in entertaining his fans with this movie that released on May 4.The movie even released in China later in the year. However, Thugs of Hindostan, a mega release of the year, failed miserably at the Box Office. The Diwali release had every ingredient to win at the counters but Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir Khan's Jodi flopped even before setting for a voyage on the sea. In the small screen, the old sound of hooters was back as Big B once again took the opportunity of hosting his favourite gameshow Kaun Banega Crorepati.

Deepika Padukone: The Bollywood beauty finally said 'Yes! I do'. The dimple-cheeked B-town queen, perhaps one of the most successful actors of this generation, tied the knot with another tinsel town heart-throb Ranveer Singh. In a wedding that could even give a tough challenge to the beautifully scripted marriages of Bollywood, Deepika and Ranveer skipped media attentions to land in Italy to be the perfect man and woman forever. 'DeepVeer' perhaps became the new word that emerged in the world of social media following the marriage. Images of the wedding went viral on the internet as the entire nation rejoiced and wished the couple a very best of luck for their new innings in life.

Ranveer Singh: Officially scheduled for release on Dec 1, 2017, controversy surrounding his Padmaavat movie had forced makers to delay its release till 2018. The movie finally released this year amid protests, violence and even ban on release in several states. However, Padmaavat and Ranveer as Alauddin Khilji shined on the big screen. The movie became a smash hit and Ranveer earned appreciation from both fans and critics for his strong performance onscreen. He will once again be back on the silverscreen as the tough cop in Simmba. Ranveer pairs up with young Sara Ali Khan for the Rohit Shetty directorial film that will try to compete with Shah Rukh Khan's Zero at the end of the year. Interestingly, Simmba assumes significance as it will be the first movie of the actor after he tied the knots with beloved actress Deepika Padukone in 2018. In 2019, Ranveer and Alia will pair up for director Zoya Akhtar's much-awaited movie Gully Boy.

Hrithik Roshan: Hrithik Roshan did not appear on the silverscreen for a single time this year but anticipations over his 2019 release Super 30 is already quite high. The Indian actor will be seen playing the character of a teacher. Away from his glamorous roles in movies like Dhoom 2, Hrithik has been portraying a simple look with a beard in the movie.

Irrfan Khan: Karwaan and Blackmail were perhaps two movies in which Irrfan appeared this year but it was the news of his cancer detection which left fans shocked across the globe. A Twitter post earlier in 2018 by Irrfan Khan had left his well wishers silent as the actor said that he was suffering from neuroendocrine tumour. Irrfan has been receiving medications for the disease in the UK and has been away from India for a long time now.

Jacqueline Fernandez: Bollywood's Sri Lankan diva Jacqueline returned onscreen with his Kick co-star Salman Khan in Race 3. The Eid release made reasonably good business at the Box Office. The actress also tasted some social media trolls and criticisms over her move of experimenting to recreate Madhuri Dixit's iconic Ek Do Teen song in her own way. The attempt left most of her fans disappointed. Comparison with Madhuri Dixit and the original number from 1988 movie Tezaab even made situations tough for the Sri Lankan actress. The Baaghi 2 song remained one forgettable moment of the year.

John Abraham: Bollywood's hunk returned onscreen in his kickass avatar with two movies- Satyameva Jayate and Parmanu: The Story Of Pokhran. Both the movies performed reasonably well at the Box Office and John made his presence strongly felt in the Bollywood arena with his power packed performance. Satyameva Jayate will be specially remembered for the item number Dilbar. The recreation of the iconic Bollywood number of the 90s earned appreciation from moviegoers. Nora Fatehi sizzled onscreen with equal boldness and guts that was once showed by Sushmita Sen in Sirf Tum. The new Dilbar became equally popular across India and perhaps became the party anthem in discs and pubs all over.

Ranbir Kapoor: After a poor show in 2017, Ranbir returned with a bang this year as 'Sanju'. The biopic on actor Sanjay Dutt helped Ranbir shine at the Box Office. His transformation from Ranbir to Sanjay Dutt had become the talk of the town this year and Sanju remained one memorable film in his career. Fans will be looking forward to see Ranbir Kapoor once again when he will unite with his real life love Alia Bhatt for Brahmastra. The fantasy film will also feature Amitabh Bachchan.

Kareena Kapoor Khan: Kareena was back in action with Veere Di Wedding this year. The poster of the movie had earned attention of fans in 2017 and this time the movie also grossed well though it was disliked by critics. Kareena shared screen space with other ladies in the film like Sonam Kapoor, Swara Bhaskar and Shikha Talsania.

Katrina Kaif: The Barbie Doll of Bollywood made a poor start to the Box Office this year with her highly anticipated Diwali release Thugs of Hindostan doing poorly. While the movie boasts of a cast like Aamir Khan and Amitabh Bachchan it failed miserably at the Box Office, disappointing fans and critics alike. Katrina will end the year with another probable major movie of her career- Zero. The film will see her unite with her old Jab Tak Hai Jaan co-stars Shah Rukh Khan and Anushka Sharma. Katrina's sizzling avatar in Husn Parcham song from Zero wowed her fans as they are going gaga on social media. In 2019, Katrina will be back with Salman Khan once again with their Eid release Bharat.

Priyanka Chopra: India's international star had the most memorable 2018 as she tied the knots with US singer Nick Jonas in Jodhpur. Nick and Priyanka married just days after Ranveer and Deepika wedding, giving Indians a chance to celebrate two major Bollywood marriages back-to-back in one year. Priyanka appeared for one last time in the third season of her international TV series Quantico. She also worked in international movies like A Kid Like Jake and Isn't It Romantic? Movie lovers are eagerly waiting for their release. However, despite opting out from Bharat, Priyanka is currently busy with her much-awaited Bollywood return- The Sky Is Pink . The Shonali Bose directed movie will also feature actors Zaira Wasim and Farhan Akhtar. Fans will be waiting for her arrival once again on the Desi screen after a long gap.

Saif Ali Khan: Saif Ali Khan is a happy father in 2018 as his daughter Sara made her Bollywood debut with Kedarnath. Sara will also feature in Simmba, opposite Ranveer Singh. On the work front, Saif's two movies Kaalakaandi and Baazaar released this year. The movies performed moderately at the Box Office. But the biggest takeaway for Saif this year is probably Netflix's web series Sacred Games, in which he played the role of police officer Sartaj Singh. Saif received appreciation for his acting in Sacred Games, which also featured Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Radhika Apte.

Sushant Singh Rajput: Onscreen MS Dhoni was back with one special year end release Kedarnath where he was seen romancing Saif Ali Khan's daughter Sara Ali Khan. It is time to see how he delivers at the Box Office after a dry 2017 where his only release Raabta failed miserably.

Salman Khan: The blackbuck poaching case came haunting Salman Khan in 2018. After spending two nights in jail, the Bollywood superstar, who is convicted in the 20-year old Blackbuck poaching case, was granted bail by a Rajasthan court in April this year. The actors were accused of poaching a blackbuck, an endangered species protected under the Indian Wildlife Act, in Kankani village of Jodhpur during the shooting of film Hum Saath Saath Hain in September, 1998. Khan was convicted under Section 51 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972. In his career, Salman featured for the first time in Race movie series with Race 3 and the Eid release once again did not fail to entertain fans. Salman once again made a special appearance in 2018 movie Zero for a special song Isaaqbaazi. Salman and Shah Rukh Khan could be seen entertaining their fans with their signature dance steps in the special Christmas gift for their fans. Salman will be seen back with his Eid release Bharat next year. He is pairing up with his old colleague Katrina Kaif for the movie. Salman also hosted popular TV shows 10 Ka Dum and Bigg Boss this year.

Shah Rukh Khan: He started 2018 with a teaser and now he is ending the year with the whole movie-Zero. So far, the teasers, trailer and even the songs of the movie, where SRK is playing the character of a vertically-challenged person, has left his fans quite impressed. Khan has paired up with director Anand L Rai and actors Anushka Sharma and Katrina Kaif with the promise of delivering one major hit at the end of the year. In 2019, SRK's Kolkata Knight Riders will be back once again on the field with the aim of winning the title for the third time.

Sunny Leone: Sunny Leone remained absent from the Bollywood screen for the entire year. She was last seen in 2017 released movie Tera Intezaar which had failed miserably at the Box Office. However, it was her biopic that made headlines in 2018. Titled ""Karenjit Kaur - The Untold Story of Sunny Leone"", it was an original web-series by ZEE5. The series narrates her journey from a middle-class girl in Canada to becoming India's most googled celebrity. The series starts from her childhood as Gogu to her foray into the adult film industry to her exciting journey into Bollywood. Sunny herself portrayed her own character in the online series. In her personal life, Sunny and her husband Daniel announced the birth of their twin boys, born through surrogacy. They named the boys Asher Singh Weber and Noah Singh Weber.

Varun Dhawan: After completing a successful 2018, Varun Dhawan appeared in two movies this year-October and Sui Dhaaga. While October passed away silently, it was the other movie, which also featured actress Anushka Sharma, that made some bang at the Box Office. Both critics and fans loved the simple story of hopes and aspiration that made Sui Dhaaga one big hit of the year. Pairing up for the first time, movie lovers will surely want Anushka and Varun to work together in several colourful movies in the upcoming years.

Special mentions

Shraddha Kapoor: Stree and its success as a horror movie would not have been possible without Shraddha, The movie emerged as one surprise hit of the year and Shraddha competed hard to match with the skills of Rajkummar Rao in this movie. Her mysterious character and that too without a name left viewers spellbound. She was also seen in other major release of the year Batti Gul Meter Chalu, opposite Shahid Kapoor, but it remained mostly unnoticed.

Tiger Shroff: How can one forget the new hunk in the town. Tiger Shroff, his dance steps and his fight sequences, made Baaghi 2 one memorable roller coaster ride for young B-town fans. Tiger will now be seen in 2019 as the new student in Punit Malhotra's movie Student of the Year 2. It is now time to see how he steps into the shoes of Sidharth Malhortra and Varun Dhawan who had left a deep and everlasting impression in Student of the Year in 2012.

Disha Patani: She is just few films old but her performance in Baaghi 2 was impressive enough to make her find a place in the list. Disha will be waiting for 2019 excitedly as it will mark her major Bollywood debut in Salman Khan's Eid release Bharat.

Radhika Apte: You cannot ignore Radhika when it comes to content driven movies and her eye catching performance in making the characters go alive onscreen. From Akshay Kumar's Padman to Ayushmann Khuranna's Andhadhun, Radhika left her presence strongly felt in all of them. She was also seen in Saif Ali Khan's Bazaar. With three big releases and her notable appearance in web series Lust Stories, Radhika dominated the world of Bollywood in her own ways in 2018. Not to forget Netflix web series Sacred Games, in which Radhika made her mark.

Sonam Kapoor: Sonam Kapoor finally said Yes when she tied the knots with Anand Ahuja in May this year. The first fat Bollywood wedding of 2018 was followed by two more as Deepika-Ranveer and Priyanka and Nick also tied the knots in the fag end of the year. In the working front, Sonam worked in three popular movies-Padman, Sanju and Veere Di Wedding. All the three movies roared at the Box Office and made Sonam one heroine to look after in the coming year.

Mr. Consistent of the Year

Rajkummar Rao: There was a strong competition this year between Bareilly Ki Barfi co-stars Ayushmann and Rajkummar Rao when it was time to find the consistent performer of the year. But it was probably Rajkummar Rao who once again stole the show with the variety of characters he played all through the year. From a serious role in Omerta to the ghost hunting village simpleton in Stree, Rajkummar did it all to entertain his fans. He also appeared in two other major movies this year- Love Sonia and Fanney Khan. In Fanney Khan, he shared the screenspace with Anil Kapoor and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. With several releases on the cards, the powerful actor is expected to deliver yet another electrifying 2019 for his fans.

#MeToo

Following Hollywood, #MeToo movement had also created ripples in Bollywood this year. The campaign began with actress Tanushree Dutta's allegations of sexual misconduct against Horn Ok Pleassss co-star Nana Patekar. Following Tanushree's claim, several actresses belonging to different generations came out in public to share their experiences of sexual harassments and assaults. One of the allegations, which raised storm, was brought by writer-director-producer Vinta Nanda against onscreen 'Sanskari' actor Alok Nath. Nanda alleged that Nath had sexually violated her years ago.

RIP:

Sridevi: The Bollywood screen goddess, who ruled the hearts of her fans for decades, passed away in Dubai. When the news of her death broke, generations of Indians were too shocked to digest it. The heart stopped beating for the Julie girl a little too early. But then she would forever be the Hawa Hawai of the Indian film industry like none other. Sridevi, who died due to 'accidental drowning', was just 54. Sridevi, who left a strong impression in the minds of Indian cinegoers with her films like Mr India, Sadma, Chandni, English Vinglish and Mom, had gone to Dubai to attend a wedding ceremony. (IBNS)"

For me, the concept of parenting has to be somewhere in-between,"" says Tailang who played two different kinds of father in the two series.

""Dekhiye sir, mere dono ladke champion hain,"" actor Rajesh Tailang is seen bragging to a cricket official in Netflix's forthcoming original, Selection Day. In the show, Tailang plays an overzealous father, Mohan Kumar, who pushes his two sons to become ace cricketers. A slight problem in this plan -- one of his sons, Manju Kumar, hates cricket. The series is based on the eponymous book by Booker Prize winner, Arvind Adiga.

This is Tailang's second outing in a father's role in the recent past. Just a few weeks ago, he was seen playing Ramakant Pandit -- a diametrically opposite character -- in Mirzapur, another web series. ""For me, the concept of parenting has to be somewhere in-between. These two extremes can't work. In Mirzapur, I am extra optimistic and hopeful, while in Selection Day, I am this extra pushy person. As a parent, I identify with the thoughts of Mohan Kumar, not his ways,"" says the Delhi-based artist.

The series is a satire on the current familial structure of our society and the flailing education system. The boys struggle with a desire to fulfill their father's dreams, even as they stumble to find their own footing in a posh school, where they have been planted to realise the road to cricket. There is an absent mother thrown in the mix as well.

""We see it all around us. Parents do project their own aspirations, desires and failed ambitions on their children. That drew me to the show. Cricket is just the premise, it's quite a scathing comment on parent-child dynamics. In the show, the father even questions the coach, beats him up, as he thinks he knows best,"" says Tailang. The web series also features Mohammed Samad, Yash Dholye and Mahesh Manjrekar, along with Ratna Pathak Shah in key roles.

Advertising

A veteran of the Delhi theatre scene, Tailang was born and brought up in Rajasthan, and frequented the Delhi home of his cartoonist brother, the late Sudhir Tailang. The thought of being an actor had caught hold of him early on.

""My father owned a printing press where the tickets for cinema halls would be printed. I have seen most films from the hole in the projector room, sitting on the lone stool placed there. It was very much like the film Cinema Paradiso,"" says the 49-year-old, adding, ""I even attended the children's workshop organised by the National School of Drama (NSD).""

After passing out from NSD, Tailang was seen in TV shows like Shanti, and films such as Haazar Chaurasi Ki Maa, and later in Dev and Mangal Pandey: The Rising. The mention of Shanti (1995), where he played a kitchen help, lightens up the moment. ""Now, when someone mentions the show, I think of it as an ancient relic, something that has perhaps come out from excavations,"" says the actor.

Post-2007, till about 2013, Tailang moved bag and baggage to Delhi. ""I drifted away from films and started doing theatre and teaching in Delhi,"" he says. This year has been quite eventful for the actor, with three film releases and two big web shows coming his way. But the transition to digital was something he was quite keen on. ""I have had my own channel on YouTube for the last few years, called Theatre Talkies, where I have put up short films and other things I have made. A full-fledged acceptance of the web-series format, where you have to hold the audience for 8-10 episodes each season, is supremely challenging for any actor,"" he says.

He adds, ""I understand the romanticism and appeal of films and theatre, and the romance of community-viewing. But we can't dismiss the evolution of solo viewing. And as the stories are getting more real, and the characters are based in the same reality, people will watch it. Iss cheez se pura drishyavidhan (the pattern of visual consumption) badal gaya hai, of how we consume stories.""

Tailang, who has taught at NSD, also talks about his student days, and how things were different when he became a teacher. ""When we attended NSD, we would end up referring to five books and spend hours in the library to research on a term that a professor might have mentioned. Now, the minute I mention a term or a concept, Google offers my students the five best answers. We had some semblance of the guru-shishya tradition, ab toh students sab bol dete hain,"" he says.

For now, Tailang is happy dividing his time between Delhi and Mumbai and is hopeful of getting more work. ""I really wish to do comedy on screen. I have done a lot on stage, and I miss the instantaneous reaction. Pata nahin mujhe sirf sanjeeda kism ke role hi kyun offer hote hain,"" he adds.

But where to find them? Deal, no deal or even another referendum?

While #Brexit has dominated much of public debate and Government time, #Metoo and #gigeconomy have also featured prominently in public debate though they are assigned to the Government's growing list of ""future legislative reform needed if we just had time"" pile - shame JK Rowling couldn't make Hermione's time turner a reality.

The Government has repeatedly stated that it intends to maintain current UK employment laws so that existing workers' rights are unchanged following exit day, this could of course change, as political fortunes change ('Fantastic [Brexit] Beasts: the [G]rimes of Grindel[gov]'). The reality is that it is unlikely the Government will change its mind and repeal all EU-derived employment law or make large-scale changes to employment law in the aftermath of Brexit. There may be scope to tweak some provisions within the current legislation, but political considerations make it relatively unlikely that core employee rights would be reduced significantly following Brexit.

John Whiting, now CBE, is the writer's personal favourite taxman for this simple and honest statement, which continues to be true. Like last year, determining worker status in modern workplaces has once again been a hot topic in 2018.

Back in February we finally saw the delayed Government Response to the recommendations of the Taylor review of modern working practices; and the answer to the tricky employment status issue is...more consultation and thinking!

The Government has rejected Matthew Taylor's recommendation for introducing a 'worker status by default' presumption and is instead revisiting the possibility of a new statutory test to determine employment status. As acknowledged in the latest consultation which closed on 1 June, codification of the test for employment status would involve trade-offs. On the one hand, a simple and clear formula will give more certainty. On the other hand, the current case law based framework provides the nuance and flexibility often needed when applying the test to different circumstances which are inevitable in the labour market.

Ultimately, employment status is a complicated subject because employment relationships are just that - complicated. A status test set down in legislation rather than case law doesn't change that fact. Trying to encapsulate the nuanced factors developed over years of case law into legislation will be no easy feat. But have the courts been any more helpful this year?

Since the 2016 landmark tribunal decision (and 2017 Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) judgment) that Uber drivers are workers (despite Uber's best efforts at drafting bamboozling contractual clauses) there has been a seemingly endless supply of successful new claims predominantly concerning couriers [Insert your choice of courier company name and you will most likely find a case].

In June, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment in Pimlico Plumbers Limited & Anr v Smith on whether a plumber who was self-employed for tax purposes was nonetheless a worker for employment law purposes. In relation to the personal service requirement for establishing 'worker' status, the Supreme Court confirmed that a limited or occasional power of delegation could still be consistent with personal performance. The 'dominant purpose' of the contract remained one of personal service.

The Supreme Court's judgment significantly decreases the importance of the right of substitution as a determining factor. A substitution clause in and of itself does not magically prevent worker status. On the other hand, integration in the business appears to be a factor of increasing importance in the current wave of worker status cases.

The Supreme Court has tweaked the judicial test by succinctly articulating the 'dominant purpose' factor. But this is more judicial test evolution rather than revolution. Unfortunately, for hopes of world peace, arguments over the required elements of worker status are far from over. Whether and to what extent 'mutuality of obligation' between assignments is relevant to a person's status during assignments is still up for grabs. 'Mutuality of obligation' is a crucial factor to establish 'employee' status, but is it required and if so, to what extent, for establishing 'worker' status? As the Supreme Court said there is no easy answer to this question and it will have to await appraisal on another occasion.

The further appeal in the Uber case was heard by the Court of Appeal on 30 and 31 October. Will the judgment, when handed down, provide an answer? No doubt whichever way the judgment goes, the losing party will further appeal.

Unfortunately, we are not much closer to tackling world peace!

Last year in Jones v Birds Eye, the employment tribunal reminded us that following the 2013 EAT decision in Moran v Ideal Cleaning, the number of agency workers potentially falling within the provisions of the Agency Workers Regulations 2010 was significantly lower than originally anticipated. Following Moran, not all agency workers are protected; it is only those supplied to work temporarily. Those placed indefinitely (meaning open-ended in duration) are not placed 'temporarily' and are therefore outside the scope of the Agency Workers Regulations (AWR).

In both Moran and Jones the agency workers were found not to be temporary and so not covered by the AWR. Conversely this year in Brooknight Guarding Ltd v Matei we have an example of an agency worker placed temporarily. The EAT agreed with the tribunal, that while a relief security guard mainly worked at one site, it was as a 'cover security guard'. Each 'as required' assignment was on a temporary rather than on a permanent or indefinite basis.

In Kocur v Angard Staffing Solutions Ltd, an employer breached the AWR in providing an agency worker with fewer enhanced contractual days' holiday and shorter paid rest breaks than comparable permanent employees, despite the agency worker receiving a higher hourly wage. The EAT rejected the defence that the agency worker's higher rate of pay offset his inferior holiday entitlement and rest breaks - the AWR require a term-by-term comparison not a package approach.

For a part-time worker to establish less favourable treatment under the Part-Time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 (PTW) they need to identify an actual full-time worker comparator who is: employed by the same employer under the same type of contract and engaged in the same or broadly similar work having regard to level of qualification, skills and experience.

In Roddis v Sheffield Hallam University, the EAT considered what constitutes the 'same type of contract' for PTW purposes in the context of a claim by an employee working under a zero hours contract. The University argued that a lecturer's zero-hours contract was not the 'same type of contract' so he could not compare himself with a full-time lecturer on a permanent contract of employment.

A good academic try? Well no. The EAT had no trouble in rejecting this argument. It cannot be that a zero-hours contract of itself constitutes a different type of contract for the purposes of the PTW, since the consequence would be that an employee on a zero-hours contract would never be able to compare themselves to a full-time worker. As the EAT points out, if a contract of employment containing a zero-hours clause was a distinct type of contract under the PTW, the PTW would be self-defeating.

Back in June 2013, the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 was revamped. Significant new provisions were introduced. The changes included introducing co-workers' liability for victimisation with corresponding employer statutory vicarious liability.

In November, the Court of Appeal in Timis and Sage v Osipov confirmed that an individual's personal liability for detriment which they cause to a whistleblower colleague can extend to liability for that colleague's dismissal. Where a distinct prior detrimental act done by a co-worker results in the whistleblower's dismissal, the whistleblower can still recover compensation for losses flowing from the dismissal - a so-called 'dismissal consequent on detriment' claim. In this case, it leaves two wrongdoer directors on the hook for just over £2 million of losses, the employer company being insolvent.

For there to be a qualifying disclosure under the whistleblowing legislation, there must be a disclosure of information, not a matter of opinion or an allegation. In practice, information and allegations are often intertwined. In June, the Court of Appeal clarified that the question is whether the disclosure has ""sufficient factual content and specificity"" (Kilraine v London Borough of Wandsworth).

This year we have also learnt on the whistleblowing front:

Common law vicarious liability is a principle of strict, no-fault liability for wrongs committed by another person. In an employment relationship, an employer may be liable for the wrongs committed by an employee where there is a sufficient connection between those wrongs and the employee's employment. This is a very long-standing legal principle with the foundation of the 'modern' principle going back to 1912 (Lloyd and Grace, Smith and Co). But have 21st century developments expanded its scope?

Following a number of appellate level 21st century judgments, when considering whether an incident has sufficient connection with the employer, it is not merely a question of whether the employee was 'at work' in a strict sense. Instead it is whether the employee was otherwise 'clothed in the employer's authority' or ''acting within the field of activities assigned to them'.

For example, an employer was liable for a Managing Director's violent assault of a colleague at an impromptu post-Christmas work party after-party as the MD 'chose to wear his metaphorical managing director's hat' at the time of the incident. Another employer was vicariously liable for a data breach by a rogue employee as access to the data was within the field of activities assigned to him. The fact that the rogue employee's actions were designed to harm the employer was irrelevant.

July saw the Court of Appeal hand down one of the most significant judgments of the year - a combined judgment in Royal Mencap Society v Tomlinson-Blake and Shannon v Rampersad t/a Clifton House Residential Home. In a single judgment, the Court of Appeal has effectively overturned the precedent value of numerous EAT judgments concerning the treatment of 'sleep-in' shifts for national minimum wage (NMW) purposes.

Where a worker is required to work a number of 'sleep-in' night shifts at the employer's premises (to be available in case of an occasional emergency but otherwise expected to sleep all or most of the shift), does the full night shift constitute 'working' for the purposes of the NMW? The Court of Appeal has now answered this question ruling: ""the only time that counts for NMW purposes [during sleep-in-shifts] is the time when the worker is required to be awake for the purpose of working"".

Quite simply the only time that counts for NMW purposes is the time when the worker is required to be awake and actually carrying out work. Time spent sleeping/relaxing does not count. Factors previously found to point towards NMW being payable for the entire sleep-in shift are now irrelevant. The sleep-in exception in the NMW Regulations applies to cases where ""the essence of the arrangement is that the worker is expected to sleep"".

Turning to on-call time for Working Time Directive purposes, until this year Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) case-law has tended to focus on the worker's location during stand-by periods and whether it is at a place determined by the employer. Early this year, in Ville de Nivelles v Matzak, the CJEU considered whether on-call time is 'working time' for fire-fighters on-call at home but with a duty to respond within eight minutes. The CJEU has held that such time is 'working time'.

Perhaps a bit counterintuitively, this judgment still reaffirms the importance of proximity to the workplace. In this case, the obligation for the firefighters to remain physically present at the place determined by the employer (their homes) and the 'geographical and temporal constraints' resulting from the requirement to reach their place of work within eight minutes, limited the opportunities which the firefighters had to devote themselves to their personal and social interests. The situation of the firefighters in this case could therefore be distinguished from that of a worker who, during his stand-by duty, must simply be at his employer's disposal inasmuch as it must be possible to contact him. While being on employer premises during on-call time is not required, the proximity of the worker to the workplace at a place determined by the employer (even if it is the worker's home) is still a key factor.

In what is now a perennial favourite, holiday leave accrual, carry-over and pay calculations have once again featured heavily over the year.

Working out holiday entitlement for term time only workers, casual and zero hour workers can often prove to be an administrative headache. The Working Time Regulations (WTR) require holiday pay to be calculated on the basis of the average hours worked in the preceding 12 weeks immediately before payment is made. However, many employers have instead worked out holiday pay by using a 12.07% of annualised hours shortcut as set out in ACAS guidance (5.6 weeks is equivalent to 12.07% of hours worked over a year for a full time worker).

While the 12.07% method is accurate in many cases, it isn't always. In March, the EAT in Brazel v The Harpur Trust confirmed that calculating holiday pay for variable hour, term-time workers based on 12.07% of annualised hours is incorrect. The express provisions contained in the WTR cannot be overridden for ease of calculation. As shown in Mrs Brazel's case, the shortcut did not work accurately for part-time term time workers. Employers using a 12.07% of annualised hours calculation as a shortcut need to review their holiday pay calculation practices or face potential claims.

In Gomes v Higher Level Care Ltd, the Court of Appeal was asked whether compensation for failing to provide rest breaks can include an injury to feelings award. If yes, this would significantly increase the value of rest break breach claims.

The Court of Appeal has confirmed that compensation for claims for failing to provide rest breaks does not extend to injury to feelings, being akin to a breach of contract claim.

While compensation for failure to provide rest breaks and annual leave does not extend to awards for injury to feelings, not all WTR claims are excluded. In contrast, compensation for injury to feelings may be awarded in working time detriment claims since they are more akin to a statutory tort (South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service v Mansell & ors).

We have also had yet another EAT judgment on overtime and holiday pay calculations. The EAT in Flowers and others v East of England Ambulance Trust, once again confirmed that for a WTR claim ""normal pay"" is that which is ""normally received"". Focusing on whether overtime is or isn't ""voluntary"" is irrelevant. The key is regular receipt. But also check the contractual provisions. If there is a contractual right to have overtime included, there may not be a need to establish a regular pattern. In Flowers, regardless of the WTR claim, the claimants were entitled under a contractual clause to have any overtime pay received in the preceding three months included in their annual leave calculation whether or not the overtime worked was part of a regular and settled pattern.

In two German references, Kreuziger v Land Berlin and Max-Planck v Shimizu, the CJEU held that a worker who does not apply for paid annual leave during employment does not automatically lose the right to an allowance in lieu of untaken leave on termination. The worker must have been given an opportunity to take that leave. While employers are not required to force workers to actually exercise their right to take paid annual leave, a bit of nagging may be needed. It is for the employer to show that it encouraged the worker to do so, while informing them, accurately and in good time, of the risk of losing that leave at the end of the applicable reference period.

The CJEU has confirmed that the Working Time Directive (WTD) does not require holiday leave accrual during the taking of parental leave (Tribunalul Botoşani v Dicu). Parental leave (in the UK 18 weeks' unpaid leave to care for a child) is distinguishable from sickness absence and maternity leave. If national law suspends the employment contract during parental leave, then annual leave entitlement does not accrue during the taking of that parental leave. Parental leave is not equivalent to a period of actual work for determining the duration of paid annual leave.

In the UK, legislative provisions which apply to maternity, paternity, adoption and shared parental leave expressly state that during the leave period the employee is entitled to the benefit of all the terms and conditions of employment except remuneration - so holiday leave accrual continues during these leave periods. However, there is no corresponding legislative provision in relation to EU law derived parental leave.

If an employer unilaterally imposes a contractual change, it is possible for employees' agreement to be implied if they continue to work without protesting after the change has been imposed. But this is risky. Careful analysis of all communication from employees (both verbal and written) is necessary to ensure nothing has been communicated that suggests or evidences objection to the changes. Where the change imposed does not have immediate effect, silence would not be considered to be agreement simply as a result of the passage of time.

In April, the Court of Appeal in Abrahall and ors v Nottingham City Council reminded employers just what risky business it is to assume agreement. In this case, the Court held that a group of employees who continued to work following their employer's imposition of a pay freeze did not agree to a variation of contract. Although the employees did not bring tribunal claims until two years later and did not individually communicate protest, they had protested through their trade unions at the time. The employees continuing to work could not be taken as unequivocal acceptance of a change that was wholly to their disadvantage. A decision by the union not to take industrial action over the imposed change did not equate to accepting the variation.

Also in April, we received Supreme Court clarification on when contractual notice of termination served by post takes effect (Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust v Haywood). In the absence of any specific contractual provision, contractual notice takes effect only when the employee personally takes delivery of the letter containing the notice (so not date recorded delivery signed for by a family member). In this case, the date of termination was crucial because it determined whether the notice period expired on or before the employee's 50th birthday, which affected her pension entitlement by some £200,000.

This judgment now aligns the contractual law position with the statutory position in respect of the effective date of termination (EDT) under the Employment Rights Act 1996.

Lesson: when dismissing an employee, it is usually best to inform the employee in person (written confirmation being simply that, confirmation, and not the mode of first communication of the actual decision). This will remove any ambiguity about the date of dismissal.

From this year's crop of unfair dismissal judgments we have learned:

A head teacher's failure to disclose to school governors a close personal relationship she had with a registered sex offender was misconduct justifying dismissal (Reilly v Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council - Supreme Court). This judgment is of particular note as Lord Wilson questions how useful is the long-standing Burchell v BHS reasonableness test, but without reaching a conclusion. The Supreme Court has, in effect, invited argument in a future case.

Misconduct does need to necessarily amount to gross misconduct for a fair dismissal. There is no magic in labelling something as gross misconduct rather than as serious misconduct for unfair dismissal purposes. As ever, each case will be fact specific to determine whether the employer acted reasonably in treating that reason for dismissal as sufficient to justify dismissal (Quintiles Commercial UK Ltd v Barongo - EAT).

The deemed extension of the effective date of termination by statutory minimum notice does not apply where the employer is entitled to immediately dismiss (summary dismissal) by reason of the employee's conduct (Lancaster and Duke Ltd v Wileman - EAT)

An employee's letter giving 'notice' was not an unambiguous resignation. The context for the letter was that the employee was expecting to take up a different role in another department (although that role was subsequently withdrawn) and the tribunal was entitled to read it as giving notice of intention to leave a particular role rather than to terminate employment (East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust v Levy - EAT).

Where an employee is contractually entitled to receipt of Permanent Health Insurance (PHI) payments, absent any over-riding express terms, the courts will imply a term preventing an employee being dismissed where this would deprive them of the benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled under the PHI scheme. While an employee may use the implied term in a breach of contract wrongful dismissal claim, tribunals must not allow that breach to automatically dictate its conclusions on unfair dismissal. Having said that, breach of the implied term will still be a very important relevant factor when assessing fairness (Awan v ICTS UK Ltd - EAT).

It is automatically unfair to dismiss an employee for taking part in the activities of an independent trade union. Union officials who are also employees will lose this protection where they are found to have acted wholly unreasonably or maliciously in carrying out their functions. But where is the line drawn?

The Court of Appeal confirmed a trade union official was automatically unfairly dismissed despite misuse of confidential information. In the Court's view, it is not uncommon for a union representative to be given, without soliciting it, information that he or she realises has been obtained without the owner's consent. Although it might be said that the only correct course in such circumstances would be to decline the information or destroy it, the court was 'not here concerned with an ethics seminar'. Instead the key question was whether the very limited way in which Mr Morris made use of the obviously illegally obtained information (forwarding it to HR and insisting on a meeting to discuss the contents) was a 'sufficient departure from good industrial relations practice to take his conduct outside the scope of 'trade union activities' .

The Court held the line had not been crossed. At most, some sort of warning for storing and not deleting the information might have been appropriate. The official's conduct was not outside the scope of 'trade union activities' and he was therefore entitled to the statutory automatic unfair dismissal protection (Morris v Metrolink RATP Dev Ltd).

On the tax front, since 6 April the way that termination payments are taxed has changed. All payments in lieu of notice are now treated as earnings subject to tax and class 1 NICs. Effectively, employers are required to subject to tax an amount equivalent to the employee's basic pay (as defined in the new rules) if notice is not worked. However, planned changes making termination payments above £30,000 subject to class 1A NICs (employer liability only) have been postponed even further to April 2020, which is good news for employers.

While case law on transfers of undertakings has been relatively quiet this year we have had some interesting cases and some rare examples:

A renewed warning that if a parent company takes over the day-to-day running of the business of a subsidiary, this may result in a TUPE transfer of the subsidiary's employees to the parent. Significant care should be taken when a parent company decides to show more of an interest in the business of its subsidiary (whether following a share acquisition or otherwise). If the parent starts making decisions and issuing directions in a manner which suggests that it has assumed control of the subsidiary, it could inadvertently become the employer. In Guvera Ltd v Butler a parent company learned that lesson at some considerable cost, with awards for failing to inform and consult on the intra-group transfer amounting to £3.5 million having been made to the numerous claimants in this case.

European case-law in line with existing UK case-law that a temporary cessation of activities prior a transfer does not necessarily prevent the existence of a transfer of undertaking (Colino Sigüenza - CJEU).

A reminder that in assessing whether there has been a service provision change (SPC) to multiple new providers, the effect of fragmentation must be considered when identifying the relevant activity. In some cases, the way a service is carried out post-transfer will be a relevant consideration in determining whether the activities are fundamentally the same as those carried out by the outgoing contractor. It is important to assess the issue of fragmentation early on in the analysis, because in some cases the fragmentation will be so acute that it will no longer be possible to say that there has been a service provision change (London Care Ltd v Henry and others - EAT).

EAT guidance on the meaning of 'undertaking', 'economic entity' and 'administrative function', which is rarely seen in domestic cases. A useful round-up of case law (both domestic and European) in relation to services or entities performing functions within the public sector (Nicholls and others v London Borough of Croydon).

A rare example of a permitted change to terms and conditions following a TUPE transfer. A transferor was not prevented from withdrawing a travel time allowance. The genuine reason for its withdrawal was that it was outdated and unjustified, not for a reason related to the transfer (Tabberer v Mears Ltd - EAT).

It was hard to miss that on 25 May, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) together with the new Data Protection Act 2018 came into force introducing a raft of important changes to the data protection regime. Key changes include:

In July we received Court of Appeal guidance on the balancing test needed when dealing with a ""mixed data"" Subject Access Request and when a third party objects to their data being disclosed (B v General Medical Council):

Although the decision concerns the DPA 1998, it will continue to have relevance under the DPA 2018 and GDPR regime.

This year employers are reminded that checking references given by applicants is an important part of any recruitment process. Especially where experience equates to safety, doing so is critical.

In Francis-McGann v West Atlantic UK Ltd, a pilot applied for a captain position with a freight airline. He falsely claimed to have previously worked as a captain and gave as a referee Mr Desilijic Tiure - in hope that the reference would never be checked. The pilot was appointed as a captain before his references were checked and provided with training based on him already being an experienced captain.

The person who initially decided to hire Mr Francis-McGann was clearly not an obsessive Star Wars fan. When his references were checked, it became obvious that Mr Desilijic Tiure was fictitious, being Jabba Desilijic Tiure, better known as Jabba the Hutt of Star Wars fame! However that was merely the first Episode.

After being summarily dismissed, Mr Francis-McGann brought a tribunal claim for three months' unpaid notice pay! The tribunal had no qualms in dismissing his claim and allowing the employer's cross claim for recovery of training costs in accordance with a contractual clause in the sum of £4,725. The force was clearly not with Mr Francis-McGann.

In July, the EAT gave a warning to prospective employers considering withdrawing a job offer following the receipt of an unsatisfactory reference criticising an applicant's levels of absence in their previous job without first considering whether there was an underlying disability.

In South Warwickshire NHS Foundation Trust v Lee a prospective employer was liable for discrimination arising from disability when it withdrew a job offer after receiving and relying upon two unsatisfactory references. One of the references was unduly negative and inaccurate because it heavily relied on disability-related absences. The tribunal found the discriminatory reference had more than a minor influence on the new hirer's decision-maker. As such, it did not matter that the non-discriminatory reference may in and of itself have been sufficient cause to withdraw the job offer (although this may be relevant when awarding compensation). Lesson - consider references critically to assess whether any adverse comments in references may relate to disability necessitating follow-up enquiry.

Do employers need to match enhanced maternity pay for fathers taking Shared Parental Leave (ShPL)?

Early in April, the EAT in Ali v Capita Customer Management confirmed that it is not direct sex discrimination for employers to offer 14 weeks' enhanced maternity pay but only statutory ShPL pay.

While this case is in line with Government guidance and the traditional view, it is notable that Mr Ali's case concerned an enhanced maternity pay period of only 14 weeks which happens to be the minimum maternity leave period required under the EU Pregnant Workers Directive. As such, a question mark remains where enhanced contractual maternity pay period exceeds 14 weeks.

While we received at least a limited answer on the question of direct sex discrimination (subject to a pending appeal), the question of indirect sex discrimination is still very much up for grabs. Three weeks after the EAT handed down the Ali judgment, the EAT handed down its related judgment in Hextall v Chief Constable of Leicestershire Police.

In Hextall, the same question was considered through the prism of an indirect discrimination claim. In this case the EAT held the original tribunal incorrectly analysed the question of comparators and also failed to correctly identify the particular disadvantage. The case was therefore sent back to the tribunal. The question of indirect discrimination continues to be unresolved and we wait a further tribunal decision (determined on the correct legal basis). Like Ali, Hextall too is subject to a pending appeal.

While large private sector equal pay claims against several large supermarkets are making their way through the tribunal system and the usual endless preliminary issues, this year we have learned:

'Discrimination arising from a disability' is still a relatively new concept first introduced by section 15 of the Equality Act 2010. Over recent years we are gathering a body of case-law on the intricacies of this concept which involves the employer treating the employee ""unfavourably because of something arising in consequence"" of the employee's disability. Section 15 entails two distinct causative issues: The first involves examining the employer's state of mind: did the unfavourable treatment occur because of the employer's attitude to the relevant 'something'? The second is objective: is there a causal link between the disability and the 'something'?

This year we have learned:

In Donelien v Liberata UK, the Court of Appeal reassures employers that they can rely on the advice of occupational health advisers in determining whether an employee is disabled, so long as appropriate questions are raised and further clarification is sought where necessary.

An employer does not necessarily need to take every step possible to establish whether an employee is disabled in order to avoid having constructive knowledge of disability. The test is what an employer could reasonably be expected to know. In this case, the employer had not relied solely on an occupational health report stating that the employee was not disabled. It had also taken into account 'return to work' meetings and letters from the employee's GP. An employer's efforts need not be perfect and, in the circumstances, the employer had taken reasonable steps to ascertain the nature of the employee's illness and could not reasonably have been expected to do more particularly when dealing with an uncooperative employee.

To establish an indirect discrimination claim, the employee will need to show that the employer applied a ""provision, criterion or practice"" (PCP) that puts, or would put, those of the employee's protected group at a particular disadvantage compared to other groups. In Carreras v United First Partners Research, the Court of Appeal held that an expectation that an employee would work late does not have to be presented as an instruction to cause a disadvantage. If the disabled employee can establish the existence of a long-hours culture, this may be enough to amount to a 'practice' under the Equality Act 2010.

In Colt Technology Services Ltd v Brown, the EAT decided an important point regarding the effect of PHI on discrimination compensation, where the employee has had the opportunity to choose different levels of PHI cover through a workplace flexible benefits scheme.

The EAT considered the 'insurance exception' to the general rule that claimants should only be compensated for actual loss. The policy behind the exception is that an employer should not be able to benefit from an employee's prudence in taking out insurance, and so insurance pay outs are not set off against the employee's financial losses in those circumstances. In the context of a flexible benefits package - where an employee can choose the level of their insurance benefits in exchange for foregoing extra salary - this principle must be apportioned. The portion paid for by the employer without the employee foregoing extra salary will be offset (in this case 50%) and the portion for which the employee had foregone extra salary will not (in this case an additional 25%).

In relation to a claim for unlawful victimisation under the Equality Act 2010, ""giving false evidence or information, or making a false allegation, is not a protected act if the evidence or information is given, or the allegation is made in bad faith."" But does an ulterior motive for making a victimisation claim show bad faith?

In Saad v Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust, the EAT confirmed that honesty not motivation is key. The primary question for victimisation purposes is whether the employee has acted honestly in giving the evidence or information, or in making the allegation, that is relied on as a protected act. The existence of a predominant ulterior motive, while potentially relevant, is not the focus of the enquiry. In this case, just because the allegation was raised as a means to deflect criticism during a performance process did not automatically mean it was done in bad faith.

In Unite the Union v Nailard, the Court of Appeal reminds employers that harassment can be committed by inaction was well as action. Failure to act in relation to third party harassment which is brought to the employer's attention, may itself amount to harassment. If the reason for the failure to act was influenced, consciously or unconsciously, by the relevant protected characteristic, then that failure to act may itself amount to harassment. Employers should ensure that they train staff on dealing with harassment issues, make it clear that harassment from suppliers, clients and customers is not tolerated and keep clear records of issues arising.

In Bakkali v Greater Manchester Buses, the EAT point out that in harassment claims, context is a crucial element. Conduct ""related to"" a protected characteristic (in the test for harassment) is wider in scope than conduct ""because of"" a protected characteristic (in the test for direct discrimination). It requires a broader enquiry, involving ""a more intense focus"" on the context of the offending words or behaviour.

The Holy Grail: financially sustainable access to justice.

Following last year's abolition of tribunal fees by the Supreme Court, the number of claims has been steadily increasing. While the number of individual tribunal claims overall has not yet returned to the pre- 2013 introduction of the fees regime level, we have reached an important statistical milestone. September's quarterly statistics revealed that single-claim receipts are, for the first time, at a higher level than when fees were first introduced.

While the number of claims is set to rise over the near future, the Ministry of Justice in November announced that a new fee regime ""balancing tribunal funding and access to justice"" was ""in development"".

Four years after the introduction of mandatory ACAS early conciliation (EC) we finally have appellate level confirmation on how to apply the 'stop the clock' provisions. In April, the EAT confirmed the widely accepted view that the time limit to present a claim should always be extended by the number of days it takes to complete the EC procedure (Luton Borough Council v Haque).

A photograph of Marx overlooks stacks of plastic chairs, crammed bookshelves and an old desktop computer in an office on the ground floor of a building in central Mumbai. On the evening of January 12, a group of electricity workers affiliated with the Mumbai Electric Employees Union met here. They worked for Reliance Energy, which supplied electricity to homes in the city's suburbs. Despite working for the company for around two decades, laying cables and excavating new lines, they were not permanent employees - they were hired by contractors, who supplied labour to the company.

The previous few weeks had been tumultuous. The company was in the middle of a major transition: its ownership was changing hands, with the Adani Group in the process of taking over.

During this period, a worker died on December 19. He was returning home from work when he fainted and hit his head, resulting in a brain haemorrhage. All the workers in the area - permanent and contract - went on a one-day strike to force the company to pay full-duty compensation to his family.

It seemed like a victory - except, on January 1, the contract workers found they had been marked absent for the day of the strike, while the permanent workers had not. When the union raised this, four workers were suspended on January 9.

Three days later, the union met in their Dadar office to discuss this suspension. Hours later, close to midnight, four of its members found men in plain clothes at their doorstep.

""At around 11.45 pm, around 15 to 20 people came to our door,"" said Rajitha, wife of Satyanarayana Karrela, 40, one of the union members. ""We did not know who they were as they were in civil dress. When we asked they just told us they had work with us.""

The men made the couple sit with their backs to each other and asked them to stay silent as they went about ransacking the house. At the end of the search, they said that they had to take Karrela with them. Panicking that he was about to be kidnapped, Rajitha seized her husband's arm and refused to let go. At this point, she said, the men announced they were the police. They said Karrela would be released in the morning. When she still refused to let go, they wrote an address and phone number on a piece of paper and told her to come there the next morning.

Similar stories played out at the houses of other union members that night - Babushankar Vanguri, 30, Shankar Gunde, 40, and Ravi Marampelli, 40. Large groups of police in plain clothes appeared close to midnight, searched their houses and took them away.

This was no ordinary police detail - it was the Anti-Terrorism Squad of the Maharashtra Police. As the families of the union members found out later, the arrests had been made under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, which punishes those proved guilty of working with banned organisations. In this case, the ATS claims the workers had been funding the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist), which has been fighting a protracted guerilla war in central and eastern India for decades with the aim of overthrowing the government.

How exactly had low-paid workers in Mumbai, who barely earned enough to support their families in India's most expensive city, saved money to send to an underground organisation?

The police claims they did so by raising money from contractors.

At the heart of the police claims, as outlined in its 5,000-page chargesheet submitted in May, are two bank cheques of Rs 1.5 lakh each. Issued in May 2017, the cheques was signed by three office bearers of a contractors association that supplied labour to Reliance Energy. The police claim the workers encashed the cheques and passed on the money to a Maoist operative, who further transferred the money to underground Maoists in Telangana.

But other union members have a simpler explanation for the cheques: they say they were written in support of the union's annual May Day function.

""The workers organised May Day functions every year and get donations from the contractors association for this,"" said N Vasudevan of the New Trade Union Initiative that backs the contract workers' union.

On the same day that they arrested the four union members, the police also arrested Narsaiah Jumpala, one of the three signatories of the cheques and a member of the contractors association. Anjaiah Anthati, president of the association, said there was no coercion at the contractor association meeting at which they decided to sign the cheques. The association, he claimed, makes donations to all workers unions every few years and that too in ""white"" money, by cheque, not cash.

""We can conduct our business only if we have good relations with them,"" said Anthati. ""If we tell them, 'No, go, we won't give you anything', then at some point, the union people will cause trouble for us. That is why we tell them we will take care of them. For this, we have to give them chai paani (money).""

But the police has cited witness statements from at least unnamed 12 contractors in support of its claims. These feature as part of the chargesheet, among the 100-odd statements which have been cited after redacting witness names.

Strikingly, all 12 statements contain identical paragraphs about how the workers introduced a man named ""Mahesh"", who they claimed worked for ""the Party"". ""As I am a resident of Andhra Pradesh, I know that in our native place, Naxalites are recognised as being of the 'party,'"" reads every single statement as translated into Marathi, purportedly made independently in Hindi by each contractor. ""Since then, we became afraid of the topic of Mahesh and whenever Ravi Marampelli, Satyanarayana Karrela and Shankar Gunde asked us for money, we always gave them money out of fear.""

Said Atul Chandra Kulkarni, additional director general of police in charge of the Anti-Terrorism Squad, ""If they have made identical statements to us, that is why we have recorded it that way.""

On January 12, along with four workers and the contractor, the police also arrested a man named Ajay Dasari, who they allege is the Maoist operative who workers introduced as ""Mahesh"". The seventh arrest, also made the same day, was of Ramesh Gondiala, 37, a pro-Telangana poet and activist who worked as a milk delivery man near Kalyan, on the outskirts of Mumbai. In February, another worker, Saidulu Singapanga, 36, was taken into custody, taking the total number of arrests in the case to eight.

This isn't the only Maoist case brought by the Maharashtra police against urban residents. Over June and August, Pune police arrested ten lawyers and activists, accusing them of working with the banned CPI (Maoist) and labelling them ""Urban Naxals"". These arrests too were made under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. Often described as draconian with vague definitions, it allows the police to hold the accused in prison for long periods by prohibiting the courts to grant bail as long as the accusation made by the police appears ""prima facie true"".

""As far as Maharashtra is concerned, there are very few UAPA cases,"" said Nihalsingh Rathod, a Nagpur lawyer with the Indian Association of People's Lawyers. ""Most cases are invoked against Islamic terrorism. The rest are concentrated in Gadchiroli district [in eastern Maharashtra, where there is a Maoist presence].""

Of the few in western Maharashtra, one is the union workers' case. Another is the 2011 case against alleged Maoist Angela Sontakke and the Kabir Kala Manch, a cultural organisation based in Pune, members of which have since been released on bail. In 2015, the Anti-Terrorism Squad arrested Konnath Muralidharan, a Maoist leader from Kerala while he was being treated at a hospital near Pune.

Given the prominence of the ten activists arrested between June and August, and a legal challenge to their arrests in the Supreme Court, discussions on the misuse of this 1960 law were briefly revived, before receding again.

According to Indiaspend, as many as 2,700 cases were filed under UAPA in three years between 2014 and 2016. Of the 33 trials under the law completed in 2016, it reported, 67% ended in acquittals. Evidence in several of these cases tends to be vague.

""I think a lot of leeway is given to the prosecuting agency at the pre-charge stage because it's their word against what the accused have to say,"" said senior advocate Rebecca John, who has argued several cases under the act. ""I don't think enough judicial scrutiny takes place at this stage. And very few of these cases end in conviction. For the prosecution, the period of incarceration is itself the punishment.""

A common thread that connects all of the men arrested on January 12 is the place where they came from: Telangana. Or more specifically, the two districts of Nalgonda and Karimnagar. Also common is their caste background: the workers are all Dalits.

The Mumbai Electric Employees Union was established in 2005, after a worker died while on duty. As contract workers, they were entitled to a compensation of only Rs 25,000 but as union members claim, they successfully forced the company to increase it Rs 6.5 lakh. Since then, the union grew in strength, attracting a large membership of around 1,000 of the company's 4,000 contract workers, many of whom are Telugu-speaking migrants. The Shiv Sena-affiliated Mumbai Electric Workers' Union, which is the only union which is recognised by the company and the Labour Commissioner, claims to represent all contract workers, apart from the 3,500-odd permanent workers, many of whom are Marathi-speaking.

All the arrested workers were office-bearers of the Mumbai Electric Employees Union and played a crucial role in every negotiation with the company and contractors. They all lived in and around Ghatkopar in central Mumbai with their wives and young children and had each been with the electricity company for around at least 15-20 years.

Work conditions were severe at first, say members of the union who worked with their arrested counterparts. Each day, they would go to the company's electricity office and contractors would tell them how many of them would get work for that day. Often, workers would return home empty-handed. With the formation of their union, however, working conditions changed. One of their first struggles was to ensure that all contract workers would get work daily. The arrested workers were active in ensuring this.

In their spare time, they organised reading groups and kept their fellow workers updated with political pamphlets and books related to Marxist, Ambedkarite and pro-Telangana ideology, said Vasudevan. Despite their long stint in the metropolis, the union members had strong connections to their homelands and were active in supporting the movement for a new Telangana state. When Telangana was carved out of Andhra Pradesh in 2014, the new Telangana Rashtra Samiti government promised three acres of land each to landless Dalit farmers. The workers, said Vasudevan, made several trips back home in the hope of getting land.

A Telangana-based researcher specialising in human rights and law, who asked not to be identified, confirmed that many migrants did indeed come back in droves in the first year of the new government, thinking they had to be physically present to avail of the scheme. However, the scheme has not materialised. The workers had grown disenchanted with the new government, said Vasudevan.

According to their co-workers, all the arrested shared an interest in Ambedkarite and Marxist ideas. At all their homes, the police found books, magazines and pamphlets related to this ideology. At Singapanga's home, the police found copies of Veekshanam, a magazine edited by N Venugopal, a Telugu poet, literary critic and journalist.

""We have even published their letters in Veekshanam,"" said Venugopal, who knew six of the eight accused. ""That way they are socially active. But the charge the police is making now is preposterous and unbelievable.""

The police chargesheet contains a screenshot of an email sent by one of the arrested workers, Vanguri, to another arrested worker, Singapanga, inviting him to an event at Ramabai Nagar to protest the arrest of Manda Krishna Madiga, a Telugu Dalit rights activist living in Telangana. Krishna, who was subsequently released, has spoken against the Maoist party for betraying the cause of workers.

But an official of the Anti-Terrorism Squad, who did not want to be identified, claimed the workers' union itself was as an overground organisation of the Maoists. Such organisations are part of the Golden Corridor Committee plan, he said, through which Maoists seek to infiltrate industrial areas in western India.

By all accounts, the workers, however, showed greater interest in Ambedkarite ideas. On December 31, they travelled to Pune in a group of 40 to take part in the anti-caste commemoration at Bhima Koregaon near Pune, where Dalit soldiers with the East India Company had trounced the casteist Peshwa-led army of the Maratha empire in 1818. ""I had gone there for the first time because it was the 200th anniversary of the battle,"" said Saidulu Gondrigalla, one of the suspended workers who was part of the group. ""We saw the [memorial] pillar in the morning, while the garlands were still being put up, then returned to Pune for the Elgaar Parishad,"" a conference being held to mark the anniversay.

While they returned to Mumbai on January 1, back in Bhima Koregaon, Dalits came under attack that day, sparking a strike and caste clashes, which spread across western Maharashtra. By the second week of January, police had conducted sweeping arrests of Dalits they believed to have participated in the violence.

When news of the workers' arrests first came, their colleagues thought this might be related to this action. However, given that the arrested workers were all union members, they also wondered whether this had anything to do with their last protest against the management in December.

The chargesheet is silent on both.

Spokespersons of both Reliance Infrastructure and Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited declined to comment on the case or the suspension of the employees.

""We are not pursuing any such past matters,"" said a spokesperson for Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited in response to a detailed questionnaire. ""It's a brand new company and a brand new way to do things. We took over on August 29 and this is a matter of last year December and January.""

A representative of Reliance Infrastructure, the holding company for Reliance Energy, also declined to comment. ""As discussed, as this business is now with Adani Electricity, you may write to Adani Electricity,"" a Reliance Infrastructure spokesperson wrote in reply to Scroll.in's questions.

Other than the workers, those arrested in the case include Jumpala, the contractor, Dasari, the alleged Maoist operative, and Gondiala, a poet and activist whose connection to the workers is tenuous.

As general secretary of the contractors association, Narsaiah Jumpala was one of the authorised signatories for cheques issued by the organisation. He had a reputation within the association for being sympathetic to the cause of workers, according to both his wife, other workers in the union, and even the head of the contractors' association.

When the worker who later died was admitted to a hospital in December, the contractor who was his employer called Jumpala for advice, according to his wife. Jumpala told the contractor to go to the hospital. ""[The contractor] said he was afraid to go there alone as the workers would be agitated,"" she told Scroll.in. ""He then asked my husband to accompany him in the morning, as my husband has good relations with workers of other contractors as well.""

Anthati, president of the contractors' association told Scroll.in that Jumpala did indeed have good relations with the workers. ""Vo worker ke piche hi rehta tha,"" he said. ""Jumpala was always with the workers, particularly that union...He used to favour them.""

The donation to the union came out of Jumpala's initiative, but the decision was taken collectively by 12 committee members, said Anthati. ""This fellow [Jumpala] only arranged the meeting for the workers,"" Anthati said. ""He asked me three times and I did not give him a time. The fourth time he asked me, I said all right and the entire committee sat and decided to give them money.""

There is not much information available about Ajay Dasari, the man the police claims the money was diverted to. The police chargesheet says he lived in Kalyan and even lists an address. But the address, a squat building adjacent to a larger bungalow, is occupied by families of Bihari and Jharkhand migrant workers, living there on rent. The wife of one of the workers confirmed the Anti-Terrorism Squad had visited this address on a Saturday in January, asking for Dasari.

The woman, who did not want to be identified, said Dasari was her husband's friend. They had met about five years ago while working at a cola factory in Kalyan and Dasari used to visit their home once or twice a month.

""Even now none of us can believe that he could be a terrorist like they said,"" the wife said. ""He always kept his eyes down, he spoke softly, did not look at any women, and never fought with anybody.""

Dasari told them that he lived with relatives in Thane, but that his wife and children were in his village in Telangana. They did not know much else about him.

The Telangana-based researcher found the police claims about a Maoist operative meeting openly with workers suspect.

""It is highly unlikely that if this person was a Maoist, he would go around telling people he was one,"" he said. ""In general, Maoists use cities as safe zones, where they don't take up any activity.""

An Anti-Terrorism Squad official familiar with the case who asked not to be identified agreed that ""Maoists keep their open activities away from secret ones to prevent detection."" However, he claimed that if Dasari was ""allowed access to both sides"", it indicated that he was in fact a ""high level functionary"".

It is not clear how Ramesh Gondiala, a poet and milkman, came to be linked to this case. A pro-Telangana activist from Nalgonda district, his connection with the workers is tenuous - according to Gondrigalla and Vasudevan, he met them in November 2013 at a meeting to support the formation of the state.

Venugopal, who wrote the preface to a book of poetry that Gondiala published, said his poetry covered issues of gender, Dalit rights, labour and the Telangana state.

Gondiala worked to deliver milk to houses in his neighbourhood and also worked as a driver. His wife told Scroll.in that he also regularly helped construction workers to arrange compensation or treatment for them if they suffered injuries or died while on duty.

The ATS also questioned another writer and translator, Prabhakar Macha, in the case. A teacher who was quite popular in Telugu writing circles, Venugopal said Macha was a significant link between Marathi and Telugu literature. He had written a 200-page book on the contribution of Telugu migrants to the building of Mumbai city.

In the first week of January, Macha's wife died. On January 23, a week after he was questioned by the ATS, he killed himself.

In the First Information Report filed hours after the arrests, the ATS claims its operative received a confidential tip-off from an informer, who told them that members of the Maoist party were raising money, recruiting new members and spreading Maoist propaganda to destabilise the nation. The informer said the members were going to congregate at Kalyan station at around 4.30 pm. The FIR charges seven men - excluding Singapanga at this stage - under sections 20, 38 and 39 of the the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, which pertain to membership of and recruitment to banned organisations, but not to fundraising for them. The charges of fundraising appear only in the chargesheet.

In the chargesheet, the police claims to have CCTV footage from an apartment building in Tilak Nagar, which purportedly shows Dasari meeting the arrested workers between 12 pm to 3 pm.

The ATS claims in the FIR that it arrested Dasari at Kalyan station at 5.30 pm. Through his interrogation, within a matter of hours, it was able to get the residential addresses of seven accomplices. At midnight, in simultaneous raids, six men were arrested.

Saidulu Singapanga is not among the seven individuals named in this FIR. Like several other union members at the time, Singapanga too did not appear for work for some weeks after the other union members were arrested, fearing that it was the union itself being targeted. When he reported for work on February 5, he was arrested immediately.

But questions have been raised over the police claims.

Jumpala's wife pointed out only her husband was arrested, even though cheques from the contractors association require three signatures. The union's founding minutes, a copy of which is in the chargesheet, designates three individuals - the president, general secretary and treasurer - as elected officers for bank transactions.

""When I confronted [another contractor in the association] about this, he became very aggressive and started shouting at me,"" Jumpala's wife told Scroll.in. ""He said he had nothing to do with the cheques, and that my husband had signed a cheques in his personal capacity and handed them over for illegal activities.""

Anthati, president of the contractors' association, said that all three signatories had indeed signed two cheques, each amounting to Rs 1.5 lakh, but did not hand them over to the union representatives at the meeting because they did not have a receipt book with them.

""I told them we would give them the cheques only after they gave us the receipt,"" Anthati said. However, he added, a few days later, Jumpala took the cheques from the office assistant, saying that he was going to Chembur, would give them to the union people and bring back a receipt. This never happened. Instead, the cheques were made out to two individual members of the union and the receipt never made it to the association office, he claimed. Scroll.in could not independently confirm this.

It is not clear from the chargesheet how the money from the cheques was passed on to the Maoists, nor is it clear whether or how the accused recruited new members for the Maoist cause.

Most of all, what is mysterious are the 12 near-identical statements purportedly made by contractors to the police.

Anthati said that as he operated in Kandivali zone in another part of the city, he did not know what the others had said to the police and whether they knew that their statements in Hindi had been identically translated into Marathi. Contractors in the east zone deflected numerous attempts by Scroll.in over almost two months to speak with them.

Advocate Rebecca John said that identical statements were a common feature of the UAPA cases she was familiar with. ""It is common to have nebulous evidence, nothing very concrete,"" John said. ""The police looks into their personal lives, including their computers, so that even if you download an article, you can become a member by association. The police also gets surrendered Maoists to make statements in which there is a fair degree of police control. In a fair world none of these cases would see the light of day.""

However, Atul Chandra Kulkarni, additional director general of police in charge of the Anti-Terrorism Squad staunchly defended the investigation. ""UAPA cases are especially serious because I know that people don't get bail or they will get a longer prison term if convicted,"" he said. ""That is why I don't cook up evidence nor do I let my officers do so. But of course, I have the prerogative to take X [fact or person] and not Y in my case if it supports that. Facts will be chosen to marshal evidence.""

He pointed out that his team was simultaneously working on a case involving Hindutva extremists who had been arrested with large caches of weapons and bombs.

Ten months after the arrests, the families of the union members are struggling. Reduced to single-income households, one family left for their village in Telangana, unable to pay the rent for their room. The others are being supported by women who have taken up domestic work to make ends meet. There is uncertainty over whether they would be able to pay their children's school fees.

There are other consequences too. The families of the workers were reluctant to meet Scroll.in in their homes to avoid drawing more attention to themselves. They said the ATS officials still visit them regularly, making their neighbours wary of them. One of their landlords even asked them to leave, to avoid the police attention.

Since the arrests, the scrappy union, which took on the company to fight for provident funds, safety equipment, identity cards and even a kind of job security with assured daily work to all its members, has become somewhat dormant.

""Because of this atmosphere, the workers are scared that if they remain with our union, they too will be arrested,"" Vasudevan said.

There are other losses which the workers rue, including the hard-earned one of dignity.

""When we go to make demands of the contractor now, they tell us to go away or we will also be arrested,"" said Laxman Bomma, one of the workers suspended on January 9. ""They normally give us our new uniforms in January, but we have not got that this year. We now have to go to Vile Parle to collect our salaries, when earlier they would give it at the offices where we report for work.""

Said Gondrigalla, ""Earlier, they would treat us with some respect and dignity. That is no longer there."""

What will the present governor do when he comes to know about the horrendous English of the present pro-vice-chancellor (pro-VC) of a state university. A glance at the spelling of words used in university files will not only reveal the standard of higher education, but also raise a question on the selection of VCs and pro-VCs. Some pages of the files disposed of by the said pro-VC recently will show how the word 'backlog' has been spelled as 'back lock', 'constituted' as 'constitued' and 'registrar' as 'registar'. Similarly, 'suggestion' has been written 'suggesein', 'opinion' as 'opinian' and 'governor' as 'governer'.

More than once, the pro-VC has scribbled 'quaries' in place of 'queries' and 'secretariot' instead of 'secretariat'. At one place, he has noted ""absent from headquater may be allowed.' Even the notes given by the pro-VC in Hindi were full of howlers, said a senior university official.

One wonders how a pro-VC can write such English or Hindi. Only a university professor, having at least 10 years of experience, is eligible to apply for the post of VC or pro-VC. The appointment is made by the governor on the basis of the recommendations of a search committee consisting of senior academics of national repute.

However, according to academics, the said pro-VC is not alone. Quite a number of teachers appointed in different universities during the last two decades cannot write an application in any language correctly.

Some time ago, two English lecturers, working in a constituent college of Jehanabad, could not correctly spell the name of William Shakespeare when asked to do so by the then principal of Patna Science College. They had come to science college to evaluate Intermediate answer books.

Similarly, a city-based college teacher wrote an application to his 'principle' (read principal) for granting him a few days' leave recently. When the principal drew his attention towards the error, the teacher asserted that he had been writing the same spelling all along and nobody had raised any objection to that! The teacher retired from service a few years back."
