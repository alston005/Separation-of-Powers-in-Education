(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). With effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions.

The Samagra Shiksha scheme focuses on improvement of quality of education by providing support for different interventions like; in-service training of teachers and schools heads, conduct of achievement surveys at National and State level, provision of textbooks as per Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, ICT and digital initiatives, vocational education, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment has been increased and from this year provisions for library grants and grants for sports and physical education have also been introduced.

The Government has also launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities.

e PATHSHALA: a single point repository of e ­resources containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-­print materials.

The Central Government, supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme namely 'Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat' (PBBB) in foundational years of schooling.

(iii) MHRD, has launched a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform popularly known as SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) on 9 July, 2017. The portal is offering various online courses for school education and higher education. NCERT has been developing course modules for Massive Open and Online Course (MOOCs) for school education system in 12 subject areas (Accountancy, business studies, biology, chemistry, economic, history, geography, mathematics, physics, political science, psychology and sociology) for classes IX-XII. Twelve (12) courses and twenty one (21) courses have been completed in the first cycle and second cycle (completed on 30 Nov. 2018) on SWAYAM platform (https://swayam.gov.in/) respectively. Nearly 22,000 students and 30,000 students were registered in the first cycle and second cycle respectively.

(iv) CIET-NCERT has been assigned the task of developing e-resources for Master of Education (M.Ed.) course jointly with Allahabad University. One course (Educational Administration, Management and Leadership in School Education) has been completed first cycle on SWAYAM platform in which 2115 were enrolled. The second cycle of this course is offered from 2 July 2018.

Besides, an online course on action research for teachers is conducted in regular intervals in the MOODLE platform (http://ictcurriculum.gov.in/ ). Post Graduate Diploma in Guidance and Counselling for in-service teachers is also offered through the same course portal. Several other online courses are developed for inservice teachers professional development and delivered through the portal https://itpd.ncert.org.in/.

(v) A programme for utilization of satellite communication technologies for transmission of educational e-contents through 32 National Channels i.e. SWAYAM PRABHA DTH-TV has been launched. CIET-NCERT is the national coordinator for one DTH TV channel i.e., Kishore Manch (#31) and has started feeding a 24x7 educational TV channel w.e.f. 09 July, 2018. Everyday four hour fresh slot is telecast and repeated six times in 24 hours to provide learning opportunities for the stake holders, as per their convenience. Besides, NIOS is running 5 channels for teachers, for Secondary and Sr. Secondary levels and for sign language.

(vi) MHRD has launched Diksha Portal for providing digital platform to teachers giving them an opportunity to learn and train themselves and connect with teacher community. The portal envisages to help teachers boost their teaching skills and create their own separate profile with their skills and knowledge, and help in improving quality of education with use of latest technologies in education sector.

This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Dr. Satya Pal Singh today in a written reply to a Lok Sabha question."

In this regard, University Grants Commission (UGC) and All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) have taken various initiatives. Some of these initiatives are as under:

(i) Diksha- It is a platform for teachers which enables capacity building of all categories of teachers. It helps over 50 lakh teachers in improving the quality of education. Teachers upload their own material on the portal, which also offer online courses, allow sharing of best content, monitor progress and introduce energized text books with QR Code.

(ii) Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQUIP)- This is a quality improvement program in technical education. In phase III, hill states of J&K, Himachal and Uttarakhand, 8 North-eastern States, Andaman Nicobar, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand and Assam has got Rs.2,600 crore. This ensures bridging the regional gaps in technical education. 1200 IIT and NIT graduates have opted for 3 years teaching in educationally backward regions. They have resumed their duties in 53

government engineering colleges where faculty vacancies were large. Thus 1,00,000 students get quality education which they were deprived off till recently.

(iii) Global Initiative of Academic Networks (GIAN) - Under GIAN, 700 professors from 58 countries have so far conducted about 1120 courses in specialized topics for students in Indian Higher Educational institutions. More than 40,000 students and associated Indian Faculty has benefited from this international teaching exposure.

(iv) Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya National Mission for Teachers Training (PMMMNMTT) - Under this scheme in-service training programs for more than 1,00,000 college and university teachers have been organized. Newly appointed teachers undergo six months pedagogical training, so they can make good rapport with students and the quality improves.

(v) INTER UNIVERSITY CENTRES (IUCS) : To improve the standards of higher education and research, the UGC establishes Inter-University Centres for Teachers Education within the university system under Clause 12(ccc) of the UGC Act.

Annual Refresher Programme in Teaching (ARPIT) is a 40 hours programme with 20 hours of video content offered in a highly flexible format which can be done at one's own pace and time. The programme has built-in assessment exercises and activities as part of the academic progression in the course. At the end of the course, there is a provision for terminal assessment which can be either online or written examination. The course offered under the ARPIT programme is treated as equivalent to one Refresher Course for the purposes of Career Advancement. This helps in assessment of teachers.

AICTE has issued All India Council for Technical Education (Career Advancement Scheme for the Teachers and other Academic Staff in Technical Institutions) (Degree) Regulations, 2012. Each faculty member submits performance based appraisal system(PBAS) in a performa as evolved by the concerned institution/ University duly supported by all credentials as per the Academic Performance Indicator(API) guidelines set out in these regulations."

The University Grants Commission (UGC) , the regulator of the higher education sector, has pushed ahead with the strategy of providing autonomous status to the country's better performing colleges, in an attempt to improve the quality of teaching and learning in the country's higher education institutions.

Thus far this year, it has given the autonomous status to 37 colleges, taking the total number to 672 colleges across 106 universities. To be sure, this has been UGC's long-time strategy: between 2007-08 and 2017-18, the number of autonomous colleges rose from 281 across 55 universities to 635 across 105.

According to data from UGC, the south Indian states account for a lion' s share of colleges with autonomy status. Tamil Nadu with 183 colleges leads the pack, followed by Andhra Pradesh (97), Karnataka (70) and Telangana (59).

Large states such as Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, with 11 and 5 autonomous colleges, lag behind. Interestingly, experts point out that Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan lag the southern states in various educational

indicators, perhaps suggesting a link between the presence of autonomous institutions and this.

Government officials are confident that with new guidelines for autonomous colleges issued earlier this year, more colleges from all geographical areas will now be applying for this status.

An autonomous college can review existing courses, programmes and restructure, redesign and prescribe its own courses or programmes of study and syllabi. These colleges can formulate new courses with the UGC-specified nomenclature and even evolve methods of assessment of students' performance and conduct of examinations.

However, even for these colleges, the degree is awarded by the University with the name of the college on the degree certificate.

""Nearly, 40 colleges in districts across the country were granted autonomous status in the current year by the commission. We are also planning to make the process of applying for autonomous status online and comparatively simpler. It is felt that autonomy can provide a much needed boost to academic standards,"" UGC secretary Rajnish Jain said.

Several top performing colleges have been given the autonomous college status in the course of this year, including Pune's Ferguson College, Chennai's Loyola College, L N Welingkar Institute of Management Development and Research, Mumbai and PSG College of Technology in Coimbatore, a government official said on condition of anonymity.

""Even in the last commission meeting on December 10, at least eight new colleges, including SGGS Khalsa college in Patiala, were approved for the autonomous status,"" this person added.

""The idea of academic autonomy to higher education systems is a good idea. But the full benefits of academic autonomy can be reaped only if the colleges have financial support to effectively implement innovations and new academic structures. In the absence of such a support only minor tinkering with the routine academic structures are possible,"" said former UGC member Inder Mohan Kapahy.

India started giving colleges such status in the eighties, Kapahy pointed out. Three decades on, an in-depth review may be called for to see if these colleges have fulfilled the original promise of helping the cause of academic excellence , he added."

It is an overarching programme for the school education sector extending from pre-school to class XII and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels of school education. It envisages the 'school' as a continuum from pre-school, primary, upper primary, secondary to senior secondary levels. The States/UTs are assisted by the central government to implement the Samagra Shiksha as a programme for providing universal access and retention, bridging of gender and social category gaps in education and enhancement of learning level of children at all levels of school education.

The major interventions under the scheme are: (i) Universal Access including Infrastructure Development and Retention; (ii) Gender and Equity; (iii) Inclusive Education; (iv) Quality; (v) Financial support for Teacher Salary; (vi) Digital initiatives; (vii) Entitlements under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 including uniforms, textbooks etc.;(viii) Pre-school Education; (ix) Vocational Education; (x) Sports and Physical Education; and (xi) Strengthening of Teacher Education and Training. The main emphasis of the Scheme is on improving quality of school education and the strategy of all interventions would be to enhance the Learning Outcomes at all levels of schooling.

The major features of Samagra Shiksha are as under:-

Preference for opening of new school is given to tribal areas, and areas with high concentration of Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST) and minority population. The districts with high concentration of population of SCs, STs and Muslims have been identified as Special Focus Districts (SFDs) for ensuring equity and inclusion at all levels of school education. Provisions have also been made for 1020 residential schools/hostels for children living in sparsely populated areas, children living in areas where schools cannot be opened due to unavailability of land and children in need of care and protection.

The RTE Act also provides for Special Training for age-appropriate admission of out-of-school children including children of disadvantaged groups in urban and rural areas. Approval has been given for special training of 8.08 lakh children with the financial outlay of Rs. 56353.95 lakh in 2018-19.

During 2018-19 an amount of Rs. 19668.26 crore has been released (as on 30.11.2018) to States/UTs as central share against the total Budget of Rs. 30891.81 crore for implementation of various interventions under Samagra Shiksha."

Jana Sena Party president Pawan Kalyan has said his party will take up skill development programmes on priority basis, apart from laying emphasis on agriculture and tourism sectors and adoption of technologies, among other things, if it comes to power in Andhra Pradesh.

Besides, it will introduce free, quality education and bring about a common hostel system. For the NRIs seeking support for their business ventures, single window systems will be launched, he has said.

Addressing NRIs at Dallas in the U.S. along with party leader Nadendla Manohar on Sunday, Mr. Pawan Kalyan said he was camping in the U.S. not to raise funds, but to express solidarity with the NRIs who were going through a turmoil far away from their homeland.

He observed that the NRIs went to the U.S. because of their zeal to achieve something big as they lacked adequate opportunities in India. But they were facing many difficulties and needed the support of fellow Indians. He was, therefore, harping on the anomalies in the U.S. Government's immigration policy that adversely affected the Indian diaspora.

Taking a dig at corruption and dynastic politics in India, Mr. Pawan said he never had the greed to loot people's money or ""make my son Chief Minister"" by entering politics, and only had a dream of his country as a place where people and law and order were strong and youth not inclined to migrate to foreign shores for jobs.

Mr. Kalyan said the objective behind the formation of JSP was to bring about the desired change in politics dominated by men who became MPs by winning the polls with money and muscle power. He expected the NRIs to participate in politics."

Mr Javadekar was speaking at the national Conference on 'Positioning India on the Global Education Map' in New Delhi today. In higher education, we have taken tremendous steps to improve college education, for this we are making accreditation process more scientific and tough. Government wants to increase the strength of NBA and NAAC so that more number of institutions can be accredited, the Minister added.

He further said that government is open for other agencies to take the responsibility of accreditation and IITs and IIMs have been asked for the same so that more and more institutions can be accredited from reputed agencies.

The Minister said that ranking and rating increase competitiveness among institutions for better performance. He gave the example of National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) and said that because of NIRF every institute has constituted an internal committee to improve the ranking.

Access to the Internet can improve the quality of education. Despite multiple efforts, many students in schools in rural areas are deprived of the knowledge and opportunity provided through internet due to unavailability and lack of access to Internet in the rural areas. Given that the majority of India's population lives in rural and semi-urban areas, it only makes sense if the infusion of technology in education is done on a larger scale, and at the grass-root level, without dependency on the Internet to achieve similar results, which Internet would provide.

Identifying the need to provide regular connectivity without hindrance, the district of Ghaziabad, under the basic education department, has initiated the process to install 'Chhota Internet', an innovative Content Access Management Device (CAMD) for learning, in 197 of its upper primary schools. Bringing the unique technology offering of 'Chhota Internet' to these schools will open doorways to information, knowledge and allow access to increased learning opportunities beyond the classroom digitally.

The implementation of 'Chhota Internet' will help the children get access to buffer-free focused education content. It will also help to deliver quality educational material digitally, over a Wi-Fi network without the need of the internet, in a responsible manner. It will also allow the school authorities to monitor the progress of students individually, the results of which can then be used to develop programs that address learning gaps.

Digital literacy is a technology-in-the-classroom solution that helps find, evaluate, utilise, share, and create content using information technologies and the Internet. The benefits of digital literacy can be best harnessed in a controlled and responsible environment. 'Chhota Internet' provides the school authorities to deliver learning solutions in a controlled and responsible manner.

It has the ability to revolutionise the traditional education system, and to address the challenges that rural India faces, such as access to quality content due to lack of Internet penetration, shortage of quality teachers, and measurement of growth of children.

Sandeep Arya, Chairman and CEO, 'Chhota Internet' said, ""The digital age has opened up newer dimensions to learning, which were previously unheard of. The twenty first century learning is more complex than ever before, and the current context of growth demands various skills from a student. Therefore, it is the need of the hour for us to use digital technology like Chhota Internet to provide more efficient ways of learning. As rural India prepares for a tectonic change in education with the launch of digital classrooms, we need to ensure consistent implementation of digital literacy on a large-scale to ensure quality education.""

""The vision of Chhota Internet is to bridge the gap between learning and growth and erase the educational divide, and more of this can happen when corporations direct their CSR funds to this cause instead of solely depending upon government funding. Chhota Internet will achieve this by bringing students in rural India abreast with the rest of the world, in terms of providing access to a more advanced system of education that is loaded with the latest technological aids, paving the way for future growth via innovative technology."" he added.

In the last 5 years, the government has made several efforts to improve the quality of education in India, especially in the context of rural India.Though the literacy rate in rural India is far less than the urban areas, yet the pace with which the literacy rate is growing is commendable. While the efforts of the government steer education in rural India towards greater heights, there is a need to build-in efficiencies through innovative technology in the school and classroom environment to secure the future of our children."

In a district of Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh, 197 upper primary schools will adopt Chhota Internet to increase learning opportunities for their students.

Using this, the schools will be able to access better quality educational material over a WiFi network without using the internet. This digital initiative will also allow schools to focus on each student's progress and help them design custom-based programmes to further enhance a student's performance. Digital literacy, when harnessed in a controlled and responsible environment, can help schools find, evaluate, utilise, share and create content using information technologies and the internet.

Chhota Internet is aimed at bridging the gap between quality education and its beneficiaries, with students as the focus of buffer-free education content.

The initiative will uplift the traditional educational system in the rural area and address various issues that hinder the quality of education like lack of internet penetration, shortage of quality teachers and measurements of the growth of children.

India has a positive demographic opportunity, with half of its population in the working-age group. Needless to say, education is tool required to realise this demographic potential. Along with childhood nutrition, healthcare and good mentoring, quality schooling forms the basis of ensuring all-round development of a person.

Quality of education depends on infrastructure such as classrooms, water and sanitation facilities, availability of electricity, provision for digital learning, sports equipment and facilities, availability of chairs and desks, and softer elements such as presence of school staff, professional competencies of teachers, access to books and learning materials, among others.

The density of schools in rural India and teacher-student ratio have both improved, and enrolment ratio has shown a largely upward trend. This, coupled with sustained increase in education expenditure as a percentage of GDP, paints a positive picture for schooling. However, at the grass-roots level, the quality of rural education in India leaves much to be desired.

School infrastructure

Despite high demand for schools, as is visible by the upward trends in enrolment data, supply-side factors related to teacher availability and infrastructure leave much room for improvement. For instance, the District Information System for Education (DISE) data shows only 53% of total government schools, which form majority of schools in rural India, have electricity connection. Only 28% schools (18% government schools) have a computer and 9% (4% government schools) an internet connection. With the digital revolution beginning to be seen in urban schools, including urban government schools, it is likely that rural schools will miss riding the digital wave due to insufficient infrastructure.

Many states are yet to fulfil the norms laid down in the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009. Provision for playgrounds and construction of boundary walls, both of which feature in the Act, exhibit the largest shortfall, with 40% schools not having a playground and 43% not having a boundary wall. The figures for laboratories for science-related subjects is even dismal.

Access to sanitation facilities poses a major impediment to student attendance, especially girls, and leads to drop-outs. The Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2017 data found that only 68% toilets in government schools are usable. Despite the fillip provided by the Swachh Bharat Swachh Vidyalaya campaign, which has increased the number of toilets across schools, the usability of these structures remains questionable. Lack of water, lack of lighting and electricity, poor drainage systems, and paucity of funds for maintenance and cleanliness have failed to feature on the agenda of sound WaSH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) management in schools, thus limiting the usability of WaSH facilities in schools.

Availability of teachers

The number of teachers admitted to schools has risen, and the percentage of vacant posts has been decreasing. But the competencies of the teaching staff are below par -- according to DISE data, 18% teachers in India, in 2016-17, had no professional qualification in teaching.

Even when teachers are on-roll, high rates of absenteeism have been recorded. A World Bank study found that one in four teachers are absent at a typical government-run primary school. Absenteeism rates were seen to be higher in low-income states of Jharkhand and Bihar, with the former reporting a rate of 42%.

Teachers, especially in rural India, often take on auxiliary tasks such as attend to the maintenance of school infrastructure, mobilise students & sensitise community on the importance of education, ensure implementation of social schemes at the school level, etc. All of this takes away from teaching time, and takes a toll on the quality of learning delivered. As per ASER 2017, a large portion of students surveyed had trouble with foundation skills of reading and arithmetic, fared poorly in abilities of calculating and telling time, could not use unitary method properly, and were unable to solve complex mathematical problems.

Outcomes for India

Poor employability is a direct outcome of poor education. With 70% of India's workforce residing in rural areas, it is rural India that will form the majority of tomorrow's workforce -- half of the total population is expected to be in rural India by 2050 (according to NITI Aayog). A major cause for rural to urban migration is the search of better employment opportunities. The net migration from rural to urban areas is about 20 lakh per annum, of which 10 lakh are expected to be job-seekers (MSS Research). The poor quality of education in rural schools will surely affect the employability of rural youth. Handicapped with low employability skills and poor educational foundation and the resultant low productivity, their struggle to find better-paying opportunities will likely follow them wherever they go. Against this background, India's positioning to convert the benefits of the demographic dividend into increased national income is weak."

In an email interview with IANS, he sheds light on how the higher education system is burdened by over-regulation and why more corporates and high net worth individuals should come forward to support the government in making India a preferred global destination for pursuing higher education and research.

Q: What is ailing India's higher education system? What kind of reforms, according to you, can improve the system?

A: The Indian higher education system is over-regulated and under-governed. This is evident in recent government policies that aim to reduce regulatory oversight through initiatives such as Graded Autonomy for well-performing institutions, and the Institutions of Eminence project that will allow for selected institutions to self-regulate on key aspects such as recruitment, admissions and collaborations. However, given the gap in scale, access and relative quality of higher education in the country, further reforms are urgently needed to match the rapid expansion of the sector with performance and quality. We also need greater engagement from private actors, including from industry, to promote quality in higher education.

Q: What is stopping private universities in India from becoming world-class universities?

A: If one were to look at the parameters on which international ranking agencies such as THE (Times Higher Education), QS (Quacquarelli Symonds) and ARWU (Academic Ranking of World Universities) operate, one would notice common metrics such as research, reputation and internationalisation. Indian universities primarily focus on teaching and less on research. Secondly, functions of internationalisation (i.e. hiring of foreign faculty members, admitting foreign students and building student mobility programmes) within higher education institutions are currently over-regulated by the government. For private universities to flourish, there needs to be greater balance between government oversight, functional autonomy and a diversified funding ecosystem within the country for such institutions.

Q: How can Indian universities improve rankings in list of the world's top universities?

A: Indian universities need to prioritise research impact and outcomes. There is greater need for funding in Indian universities, which ought to come from both public and private sources. Secondly, the regulations that encumber the internationalisation efforts of universities need to be eased. Universities need to be encouraged to promote all forms of internationalisation. We need to create an ecosystem in which students from other parts of the world should desire to study in India just as we create opportunities for student mobility programmes where Indian students go abroad for various short- and long-term programmes. All of this will require greater support from the government and private actors.

Q: What measures should India put in place to improve access to higher education among the underprivileged?

A: While public universities now provide the broadest access to students from under-represented and disadvantaged communities, private higher education institutions need to play a far greater role in expanding access to quality higher education in India. The higher education sector is yet to see meaningful private participation in a not-for-profit mode where corporates and high net worth individuals support access to quality higher education. O.P. Jindal Global University is a stellar example of private, not-for-profit and corporate philanthropy in higher education. Unfortunately, for a large country like India, there are very few such examples and we need more of them.

Q: What role do you see for universities in shaping the future of the nation?

A: A nation is built on the basis of its people and, indeed, institutions. Visionaries who inspire others and change the way of doing things are critical in every effort to build a nation. In order for our citizens to dream, aspire and inspire, there needs to be greater imagination and efforts in creating enabling and inspiring environments in the form of university spaces where teaching, learning and research can happen. Institution-building is central to nation-building and that is how we can create an enabling environment for the future.

And adding to the woes is the latest diktat to inspect CBSE schools, which the already burdened officials claim is very difficult to implement.

According to education department sources, of the 31 DEOs in the State, only 10 are regular appointees and the remaining ones are acting DEOs while all the 63 dyDEO posts are lying vacant. In 584 mandals, there are 539 sanctioned MEO posts but only 36 regular MEOs are presently on the job. In rest of the 503 mandals, headmasters are given full additional charge of MEO posts.

The headmasters, each of whom are now in-charge of at least 200 schools, allege that as a result they are unable to attend to their regular duties since they are always away to inspect the schools.

Chava Ravi, general secretary of Telangana State United Teachers Federation (TSUTF), said that lack of regular appointments was having a telling impact on education in general and supervision of schools in particular.

Inspection of SSC schools in the State is done currently by FAC MEOs and this too is not done properly, he said, adding that in the current scheme of things, for inspection of CBSE schools government has to come up with a new mechanism as handing it over to the FAC MEOs might not work. One of the DEOs, on the condition of anonymity, told Express that such inspection of CBSE schools cannot be undertaken in Telangana.

""If we had to conduct visits, it would have been fine but inspection of all schools when we are so short on manpower is not possible. In our schools too we only do random inspection,"" the officer said. The teaching community, therefore, has been demanding regularisation of 21 DEO posts, along with one DEO per constituency & 45 additional posts MEO posts to ensure one for each mandal.

""Overlooking the need for supervisory officials has resulted in the collapse of the education sector in TS. There is absenteeism in government schools because HMs are not there to monitor teachers. Neither teaching is done nor are schemes implemented properly,"" said T Swaroopa, a government school teacher."

More than half of India's population lives in states where the population has stopped growing, with the TFR in urban India and 18 states having fallen below the replacement level of 2.1, which is when the population stops growing.

Yet another one-third of the country's population has TFR between 2.5 and 3, with the rates being the highest 3.4 in Bihar, which is home to 10% of the population. The country's demographic transition varies not just widely across regions and states, but also across districts. The states in southern India and a few other regions, including Delhi, have reduced fertility and deaths at a much faster rate than the rest of the country.

According to demographer Ansley Coale, fertility rates begin to fall in a sustained way when people consider fertility a conscious choice that they can control, when they believe that having smaller families is advantageous, and when reliable methods of contraception are widely available. ""Family size, whether small or large, is intertwined with reproductive rights, which are tied to many other rights, such as those to health and education, adequate income, the freedom to make choices, and non-discrimination. Where all rights are realised, people tend to thrive. Where they are not, people are not able to realize their potential, and fertility rates tend to be higher or lower than what most people really want,"" said the UNFPA State of the World Population Report 2018.

How India grows

How India's populations story plays out depends on India's young population.Every fifth person in India is an adolescent (10-19 years) and every third a young person (10-24 years). Every year, 12-14 million people enter the workforce, largely from the northern states.

""India needs to invest in the health, education and technical skill development of this age group to leverage its competitive advantage for economic growth,"" said Poonam Muttreja, executive director of the Population Foundation of India.

Rapid fertility decline raises the share of working age population( ages 15-49 years) and leads to a corresponding fall in the dependency ratio. After a few decades, however, this demographic advantage is lost as the share of the elderly population increases.

Low dependency ratio is the period of demographic dividend, which provides a window of opportunity to countries to boost productivity and economic growth. A dependency ratio of less than 67% boosts growth.

India is set to ride this wave, with its dependency ratio falling from 75% in 2001 to 65% in 2011. It is projected to fall to 55% in 2021, where it will remain for two decades before beginning to close at 2041 and finally closing in 2061, when the ageing population will push up the dependency ratio above the critical 67%.

While Kerala and Tamil Nadu, which led the demographic transition in India, are already gaining from their shrunken population, they will lose the dividend before the 1940s when their population ages. In sharp contrast, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar will reach a dependency ratio below 67% only by 2021.

Mind the gap

With the demographic dividend varying so widely between states, India's challenge is to implement customised and differential policies that correspond with each state's level of demographic transition.

""Government policies must focus on social and health security and promoting new employment skills for the ageing population in the demographically advanced states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Andhra, Gujarat, Punjab, Himachal and West Bengal,"" said ,"" said Shailaja Chandra, former executive director, Population Stabilisation Fund.

""With the population ageing, we need to focus on building skills to provide care, including health and social services, and establish old-age homes and housing models where the older population can live independently with supportive facilities on call,"" said Chandra.

In the six states where fertility remains high, promoting sexual and reproductive health services, providing quality education and vocational skills to young people must be prioritised.

""Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Iran and Turkey all saw substantial declines in infant and child mortality, partly because of wider reach of health-care systems, economic development, reduced poverty, and increased female enrolment in primary and secondary education,"" said the UNFPA report. Other factors that led to lower fertility is decreasing infant and child mortality and strong national family planning programmes.

The age of marriage needs to be raised further so young girls are mature enough, physically, mentally and emotionally, to make the right reproductive choices, say experts.

In states with high fertility, contraceptive information and services must reach young people.

""An estimated 70% of the population momentum is fuelled by the young population and young girls don't want to have kids as soon as they get married. Young couples, especially women, need the information and the tools to choose when and how many children they want,"" said Muttreja.

""Young girls have less knowledge and access to contraception and health services and are more likely to succumb to pressure to start a family at a young age, which is not good for the health of both the mother and child,"" said Muttreja.

""In the end, our success will not just come in reaching what we imagine is ideal fertility. The real measure of progress is people themselves: especially the well-being of women and girls, their enjoyment of their rights and full equality, and the life choices that they are free to make,"" writes Natalia Kanem, executive director, UNFPA."

The exercise, which is expected to begin mid-November, is being led by the regulator of the higher education sector, University Grants Commission (UGC), which has already collected at least 300 state acts. A team of legal consultants working with Niti Aayog will study these acts to give a holistic picture, the official added.

UGC is already working on revising parameters for the setting up of universities. ""There have been concerns about the standard of education in the hundreds of private universities spread across the country, and also about to maintaining quality. There have been reports of varsities with insufficient infrastructure, including some functioning from just a few rooms,"" said the ministry official who asked not to be named.

It was felt that a way to address the situation was to have a comprehensive evaluation of the legislations through which these bodies are set up, the official added.

The hundreds of acts under which private universities are set up in different states will be examined in light of the latest parameters that the regulator will soon come up with, said the official. ""The idea is to identify any lacunae or gaps that lead to a laxity in the maintenance of educational standards, and ways to address them.""

He added that the ministry has taken steps to bring UGC and legal consultants together to address this key aspect following directions from HRD minister Prakash Javadekar.

""The government is in favour of granting more funds and more autonomy to institutions that provide quality education, but ensuring that standards are not diluted is a key premise. Therefore, it is believed this exercise would go a long way in addressing quality concerns,"" the official said.

Apart from this, UGC is analysing nearly 8,000 cases it finds itself embroiled in, because, officials feel, ambiguities in existing legislations could be the reason behind several of these legal matters. ""The study may help in suggesting ways in which the burden on the UGC of such cases may come down in the coming days,"" said the official quoted above.

Former UGC member Inder Mohan Kapahy said, ""Some (private universities in India) are very good and some not as good. At times, even political pressure may lead to the formation of such a body. A key aspect is: the day an act or ordinance is passed, the body can give degrees. There should be some mechanism to ensure quality checks at the time of inception. In India, operations of a varsity have hardly ever been stopped. So it is important to have quality checks at the time of inception, particularly with regard to new private varsities."""

The Advisor said this in his meeting with a delegation of All J&K Private College Association and J&K (un-aided) Private Schools Coordination Committee Srinagar, during his weekly public durbar, where scores of public delegations called on Ganai to apprise him with their demands and issues here at JK Governor's Grievance Cell at Church Lane, Sonwar.

Ganai said that all the stakeholders need to come together to improve the quality of teaching and quality of learning. He said public as well as private sectors need to work in synergy so that the desired results in education sector could be achieved.

The meeting also suggested frequent student exchange programmes, where students from public schools could frequently visit private school campuses and avail their resources so that their talents could also be harnessed.

Earlier, the delegation presented various demands including making B.ed mandatory for teaching purpose, besides, abolishing B.ed conducted through distance mode. They also wanted a uniform pay norms for B.ed students across the State. According to the delegation, the B.ed students in Jammu have to pay less than Rs 10, 000 towards university, while as Kashmir University is charging the B.ed students around Rs 18000, which as per them was ""unfair"".

The Advisor assured that he would surely consider all their genuine demands and do the necessary at an earliest.

A delegation from Rambir Garh Check Razak Khan demanded that they should get due compensation for the land coming under ring road. The delegation members informed the Advisor that land owners of district Baramulla have received 35 lakhs for Abi-awal and 52 lakhs for apple orchad land. However, the delegation members said that their village despite falling in district Srinagar was only provided with 23 lakhs as compensation. The delegations demanded par rates like Baramulla residents.

Besides, they also demanded installation of new pipes for Sukhnag water supply as the current pipes have developed rust and the water supplied through them is not fit for drinking.

The delegation of contractual lectures of Government Degree College Pampore requested the Advisor to intervene to get their three months' salary released.

The delegation of PHD scholars called on Advisor and requested that they should be considered for teaching jobs in medical colleges as was the past practice.

A delegation from Bazar Committee Solina demanded the release of assured compensation for the loss their businesses have suffered due to the construction of Rambagh flyover."

The real challenge is in infusing quality into delivery of higher education alongside enlarging its reach, Justice Balbir Singh Chauhan, Chairman of Law Commission of India, said addressing the fourth convocation of Central University of Tamil Nadu, Tiruvarur, on Friday.

Higher education is the key factor for creating a large pool of skilled manpower for our nation.

It is the determiner of career prospects of the students and is the stepping stone for building a strong nation, said Justice Chauhan.

Universities, he said, were the hub of dynamic and creative young students and experienced faculties where innovative ideas and technologies sprout for advancement of science and development of home grown technologies.

""Understand and tap your potential to the maximum. With talents and interests, you can transform the world,"" Justice Chauhan told the students.

""While the internet is a magical world and provides solutions to many questions, constant use of social media may lead to a kind of addiction resulting in vulnerability to crimes and dereliction of work. Therefore, try to use technology for your advantage and ensure that it is not detrimental to your personal life and future prospects,"" he added.

In his welcome address, Vice-Chancellor A. P. Dash said quality of education has to be the focus of attention in the country that accounts for over 800 universities and 50,000 colleges.

For the country to become a developed nation, every individual must strive to achieve excellence.

""A degree is no longer a passage to certain employment. There is a need to add new skills with latest technologies. Innovation and creativity are the keywords of our times."" Prof. Dash said.

"52","954676589","2018-09-25","http://risingkashmir.com/news/improving-quality-of-education-at-elementary-level","Improving quality of education at elementary level","RisingKashmir",FALSE,"We have highly qualified and experienced teachers in government schools. The students studying in government schools come from a very poor background and their parents are not educated, hence, they are not able to give any attention towards their studies at home. This is the bitter truth that the students from these schools are not well versed with the three R's namely reading, writing and arithmetic, (Curtis, 1795 as cited by Timbs&Limbert, 1825).

Moreover, they are not able to spell, understand and pronounce words even in the upper primary classes. This problem is carried forward to higher secondary level and at times even to higher education level.

And in this way can say that we are not able to generate good educational outcomes from government schools because the students studying there don't have a strong base. Government schools lack organizational capacity. The classes are not organized in judicious rooms.

The main aim of education is to acquire relevant skills and knowledge coupled with the proper know-how and technology, which is responsible for the capacity and skill development and the inclination for making cost-effective use of that knowledge.

It is very unfortunate that the students in the government schools don't even get a basic education which is why the main aim of education remains unfulfilled. Government teachers don't give thrust on spellings, meanings, pronunciation, and dictation etc. so that basics of students studying in such schools are very weak and for that matter, they are not able to write a sentence or even a paragraph properly.

All the schools, colleges and institutions of higher education in India follow a random walk series as far as course outline is concerned. The obsolete syllabus is the normal feature of Indian educational institutions which doesn't fit into the modern world setting. For the reason, students in our country are not able to find a good place in job markets, in and outside the country.

Moreover, faulty education system is one of the reasons for high educated unemployment in our country in general and Jammu Kashmir in particular (Qadri&Kasab, 2017).

In order to improve the quality of education in India, particularly in government schools, the government and the concerned authorities should put heavy emphasis upon the research and development of the syllabus which should necessarily talk about the modern world and its related processes of globalization, liberalization and privatization on the one hand and technology, innovations and entrepreneurships on the other hand. Furthermore, special focus should be given on relevant case studies.

There is a need to thoroughly and scientifically review and identify the policy intermediations that improve education quality and student learning at the elementary levels. We need to depend on a theory of alteration and for that matter, we need to understand the main drivers of the improvements in the quality of education at elementary level.

The supply-side competence contributions need to be put up that function through the provision of better infrastructure, particularly, human capital, and social capital. The efficiency wage hypothesis argues that incentives and rewards increase the productivity or efficiency. It should be adopted in our education system for both students as well as for teachers because it will increase their productivity levels.

Besides, the programmes, policies and plans through rewards and incentives seek to influence the behavior and inter-temporal likings and inclinations of teachers, parents and students.

The inductive or bottom-up and deductive or top-down participating and community management intrusions, which activate through the principles of decentralization and its allied reforms, transmission of skills and knowledge, and augmented community participation in the organization and management of education systems must be adopted (Masino&Zarazua, 2015).

Conclusion and recommendation:

Immense stress should be given right from KG classes at words, spellings, meanings, pronunciation, writing, dictation, and reading etc. so that fundamentals of learning become strong which will make the students able to read and write properly.

There is a need to thoroughly and scientifically review and identify the policy intermediations that improve education quality and student learning at elementary levels. It is very important to note that the inputs and efforts are effective only when policy changes are coupled with community participation, rewards and social capital.

We can improve learning outcomes when social norms and inter-temporal varieties and selections are factored in the strategy of education plans and policies (Masino&Zarazua, 2015), and when we integrate technology with classroom.

As education is an unending process and the knowledge acquisition and skill upgradation for its solicitation and application are not static but parts of a dynamic and lively process, there is a need to make schools dynamic and lively with good interaction among all the parties involved in the teaching-learning process.

Special training programmes must be developed for teachers teaching at an elementary level. Division of labour is the separation of tasks in a system so that actors or participants may specialize. Economic growth is the pivotal point of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations (1776). Economic Growth for Smith is rooted in increasing division of labour and specialization.

In any modern education system there is an increasing emphasis on specialization and the division of labour. Subject specialist teachers must be allocated against specific subject posts.

For example, P.G. in English must be posted for teaching English, P.G. in History must be posted for teaching History, P.G. in Chemistry must be posted for teaching Chemistry and so on and so forth. This will definitely enhance the quality of education and bring specialization in an economy in general and education in particular.

(Praful Gangurde/ HT)

Take a walk along the corridors of TMC school number 18 at Parabwadi and the information neatly painted on walls will tell you about countries and flags. Small diagrams on other walls give an insight into the school and the schedule.

This is one of the many civic schools which have undergone a makeover in the past two years.

The Thane Municipal Corporation's education department has made use of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds to give civic schools a facelift.

The move has made the students more enthusiastic to attend class.

""We have noticed better attendance in classrooms after the colourful makeover. Also children are showing interest in subjects where special sessions are conducted for them,"" said Disha Vichare, teacher at a civic school in Kisan Nagar.

Corporates have helped set up digital and technology friendly classrooms and laboratory for higher classes.

Not just infrastructure but self-help organisations are focusing on improving the quality of teaching.

Some provide sessions for special children and some focus on students who are talented in art. English speaking sessions are also held for teachers and special coaching for dropouts.

A total of Rs9.76 crore corporate social responsibility funds have been used since 2015 till 2017 with an aim to improve the quality of education in municipal schools.

The TMC accepts funds from top corporates and self-help organisations to avoid delays in projects.

""Earlier, the procedure to approve budget for projects was time-consuming. However, approval for CSR funding is quick. Since the corporates handle most of the procedure, it saves us a lot of time. This also helps students and teachers to get better facilities quickly,"" said Vikas Repale, chairman of education committee, education department, TMC.

A visible example of the benefits of CSR initiative is the signal school at Teen Hath Naka, which has been running for three years.

""The signal school started for the children begging on the streets has gained a lot of popularity. We will soon begin a platform school in Mumbra for children loitering on the station premises,"" said Manish Joshi, deputy municipal commissioner, education department, TMC.

He said a skill centre for labourers has also been built. ""We are working towards making Thane's civic education on a par with private institutions,"" Joshi said.

""Many organisations have approached us to provide stationery or meals to students of civic schools. We tell them about the requirements we have in schools and accordingly the organisations work to provide what the schools lack,"" added Repale.

Many TMC schools, which were in a run-down condition, have been upgraded with better infrastructure and teaching quality.

Students of Lokmanya Nagar civic school were happy getting a laboratory recently.

""Without a laboratory, it was difficult teaching science to students. There was hardly any practical training and students also would not show much interest in understanding concepts. There has been a huge improvement after a laboratory was set up,"" said Pranali Vaidya, teacher from the school.

Students are excited about their 'new' school.

""Our school walls have mathematical tables and cartoon figures. It is attractive and we all join in to learn tables,"" said Anish More, student of Vartak Nagar civic school.

""The makeover has made

a difference to learning and teaching. However, the CSR activities are time-bound and it is essential for the TMC to ensure that teaching quality keeps improving,"" said Vijay Bedekar, educationalist."

The exam is designed in such a way that it helps both students and parents to understand the improvement areas and their National level academic performance.

Primary Olympiad runs as a National level certification program and competition for young learners along with their teachers from class I - V. The competition has five levels and the students studying in respective classes can opt for the respective levels. The Olympiad consists of Language, Mathematics and Science sections. The Language Olympiad focuses on spelling and grammar, Maths Olympiad focuses on Arithmetic & Geometry and the Science Olympiad focuses on science and environmental studies.

""In our education system, the National Level examinations are best held at only X or XII standard level, which hampers the educational outcomes. This situation needs to be addressed urgently, as lack of early transparency eliminates the system's knack to rectify itself. There are tremendous contentions among academicians on measuring a students learning from younger grades. Some believe that the damage done to young children through exam stress outweighs the benefits of actual learning, and others contend that the examination results are not the actual reflection of true learning,says,Mr.Hemant Bisht, National Product Head, Primary Olympiad.

Students enrolled in the Primary Olympiad receive books as study materials which are aligned with their school curriculum and hence can also be utilized as an additional practice material. Students enrolled for the Language Olympiad receive a spelling book, a grammar book and comprehension & composition book. Students enrolled for the Maths Olympiad receive a maths text-book and an activity book. Students enrolled for the Science Olympiad receive a science text book and an environmental studies book.

A teacher's guide is also provided to the teachers of the participating schools to enable them for effective preparation assistance to the students. A team of master trainer also assist the teachers of the enrolled schools on state-of -the art teaching methodology and easy ways to understand the subjects better.

""In parallel to the issue of not having annual exams, students in primary classes are devoid of exposure to non-academic and in-school activities as well. While the Government makes systematic yet gradual progress towards improving the education system, the approach that the Non-Profit Organisations have undertaken is to highlight the above issues and support the Government initiative by either creating a content of International standard or raise their exposure by conducting competitive exams.""Mr.Bisht further added .

Winners from each grade will be awarded a scholarship of upto Rs 10000/- along with certificates and recognition. For students not making it to the finale, in addition to awards, certificates and recognition, a detailed score card that analyzes their performance in a variety of competency dimensions is given. Schools also receive a confidential score card that shows how the school performed relative to other schools.

With Alumni bases in over 20 cities and associations with the best schools, the services provided are niche in the segment. Successfully implementing with the State Governments and PSU's to support their quality education drive, Primary Olympiads continuously prove to have a substantial impact on effective learning

The Primary Olympiad was first launched in June 2010 in the name of 'English Olympiad' and was confined only to Mumbai. With over 9 years of excellence in it s unique domain, Primary Olympiad is the oldest certificate programs, emerging as the premium certification programs for primary classes in the country. Today over 12,000 students from 200 schools in 20 cities are part of the Primary Olympiad. The Last date for registration for this year is 15th October, 2018."

Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma has said the state government is working towards making secondary education in the state a ""model for quality education"". Sharma, who also holds the Secondary Education and Higher Education portfolio, said a number of steps have been taken to ensure ""cheating free"" examination in the state. He highlighted a slew of measures taken by the Yogi Adityanath-led government to improve the quality of secondary education in the state.

""To achieve the goal, a comprehensive plan has been prepared for activating major components associated in the system,"" Sharma said here on Saturday, before leaving for Agra. He said, ""Not only NCERT syllabus has been introduced but availability of qualified teachers, their screening through written test, is being ensured."" ""A nodal officer to supervise proper teaching has been appointed in every district. The norms for evaluating the quality have also been framed. To enhance academic level of the teachers, five master trainers at division headquarters would also be arranged,"" Sharma said.

""An academic calendar, in the history of secondary education, has not only been declared, but teaching in 220 academic days, has also been made obligatory, for every school,"" he said. Recognising teachers as an ""important component"" of the education system, Sharma said the government is making efforts to solve their overdue problems and provide environment conducive to productivity.

For this, Sharma said, the government will felicitate part-time teachers working in self-financing institutions with ""Mukhya Mantri Shikshak Puruskar (chief minister teacher award)"" on December 25, coinciding with the birth anniversary of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He said 5,696 posts of teachers and other staff have been sanctioned for 194 intermediate colleges started by the Yogi government.

The process of recruitment for 10,768 assistant teachers and 3,794 lecturers is on and the assistant teachers would be posted by October, he said. ""Since, Secondary Education Service Selection Ayog has been reactivated, the written examination for the selection of 1,344 lecturers and 7,950 assistant teachers would be held on September 27,28 and 29,"" the deputy chief minister said.

The Uttar Pradesh government, under chief minister Yogi Adityanath's personal push, is working on a plan to make public education free. There is already a catchy slogan -- from KG (kindergarten) to PG (post graduation). The plan may seem revolutionary, but amounts to little more than tokenism. Fees are already quite low -- in University of Lucknow, for instance, the monthly fee for a regular MA programme is a little below '700 while that for the most expensive self-financed MA programme, the monthly fee stands a little below '5,000. Education is free till the secondary level in public schools. Yet, successive ASER surveys show how, even in rural areas, parents are increasingly preferring private schools over public ones. In UP, 30.3% of the all school-going children were enrolled in private schools in 2006. By 2014, this had increased to over 51%. Also, these reports point at a significant lag in terms of quality of learning between government-run and private schools. And, as per NSSO data, more than a quarter of school students in the country bridge gaps in school-learning through private coaching . So, the problem is not fees impeding access to education, it is the poor quality of education and consequent poor learning outcomes, especially in government-run schools. In fact, the increasing private-school enrolment and private tuitions trends show that even the poor are willing to spend for better quality education.

The Adityanath government should work on improving the quality of learning in its schools and universities -- students in government schools in the state, as per the last ASER survey that examined this, reported worse learning outcomes than students in government schools across the rest of the country. As per a Times of India report, nearly 3,700 PhD-holders applied for the job of 62 messenger posts in the telecom wing of UP police -- the minimum educational qualification required is Class V-pass. Among other things, this is also a blistering commentary on the quality of higher education in the state. So, instead of making ""KG to PG"" free, if the state focuses on improving quality of education imparted at its schools, colleges and universities, students would benefit more. Addressing the quality-gaps in government school education, in particular, would not only mean better learning outcomes, it could also benefit families financially if it brings down dependence on private coaching or private school enrolment."

Justice Misra, while delivering his inaugural speech at the 10th Law Teachers' Day award function here, said law schools are the hatcheries supplying legal professionals who act as sentinels for the implementation of rule of law. He also said legal education is a science which inculcates in law students a sense of maturity and understanding of the society and moulds them to emerge as protectors of citizenry liberties.

The CJI inaugurated the symposium on 'Role of legal education on nation building' in the event organised by Society of Indian Law Firms (SILF) and Menon Institute of Legal Advocacy Training (MILAT) here. ""The implementation of rule of law in a nation depends on the quality of legal education in a country. Law schools are the hatcheries which supply quintessential legal professionals who act as sentinels for the implementation of rule of law and contribute tremendously towards the development of the nation.

""Legal education is a science which imparts to law students not only the knowledge of certain legal provisions but it also inculcates a sense of maturity and understanding of the society which shapes and moulds them to emerge as protectors of citizenry liberties,"" Justice Misra said. He appreciated the functioning of National Law Universities and said the institution has turned out to be the most successful exercise for enhancing the quality of legal education in the country.

""The introduction of five year law course has made legal education quite coveted in India. It has become imperative for law schools to take in account the changes taking place across the world as well as the contemporary issues in the society. ""Law schools must focus on developing amongst its students critical reflectiveness of the social, moral and political outlooks embedded in law,"" Justice Misra said.

The CJI said it was the duty of all stakeholders to enhance the legal education by registering the importance of law schools and lauded Professor N R Madhava Menon, saying he has been influenced by the octogenarian in a subconscious way and his passion towards the discipline of law should be inculcated by everyone.

Prof Menon said the law schools were a neglected lot. He said even though there are 23 national law universities across the country and India need to do more for the legal education. This year, the prestigious SILF-MILAT Prof N R Madhava Menon Best Law Teacher Award was bagged by Prof R Venkata Rao of the National Law School of India University, Bangalore.

For proper teaching to take place, the tenure should be of at least four to five years or the government should take up permanent recruitment.""

With the state government not recruiting any regular lecturer since 2002, the colleges have been making do with contract lecturers. Despite the High Court's directive on ensuring that the tenure of contract lecturers does not exceed three-year term, it was in 2014 that lecturers under this category were inducted. ""Teachers and infrastructure are most important inputs in the education system. Having so many categories of lecturers -- regular, contract, guest, part-time guest and minimum scale -- is doing more harm than good,"" said a Board official."

A total of 45 students from SC residential schools bagged MBBS seats this year of which 30 got the seats in open category. This stands testimony to the kind of education being extended to students in Telangana, said Irrigation Minister T. Harish Rao.

Addressing the students of Girls Residential School at Hothi K in Zaheerabad mandal after inaugurating the school building and laying foundation stone for additional classrooms on Thursday, he said that the State government has established 604 residential schools in addition to the existing 273 institutions.

By 2021, about 10 lakh students would be studying in schools and the government would be spending a budget of ₹15,000 crore on education per annum, he said.

""Education is one of our top priorities which is why Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao ensured establishment of 134 SC residential schools in addition to the existing 134 schools that were established in the past six decades,"" Mr. Harish Rao said.

""For the first time in the country, we established as many as 30 degree residential colleges in the State,"" he said, adding that people have trust in government educational system now as they were willing to send their children to government schools. Unlike his usual way, he spoke to students in English and enquired about the facilities at school.

Principal Vijaya informed the Minister that the existing residential accommodation was sufficient for only 256 students while the student strength was 526.

Mr. Harish Rao promised her to sanction additional rooms.

Earlier, the Minister laid foundation stone for the construction of 50-bed hospital and classrooms at Kohir.

He also laid foundation stone for road-over bridge on railway track at Zaheerabad at an estimated cost of ₹90 crore, a demand that was pending for the past two decades.

Of the 6,000 'lecturer' positions in 404 government junior colleges, there are only 840 regular ones. In 162 colleges, there is not even one regular lecturer.

The remaining 5,200 vacancies were filled filled with contract and guest lecturers _ the former recruited for three years and the latter on annual basis. There are 3,800 contractual and 1,400 guest lecturers in the government junior colleges.

Now, with no job security for 85 per cent of the staff working in these colleges, the educational standard in these institutions has taken a beating.

Principal of Lakireddy Balireddy College of Engineering K. Appa Rao has said there are plenty of opportunities for higher education in various countries and called upon students to work hard and be equipped to pursue a career that has better prospects.

Mr. Rao was speaking at the seminar on 'Overseas Education and Opportunities' organised jointly by The Hindu and IDP Education at the college on Friday.

He said not many had a clear picture of education abroad and such awareness programmes introduced them to not just education opportunities but also financial aid in the form of scholarships provided by institutions.

Manager-Operations of IDP Education Maneesh Chandra stressed the need for setting a higher goal in life to make it big.

Focus on research

""The quality of education and standards of an institution play a key role in shaping up the career of students. Industries across the world always look for industry-ready graduates to employ. But curriculum in Indian institutions is changed only once in two or three years.

In case of foreign universities, course curriculum as required by the industry could be updated in a matter of a month or two, which is a great advantage for students,"" Mr. Maneesh said. The first salary was the most important thing in one's career, he said and asked students to aim high.

Explaining the opportunities of funded courses in universities in the U.S., Canada, Australia and other countries, Mr. Maneesh said most of the foreign universities were involved in research and engaged students in research work.

Govt. assistance

Apart from the universities, the government of Andhra Pradesh was also providing loans and subsidies for students to pursue higher education in foreign universities, he said. ""All kinds of support is available for those wishing to pursue education in other countries. It is time you used the opportunities,"" he told the students.

In the case of Urdu medium schools, the ability to read a story in Urdu improved from 17% to 57%.

Elated with the success, the state government by the end of 2019 will extend this partnership with Pratham in 21 districts of the state.

Divulging details of the training method of Pratham which has brought about significant changes, founder of Pratham Mysore, Ashvini Ranjan told TOI, ""The uniqueness in our training lies in segregating the children based on their learning levels. In a typical classroom, there are children who have stopped learning at different levels. While 10% of a classroom is made up of frontbenchers who have little or no difficulty, the remaining 90% have difficulties in learning at various levels.""

""By segregating them, the teachers who are trained by our master trainers will provide individual attention to every child to help them catch up by clearing their doubts and the children rapidly catch up,"" said Ranjan.

""To promote a healthy and friendly classroom atmosphere, we ask the teachers to squat on the floor along with the children as it makes a world of a difference to the children as they feel less intimidated by the teacher,"" said Ranjan asserting that a significant change was witnessed after this method was adopted. The children do not get frightened and a friendly atmosphere is created and learning becomes fun, he added.

""We also update the parents about their wards' progress which is making them wake up and pay attention to their children,"" Ranjan said.

Elated by the difference made to the children, Ranjan said, ""We are participating with the government at every step in this short-term intervention. Many a times, there are teachers who are not so welcoming of our master trainers who are young men and women between the ages of 20-25, but the difference made in the learning process of these children is reassuring and encourages us to do better.""

Explaining the Teaching at Right Level (TARL) methodology of Pratham, Jagadish, a programme coordinator for Pratham, said, ""Our methodology focuses on teaching students based on their levels by giving them individual attention. Some children will not be able to identify letters, some won't be able to read words and some others won't be able to read sentences. We identify such problems and help them overcome those problems. There are many dedicated teachers who put in a lot of effort to help these children overcome their learning difficulties.""

After grouping the children by classifying them as 'letter level', 'word level', and 'sentence level', a semicircle is formed and the teacher sits down on the floor to impart lessons which boosts one-to-one relationship, added Jagadish.

Pointing to the pivotal role played by Teaching Learning Materials (TLM) of Pratham, Rachaiah, a member of the State Resource Group (SRG) who teaches mathematics, said, ""We adopt the touch and learn method which makes learning not only easy, but also fun. To teach mathematics, we use straws, coins, and currency notes when we have to teach them simple addition, subtraction, division or multiplication.""

Crediting the method adopted by Pratham for improving soft skills of the children, he said, ""Along with learning, the speaking skills of the children also saw a huge improvement."""

They also outnumbered universities since their inception, but post-Independence they have grown rather too rapidly to become dominant players in the higher education. As per MHRD's All India Survey of Higher Education (AISHE) data, while the number of universities in the country increased from 27 in 1950 to 903 in 2017-18, recording a growth of 32 times, the number of colleges during the corresponding period soared 67 times from 578 to 39,050. Critically, over 78 per cent of the total number of teachers in higher education are employed in the collegiate sector.

Ubiquitously, improving the overall quality of higher education shall remain a distant dream unless the initiatives and measures in this regard pay focussed attention on colleges. The fact that over 60 per cent of the colleges in the country are located in rural areas, catering mostly to the deprived and marginalised sections of the society, makes it imperative for policy planners to focus their attention on colleges. Since an overwhelming number of the colleges are affiliated to public-funded state universities, the onus of reforms for improving quality and promoting excellence in colleges fall in the domain of the state governments. However, the Union government, which is constitutionally charged with the responsibility of coordination and maintenance of standards in higher education, has to play a critical role through policy intervention and regulation.

Fortunately for the policy planners and regulators, the MHRD's AISHE has been providing data on the number, size and growth of colleges consistently since 2006-07 and the same are also timely released. So, the summary data for 2017-18 is already available in public domain. A quick diagnostic run of the available data as obtained for the years 2007-08 to 2017-18 throws up major deficiencies in the collegiate system of higher education in the country, crying for structural reforms in the sector.

The problem of large numbers of colleges affiliated to a single university seems to have been gradually addressed; 161 of the 285 universities affiliating colleges now have less than 100 colleges affiliated to them and the same has been achieved by establishing new universities and also by bifurcating or trifurcating existing universities. There are now only 15 universities that have more than 500 colleges affiliated to them and it seems that most states are now proactively working to lessen their affiliating burden.

Quite a few major problems, however, still continue to persist, thus calling for urgent action. The first is the problem of single-discipline colleges which constitute over a third of the total number of colleges in the country. For these colleges, curricular reforms like Choice-Based Credit System (CBCS), which is being prescribed by the University Grants Commission (UGC) as a necessary measure to improve quality in higher education is a near impossibility.

Secondly, the collegiate system of higher education in the country is characterised by a very large number of small-sized institutions. Data reveals that nearly a fifth of the colleges have less than a hundred students on their roll and only less than 4 per cent of them have over 3,000 students. Small-sized colleges suffer from the same deficiencies as those pointed out in case of single-discipline colleges. Additionally, they also lack adequate and suitable infrastructure and suffer from the lack of academic viability and economies of scale.

Thirdly, the student-teacher ratio in the colleges at over 30 is way too high. Technological advancements in teaching-learning notwithstanding, teachers play a critical role in imparting quality higher education. It is also proven that institutions catering to largely first-generation learners drawn from the poorer and marginalised sections of society need to invest more in teachers and teaching-learning resources as these students require far more focussed attention to overcome what their families are unable to provide for.

Finally, the number of colleges in the country have been rising too rapidly. The expansion is largely driven by private initiatives and the number of government and government-aided colleges have been declining in proportion. Even though there have been some consolidation lately, leading to closure and winding up of colleges, we are still seeing on an average 3 to 4 colleges being established every day. Such a growth is neither desirable nor viable academically and economically. While new colleges are still needed to mitigate regional disparities and widen equitable access, the time has come to focus on qualitative expansion and consolidation."

He then presented a challenge to all the universities in Delhi and IIIT-Delhi to make it to the ""top universities in the world"" and said that the Delhi government will support the universities in reaching the list.

He assured the students his government will increase the capacity of higher education institutes in Delhi so that more students from the city could get admission here.

""In Delhi, we have a shortage of higher education institutions. Almost 2.5 lakh pass 12th standard every year and our higher education institutes only have the capacity of 1.25 lakh.

(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). With effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions.

The Samagra Shiksha scheme focuses on improvement of quality of education by providing support for different interventions like; in-service training of teachers and schools heads, conduct of achievement surveys at National and State level, provision of textbooks as per Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, ICT and digital initiatives, vocational education, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment has been increased and from this year provisions for library grants and grants for sports and physical education have also been introduced.

The Government has also launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities.

e PATHSHALA: a single point repository of e ­resources containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-­print materials.

The Central Government, supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme namely 'Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat' (PBBB) in foundational years of schooling.

(iii) MHRD, has launched a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform popularly known as SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) on 9 July, 2017. The portal is offering various online courses for school education and higher education. NCERT has been developing course modules for Massive Open and Online Course (MOOCs) for school education system in 12 subject areas (Accountancy, business studies, biology, chemistry, economic, history, geography, mathematics, physics, political science, psychology and sociology) for classes IX-XII. Twelve (12) courses and twenty one (21) courses have been completed in the first cycle and second cycle (completed on 30 Nov. 2018) on SWAYAM platform (https://swayam.gov.in/) respectively.

In this regard, University Grants Commission (UGC) and All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) have taken various initiatives. Some of these initiatives are as under:

(i) Diksha- It is a platform for teachers which enables capacity building of all categories of teachers. It helps over 50 lakh teachers in improving the quality of education. Teachers upload their own material on the portal, which also offer online courses, allow sharing of best content, monitor progress and introduce energized text books with QR Code.

(ii) Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQUIP)- This is a quality improvement program in technical education. In phase III, hill states of J&K, Himachal and Uttarakhand, 8 North-eastern States, Andaman Nicobar, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand and Assam has got Rs.2,600 crore. This ensures bridging the regional gaps in technical education. 1200 IIT and NIT graduates have opted for 3 years teaching in educationally backward regions. They have resumed their duties in 53

government engineering colleges where faculty vacancies were large. Thus 1,00,000 students get quality education which they were deprived off till recently.

(iii) Global Initiative of Academic Networks (GIAN) - Under GIAN, 700 professors from 58 countries have so far conducted about 1120 courses in specialized topics for students in Indian Higher Educational institutions. More than 40,000 students and associated Indian Faculty has benefited from this international teaching exposure.

(iv) Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya National Mission for Teachers Training (PMMMNMTT) - Under this scheme in-service training programs for more than 1,00,000 college and university teachers have been organized. Newly appointed teachers undergo six months pedagogical training, so they can make good rapport with students and the quality improves.

(v) INTER UNIVERSITY CENTRES (IUCS) : To improve the standards of higher education and research, the UGC establishes Inter-University Centres for Teachers Education within the university system under Clause 12(ccc) of the UGC Act.

Annual Refresher Programme in Teaching (ARPIT) is a 40 hours programme with 20 hours of video content offered in a highly flexible format which can be done at one's own pace and time. The programme has built-in assessment exercises and activities as part of the academic progression in the course. At the end of the course, there is a provision for terminal assessment which can be either online or written examination. The course offered under the ARPIT programme is treated as equivalent to one Refresher Course for the purposes of Career Advancement. This helps in assessment of teachers.

AICTE has issued All India Council for Technical Education (Career Advancement Scheme for the Teachers and other Academic Staff in Technical Institutions) (Degree) Regulations, 2012. Each faculty member submits performance based appraisal system(PBAS) in a performa as evolved by the concerned institution/ University duly supported by all credentials as per the Academic Performance Indicator(API) guidelines set out in these regulations."

The University Grants Commission (UGC) , the regulator of the higher education sector, has pushed ahead with the strategy of providing autonomous status to the country's better performing colleges, in an attempt to improve the quality of teaching and learning in the country's higher education institutions.

Thus far this year, it has given the autonomous status to 37 colleges, taking the total number to 672 colleges across 106 universities. To be sure, this has been UGC's long-time strategy: between 2007-08 and 2017-18, the number of autonomous colleges rose from 281 across 55 universities to 635 across 105.

According to data from UGC, the south Indian states account for a lion' s share of colleges with autonomy status. Tamil Nadu with 183 colleges leads the pack, followed by Andhra Pradesh (97), Karnataka (70) and Telangana (59).

Large states such as Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, with 11 and 5 autonomous colleges, lag behind. Interestingly, experts point out that Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan lag the southern states in various educational

indicators, perhaps suggesting a link between the presence of autonomous institutions and this.

Government officials are confident that with new guidelines for autonomous colleges issued earlier this year, more colleges from all geographical areas will now be applying for this status.

An autonomous college can review existing courses, programmes and restructure, redesign and prescribe its own courses or programmes of study and syllabi. These colleges can formulate new courses with the UGC-specified nomenclature and even evolve methods of assessment of students' performance and conduct of examinations.

However, even for these colleges, the degree is awarded by the University with the name of the college on the degree certificate.

""Nearly, 40 colleges in districts across the country were granted autonomous status in the current year by the commission. We are also planning to make the process of applying for autonomous status online and comparatively simpler. It is felt that autonomy can provide a much needed boost to academic standards,"" UGC secretary Rajnish Jain said.

Several top performing colleges have been given the autonomous college status in the course of this year, including Pune's Ferguson College, Chennai's Loyola College, L N Welingkar Institute of Management Development and Research, Mumbai and PSG College of Technology in Coimbatore, a government official said on condition of anonymity.

""Even in the last commission meeting on December 10, at least eight new colleges, including SGGS Khalsa college in Patiala, were approved for the autonomous status,"" this person added.

""The idea of academic autonomy to higher education systems is a good idea. But the full benefits of academic autonomy can be reaped only if the colleges have financial support to effectively implement innovations and new academic structures. In the absence of such a support only minor tinkering with the routine academic structures are possible,"" said former UGC member Inder Mohan Kapahy.

India started giving colleges such status in the eighties, Kapahy pointed out. Three decades on, an in-depth review may be called for to see if these colleges have fulfilled the original promise of helping the cause of academic excellence , he added."

This programme subsumes the three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). It is an overarching programme for the school education sector extending from pre-school to class XII and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels of school education. It envisages the 'school' as a continuum from pre-school, primary, upper primary, secondary to senior secondary levels. The States/UTs are assisted by the central government to implement the Samagra Shiksha as a programme for providing universal access and retention, bridging of gender and social category gaps in education and enhancement of learning level of children at all levels of school education.

The major interventions under the scheme are: (i) Universal Access including Infrastructure Development and Retention; (ii) Gender and Equity; (iii) Inclusive Education; (iv) Quality; (v) Financial support for Teacher Salary; (vi) Digital initiatives; (vii) Entitlements under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 including uniforms, textbooks etc.;(viii) Pre-school Education; (ix) Vocational Education; (x) Sports and Physical Education; and (xi) Strengthening of Teacher Education and Training. The main emphasis of the Scheme is on improving quality of school education and the strategy of all interventions would be to enhance the Learning Outcomes at all levels of schooling.

The major features of Samagra Shiksha are as under:-

Preference for opening of new school is given to tribal areas, and areas with high concentration of Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST) and minority population. The districts with high concentration of population of SCs, STs and Muslims have been identified as Special Focus Districts (SFDs) for ensuring equity and inclusion at all levels of school education. Provisions have also been made for 1020 residential schools/hostels for children living in sparsely populated areas, children living in areas where schools cannot be opened due to unavailability of land and children in need of care and protection.

The RTE Act also provides for Special Training for age-appropriate admission of out-of-school children including children of disadvantaged groups in urban and rural areas. Approval has been given for special training of 8.08 lakh children with the financial outlay of Rs. 56353.95 lakh in 2018-19.

During 2018-19 an amount of Rs. 19668.26 crore has been released (as on 30.11.2018) to States/UTs as central share against the total Budget of Rs. 30891.81 crore for implementation of various interventions under Samagra Shiksha."

Jana Sena Party president Pawan Kalyan has said his party will take up skill development programmes on priority basis, apart from laying emphasis on agriculture and tourism sectors and adoption of technologies, among other things, if it comes to power in Andhra Pradesh.

Besides, it will introduce free, quality education and bring about a common hostel system. For the NRIs seeking support for their business ventures, single window systems will be launched, he has said.

Addressing NRIs at Dallas in the U.S. along with party leader Nadendla Manohar on Sunday, Mr. Pawan Kalyan said he was camping in the U.S. not to raise funds, but to express solidarity with the NRIs who were going through a turmoil far away from their homeland.

He observed that the NRIs went to the U.S. because of their zeal to achieve something big as they lacked adequate opportunities in India. But they were facing many difficulties and needed the support of fellow Indians. He was, therefore, harping on the anomalies in the U.S. Government's immigration policy that adversely affected the Indian diaspora.

Taking a dig at corruption and dynastic politics in India, Mr. Pawan said he never had the greed to loot people's money or ""make my son Chief Minister"" by entering politics, and only had a dream of his country as a place where people and law and order were strong and youth not inclined to migrate to foreign shores for jobs.

Mr. Kalyan said the objective behind the formation of JSP was to bring about the desired change in politics dominated by men who became MPs by winning the polls with money and muscle power. He expected the NRIs to participate in politics."

Access to the Internet can improve the quality of education. Despite multiple efforts, many students in schools in rural areas are deprived of the knowledge and opportunity provided through internet due to unavailability and lack of access to Internet in the rural areas. Given that the majority of India's population lives in rural and semi-urban areas, it only makes sense if the infusion of technology in education is done on a larger scale, and at the grass-root level, without dependency on the Internet to achieve similar results, which Internet would provide.

Identifying the need to provide regular connectivity without hindrance, the district of Ghaziabad, under the basic education department, has initiated the process to install 'Chhota Internet', an innovative Content Access Management Device (CAMD) for learning, in 197 of its upper primary schools. Bringing the unique technology offering of 'Chhota Internet' to these schools will open doorways to information, knowledge and allow access to increased learning opportunities beyond the classroom digitally.

The implementation of 'Chhota Internet' will help the children get access to buffer-free focused education content. It will also help to deliver quality educational material digitally, over a Wi-Fi network without the need of the internet, in a responsible manner. It will also allow the school authorities to monitor the progress of students individually, the results of which can then be used to develop programs that address learning gaps.

Digital literacy is a technology-in-the-classroom solution that helps find, evaluate, utilise, share, and create content using information technologies and the Internet. The benefits of digital literacy can be best harnessed in a controlled and responsible environment. 'Chhota Internet' provides the school authorities to deliver learning solutions in a controlled and responsible manner.

It has the ability to revolutionise the traditional education system, and to address the challenges that rural India faces, such as access to quality content due to lack of Internet penetration, shortage of quality teachers, and measurement of growth of children.

Sandeep Arya, Chairman and CEO, 'Chhota Internet' said, ""The digital age has opened up newer dimensions to learning, which were previously unheard of. The twenty first century learning is more complex than ever before, and the current context of growth demands various skills from a student. Therefore, it is the need of the hour for us to use digital technology like Chhota Internet to provide more efficient ways of learning. As rural India prepares for a tectonic change in education with the launch of digital classrooms, we need to ensure consistent implementation of digital literacy on a large-scale to ensure quality education.""

""The vision of Chhota Internet is to bridge the gap between learning and growth and erase the educational divide, and more of this can happen when corporations direct their CSR funds to this cause instead of solely depending upon government funding. Chhota Internet will achieve this by bringing students in rural India abreast with the rest of the world, in terms of providing access to a more advanced system of education that is loaded with the latest technological aids, paving the way for future growth via innovative technology."" he added.

In the last 5 years, the government has made several efforts to improve the quality of education in India, especially in the context of rural India.Though the literacy rate in rural India is far less than the urban areas, yet the pace with which the literacy rate is growing is commendable. While the efforts of the government steer education in rural India towards greater heights, there is a need to build-in efficiencies through innovative technology in the school and classroom environment to secure the future of our children."

In a district of Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh, 197 upper primary schools will adopt Chhota Internet to increase learning opportunities for their students.

Using this, the schools will be able to access better quality educational material over a WiFi network without using the internet. This digital initiative will also allow schools to focus on each student's progress and help them design custom-based programmes to further enhance a student's performance. Digital literacy, when harnessed in a controlled and responsible environment, can help schools find, evaluate, utilise, share and create content using information technologies and the internet.

Chhota Internet is aimed at bridging the gap between quality education and its beneficiaries, with students as the focus of buffer-free education content.

The initiative will uplift the traditional educational system in the rural area and address various issues that hinder the quality of education like lack of internet penetration, shortage of quality teachers and measurements of the growth of children.

India has a positive demographic opportunity, with half of its population in the working-age group. Needless to say, education is tool required to realise this demographic potential. Along with childhood nutrition, healthcare and good mentoring, quality schooling forms the basis of ensuring all-round development of a person.

Quality of education depends on infrastructure such as classrooms, water and sanitation facilities, availability of electricity, provision for digital learning, sports equipment and facilities, availability of chairs and desks, and softer elements such as presence of school staff, professional competencies of teachers, access to books and learning materials, among others.

The density of schools in rural India and teacher-student ratio have both improved, and enrolment ratio has shown a largely upward trend. This, coupled with sustained increase in education expenditure as a percentage of GDP, paints a positive picture for schooling. However, at the grass-roots level, the quality of rural education in India leaves much to be desired.

School infrastructure

Despite high demand for schools, as is visible by the upward trends in enrolment data, supply-side factors related to teacher availability and infrastructure leave much room for improvement. For instance, the District Information System for Education (DISE) data shows only 53% of total government schools, which form majority of schools in rural India, have electricity connection. Only 28% schools (18% government schools) have a computer and 9% (4% government schools) an internet connection. With the digital revolution beginning to be seen in urban schools, including urban government schools, it is likely that rural schools will miss riding the digital wave due to insufficient infrastructure.

Many states are yet to fulfil the norms laid down in the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009. Provision for playgrounds and construction of boundary walls, both of which feature in the Act, exhibit the largest shortfall, with 40% schools not having a playground and 43% not having a boundary wall. The figures for laboratories for science-related subjects is even dismal.

Access to sanitation facilities poses a major impediment to student attendance, especially girls, and leads to drop-outs. The Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2017 data found that only 68% toilets in government schools are usable. Despite the fillip provided by the Swachh Bharat Swachh Vidyalaya campaign, which has increased the number of toilets across schools, the usability of these structures remains questionable. Lack of water, lack of lighting and electricity, poor drainage systems, and paucity of funds for maintenance and cleanliness have failed to feature on the agenda of sound WaSH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) management in schools, thus limiting the usability of WaSH facilities in schools.

Availability of teachers

The number of teachers admitted to schools has risen, and the percentage of vacant posts has been decreasing. But the competencies of the teaching staff are below par -- according to DISE data, 18% teachers in India, in 2016-17, had no professional qualification in teaching.

Even when teachers are on-roll, high rates of absenteeism have been recorded. A World Bank study found that one in four teachers are absent at a typical government-run primary school. Absenteeism rates were seen to be higher in low-income states of Jharkhand and Bihar, with the former reporting a rate of 42%.

Teachers, especially in rural India, often take on auxiliary tasks such as attend to the maintenance of school infrastructure, mobilise students & sensitise community on the importance of education, ensure implementation of social schemes at the school level, etc. All of this takes away from teaching time, and takes a toll on the quality of learning delivered. As per ASER 2017, a large portion of students surveyed had trouble with foundation skills of reading and arithmetic, fared poorly in abilities of calculating and telling time, could not use unitary method properly, and were unable to solve complex mathematical problems.

Outcomes for India

Poor employability is a direct outcome of poor education. With 70% of India's workforce residing in rural areas, it is rural India that will form the majority of tomorrow's workforce -- half of the total population is expected to be in rural India by 2050 (according to NITI Aayog). A major cause for rural to urban migration is the search of better employment opportunities. The net migration from rural to urban areas is about 20 lakh per annum, of which 10 lakh are expected to be job-seekers (MSS Research). The poor quality of education in rural schools will surely affect the employability of rural youth. Handicapped with low employability skills and poor educational foundation and the resultant low productivity, their struggle to find better-paying opportunities will likely follow them wherever they go. Against this background, India's positioning to convert the benefits of the demographic dividend into increased national income is weak."

In an email interview with IANS, he sheds light on how the higher education system is burdened by over-regulation and why more corporates and high net worth individuals should come forward to support the government in making India a preferred global destination for pursuing higher education and research.

Q: What is ailing India's higher education system? What kind of reforms, according to you, can improve the system?

A: The Indian higher education system is over-regulated and under-governed. This is evident in recent government policies that aim to reduce regulatory oversight through initiatives such as Graded Autonomy for well-performing institutions, and the Institutions of Eminence project that will allow for selected institutions to self-regulate on key aspects such as recruitment, admissions and collaborations. However, given the gap in scale, access and relative quality of higher education in the country, further reforms are urgently needed to match the rapid expansion of the sector with performance and quality. We also need greater engagement from private actors, including from industry, to promote quality in higher education.

Q: What is stopping private universities in India from becoming world-class universities?

A: If one were to look at the parameters on which international ranking agencies such as THE (Times Higher Education), QS (Quacquarelli Symonds) and ARWU (Academic Ranking of World Universities) operate, one would notice common metrics such as research, reputation and internationalisation. Indian universities primarily focus on teaching and less on research. Secondly, functions of internationalisation (i.e. hiring of foreign faculty members, admitting foreign students and building student mobility programmes) within higher education institutions are currently over-regulated by the government. For private universities to flourish, there needs to be greater balance between government oversight, functional autonomy and a diversified funding ecosystem within the country for such institutions.

Q: How can Indian universities improve rankings in list of the world's top universities?

A: Indian universities need to prioritise research impact and outcomes. There is greater need for funding in Indian universities, which ought to come from both public and private sources. Secondly, the regulations that encumber the internationalisation efforts of universities need to be eased. Universities need to be encouraged to promote all forms of internationalisation. We need to create an ecosystem in which students from other parts of the world should desire to study in India just as we create opportunities for student mobility programmes where Indian students go abroad for various short- and long-term programmes. All of this will require greater support from the government and private actors.

Q: What measures should India put in place to improve access to higher education among the underprivileged?

A: While public universities now provide the broadest access to students from under-represented and disadvantaged communities, private higher education institutions need to play a far greater role in expanding access to quality higher education in India. The higher education sector is yet to see meaningful private participation in a not-for-profit mode where corporates and high net worth individuals support access to quality higher education. O.P. Jindal Global University is a stellar example of private, not-for-profit and corporate philanthropy in higher education. Unfortunately, for a large country like India, there are very few such examples and we need more of them.

Q: What role do you see for universities in shaping the future of the nation?

A: A nation is built on the basis of its people and, indeed, institutions. Visionaries who inspire others and change the way of doing things are critical in every effort to build a nation. In order for our citizens to dream, aspire and inspire, there needs to be greater imagination and efforts in creating enabling and inspiring environments in the form of university spaces where teaching, learning and research can happen. Institution-building is central to nation-building and that is how we can create an enabling environment for the future.

According to education department sources, of the 31 DEOs in the State, only 10 are regular appointees and the remaining ones are acting DEOs while all the 63 dyDEO posts are lying vacant. In 584 mandals, there are 539 sanctioned MEO posts but only 36 regular MEOs are presently on the job. In rest of the 503 mandals, headmasters are given full additional charge of MEO posts.

Chava Ravi, general secretary of Telangana State United Teachers Federation (TSUTF), said that lack of regular appointments was having a telling impact on education in general and supervision of schools in particular.

Inspection of SSC schools in the State is done currently by FAC MEOs and this too is not done properly, he said, adding that in the current scheme of things, for inspection of CBSE schools government has to come up with a new mechanism as handing it over to the FAC MEOs might not work. One of the DEOs, on the condition of anonymity, told Express that such inspection of CBSE schools cannot be undertaken in Telangana.

""If we had to conduct visits, it would have been fine but inspection of all schools when we are so short on manpower is not possible. In our schools too we only do random inspection,"" the officer said.

More than half of India's population lives in states where the population has stopped growing, with the TFR in urban India and 18 states having fallen below the replacement level of 2.1, which is when the population stops growing.

Yet another one-third of the country's population has TFR between 2.5 and 3, with the rates being the highest 3.4 in Bihar, which is home to 10% of the population. The country's demographic transition varies not just widely across regions and states, but also across districts. The states in southern India and a few other regions, including Delhi, have reduced fertility and deaths at a much faster rate than the rest of the country.

According to demographer Ansley Coale, fertility rates begin to fall in a sustained way when people consider fertility a conscious choice that they can control, when they believe that having smaller families is advantageous, and when reliable methods of contraception are widely available. ""Family size, whether small or large, is intertwined with reproductive rights, which are tied to many other rights, such as those to health and education, adequate income, the freedom to make choices, and non-discrimination. Where all rights are realised, people tend to thrive. Where they are not, people are not able to realize their potential, and fertility rates tend to be higher or lower than what most people really want,"" said the UNFPA State of the World Population Report 2018.

How India grows

How India's populations story plays out depends on India's young population.Every fifth person in India is an adolescent (10-19 years) and every third a young person (10-24 years). Every year, 12-14 million people enter the workforce, largely from the northern states.

""India needs to invest in the health, education and technical skill development of this age group to leverage its competitive advantage for economic growth,"" said Poonam Muttreja, executive director of the Population Foundation of India.

Rapid fertility decline raises the share of working age population( ages 15-49 years) and leads to a corresponding fall in the dependency ratio. After a few decades, however, this demographic advantage is lost as the share of the elderly population increases.

Low dependency ratio is the period of demographic dividend, which provides a window of opportunity to countries to boost productivity and economic growth. A dependency ratio of less than 67% boosts growth.

India is set to ride this wave, with its dependency ratio falling from 75% in 2001 to 65% in 2011. It is projected to fall to 55% in 2021, where it will remain for two decades before beginning to close at 2041 and finally closing in 2061, when the ageing population will push up the dependency ratio above the critical 67%.

While Kerala and Tamil Nadu, which led the demographic transition in India, are already gaining from their shrunken population, they will lose the dividend before the 1940s when their population ages. In sharp contrast, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar will reach a dependency ratio below 67% only by 2021.

Mind the gap

With the demographic dividend varying so widely between states, India's challenge is to implement customised and differential policies that correspond with each state's level of demographic transition.

""Government policies must focus on social and health security and promoting new employment skills for the ageing population in the demographically advanced states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Andhra, Gujarat, Punjab, Himachal and West Bengal,"" said ,"" said Shailaja Chandra, former executive director, Population Stabilisation Fund.

""With the population ageing, we need to focus on building skills to provide care, including health and social services, and establish old-age homes and housing models where the older population can live independently with supportive facilities on call,"" said Chandra.

In the six states where fertility remains high, promoting sexual and reproductive health services, providing quality education and vocational skills to young people must be prioritised.

""Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Iran and Turkey all saw substantial declines in infant and child mortality, partly because of wider reach of health-care systems, economic development, reduced poverty, and increased female enrolment in primary and secondary education,"" said the UNFPA report. Other factors that led to lower fertility is decreasing infant and child mortality and strong national family planning programmes.

The age of marriage needs to be raised further so young girls are mature enough, physically, mentally and emotionally, to make the right reproductive choices, say experts.

In states with high fertility, contraceptive information and services must reach young people.

""An estimated 70% of the population momentum is fuelled by the young population and young girls don't want to have kids as soon as they get married. Young couples, especially women, need the information and the tools to choose when and how many children they want,"" said Muttreja.

""Young girls have less knowledge and access to contraception and health services and are more likely to succumb to pressure to start a family at a young age, which is not good for the health of both the mother and child,"" said Muttreja.

""In the end, our success will not just come in reaching what we imagine is ideal fertility. The real measure of progress is people themselves: especially the well-being of women and girls, their enjoyment of their rights and full equality, and the life choices that they are free to make,"" writes Natalia Kanem, executive director, UNFPA."

The exercise, which is expected to begin mid-November, is being led by the regulator of the higher education sector, University Grants Commission (UGC), which has already collected at least 300 state acts. A team of legal consultants working with Niti Aayog will study these acts to give a holistic picture, the official added.

UGC is already working on revising parameters for the setting up of universities. ""There have been concerns about the standard of education in the hundreds of private universities spread across the country, and also about to maintaining quality. There have been reports of varsities with insufficient infrastructure, including some functioning from just a few rooms,"" said the ministry official who asked not to be named.

It was felt that a way to address the situation was to have a comprehensive evaluation of the legislations through which these bodies are set up, the official added.

The hundreds of acts under which private universities are set up in different states will be examined in light of the latest parameters that the regulator will soon come up with, said the official. ""The idea is to identify any lacunae or gaps that lead to a laxity in the maintenance of educational standards, and ways to address them.""

He added that the ministry has taken steps to bring UGC and legal consultants together to address this key aspect following directions from HRD minister Prakash Javadekar.

""The government is in favour of granting more funds and more autonomy to institutions that provide quality education, but ensuring that standards are not diluted is a key premise. Therefore, it is believed this exercise would go a long way in addressing quality concerns,"" the official said.

Apart from this, UGC is analysing nearly 8,000 cases it finds itself embroiled in, because, officials feel, ambiguities in existing legislations could be the reason behind several of these legal matters. ""The study may help in suggesting ways in which the burden on the UGC of such cases may come down in the coming days,"" said the official quoted above.

Former UGC member Inder Mohan Kapahy said, ""Some (private universities in India) are very good and some not as good. At times, even political pressure may lead to the formation of such a body. A key aspect is: the day an act or ordinance is passed, the body can give degrees. There should be some mechanism to ensure quality checks at the time of inception. In India, operations of a varsity have hardly ever been stopped. So it is important to have quality checks at the time of inception, particularly with regard to new private varsities."""

Ganai said that all the stakeholders need to come together to improve the quality of teaching and quality of learning. He said public as well as private sectors need to work in synergy so that the desired results in education sector could be achieved.

The meeting also suggested frequent student exchange programmes, where students from public schools could frequently visit private school campuses and avail their resources so that their talents could also be harnessed.

Earlier, the delegation presented various demands including making B.ed mandatory for teaching purpose, besides, abolishing B.ed conducted through distance mode. They also wanted a uniform pay norms for B.ed students across the State. According to the delegation, the B.ed students in Jammu have to pay less than Rs 10, 000 towards university, while as Kashmir University is charging the B.ed students around Rs 18000, which as per them was ""unfair"".

The Advisor assured that he would surely consider all their genuine demands and do the necessary at an earliest.

The delegation members informed the Advisor that land owners of district Baramulla have received 35 lakhs for Abi-awal and 52 lakhs for apple orchad land. However, the delegation members said that their village despite falling in district Srinagar was only provided with 23 lakhs as compensation. The delegations demanded par rates like Baramulla residents.

Besides, they also demanded installation of new pipes for Sukhnag water supply as the current pipes have developed rust and the water supplied through them is not fit for drinking.

The delegation of contractual lectures of Government Degree College Pampore requested the Advisor to intervene to get their three months' salary released.

The delegation of PHD scholars called on Advisor and requested that they should be considered for teaching jobs in medical colleges as was the past practice.

Universities, he said, were the hub of dynamic and creative young students and experienced faculties where innovative ideas and technologies sprout for advancement of science and development of home grown technologies.

""Understand and tap your potential to the maximum. With talents and interests, you can transform the world,"" Justice Chauhan told the students.

""While the internet is a magical world and provides solutions to many questions, constant use of social media may lead to a kind of addiction resulting in vulnerability to crimes and dereliction of work. Therefore, try to use technology for your advantage and ensure that it is not detrimental to your personal life and future prospects,"" he added.

In his welcome address, Vice-Chancellor A. P. Dash said quality of education has to be the focus of attention in the country that accounts for over 800 universities and 50,000 colleges.

For the country to become a developed nation, every individual must strive to achieve excellence.

""A degree is no longer a passage to certain employment. There is a need to add new skills with latest technologies. Innovation and creativity are the keywords of our times."" Prof. Dash said.

The chief guest conferred degrees on 381 students comprising 151 boys and the rest girls in the presence of G. Padmanaban, Chancellor of the University."

"152","954676589","2018-09-25","http://risingkashmir.com/news/improving-quality-of-education-at-elementary-level","Improving quality of education at elementary level","RisingKashmir",FALSE,"We have highly qualified and experienced teachers in government schools. The students studying in government schools come from a very poor background and their parents are not educated, hence, they are not able to give any attention towards their studies at home. This is the bitter truth that the students from these schools are not well versed with the three R's namely reading, writing and arithmetic, (Curtis, 1795 as cited by Timbs&Limbert, 1825).

Moreover, they are not able to spell, understand and pronounce words even in the upper primary classes. This problem is carried forward to higher secondary level and at times even to higher education level.

And in this way can say that we are not able to generate good educational outcomes from government schools because the students studying there don't have a strong base. Government schools lack organizational capacity. The classes are not organized in judicious rooms.

The main aim of education is to acquire relevant skills and knowledge coupled with the proper know-how and technology, which is responsible for the capacity and skill development and the inclination for making cost-effective use of that knowledge.

It is very unfortunate that the students in the government schools don't even get a basic education which is why the main aim of education remains unfulfilled. Government teachers don't give thrust on spellings, meanings, pronunciation, and dictation etc. so that basics of students studying in such schools are very weak and for that matter, they are not able to write a sentence or even a paragraph properly.

All the schools, colleges and institutions of higher education in India follow a random walk series as far as course outline is concerned. The obsolete syllabus is the normal feature of Indian educational institutions which doesn't fit into the modern world setting. For the reason, students in our country are not able to find a good place in job markets, in and outside the country.

Moreover, faulty education system is one of the reasons for high educated unemployment in our country in general and Jammu Kashmir in particular (Qadri&Kasab, 2017).

In order to improve the quality of education in India, particularly in government schools, the government and the concerned authorities should put heavy emphasis upon the research and development of the syllabus which should necessarily talk about the modern world and its related processes of globalization, liberalization and privatization on the one hand and technology, innovations and entrepreneurships on the other hand. Furthermore, special focus should be given on relevant case studies.

There is a need to thoroughly and scientifically review and identify the policy intermediations that improve education quality and student learning at the elementary levels. We need to depend on a theory of alteration and for that matter, we need to understand the main drivers of the improvements in the quality of education at elementary level.

The supply-side competence contributions need to be put up that function through the provision of better infrastructure, particularly, human capital, and social capital. The efficiency wage hypothesis argues that incentives and rewards increase the productivity or efficiency. It should be adopted in our education system for both students as well as for teachers because it will increase their productivity levels.

Besides, the programmes, policies and plans through rewards and incentives seek to influence the behavior and inter-temporal likings and inclinations of teachers, parents and students.

The inductive or bottom-up and deductive or top-down participating and community management intrusions, which activate through the principles of decentralization and its allied reforms, transmission of skills and knowledge, and augmented community participation in the organization and management of education systems must be adopted (Masino&Zarazua, 2015).

Conclusion and recommendation:

Immense stress should be given right from KG classes at words, spellings, meanings, pronunciation, writing, dictation, and reading etc. so that fundamentals of learning become strong which will make the students able to read and write properly.

There is a need to thoroughly and scientifically review and identify the policy intermediations that improve education quality and student learning at elementary levels. It is very important to note that the inputs and efforts are effective only when policy changes are coupled with community participation, rewards and social capital.

We can improve learning outcomes when social norms and inter-temporal varieties and selections are factored in the strategy of education plans and policies (Masino&Zarazua, 2015), and when we integrate technology with classroom.

As education is an unending process and the knowledge acquisition and skill upgradation for its solicitation and application are not static but parts of a dynamic and lively process, there is a need to make schools dynamic and lively with good interaction among all the parties involved in the teaching-learning process.

Special training programmes must be developed for teachers teaching at an elementary level. Division of labour is the separation of tasks in a system so that actors or participants may specialize. Economic growth is the pivotal point of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations (1776). Economic Growth for Smith is rooted in increasing division of labour and specialization.

In any modern education system there is an increasing emphasis on specialization and the division of labour. Subject specialist teachers must be allocated against specific subject posts.

For example, P.G. in English must be posted for teaching English, P.G. in History must be posted for teaching History, P.G. in Chemistry must be posted for teaching Chemistry and so on and so forth. This will definitely enhance the quality of education and bring specialization in an economy in general and education in particular.

(Praful Gangurde/ HT)

Take a walk along the corridors of TMC school number 18 at Parabwadi and the information neatly painted on walls will tell you about countries and flags. Small diagrams on other walls give an insight into the school and the schedule.

This is one of the many civic schools which have undergone a makeover in the past two years.

The Thane Municipal Corporation's education department has made use of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds to give civic schools a facelift.

The move has made the students more enthusiastic to attend class.

""We have noticed better attendance in classrooms after the colourful makeover. Also children are showing interest in subjects where special sessions are conducted for them,"" said Disha Vichare, teacher at a civic school in Kisan Nagar.

Corporates have helped set up digital and technology friendly classrooms and laboratory for higher classes.

Not just infrastructure but self-help organisations are focusing on improving the quality of teaching.

Some provide sessions for special children and some focus on students who are talented in art. English speaking sessions are also held for teachers and special coaching for dropouts.

A total of Rs9.76 crore corporate social responsibility funds have been used since 2015 till 2017 with an aim to improve the quality of education in municipal schools.

The TMC accepts funds from top corporates and self-help organisations to avoid delays in projects.

""Earlier, the procedure to approve budget for projects was time-consuming. However, approval for CSR funding is quick. Since the corporates handle most of the procedure, it saves us a lot of time. This also helps students and teachers to get better facilities quickly,"" said Vikas Repale, chairman of education committee, education department, TMC.

A visible example of the benefits of CSR initiative is the signal school at Teen Hath Naka, which has been running for three years.

""The signal school started for the children begging on the streets has gained a lot of popularity. We will soon begin a platform school in Mumbra for children loitering on the station premises,"" said Manish Joshi, deputy municipal commissioner, education department, TMC.

He said a skill centre for labourers has also been built. ""We are working towards making Thane's civic education on a par with private institutions,"" Joshi said.

""Many organisations have approached us to provide stationery or meals to students of civic schools. We tell them about the requirements we have in schools and accordingly the organisations work to provide what the schools lack,"" added Repale.

Many TMC schools, which were in a run-down condition, have been upgraded with better infrastructure and teaching quality.

Students of Lokmanya Nagar civic school were happy getting a laboratory recently.

""Without a laboratory, it was difficult teaching science to students. There was hardly any practical training and students also would not show much interest in understanding concepts. There has been a huge improvement after a laboratory was set up,"" said Pranali Vaidya, teacher from the school.

Students are excited about their 'new' school.

""Our school walls have mathematical tables and cartoon figures. It is attractive and we all join in to learn tables,"" said Anish More, student of Vartak Nagar civic school.

""The makeover has made

a difference to learning and teaching. However, the CSR activities are time-bound and it is essential for the TMC to ensure that teaching quality keeps improving,"" said Vijay Bedekar, educationalist."

The exam is designed in such a way that it helps both students and parents to understand the improvement areas and their National level academic performance.

Primary Olympiad runs as a National level certification program and competition for young learners along with their teachers from class I - V. The competition has five levels and the students studying in respective classes can opt for the respective levels. The Olympiad consists of Language, Mathematics and Science sections. The Language Olympiad focuses on spelling and grammar, Maths Olympiad focuses on Arithmetic & Geometry and the Science Olympiad focuses on science and environmental studies.

""In our education system, the National Level examinations are best held at only X or XII standard level, which hampers the educational outcomes. This situation needs to be addressed urgently, as lack of early transparency eliminates the system's knack to rectify itself. There are tremendous contentions among academicians on measuring a students learning from younger grades. Some believe that the damage done to young children through exam stress outweighs the benefits of actual learning, and others contend that the examination results are not the actual reflection of true learning,says,Mr.Hemant Bisht, National Product Head, Primary Olympiad.

Students enrolled in the Primary Olympiad receive books as study materials which are aligned with their school curriculum and hence can also be utilized as an additional practice material. Students enrolled for the Language Olympiad receive a spelling book, a grammar book and comprehension & composition book. Students enrolled for the Maths Olympiad receive a maths text-book and an activity book. Students enrolled for the Science Olympiad receive a science text book and an environmental studies book.

A teacher's guide is also provided to the teachers of the participating schools to enable them for effective preparation assistance to the students. A team of master trainer also assist the teachers of the enrolled schools on state-of -the art teaching methodology and easy ways to understand the subjects better.

""In parallel to the issue of not having annual exams, students in primary classes are devoid of exposure to non-academic and in-school activities as well. While the Government makes systematic yet gradual progress towards improving the education system, the approach that the Non-Profit Organisations have undertaken is to highlight the above issues and support the Government initiative by either creating a content of International standard or raise their exposure by conducting competitive exams.""Mr.Bisht further added .

Winners from each grade will be awarded a scholarship of upto Rs 10000/- along with certificates and recognition. For students not making it to the finale, in addition to awards, certificates and recognition, a detailed score card that analyzes their performance in a variety of competency dimensions is given. Schools also receive a confidential score card that shows how the school performed relative to other schools.

With Alumni bases in over 20 cities and associations with the best schools, the services provided are niche in the segment. Successfully implementing with the State Governments and PSU's to support their quality education drive, Primary Olympiads continuously prove to have a substantial impact on effective learning

The Primary Olympiad was first launched in June 2010 in the name of 'English Olympiad' and was confined only to Mumbai. With over 9 years of excellence in it s unique domain, Primary Olympiad is the oldest certificate programs, emerging as the premium certification programs for primary classes in the country. Today over 12,000 students from 200 schools in 20 cities are part of the Primary Olympiad. The Last date for registration for this year is 15th October, 2018."

Over 500 delegates from all over India from various medical colleges and universities took part in the event.

S. Sacchidanand, Vice-Chancellor of Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences, Bangalore, who inaugurated the conference, said that though there were about 450 medical colleges and 10,000 nursing colleges in India, producing thousands of graduates and post-graduates and paramedical students every year, the need of the hour is to have 'quality medical education'. Along with age-related health ailments, several diseases were breaking out from time to time, every season, as they were being potentially fostered by the rapid changes in the environment globally.

""The true meaning of medical education and practice should be based on social context. With young generation and available infrastructure and talent, India has the potential to be a vibrant destination for medical education and to become a perfect hub for it,"" Dr. Sacchidanand said.

Chancellor of PES University Dr M.R. Doreswamy observed that the PES Medical College in Kuppam is the best example of taking medical education and fruits of research to villages, following the Gandhian concept that 'India lives in villages'.

He said that generally national conferences would be held in cities, but the PES University could bring the intellectuals of medical field to a remote village like Kuppam, behind which the efforts of the faculty played a crucial role.

The Uttar Pradesh government, under chief minister Yogi Adityanath's personal push, is working on a plan to make public education free. There is already a catchy slogan -- from KG (kindergarten) to PG (post graduation). The plan may seem revolutionary, but amounts to little more than tokenism. Fees are already quite low -- in University of Lucknow, for instance, the monthly fee for a regular MA programme is a little below '700 while that for the most expensive self-financed MA programme, the monthly fee stands a little below '5,000. Education is free till the secondary level in public schools. Yet, successive ASER surveys show how, even in rural areas, parents are increasingly preferring private schools over public ones. In UP, 30.3% of the all school-going children were enrolled in private schools in 2006. By 2014, this had increased to over 51%. Also, these reports point at a significant lag in terms of quality of learning between government-run and private schools. And, as per NSSO data, more than a quarter of school students in the country bridge gaps in school-learning through private coaching . So, the problem is not fees impeding access to education, it is the poor quality of education and consequent poor learning outcomes, especially in government-run schools. In fact, the increasing private-school enrolment and private tuitions trends show that even the poor are willing to spend for better quality education.

The Adityanath government should work on improving the quality of learning in its schools and universities -- students in government schools in the state, as per the last ASER survey that examined this, reported worse learning outcomes than students in government schools across the rest of the country. As per a Times of India report, nearly 3,700 PhD-holders applied for the job of 62 messenger posts in the telecom wing of UP police -- the minimum educational qualification required is Class V-pass. Among other things, this is also a blistering commentary on the quality of higher education in the state. So, instead of making ""KG to PG"" free, if the state focuses on improving quality of education imparted at its schools, colleges and universities, students would benefit more. Addressing the quality-gaps in government school education, in particular, would not only mean better learning outcomes, it could also benefit families financially if it brings down dependence on private coaching or private school enrolment."

Of the 6,000 'lecturer' positions in 404 government junior colleges, there are only 840 regular ones. In 162 colleges, there is not even one regular lecturer.

A total of 45 students from SC residential schools bagged MBBS seats this year of which 30 got the seats in open category. This stands testimony to the kind of education being extended to students in Telangana, said Irrigation Minister T. Harish Rao.

Addressing the students of Girls Residential School at Hothi K in Zaheerabad mandal after inaugurating the school building and laying foundation stone for additional classrooms on Thursday, he said that the State government has established 604 residential schools in addition to the existing 273 institutions.

By 2021, about 10 lakh students would be studying in schools and the government would be spending a budget of ₹15,000 crore on education per annum, he said.

""Education is one of our top priorities which is why Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao ensured establishment of 134 SC residential schools in addition to the existing 134 schools that were established in the past six decades,"" Mr. Harish Rao said.

""For the first time in the country, we established as many as 30 degree residential colleges in the State,"" he said, adding that people have trust in government educational system now as they were willing to send their children to government schools. Unlike his usual way, he spoke to students in English and enquired about the facilities at school.

Principal Vijaya informed the Minister that the existing residential accommodation was sufficient for only 256 students while the student strength was 526.

Mr. Harish Rao promised her to sanction additional rooms.

Earlier, the Minister laid foundation stone for the construction of 50-bed hospital and classrooms at Kohir.

He also laid foundation stone for road-over bridge on railway track at Zaheerabad at an estimated cost of ₹90 crore, a demand that was pending for the past two decades.

Of the 6,000 'lecturer' positions in 404 government junior colleges, there are only 840 regular ones. In 162 colleges, there is not even one regular lecturer.

The remaining 5,200 vacancies were filled filled with contract and guest lecturers _ the former recruited for three years and the latter on annual basis. There are 3,800 contractual and 1,400 guest lecturers in the government junior colleges.

Now, with no job security for 85 per cent of the staff working in these colleges, the educational standard in these institutions has taken a beating. P Madhusudan Reddy, president of Telangana Government Junior Lecturers' Association, said, ""The High Court has said that contract lecturers cannot be regularised nor can they continue for more than three years.

By the time there develops an understanding between the teacher and the student, it is time for them to leave. Teachers, too, are not interested in working because they know they are temporary. For proper teaching to take place, the tenure should be of at least for or five years or the government should take up permanent recruitment.""

Since 2002 the government has not recruited any regular lecturer and the colleges have been making do with contract lecturers. Despite the High Court's directive on ensuring that the tenure of contract lecturers does not exceed three-year term, it was in 2014 that lecturers under this category were inducted.

An official of the board admitted that quality of education depended on the strength and permanence of the teaching staff. ""Teachers and infrastructure are most important inputs in the education system. That infrastructure in government colleges is poor is well-known. Now, having so many categories of lecturers - regular, contract, guest, part-time guest, and minimum scale - is doing more harm than good,"" he said."

Principal of Lakireddy Balireddy College of Engineering K. Appa Rao has said there are plenty of opportunities for higher education in various countries and called upon students to work hard and be equipped to pursue a career that has better prospects.

Mr. Rao was speaking at the seminar on 'Overseas Education and Opportunities' organised jointly by The Hindu and IDP Education at the college on Friday.

He said not many had a clear picture of education abroad and such awareness programmes introduced them to not just education opportunities but also financial aid in the form of scholarships provided by institutions.

Manager-Operations of IDP Education Maneesh Chandra stressed the need for setting a higher goal in life to make it big.

Focus on research

""The quality of education and standards of an institution play a key role in shaping up the career of students. Industries across the world always look for industry-ready graduates to employ. But curriculum in Indian institutions is changed only once in two or three years.

In case of foreign universities, course curriculum as required by the industry could be updated in a matter of a month or two, which is a great advantage for students,"" Mr. Maneesh said. The first salary was the most important thing in one's career, he said and asked students to aim high.

Explaining the opportunities of funded courses in universities in the U.S., Canada, Australia and other countries, Mr. Maneesh said most of the foreign universities were involved in research and engaged students in research work.

Govt. assistance

Apart from the universities, the government of Andhra Pradesh was also providing loans and subsidies for students to pursue higher education in foreign universities, he said. ""All kinds of support is available for those wishing to pursue education in other countries. It is time you used the opportunities,"" he told the students.

A team of experts of IDP Education later threw light on courses, universities and scholarships available in Canada, U.S. and other countries.

In the case of Urdu medium schools, the ability to read a story in Urdu improved from 17% to 57%.

Elated with the success, the state government by the end of 2019 will extend this partnership with Pratham in 21 districts of the state.

Divulging details of the training method of Pratham which has brought about significant changes, founder of Pratham Mysore, Ashvini Ranjan told TOI, ""The uniqueness in our training lies in segregating the children based on their learning levels. In a typical classroom, there are children who have stopped learning at different levels. While 10% of a classroom is made up of frontbenchers who have little or no difficulty, the remaining 90% have difficulties in learning at various levels.""

""By segregating them, the teachers who are trained by our master trainers will provide individual attention to every child to help them catch up by clearing their doubts and the children rapidly catch up,"" said Ranjan.

""To promote a healthy and friendly classroom atmosphere, we ask the teachers to squat on the floor along with the children as it makes a world of a difference to the children as they feel less intimidated by the teacher,"" said Ranjan asserting that a significant change was witnessed after this method was adopted. The children do not get frightened and a friendly atmosphere is created and learning becomes fun, he added.

""We also update the parents about their wards' progress which is making them wake up and pay attention to their children,"" Ranjan said.

Elated by the difference made to the children, Ranjan said, ""We are participating with the government at every step in this short-term intervention. Many a times, there are teachers who are not so welcoming of our master trainers who are young men and women between the ages of 20-25, but the difference made in the learning process of these children is reassuring and encourages us to do better.""

Explaining the Teaching at Right Level (TARL) methodology of Pratham, Jagadish, a programme coordinator for Pratham, said, ""Our methodology focuses on teaching students based on their levels by giving them individual attention. Some children will not be able to identify letters, some won't be able to read words and some others won't be able to read sentences. We identify such problems and help them overcome those problems. There are many dedicated teachers who put in a lot of effort to help these children overcome their learning difficulties.""

After grouping the children by classifying them as 'letter level', 'word level', and 'sentence level', a semicircle is formed and the teacher sits down on the floor to impart lessons which boosts one-to-one relationship, added Jagadish.

Pointing to the pivotal role played by Teaching Learning Materials (TLM) of Pratham, Rachaiah, a member of the State Resource Group (SRG) who teaches mathematics, said, ""We adopt the touch and learn method which makes learning not only easy, but also fun. To teach mathematics, we use straws, coins, and currency notes when we have to teach them simple addition, subtraction, division or multiplication.""

Crediting the method adopted by Pratham for improving soft skills of the children, he said, ""Along with learning, the speaking skills of the children also saw a huge improvement."""

They also outnumbered universities since their inception, but post-Independence they have grown rather too rapidly to become dominant players in the higher education. As per MHRD's All India Survey of Higher Education (AISHE) data, while the number of universities in the country increased from 27 in 1950 to 903 in 2017-18, recording a growth of 32 times, the number of colleges during the corresponding period soared 67 times from 578 to 39,050. Critically, over 78 per cent of the total number of teachers in higher education are employed in the collegiate sector.

Ubiquitously, improving the overall quality of higher education shall remain a distant dream unless the initiatives and measures in this regard pay focussed attention on colleges. The fact that over 60 per cent of the colleges in the country are located in rural areas, catering mostly to the deprived and marginalised sections of the society, makes it imperative for policy planners to focus their attention on colleges. Since an overwhelming number of the colleges are affiliated to public-funded state universities, the onus of reforms for improving quality and promoting excellence in colleges fall in the domain of the state governments. However, the Union government, which is constitutionally charged with the responsibility of coordination and maintenance of standards in higher education, has to play a critical role through policy intervention and regulation.

Fortunately for the policy planners and regulators, the MHRD's AISHE has been providing data on the number, size and growth of colleges consistently since 2006-07 and the same are also timely released. So, the summary data for 2017-18 is already available in public domain. A quick diagnostic run of the available data as obtained for the years 2007-08 to 2017-18 throws up major deficiencies in the collegiate system of higher education in the country, crying for structural reforms in the sector.

The problem of large numbers of colleges affiliated to a single university seems to have been gradually addressed; 161 of the 285 universities affiliating colleges now have less than 100 colleges affiliated to them and the same has been achieved by establishing new universities and also by bifurcating or trifurcating existing universities. There are now only 15 universities that have more than 500 colleges affiliated to them and it seems that most states are now proactively working to lessen their affiliating burden.

Quite a few major problems, however, still continue to persist, thus calling for urgent action. The first is the problem of single-discipline colleges which constitute over a third of the total number of colleges in the country. For these colleges, curricular reforms like Choice-Based Credit System (CBCS), which is being prescribed by the University Grants Commission (UGC) as a necessary measure to improve quality in higher education is a near impossibility.

Secondly, the collegiate system of higher education in the country is characterised by a very large number of small-sized institutions. Data reveals that nearly a fifth of the colleges have less than a hundred students on their roll and only less than 4 per cent of them have over 3,000 students. Small-sized colleges suffer from the same deficiencies as those pointed out in case of single-discipline colleges. Additionally, they also lack adequate and suitable infrastructure and suffer from the lack of academic viability and economies of scale.

Thirdly, the student-teacher ratio in the colleges at over 30 is way too high. Technological advancements in teaching-learning notwithstanding, teachers play a critical role in imparting quality higher education. It is also proven that institutions catering to largely first-generation learners drawn from the poorer and marginalised sections of society need to invest more in teachers and teaching-learning resources as these students require far more focussed attention to overcome what their families are unable to provide for.

Finally, the number of colleges in the country have been rising too rapidly. The expansion is largely driven by private initiatives and the number of government and government-aided colleges have been declining in proportion. Even though there have been some consolidation lately, leading to closure and winding up of colleges, we are still seeing on an average 3 to 4 colleges being established every day. Such a growth is neither desirable nor viable academically and economically. While new colleges are still needed to mitigate regional disparities and widen equitable access, the time has come to focus on qualitative expansion and consolidation."

(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). With effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions.

The Samagra Shiksha scheme focuses on improvement of quality of education by providing support for different interventions like; in-service training of teachers and schools heads, conduct of achievement surveys at National and State level, provision of textbooks as per Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, ICT and digital initiatives, vocational education, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment has been increased and from this year provisions for library grants and grants for sports and physical education have also been introduced.

The Government has also launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities.

e PATHSHALA: a single point repository of e ­resources containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-­print materials.

The Central Government, supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme namely 'Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat' (PBBB) in foundational years of schooling.

(iii) MHRD, has launched a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform popularly known as SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) on 9 July, 2017. The portal is offering various online courses for school education and higher education. NCERT has been developing course modules for Massive Open and Online Course (MOOCs) for school education system in 12 subject areas (Accountancy, business studies, biology, chemistry, economic, history, geography, mathematics, physics, political science, psychology and sociology) for classes IX-XII. Twelve (12) courses and twenty one (21) courses have been completed in the first cycle and second cycle (completed on 30 Nov. 2018) on SWAYAM platform (https://swayam.gov.in/) respectively. Nearly 22,000 students and 30,000 students were registered in the first cycle and second cycle respectively.

(iv) CIET-NCERT has been assigned the task of developing e-resources for Master of Education (M.Ed.) course jointly with Allahabad University. One course (Educational Administration, Management and Leadership in School Education) has been completed first cycle on SWAYAM platform in which 2115 were enrolled. The second cycle of this course is offered from 2 July 2018.

Besides, an online course on action research for teachers is conducted in regular intervals in the MOODLE platform (http://ictcurriculum.gov.in/ ). Post Graduate Diploma in Guidance and Counselling for in-service teachers is also offered through the same course portal. Several other online courses are developed for inservice teachers professional development and delivered through the portal https://itpd.ncert.org.in/.

(v) A programme for utilization of satellite communication technologies for transmission of educational e-contents through 32 National Channels i.e. SWAYAM PRABHA DTH-TV has been launched. CIET-NCERT is the national coordinator for one DTH TV channel i.e., Kishore Manch (#31) and has started feeding a 24x7 educational TV channel w.e.f. 09 July, 2018. Everyday four hour fresh slot is telecast and repeated six times in 24 hours to provide learning opportunities for the stake holders, as per their convenience. Besides, NIOS is running 5 channels for teachers, for Secondary and Sr. Secondary levels and for sign language.

(vi) MHRD has launched Diksha Portal for providing digital platform to teachers giving them an opportunity to learn and train themselves and connect with teacher community. The portal envisages to help teachers boost their teaching skills and create their own separate profile with their skills and knowledge, and help in improving quality of education with use of latest technologies in education sector.

Teachers upload their own material on the portal, which also offer online courses, allow sharing of best content, monitor progress and introduce energized text books with QR Code.

(ii) Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQUIP)- This is a quality improvement program in technical education. In phase III, hill states of J&K, Himachal and Uttarakhand, 8 North-eastern States, Andaman Nicobar, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand and Assam has got Rs.2,600 crore. This ensures bridging the regional gaps in technical education. 1200 IIT and NIT graduates have opted for 3 years teaching in educationally backward regions. They have resumed their duties in 53

government engineering colleges where faculty vacancies were large. Thus 1,00,000 students get quality education which they were deprived off till recently.

(iii) Global Initiative of Academic Networks (GIAN) - Under GIAN, 700 professors from 58 countries have so far conducted about 1120 courses in specialized topics for students in Indian Higher Educational institutions. More than 40,000 students and associated Indian Faculty has benefited from this international teaching exposure.

(iv) Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya National Mission for Teachers Training (PMMMNMTT) - Under this scheme in-service training programs for more than 1,00,000 college and university teachers have been organized. Newly appointed teachers undergo six months pedagogical training, so they can make good rapport with students and the quality improves.

(v) INTER UNIVERSITY CENTRES (IUCS) : To improve the standards of higher education and research, the UGC establishes Inter-University Centres for Teachers Education within the university system under Clause 12(ccc) of the UGC Act.

Annual Refresher Programme in Teaching (ARPIT) is a 40 hours programme with 20 hours of video content offered in a highly flexible format which can be done at one's own pace and time.

The University Grants Commission (UGC) , the regulator of the higher education sector, has pushed ahead with the strategy of providing autonomous status to the country's better performing colleges, in an attempt to improve the quality of teaching and learning in the country's higher education institutions.

Thus far this year, it has given the autonomous status to 37 colleges, taking the total number to 672 colleges across 106 universities. To be sure, this has been UGC's long-time strategy: between 2007-08 and 2017-18, the number of autonomous colleges rose from 281 across 55 universities to 635 across 105.

According to data from UGC, the south Indian states account for a lion' s share of colleges with autonomy status. Tamil Nadu with 183 colleges leads the pack, followed by Andhra Pradesh (97), Karnataka (70) and Telangana (59).

Large states such as Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, with 11 and 5 autonomous colleges, lag behind. Interestingly, experts point out that Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan lag the southern states in various educational

indicators, perhaps suggesting a link between the presence of autonomous institutions and this.

Government officials are confident that with new guidelines for autonomous colleges issued earlier this year, more colleges from all geographical areas will now be applying for this status.

An autonomous college can review existing courses, programmes and restructure, redesign and prescribe its own courses or programmes of study and syllabi. These colleges can formulate new courses with the UGC-specified nomenclature and even evolve methods of assessment of students' performance and conduct of examinations.

However, even for these colleges, the degree is awarded by the University with the name of the college on the degree certificate.

""Nearly, 40 colleges in districts across the country were granted autonomous status in the current year by the commission. We are also planning to make the process of applying for autonomous status online and comparatively simpler. It is felt that autonomy can provide a much needed boost to academic standards,"" UGC secretary Rajnish Jain said.

Several top performing colleges have been given the autonomous college status in the course of this year, including Pune's Ferguson College, Chennai's Loyola College, L N Welingkar Institute of Management Development and Research, Mumbai and PSG College of Technology in Coimbatore, a government official said on condition of anonymity.

""Even in the last commission meeting on December 10, at least eight new colleges, including SGGS Khalsa college in Patiala, were approved for the autonomous status,"" this person added.

""The idea of academic autonomy to higher education systems is a good idea. But the full benefits of academic autonomy can be reaped only if the colleges have financial support to effectively implement innovations and new academic structures. In the absence of such a support only minor tinkering with the routine academic structures are possible,"" said former UGC member Inder Mohan Kapahy.

India started giving colleges such status in the eighties, Kapahy pointed out. Three decades on, an in-depth review may be called for to see if these colleges have fulfilled the original promise of helping the cause of academic excellence , he added."

It is an overarching programme for the school education sector extending from pre-school to class XII and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels of school education. It envisages the 'school' as a continuum from pre-school, primary, upper primary, secondary to senior secondary levels. The States/UTs are assisted by the central government to implement the Samagra Shiksha as a programme for providing universal access and retention, bridging of gender and social category gaps in education and enhancement of learning level of children at all levels of school education.

The major interventions under the scheme are: (i) Universal Access including Infrastructure Development and Retention; (ii) Gender and Equity; (iii) Inclusive Education; (iv) Quality; (v) Financial support for Teacher Salary; (vi) Digital initiatives; (vii) Entitlements under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 including uniforms, textbooks etc.;(viii) Pre-school Education; (ix) Vocational Education; (x) Sports and Physical Education; and (xi) Strengthening of Teacher Education and Training. The main emphasis of the Scheme is on improving quality of school education and the strategy of all interventions would be to enhance the Learning Outcomes at all levels of schooling.

The major features of Samagra Shiksha are as under:-

Preference for opening of new school is given to tribal areas, and areas with high concentration of Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST) and minority population. The districts with high concentration of population of SCs, STs and Muslims have been identified as Special Focus Districts (SFDs) for ensuring equity and inclusion at all levels of school education. Provisions have also been made for 1020 residential schools/hostels for children living in sparsely populated areas, children living in areas where schools cannot be opened due to unavailability of land and children in need of care and protection.

The RTE Act also provides for Special Training for age-appropriate admission of out-of-school children including children of disadvantaged groups in urban and rural areas. Approval has been given for special training of 8.08 lakh children with the financial outlay of Rs. 56353.95 lakh in 2018-19.

During 2018-19 an amount of Rs. 19668.26 crore has been released (as on 30.11.2018) to States/UTs as central share against the total Budget of Rs. 30891.81 crore for implementation of various interventions under Samagra Shiksha."

Jana Sena Party president Pawan Kalyan has said his party will take up skill development programmes on priority basis, apart from laying emphasis on agriculture and tourism sectors and adoption of technologies, among other things, if it comes to power in Andhra Pradesh.

Besides, it will introduce free, quality education and bring about a common hostel system. For the NRIs seeking support for their business ventures, single window systems will be launched, he has said.

Addressing NRIs at Dallas in the U.S. along with party leader Nadendla Manohar on Sunday, Mr. Pawan Kalyan said he was camping in the U.S. not to raise funds, but to express solidarity with the NRIs who were going through a turmoil far away from their homeland.

He observed that the NRIs went to the U.S. because of their zeal to achieve something big as they lacked adequate opportunities in India. But they were facing many difficulties and needed the support of fellow Indians. He was, therefore, harping on the anomalies in the U.S. Government's immigration policy that adversely affected the Indian diaspora.

Taking a dig at corruption and dynastic politics in India, Mr. Pawan said he never had the greed to loot people's money or ""make my son Chief Minister"" by entering politics, and only had a dream of his country as a place where people and law and order were strong and youth not inclined to migrate to foreign shores for jobs.

Mr. Kalyan said the objective behind the formation of JSP was to bring about the desired change in politics dominated by men who became MPs by winning the polls with money and muscle power. He expected the NRIs to participate in politics."

Access to the Internet can improve the quality of education. Despite multiple efforts, many students in schools in rural areas are deprived of the knowledge and opportunity provided through internet due to unavailability and lack of access to Internet in the rural areas. Given that the majority of India's population lives in rural and semi-urban areas, it only makes sense if the infusion of technology in education is done on a larger scale, and at the grass-root level, without dependency on the Internet to achieve similar results, which Internet would provide.

Identifying the need to provide regular connectivity without hindrance, the district of Ghaziabad, under the basic education department, has initiated the process to install 'Chhota Internet', an innovative Content Access Management Device (CAMD) for learning, in 197 of its upper primary schools. Bringing the unique technology offering of 'Chhota Internet' to these schools will open doorways to information, knowledge and allow access to increased learning opportunities beyond the classroom digitally.

The implementation of 'Chhota Internet' will help the children get access to buffer-free focused education content. It will also help to deliver quality educational material digitally, over a Wi-Fi network without the need of the internet, in a responsible manner. It will also allow the school authorities to monitor the progress of students individually, the results of which can then be used to develop programs that address learning gaps.

Digital literacy is a technology-in-the-classroom solution that helps find, evaluate, utilise, share, and create content using information technologies and the Internet. The benefits of digital literacy can be best harnessed in a controlled and responsible environment. 'Chhota Internet' provides the school authorities to deliver learning solutions in a controlled and responsible manner.

It has the ability to revolutionise the traditional education system, and to address the challenges that rural India faces, such as access to quality content due to lack of Internet penetration, shortage of quality teachers, and measurement of growth of children.

Sandeep Arya, Chairman and CEO, 'Chhota Internet' said, ""The digital age has opened up newer dimensions to learning, which were previously unheard of. The twenty first century learning is more complex than ever before, and the current context of growth demands various skills from a student. Therefore, it is the need of the hour for us to use digital technology like Chhota Internet to provide more efficient ways of learning. As rural India prepares for a tectonic change in education with the launch of digital classrooms, we need to ensure consistent implementation of digital literacy on a large-scale to ensure quality education.""

""The vision of Chhota Internet is to bridge the gap between learning and growth and erase the educational divide, and more of this can happen when corporations direct their CSR funds to this cause instead of solely depending upon government funding. Chhota Internet will achieve this by bringing students in rural India abreast with the rest of the world, in terms of providing access to a more advanced system of education that is loaded with the latest technological aids, paving the way for future growth via innovative technology."" he added.

In the last 5 years, the government has made several efforts to improve the quality of education in India, especially in the context of rural India.Though the literacy rate in rural India is far less than the urban areas, yet the pace with which the literacy rate is growing is commendable. While the efforts of the government steer education in rural India towards greater heights, there is a need to build-in efficiencies through innovative technology in the school and classroom environment to secure the future of our children."

In a district of Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh, 197 upper primary schools will adopt Chhota Internet to increase learning opportunities for their students.

Using this, the schools will be able to access better quality educational material over a WiFi network without using the internet. This digital initiative will also allow schools to focus on each student's progress and help them design custom-based programmes to further enhance a student's performance. Digital literacy, when harnessed in a controlled and responsible environment, can help schools find, evaluate, utilise, share and create content using information technologies and the internet.

Chhota Internet is aimed at bridging the gap between quality education and its beneficiaries, with students as the focus of buffer-free education content.

The initiative will uplift the traditional educational system in the rural area and address various issues that hinder the quality of education like lack of internet penetration, shortage of quality teachers and measurements of the growth of children.

India has a positive demographic opportunity, with half of its population in the working-age group. Needless to say, education is tool required to realise this demographic potential. Along with childhood nutrition, healthcare and good mentoring, quality schooling forms the basis of ensuring all-round development of a person.

Quality of education depends on infrastructure such as classrooms, water and sanitation facilities, availability of electricity, provision for digital learning, sports equipment and facilities, availability of chairs and desks, and softer elements such as presence of school staff, professional competencies of teachers, access to books and learning materials, among others.

The density of schools in rural India and teacher-student ratio have both improved, and enrolment ratio has shown a largely upward trend. This, coupled with sustained increase in education expenditure as a percentage of GDP, paints a positive picture for schooling. However, at the grass-roots level, the quality of rural education in India leaves much to be desired.

School infrastructure

Despite high demand for schools, as is visible by the upward trends in enrolment data, supply-side factors related to teacher availability and infrastructure leave much room for improvement. For instance, the District Information System for Education (DISE) data shows only 53% of total government schools, which form majority of schools in rural India, have electricity connection. Only 28% schools (18% government schools) have a computer and 9% (4% government schools) an internet connection. With the digital revolution beginning to be seen in urban schools, including urban government schools, it is likely that rural schools will miss riding the digital wave due to insufficient infrastructure.

Many states are yet to fulfil the norms laid down in the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009. Provision for playgrounds and construction of boundary walls, both of which feature in the Act, exhibit the largest shortfall, with 40% schools not having a playground and 43% not having a boundary wall. The figures for laboratories for science-related subjects is even dismal.

Access to sanitation facilities poses a major impediment to student attendance, especially girls, and leads to drop-outs. The Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2017 data found that only 68% toilets in government schools are usable. Despite the fillip provided by the Swachh Bharat Swachh Vidyalaya campaign, which has increased the number of toilets across schools, the usability of these structures remains questionable. Lack of water, lack of lighting and electricity, poor drainage systems, and paucity of funds for maintenance and cleanliness have failed to feature on the agenda of sound WaSH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) management in schools, thus limiting the usability of WaSH facilities in schools.

Availability of teachers

The number of teachers admitted to schools has risen, and the percentage of vacant posts has been decreasing. But the competencies of the teaching staff are below par -- according to DISE data, 18% teachers in India, in 2016-17, had no professional qualification in teaching.

Even when teachers are on-roll, high rates of absenteeism have been recorded. A World Bank study found that one in four teachers are absent at a typical government-run primary school. Absenteeism rates were seen to be higher in low-income states of Jharkhand and Bihar, with the former reporting a rate of 42%.

Teachers, especially in rural India, often take on auxiliary tasks such as attend to the maintenance of school infrastructure, mobilise students & sensitise community on the importance of education, ensure implementation of social schemes at the school level, etc. All of this takes away from teaching time, and takes a toll on the quality of learning delivered. As per ASER 2017, a large portion of students surveyed had trouble with foundation skills of reading and arithmetic, fared poorly in abilities of calculating and telling time, could not use unitary method properly, and were unable to solve complex mathematical problems.

Outcomes for India

Poor employability is a direct outcome of poor education. With 70% of India's workforce residing in rural areas, it is rural India that will form the majority of tomorrow's workforce -- half of the total population is expected to be in rural India by 2050 (according to NITI Aayog). A major cause for rural to urban migration is the search of better employment opportunities. The net migration from rural to urban areas is about 20 lakh per annum, of which 10 lakh are expected to be job-seekers (MSS Research). The poor quality of education in rural schools will surely affect the employability of rural youth. Handicapped with low employability skills and poor educational foundation and the resultant low productivity, their struggle to find better-paying opportunities will likely follow them wherever they go. Against this background, India's positioning to convert the benefits of the demographic dividend into increased national income is weak."

In an email interview with IANS, he sheds light on how the higher education system is burdened by over-regulation and why more corporates and high net worth individuals should come forward to support the government in making India a preferred global destination for pursuing higher education and research.

Q: What is ailing India's higher education system? What kind of reforms, according to you, can improve the system?

A: The Indian higher education system is over-regulated and under-governed. This is evident in recent government policies that aim to reduce regulatory oversight through initiatives such as Graded Autonomy for well-performing institutions, and the Institutions of Eminence project that will allow for selected institutions to self-regulate on key aspects such as recruitment, admissions and collaborations. However, given the gap in scale, access and relative quality of higher education in the country, further reforms are urgently needed to match the rapid expansion of the sector with performance and quality. We also need greater engagement from private actors, including from industry, to promote quality in higher education.

Q: What is stopping private universities in India from becoming world-class universities?

A: If one were to look at the parameters on which international ranking agencies such as THE (Times Higher Education), QS (Quacquarelli Symonds) and ARWU (Academic Ranking of World Universities) operate, one would notice common metrics such as research, reputation and internationalisation. Indian universities primarily focus on teaching and less on research. Secondly, functions of internationalisation (i.e. hiring of foreign faculty members, admitting foreign students and building student mobility programmes) within higher education institutions are currently over-regulated by the government. For private universities to flourish, there needs to be greater balance between government oversight, functional autonomy and a diversified funding ecosystem within the country for such institutions.

Q: How can Indian universities improve rankings in list of the world's top universities?

A: Indian universities need to prioritise research impact and outcomes. There is greater need for funding in Indian universities, which ought to come from both public and private sources. Secondly, the regulations that encumber the internationalisation efforts of universities need to be eased. Universities need to be encouraged to promote all forms of internationalisation. We need to create an ecosystem in which students from other parts of the world should desire to study in India just as we create opportunities for student mobility programmes where Indian students go abroad for various short- and long-term programmes. All of this will require greater support from the government and private actors.

Q: What measures should India put in place to improve access to higher education among the underprivileged?

A: While public universities now provide the broadest access to students from under-represented and disadvantaged communities, private higher education institutions need to play a far greater role in expanding access to quality higher education in India. The higher education sector is yet to see meaningful private participation in a not-for-profit mode where corporates and high net worth individuals support access to quality higher education. O.P. Jindal Global University is a stellar example of private, not-for-profit and corporate philanthropy in higher education. Unfortunately, for a large country like India, there are very few such examples and we need more of them.

Q: What role do you see for universities in shaping the future of the nation?

A: A nation is built on the basis of its people and, indeed, institutions. Visionaries who inspire others and change the way of doing things are critical in every effort to build a nation. In order for our citizens to dream, aspire and inspire, there needs to be greater imagination and efforts in creating enabling and inspiring environments in the form of university spaces where teaching, learning and research can happen. Institution-building is central to nation-building and that is how we can create an enabling environment for the future.

And adding to the woes is the latest diktat to inspect CBSE schools, which the already burdened officials claim is very difficult to implement.

According to education department sources, of the 31 DEOs in the State, only 10 are regular appointees and the remaining ones are acting DEOs while all the 63 dyDEO posts are lying vacant. In 584 mandals, there are 539 sanctioned MEO posts but only 36 regular MEOs are presently on the job. In rest of the 503 mandals, headmasters are given full additional charge of MEO posts.

The headmasters, each of whom are now in-charge of at least 200 schools, allege that as a result they are unable to attend to their regular duties since they are always away to inspect the schools.

Chava Ravi, general secretary of Telangana State United Teachers Federation (TSUTF), said that lack of regular appointments was having a telling impact on education in general and supervision of schools in particular.

Inspection of SSC schools in the State is done currently by FAC MEOs and this too is not done properly, he said, adding that in the current scheme of things, for inspection of CBSE schools government has to come up with a new mechanism as handing it over to the FAC MEOs might not work. One of the DEOs, on the condition of anonymity, told Express that such inspection of CBSE schools cannot be undertaken in Telangana.

""If we had to conduct visits, it would have been fine but inspection of all schools when we are so short on manpower is not possible. In our schools too we only do random inspection,"" the officer said. The teaching community, therefore, has been demanding regularisation of 21 DEO posts, along with one DEO per constituency & 45 additional posts MEO posts to ensure one for each mandal.

""Overlooking the need for supervisory officials has resulted in the collapse of the education sector in TS. There is absenteeism in government schools because HMs are not there to monitor teachers. Neither teaching is done nor are schemes implemented properly,"" said T Swaroopa, a government school teacher."

""In India, there is a huge craving for education, but quality education is not accessible to all of them. Today, technology can make it happen. online classes can do what is not otherwise possible,"" Kumar said.

""Education is changing fast, as the requirements are changing. This calls for new approach to education,"" he said while speaking at the golden jubilee function of 'Indian for collective action' organised in San Jose, California, on Saturday.

Observing that there is no dearth of talent in India, Kumar said equal opportunities in terms of quality education and modern-day requirements often eluded a large number of students.

""Today, there are opportunities to fill this void through technology. You people can make it happen through small contributions from your side in your own way to make a big difference,"" he said.

Anand runs Super 30 educational programme to mentor 30 students free off cost through a year-long residential programme for India's prestigious IIT-JEE exam.

In its 17-year, Super 30 has helped hundreds of students, mostly from poverty-stricken background, successfully chase their IIT dream."

More than half of India's population lives in states where the population has stopped growing, with the TFR in urban India and 18 states having fallen below the replacement level of 2.1, which is when the population stops growing.

Yet another one-third of the country's population has TFR between 2.5 and 3, with the rates being the highest 3.4 in Bihar, which is home to 10% of the population. The country's demographic transition varies not just widely across regions and states, but also across districts. The states in southern India and a few other regions, including Delhi, have reduced fertility and deaths at a much faster rate than the rest of the country.

According to demographer Ansley Coale, fertility rates begin to fall in a sustained way when people consider fertility a conscious choice that they can control, when they believe that having smaller families is advantageous, and when reliable methods of contraception are widely available. ""Family size, whether small or large, is intertwined with reproductive rights, which are tied to many other rights, such as those to health and education, adequate income, the freedom to make choices, and non-discrimination. Where all rights are realised, people tend to thrive. Where they are not, people are not able to realize their potential, and fertility rates tend to be higher or lower than what most people really want,"" said the UNFPA State of the World Population Report 2018.

How India grows

How India's populations story plays out depends on India's young population.Every fifth person in India is an adolescent (10-19 years) and every third a young person (10-24 years). Every year, 12-14 million people enter the workforce, largely from the northern states.

""India needs to invest in the health, education and technical skill development of this age group to leverage its competitive advantage for economic growth,"" said Poonam Muttreja, executive director of the Population Foundation of India.

Rapid fertility decline raises the share of working age population( ages 15-49 years) and leads to a corresponding fall in the dependency ratio. After a few decades, however, this demographic advantage is lost as the share of the elderly population increases.

Low dependency ratio is the period of demographic dividend, which provides a window of opportunity to countries to boost productivity and economic growth. A dependency ratio of less than 67% boosts growth.

India is set to ride this wave, with its dependency ratio falling from 75% in 2001 to 65% in 2011. It is projected to fall to 55% in 2021, where it will remain for two decades before beginning to close at 2041 and finally closing in 2061, when the ageing population will push up the dependency ratio above the critical 67%.

While Kerala and Tamil Nadu, which led the demographic transition in India, are already gaining from their shrunken population, they will lose the dividend before the 1940s when their population ages. In sharp contrast, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar will reach a dependency ratio below 67% only by 2021.

Mind the gap

With the demographic dividend varying so widely between states, India's challenge is to implement customised and differential policies that correspond with each state's level of demographic transition.

""Government policies must focus on social and health security and promoting new employment skills for the ageing population in the demographically advanced states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Andhra, Gujarat, Punjab, Himachal and West Bengal,"" said ,"" said Shailaja Chandra, former executive director, Population Stabilisation Fund.

""With the population ageing, we need to focus on building skills to provide care, including health and social services, and establish old-age homes and housing models where the older population can live independently with supportive facilities on call,"" said Chandra.

In the six states where fertility remains high, promoting sexual and reproductive health services, providing quality education and vocational skills to young people must be prioritised.

""Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Iran and Turkey all saw substantial declines in infant and child mortality, partly because of wider reach of health-care systems, economic development, reduced poverty, and increased female enrolment in primary and secondary education,"" said the UNFPA report. Other factors that led to lower fertility is decreasing infant and child mortality and strong national family planning programmes.

The age of marriage needs to be raised further so young girls are mature enough, physically, mentally and emotionally, to make the right reproductive choices, say experts.

In states with high fertility, contraceptive information and services must reach young people.

""An estimated 70% of the population momentum is fuelled by the young population and young girls don't want to have kids as soon as they get married. Young couples, especially women, need the information and the tools to choose when and how many children they want,"" said Muttreja.

""Young girls have less knowledge and access to contraception and health services and are more likely to succumb to pressure to start a family at a young age, which is not good for the health of both the mother and child,"" said Muttreja.

""In the end, our success will not just come in reaching what we imagine is ideal fertility. The real measure of progress is people themselves: especially the well-being of women and girls, their enjoyment of their rights and full equality, and the life choices that they are free to make,"" writes Natalia Kanem, executive director, UNFPA."

The exercise, which is expected to begin mid-November, is being led by the regulator of the higher education sector, University Grants Commission (UGC), which has already collected at least 300 state acts. A team of legal consultants working with Niti Aayog will study these acts to give a holistic picture, the official added.

UGC is already working on revising parameters for the setting up of universities. ""There have been concerns about the standard of education in the hundreds of private universities spread across the country, and also about to maintaining quality. There have been reports of varsities with insufficient infrastructure, including some functioning from just a few rooms,"" said the ministry official who asked not to be named.

It was felt that a way to address the situation was to have a comprehensive evaluation of the legislations through which these bodies are set up, the official added.

The hundreds of acts under which private universities are set up in different states will be examined in light of the latest parameters that the regulator will soon come up with, said the official. ""The idea is to identify any lacunae or gaps that lead to a laxity in the maintenance of educational standards, and ways to address them.""

He added that the ministry has taken steps to bring UGC and legal consultants together to address this key aspect following directions from HRD minister Prakash Javadekar.

""The government is in favour of granting more funds and more autonomy to institutions that provide quality education, but ensuring that standards are not diluted is a key premise. Therefore, it is believed this exercise would go a long way in addressing quality concerns,"" the official said.

Apart from this, UGC is analysing nearly 8,000 cases it finds itself embroiled in, because, officials feel, ambiguities in existing legislations could be the reason behind several of these legal matters. ""The study may help in suggesting ways in which the burden on the UGC of such cases may come down in the coming days,"" said the official quoted above.

Former UGC member Inder Mohan Kapahy said, ""Some (private universities in India) are very good and some not as good. At times, even political pressure may lead to the formation of such a body. A key aspect is: the day an act or ordinance is passed, the body can give degrees. There should be some mechanism to ensure quality checks at the time of inception. In India, operations of a varsity have hardly ever been stopped. So it is important to have quality checks at the time of inception, particularly with regard to new private varsities."""

Ganai said that all the stakeholders need to come together to improve the quality of teaching and quality of learning. He said public as well as private sectors need to work in synergy so that the desired results in education sector could be achieved.

The meeting also suggested frequent student exchange programmes, where students from public schools could frequently visit private school campuses and avail their resources so that their talents could also be harnessed.

Earlier, the delegation presented various demands including making B.ed mandatory for teaching purpose, besides, abolishing B.ed conducted through distance mode. They also wanted a uniform pay norms for B.ed students across the State. According to the delegation, the B.ed students in Jammu have to pay less than Rs 10, 000 towards university, while as Kashmir University is charging the B.ed students around Rs 18000, which as per them was ""unfair"".

The Advisor assured that he would surely consider all their genuine demands and do the necessary at an earliest.

A delegation from Rambir Garh Check Razak Khan demanded that they should get due compensation for the land coming under ring road. The delegation members informed the Advisor that land owners of district Baramulla have received 35 lakhs for Abi-awal and 52 lakhs for apple orchad land. However, the delegation members said that their village despite falling in district Srinagar was only provided with 23 lakhs as compensation. The delegations demanded par rates like Baramulla residents.

Besides, they also demanded installation of new pipes for Sukhnag water supply as the current pipes have developed rust and the water supplied through them is not fit for drinking.

The delegation of contractual lectures of Government Degree College Pampore requested the Advisor to intervene to get their three months' salary released.

The delegation of PHD scholars called on Advisor and requested that they should be considered for teaching jobs in medical colleges as was the past practice.

A delegation from Bazar Committee Solina demanded the release of assured compensation for the loss their businesses have suffered due to the construction of Rambagh flyover."

Higher education is the key factor for creating a large pool of skilled manpower for our nation.

It is the determiner of career prospects of the students and is the stepping stone for building a strong nation, said Justice Chauhan.

Universities, he said, were the hub of dynamic and creative young students and experienced faculties where innovative ideas and technologies sprout for advancement of science and development of home grown technologies.

""While the internet is a magical world and provides solutions to many questions, constant use of social media may lead to a kind of addiction resulting in vulnerability to crimes and dereliction of work.

The students studying in government schools come from a very poor background and their parents are not educated, hence, they are not able to give any attention towards their studies at home. This is the bitter truth that the students from these schools are not well versed with the three R's namely reading, writing and arithmetic, (Curtis, 1795 as cited by Timbs&Limbert, 1825).

Moreover, they are not able to spell, understand and pronounce words even in the upper primary classes. This problem is carried forward to higher secondary level and at times even to higher education level.

And in this way can say that we are not able to generate good educational outcomes from government schools because the students studying there don't have a strong base. Government schools lack organizational capacity. The classes are not organized in judicious rooms.

The main aim of education is to acquire relevant skills and knowledge coupled with the proper know-how and technology, which is responsible for the capacity and skill development and the inclination for making cost-effective use of that knowledge.

It is very unfortunate that the students in the government schools don't even get a basic education which is why the main aim of education remains unfulfilled. Government teachers don't give thrust on spellings, meanings, pronunciation, and dictation etc. so that basics of students studying in such schools are very weak and for that matter, they are not able to write a sentence or even a paragraph properly.

All the schools, colleges and institutions of higher education in India follow a random walk series as far as course outline is concerned. The obsolete syllabus is the normal feature of Indian educational institutions which doesn't fit into the modern world setting. For the reason, students in our country are not able to find a good place in job markets, in and outside the country.

Moreover, faulty education system is one of the reasons for high educated unemployment in our country in general and Jammu Kashmir in particular (Qadri&Kasab, 2017).

In order to improve the quality of education in India, particularly in government schools, the government and the concerned authorities should put heavy emphasis upon the research and development of the syllabus which should necessarily talk about the modern world and its related processes of globalization, liberalization and privatization on the one hand and technology, innovations and entrepreneurships on the other hand. Furthermore, special focus should be given on relevant case studies.

There is a need to thoroughly and scientifically review and identify the policy intermediations that improve education quality and student learning at the elementary levels. We need to depend on a theory of alteration and for that matter, we need to understand the main drivers of the improvements in the quality of education at elementary level.

The supply-side competence contributions need to be put up that function through the provision of better infrastructure, particularly, human capital, and social capital. The efficiency wage hypothesis argues that incentives and rewards increase the productivity or efficiency. It should be adopted in our education system for both students as well as for teachers because it will increase their productivity levels.

Besides, the programmes, policies and plans through rewards and incentives seek to influence the behavior and inter-temporal likings and inclinations of teachers, parents and students.

The inductive or bottom-up and deductive or top-down participating and community management intrusions, which activate through the principles of decentralization and its allied reforms, transmission of skills and knowledge, and augmented community participation in the organization and management of education systems must be adopted (Masino&Zarazua, 2015).

Conclusion and recommendation:

Immense stress should be given right from KG classes at words, spellings, meanings, pronunciation, writing, dictation, and reading etc. so that fundamentals of learning become strong which will make the students able to read and write properly.

There is a need to thoroughly and scientifically review and identify the policy intermediations that improve education quality and student learning at elementary levels. It is very important to note that the inputs and efforts are effective only when policy changes are coupled with community participation, rewards and social capital.

We can improve learning outcomes when social norms and inter-temporal varieties and selections are factored in the strategy of education plans and policies (Masino&Zarazua, 2015), and when we integrate technology with classroom.

As education is an unending process and the knowledge acquisition and skill upgradation for its solicitation and application are not static but parts of a dynamic and lively process, there is a need to make schools dynamic and lively with good interaction among all the parties involved in the teaching-learning process.

Special training programmes must be developed for teachers teaching at an elementary level. Division of labour is the separation of tasks in a system so that actors or participants may specialize. Economic growth is the pivotal point of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations (1776). Economic Growth for Smith is rooted in increasing division of labour and specialization.

In any modern education system there is an increasing emphasis on specialization and the division of labour. Subject specialist teachers must be allocated against specific subject posts.

For example, P.G. in English must be posted for teaching English, P.G. in History must be posted for teaching History, P.G. in Chemistry must be posted for teaching Chemistry and so on and so forth. This will definitely enhance the quality of education and bring specialization in an economy in general and education in particular.

(Praful Gangurde/ HT)

Take a walk along the corridors of TMC school number 18 at Parabwadi and the information neatly painted on walls will tell you about countries and flags. Small diagrams on other walls give an insight into the school and the schedule.

This is one of the many civic schools which have undergone a makeover in the past two years.

The Thane Municipal Corporation's education department has made use of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds to give civic schools a facelift.

The move has made the students more enthusiastic to attend class.

""We have noticed better attendance in classrooms after the colourful makeover. Also children are showing interest in subjects where special sessions are conducted for them,"" said Disha Vichare, teacher at a civic school in Kisan Nagar.

Corporates have helped set up digital and technology friendly classrooms and laboratory for higher classes.

Not just infrastructure but self-help organisations are focusing on improving the quality of teaching.

Some provide sessions for special children and some focus on students who are talented in art. English speaking sessions are also held for teachers and special coaching for dropouts.

A total of Rs9.76 crore corporate social responsibility funds have been used since 2015 till 2017 with an aim to improve the quality of education in municipal schools.

The TMC accepts funds from top corporates and self-help organisations to avoid delays in projects.

""Earlier, the procedure to approve budget for projects was time-consuming. However, approval for CSR funding is quick. Since the corporates handle most of the procedure, it saves us a lot of time. This also helps students and teachers to get better facilities quickly,"" said Vikas Repale, chairman of education committee, education department, TMC.

A visible example of the benefits of CSR initiative is the signal school at Teen Hath Naka, which has been running for three years.

""The signal school started for the children begging on the streets has gained a lot of popularity. We will soon begin a platform school in Mumbra for children loitering on the station premises,"" said Manish Joshi, deputy municipal commissioner, education department, TMC.

He said a skill centre for labourers has also been built. ""We are working towards making Thane's civic education on a par with private institutions,"" Joshi said.

""Many organisations have approached us to provide stationery or meals to students of civic schools. We tell them about the requirements we have in schools and accordingly the organisations work to provide what the schools lack,"" added Repale.

Many TMC schools, which were in a run-down condition, have been upgraded with better infrastructure and teaching quality.

Students of Lokmanya Nagar civic school were happy getting a laboratory recently.

""Without a laboratory, it was difficult teaching science to students. There was hardly any practical training and students also would not show much interest in understanding concepts. There has been a huge improvement after a laboratory was set up,"" said Pranali Vaidya, teacher from the school.

Students are excited about their 'new' school.

""Our school walls have mathematical tables and cartoon figures. It is attractive and we all join in to learn tables,"" said Anish More, student of Vartak Nagar civic school.

""The makeover has made

a difference to learning and teaching. However, the CSR activities are time-bound and it is essential for the TMC to ensure that teaching quality keeps improving,"" said Vijay Bedekar, educationalist."

The exam is designed in such a way that it helps both students and parents to understand the improvement areas and their National level academic performance.

Primary Olympiad runs as a National level certification program and competition for young learners along with their teachers from class I - V. The competition has five levels and the students studying in respective classes can opt for the respective levels. The Olympiad consists of Language, Mathematics and Science sections. The Language Olympiad focuses on spelling and grammar, Maths Olympiad focuses on Arithmetic & Geometry and the Science Olympiad focuses on science and environmental studies.

""In our education system, the National Level examinations are best held at only X or XII standard level, which hampers the educational outcomes. This situation needs to be addressed urgently, as lack of early transparency eliminates the system's knack to rectify itself. There are tremendous contentions among academicians on measuring a students learning from younger grades. Some believe that the damage done to young children through exam stress outweighs the benefits of actual learning, and others contend that the examination results are not the actual reflection of true learning,says,Mr.Hemant Bisht, National Product Head, Primary Olympiad.

Students enrolled in the Primary Olympiad receive books as study materials which are aligned with their school curriculum and hence can also be utilized as an additional practice material. Students enrolled for the Language Olympiad receive a spelling book, a grammar book and comprehension & composition book. Students enrolled for the Maths Olympiad receive a maths text-book and an activity book. Students enrolled for the Science Olympiad receive a science text book and an environmental studies book.

A teacher's guide is also provided to the teachers of the participating schools to enable them for effective preparation assistance to the students. A team of master trainer also assist the teachers of the enrolled schools on state-of -the art teaching methodology and easy ways to understand the subjects better.

""In parallel to the issue of not having annual exams, students in primary classes are devoid of exposure to non-academic and in-school activities as well. While the Government makes systematic yet gradual progress towards improving the education system, the approach that the Non-Profit Organisations have undertaken is to highlight the above issues and support the Government initiative by either creating a content of International standard or raise their exposure by conducting competitive exams.""Mr.Bisht further added .

Winners from each grade will be awarded a scholarship of upto Rs 10000/- along with certificates and recognition. For students not making it to the finale, in addition to awards, certificates and recognition, a detailed score card that analyzes their performance in a variety of competency dimensions is given. Schools also receive a confidential score card that shows how the school performed relative to other schools.

With Alumni bases in over 20 cities and associations with the best schools, the services provided are niche in the segment. Successfully implementing with the State Governments and PSU's to support their quality education drive, Primary Olympiads continuously prove to have a substantial impact on effective learning

The Primary Olympiad was first launched in June 2010 in the name of 'English Olympiad' and was confined only to Mumbai. With over 9 years of excellence in it s unique domain, Primary Olympiad is the oldest certificate programs, emerging as the premium certification programs for primary classes in the country. Today over 12,000 students from 200 schools in 20 cities are part of the Primary Olympiad. The Last date for registration for this year is 15th October, 2018."

Over 500 delegates from all over India from various medical colleges and universities took part in the event.

S. Sacchidanand, Vice-Chancellor of Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences, Bangalore, who inaugurated the conference, said that though there were about 450 medical colleges and 10,000 nursing colleges in India, producing thousands of graduates and post-graduates and paramedical students every year, the need of the hour is to have 'quality medical education'. Along with age-related health ailments, several diseases were breaking out from time to time, every season, as they were being potentially fostered by the rapid changes in the environment globally.

""The true meaning of medical education and practice should be based on social context. With young generation and available infrastructure and talent, India has the potential to be a vibrant destination for medical education and to become a perfect hub for it,"" Dr. Sacchidanand said.

Chancellor of PES University Dr M.R. Doreswamy observed that the PES Medical College in Kuppam is the best example of taking medical education and fruits of research to villages, following the Gandhian concept that 'India lives in villages'.

He said that generally national conferences would be held in cities, but the PES University could bring the intellectuals of medical field to a remote village like Kuppam, behind which the efforts of the faculty played a crucial role. ""Fields of science and technology in India have to be bolstered with advanced research and steps should begin immediately,"" he said."

He said that with a youth population of about 600 million, more than half of India's population are under 25 years old.

The Uttar Pradesh government, under chief minister Yogi Adityanath's personal push, is working on a plan to make public education free. There is already a catchy slogan -- from KG (kindergarten) to PG (post graduation). The plan may seem revolutionary, but amounts to little more than tokenism. Fees are already quite low -- in University of Lucknow, for instance, the monthly fee for a regular MA programme is a little below '700 while that for the most expensive self-financed MA programme, the monthly fee stands a little below '5,000. Education is free till the secondary level in public schools. Yet, successive ASER surveys show how, even in rural areas, parents are increasingly preferring private schools over public ones. In UP, 30.3% of the all school-going children were enrolled in private schools in 2006. By 2014, this had increased to over 51%. Also, these reports point at a significant lag in terms of quality of learning between government-run and private schools. And, as per NSSO data, more than a quarter of school students in the country bridge gaps in school-learning through private coaching . So, the problem is not fees impeding access to education, it is the poor quality of education and consequent poor learning outcomes, especially in government-run schools. In fact, the increasing private-school enrolment and private tuitions trends show that even the poor are willing to spend for better quality education.

The Adityanath government should work on improving the quality of learning in its schools and universities -- students in government schools in the state, as per the last ASER survey that examined this, reported worse learning outcomes than students in government schools across the rest of the country. As per a Times of India report, nearly 3,700 PhD-holders applied for the job of 62 messenger posts in the telecom wing of UP police -- the minimum educational qualification required is Class V-pass. Among other things, this is also a blistering commentary on the quality of higher education in the state. So, instead of making ""KG to PG"" free, if the state focuses on improving quality of education imparted at its schools, colleges and universities, students would benefit more. Addressing the quality-gaps in government school education, in particular, would not only mean better learning outcomes, it could also benefit families financially if it brings down dependence on private coaching or private school enrolment."

Of the 6,000 'lecturer' positions in 404 government junior colleges, there are only 840 regular ones. In 162 colleges, there is not even one regular lecturer. The remaining 5,200 vacancies were filled with contract and guest lecturers -- the former recruited for three years and the latter on annual basis. There are 3,800 contractual and 1,400 guest lecturers in the government junior colleges.

Now, with no job security for 85 per cent of the staff working in these colleges, the educational standards in these institutions have taken a beating. P Madhusudan Reddy, president of Telangana Government Junior Lecturers' Association, said, ""The High Court has said that contract lecturers cannot be regularised nor can they continue for more than three years.

By the time there develops an understanding between the teacher and the student, it is time for them to leave. Teachers too are not interested in working because they know they are temporary. For proper teaching to take place, the tenure should be of at least four to five years or the government should take up permanent recruitment.""

With the state government not recruiting any regular lecturer since 2002, the colleges have been making do with contract lecturers. Despite the High Court's directive on ensuring that the tenure of contract lecturers does not exceed three-year term, it was in 2014 that lecturers under this category were inducted. ""Teachers and infrastructure are most important inputs in the education system. Having so many categories of lecturers -- regular, contract, guest, part-time guest and minimum scale -- is doing more harm than good,"" said a Board official."

""Education is one of our top priorities which is why Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao ensured establishment of 134 SC residential schools in addition to the existing 134 schools that were established in the past six decades,"" Mr. Harish Rao said.

""For the first time in the country, we established as many as 30 degree residential colleges in the State,"" he said, adding that people have trust in government educational system now as they were willing to send their children to government schools. Unlike his usual way, he spoke to students in English and enquired about the facilities at school.

Principal Vijaya informed the Minister that the existing residential accommodation was sufficient for only 256 students while the student strength was 526.

Mr. Harish Rao promised her to sanction additional rooms.

Earlier, the Minister laid foundation stone for the construction of 50-bed hospital and classrooms at Kohir.

He also laid foundation stone for road-over bridge on railway track at Zaheerabad at an estimated cost of ₹90 crore, a demand that was pending for the past two decades.

Of the 6,000 'lecturer' positions in 404 government junior colleges, there are only 840 regular ones. In 162 colleges, there is not even one regular lecturer.

The remaining 5,200 vacancies were filled filled with contract and guest lecturers _ the former recruited for three years and the latter on annual basis. There are 3,800 contractual and 1,400 guest lecturers in the government junior colleges.

Now, with no job security for 85 per cent of the staff working in these colleges, the educational standard in these institutions has taken a beating. P Madhusudan Reddy, president of Telangana Government Junior Lecturers' Association, said, ""The High Court has said that contract lecturers cannot be regularised nor can they continue for more than three years.

By the time there develops an understanding between the teacher and the student, it is time for them to leave. Teachers, too, are not interested in working because they know they are temporary. For proper teaching to take place, the tenure should be of at least for or five years or the government should take up permanent recruitment.""

Since 2002 the government has not recruited any regular lecturer and the colleges have been making do with contract lecturers. Despite the High Court's directive on ensuring that the tenure of contract lecturers does not exceed three-year term, it was in 2014 that lecturers under this category were inducted.

An official of the board admitted that quality of education depended on the strength and permanence of the teaching staff. ""Teachers and infrastructure are most important inputs in the education system. That infrastructure in government colleges is poor is well-known. Now, having so many categories of lecturers - regular, contract, guest, part-time guest, and minimum scale - is doing more harm than good,"" he said."

Principal of Lakireddy Balireddy College of Engineering K. Appa Rao has said there are plenty of opportunities for higher education in various countries and called upon students to work hard and be equipped to pursue a career that has better prospects.

Mr. Rao was speaking at the seminar on 'Overseas Education and Opportunities' organised jointly by The Hindu and IDP Education at the college on Friday.

He said not many had a clear picture of education abroad and such awareness programmes introduced them to not just education opportunities but also financial aid in the form of scholarships provided by institutions.

Manager-Operations of IDP Education Maneesh Chandra stressed the need for setting a higher goal in life to make it big.

Focus on research

""The quality of education and standards of an institution play a key role in shaping up the career of students. Industries across the world always look for industry-ready graduates to employ. But curriculum in Indian institutions is changed only once in two or three years.

In case of foreign universities, course curriculum as required by the industry could be updated in a matter of a month or two, which is a great advantage for students,"" Mr. Maneesh said. The first salary was the most important thing in one's career, he said and asked students to aim high.

Explaining the opportunities of funded courses in universities in the U.S., Canada, Australia and other countries, Mr. Maneesh said most of the foreign universities were involved in research and engaged students in research work.

Govt. assistance

Apart from the universities, the government of Andhra Pradesh was also providing loans and subsidies for students to pursue higher education in foreign universities, he said. ""All kinds of support is available for those wishing to pursue education in other countries. It is time you used the opportunities,"" he told the students.

A team of experts of IDP Education later threw light on courses, universities and scholarships available in Canada, U.S. and other countries.

In the case of Urdu medium schools, the ability to read a story in Urdu improved from 17% to 57%.

Elated with the success, the state government by the end of 2019 will extend this partnership with Pratham in 21 districts of the state.

Divulging details of the training method of Pratham which has brought about significant changes, founder of Pratham Mysore, Ashvini Ranjan told TOI, ""The uniqueness in our training lies in segregating the children based on their learning levels. In a typical classroom, there are children who have stopped learning at different levels. While 10% of a classroom is made up of frontbenchers who have little or no difficulty, the remaining 90% have difficulties in learning at various levels.""

""By segregating them, the teachers who are trained by our master trainers will provide individual attention to every child to help them catch up by clearing their doubts and the children rapidly catch up,"" said Ranjan.

""To promote a healthy and friendly classroom atmosphere, we ask the teachers to squat on the floor along with the children as it makes a world of a difference to the children as they feel less intimidated by the teacher,"" said Ranjan asserting that a significant change was witnessed after this method was adopted. The children do not get frightened and a friendly atmosphere is created and learning becomes fun, he added.

""We also update the parents about their wards' progress which is making them wake up and pay attention to their children,"" Ranjan said.

Elated by the difference made to the children, Ranjan said, ""We are participating with the government at every step in this short-term intervention. Many a times, there are teachers who are not so welcoming of our master trainers who are young men and women between the ages of 20-25, but the difference made in the learning process of these children is reassuring and encourages us to do better.""

Explaining the Teaching at Right Level (TARL) methodology of Pratham, Jagadish, a programme coordinator for Pratham, said, ""Our methodology focuses on teaching students based on their levels by giving them individual attention. Some children will not be able to identify letters, some won't be able to read words and some others won't be able to read sentences. We identify such problems and help them overcome those problems. There are many dedicated teachers who put in a lot of effort to help these children overcome their learning difficulties.""

After grouping the children by classifying them as 'letter level', 'word level', and 'sentence level', a semicircle is formed and the teacher sits down on the floor to impart lessons which boosts one-to-one relationship, added Jagadish.

Pointing to the pivotal role played by Teaching Learning Materials (TLM) of Pratham, Rachaiah, a member of the State Resource Group (SRG) who teaches mathematics, said, ""We adopt the touch and learn method which makes learning not only easy, but also fun. To teach mathematics, we use straws, coins, and currency notes when we have to teach them simple addition, subtraction, division or multiplication.""

Crediting the method adopted by Pratham for improving soft skills of the children, he said, ""Along with learning, the speaking skills of the children also saw a huge improvement."""

They also outnumbered universities since their inception, but post-Independence they have grown rather too rapidly to become dominant players in the higher education. As per MHRD's All India Survey of Higher Education (AISHE) data, while the number of universities in the country increased from 27 in 1950 to 903 in 2017-18, recording a growth of 32 times, the number of colleges during the corresponding period soared 67 times from 578 to 39,050. Critically, over 78 per cent of the total number of teachers in higher education are employed in the collegiate sector.

Ubiquitously, improving the overall quality of higher education shall remain a distant dream unless the initiatives and measures in this regard pay focussed attention on colleges. The fact that over 60 per cent of the colleges in the country are located in rural areas, catering mostly to the deprived and marginalised sections of the society, makes it imperative for policy planners to focus their attention on colleges. Since an overwhelming number of the colleges are affiliated to public-funded state universities, the onus of reforms for improving quality and promoting excellence in colleges fall in the domain of the state governments. However, the Union government, which is constitutionally charged with the responsibility of coordination and maintenance of standards in higher education, has to play a critical role through policy intervention and regulation.

Fortunately for the policy planners and regulators, the MHRD's AISHE has been providing data on the number, size and growth of colleges consistently since 2006-07 and the same are also timely released. So, the summary data for 2017-18 is already available in public domain. A quick diagnostic run of the available data as obtained for the years 2007-08 to 2017-18 throws up major deficiencies in the collegiate system of higher education in the country, crying for structural reforms in the sector.

The problem of large numbers of colleges affiliated to a single university seems to have been gradually addressed; 161 of the 285 universities affiliating colleges now have less than 100 colleges affiliated to them and the same has been achieved by establishing new universities and also by bifurcating or trifurcating existing universities. There are now only 15 universities that have more than 500 colleges affiliated to them and it seems that most states are now proactively working to lessen their affiliating burden.

Quite a few major problems, however, still continue to persist, thus calling for urgent action. The first is the problem of single-discipline colleges which constitute over a third of the total number of colleges in the country. For these colleges, curricular reforms like Choice-Based Credit System (CBCS), which is being prescribed by the University Grants Commission (UGC) as a necessary measure to improve quality in higher education is a near impossibility.

Secondly, the collegiate system of higher education in the country is characterised by a very large number of small-sized institutions. Data reveals that nearly a fifth of the colleges have less than a hundred students on their roll and only less than 4 per cent of them have over 3,000 students. Small-sized colleges suffer from the same deficiencies as those pointed out in case of single-discipline colleges. Additionally, they also lack adequate and suitable infrastructure and suffer from the lack of academic viability and economies of scale.

Thirdly, the student-teacher ratio in the colleges at over 30 is way too high. Technological advancements in teaching-learning notwithstanding, teachers play a critical role in imparting quality higher education. It is also proven that institutions catering to largely first-generation learners drawn from the poorer and marginalised sections of society need to invest more in teachers and teaching-learning resources as these students require far more focussed attention to overcome what their families are unable to provide for.

Finally, the number of colleges in the country have been rising too rapidly. The expansion is largely driven by private initiatives and the number of government and government-aided colleges have been declining in proportion. Even though there have been some consolidation lately, leading to closure and winding up of colleges, we are still seeing on an average 3 to 4 colleges being established every day. Such a growth is neither desirable nor viable academically and economically. While new colleges are still needed to mitigate regional disparities and widen equitable access, the time has come to focus on qualitative expansion and consolidation."

The prime minister said several students who have graduated from the institute are actively participating in the country's development.

Modi said that in the last four years, seven IITs, seven IIMs (Indian Institute of Management), two IISER (Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research) and 11 IIITs (Indian Institute of Information Technology) have been approved.

""In order to improve infrastructure, RISE (Revitalisation of Infrastructure and Systems in Education) programme has been initiated. In accordance with this programme, a target of accumulating Rs 1 lakh crore has been set.

""New institutes, new infrastructure is necessary, but more important is the skilled power generated from these. The government is also focusing on this,"" he said.

The prime minister further said the foundation of India's developed economy was being laid through innovation and industries which will lead to sustainable long-term financial growth based on technology.

""Innovation and enterprise are going to be the foundation stones for making India a developed economy. Start Up India and the Atal Innovation Mission launched by the Centre have resulted in India becoming the world's second largest ecosystem for technology,"" the prime minister said.

In the coming two decades, innovation and new technology will decide the trajectory of growth in the world and the role of IITs in this will be very important, he said.

""Be it 5G broadband technology, artificial intelligence, block chain technology or machine learning, these are techniques that will play an important role in the vision of smart cities,"" Modi said.

Maharashtra governor C Vidyasagar Rao, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Union Human Resources Development Minister Prakash Javadekar were present at the event.

Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Gates said that the key predictor of a hike in jobs is quality education. ""Nothing comes close to the key issues... Do those kids really learn while they're in school? Are Indian universities allowing students to be innovative?""

All this is more important than questions about how or when artificial intelligence (AI) will impact the job market, he said.

And 'The Giving Pledge' is doing its bit in tackling problems that plague the education system in India, including at the primary school level, Gates added. ""[Under The Giving Pledge] we talk about how do you give to education in India; how do you do pilots and help kids learn. We share success stories... [it's] a global movement that helps us do more and work with each other.""

The billionaire also told the news channel that the private sector is where most jobs will be created,. ""When private sector is given the right incentives, [and] the scale of demand, [a] lot of good things can happen."" There is opportunity to get way more out of the private sector, he stated.

Furthermore, the philanthropist termed the evolving global trade tensions as ""scary"" and said they could hit economic growth, and jobs.

""The rhetoric that, okay, you know we'll use trade tariffs and we'll force somebody to do something, that can escalate...That alone will be quite a burden on economic growth and therefore job creation.""

Factory activity and jobs

India's manufacturing activity moderated in July, 2018, amid a softer increase in output, new orders and employment, according to a monthly survey that polls factory managers. The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) stood at 52.3 in July, down from 53.1 in June.

Although softening slightly since June, both domestic and export orders rose for the ninth consecutive month in July. And Reflecting sustained periods of growth in output and new orders, firms were encouraged to raise their staffing levels for the fourth successive month in July, the survey added.
