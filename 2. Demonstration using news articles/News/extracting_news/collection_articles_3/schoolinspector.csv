A speeding autorickshaw rammed into a school van from behind, resulting in the death of an eight-year-old boy and severely injuring a girl in north Delhi's Timarpur on Tuesday, police said.

The deceased was the son of an assistant sub-inspector in Delhi Police's Crime Branch, they added.

The incident took place near Nirankari Sarovar area when the school van was taking back students of a private school in Model Town to their homes at around 2 pm, a senior police officer said.

The Maruti Eco van was hit by the autorickshaw carrying goods. An eight-year-old boy, who was sitting behind, sustained severe injuries and was rushed to a nearby hospital where he succumbed to injuries, police said.

The impact of the accident was such that both the auto rickshaw and the school van turned sides.

The 10-year-old girl was admitted to the Sushruta Trauma Centre in Civil Lines. She is out of danger now, the senior officer said.

Others who sustained minor injuries were also taken to a private nursing home nearby where they were given first-aid, he said.

Police said the accused driver, however, escaped unhurt.

A case has been registered. The accused auto-rickshaw driver identified as Salman (21), a resident of Azadpur Mandi, has been arrested in connection with the incident, he added.

Police said there were reportedly 10 students in the van from a school in Model Town. Further investigation is underway.

In April this year, a seven-year-old girl was killed and 17 students were injured after a milk-tanker rammed into a private school van near the Kanhaiya Nagar metro station in northwest Delhi, following which the Delhi government ordered a magisterial probe into the incident.

The Delhi Traffic Police has issued 6,532 challans to school vans and cab drivers who violated traffic rules this year, almost three times the number of challans issued in the last year.

A Bharatiya Janata Party MLA allegedly roughed up a district inspector of schools (DIOS) during a review meeting in Ballia district of eastern Uttar Pradesh, reportedly in presence of BJP Ballia Member of Parliament Bharat Singh, the District Magistrate and many senior officers in the auditorium of the collectorate on Saturday, September 22. Those who were supposed to protect the DIOS tried their best to hush up the scandal, but it went viral on social media sites.

After Education Department officers across Uttar Pradesh watched the clipping of the incident and were agitated over the manhandling of the school inspector, Bairia MLA Surendra Singh, who had left the meeting hall after thrashing Narendra Deo, came to the bungalow of the District Magistrate Bhawani Singh Khangarot after two hours and apologised to the Deo. The lawmaker also reportedly ensured that the video of him standing before the officer and apologising was circulated on social media sites.

Singh and his aides allegedly attacked Deo, when the latter was trying to reply to the MLA's allegation that he was not solving day-to-day problems of teachers. Later, the DM took the DIOS to his official residence, allegedly to force him to forget about whatever happened in the meeting. But by that time, someone had posted the video of the incident shot on a mobile phone to the WhatsApp group of the Education Department officers. Some officers of Gorakhpur, where Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was camping, sought time to register their protest against the incident. Sources said while Adityanath had yet to react to the incident, the rogue lawmaker asked his aide to make a video while he would say sorry to Deo.

BJP's Bairia MLA Surendra Singh is no stranger to controversy. In July 2018, he told reporters, ""Even Lord Ram would not have been able to stop rapes"", when they queried him about the Unnao rape case in which BJP's Bangarmau MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar is an accused

An Education Department officer alleged that many teachers who stay in cities don't attend the schools in villages.""They grease the palm of local representatives in return for security of their jobs. Such people would obviously dislike any officer who would proactively try to make them go by the book"", alleged the officer, who didn't want to be named.

Playing down the seriousness of the incident, the DM said, ""Nothing had happened between the MLA and the DIOS.""

Surendra Singh is no stranger to controversy. In April 2018, he infamously said a public rally in Ballia that the next Lok Sabha elections were going to be Islam versus God. In June 2018, he asked his supporters at a public meeting to beat officers with their shoes if they sought bribes. A month later, he told reporters, ""Even Lord Ram would not have been able to stop rapes"", when they queried him about the Unnao rape case in which BJP's Bangarmau MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar is an accused.

Nearly 350 kids are igniting their minds in school, but in dark. These kids of Safal English Medium school in Juhapura have finally got some relief from the power cut. Thanks to the Sarkhej police inspector, who, on Saturday, came to their rescue and ensured that a new power link was set and classes resume from Monday.

The students of the school, which has been running since the last three years on the first floor of Jambuwala Cooperative Bank on Sarkhej Road, were being forced to sit outside their classrooms. Also, there has been a fight between the trustee of the school, AR Pathan, and the landlord. The latter has also stopped water supply to the school since last 15 days and power since last 10 days.

The examination will start on August 16 and the school authorities called the police inspector to intervene.

""It is disheartening to see children studying in dark. I called the chairman of the premise but he did not come to the spot. They had locked the room from where the main electric supply comes. So, I brought an electrician and ensured a new electrical connection to the school. No matter what, the children should not suffer,"" PR Ramani, police inspector of Sarkhej police station, said.

""I have been running English and Gujarati medium schools on the premise. We have been given 12 rooms to run classes,"" said AR Pathan, Trustee of Safal English school."
