From a Kolkata girls' school accusing ten of its students of 'indulging in lesbianism', to Kamaal R Khan making homophobic and transphobic comments on his Youtube channel, to the death of Sridevi, a desi queer icon for most of us Bollywood loving gaysis, 2018 has not been an year of complete euphoria.

2018 has been a mixed bag in terms of our constitution and its laws. While same-sex relationships have finally been decriminalized thanks to Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code being partially struck down, it has been bad for the Indian trans community due to the recent passing of the Transgender Persons Protection of Rights Bill a couple of days back. It has been a long time fighting for Indian gay and lesbian relationships since the reinstating of Section 377 in 2013, and countless petitions by LGBTQ individuals, organizations, and allies against the judgement helped the archaic law to be overturned.

The Transgender Persons Protection of Rights Bill is a huge step back. According to this bill, an Indian trans individual will be required to have an ID, with a thorough 'screening' process on various governmental levels that will certify whether they are trans or not (I find myself shaking my head at this), and sex reassignment surgery (SRS) will be mandatory for all trans individuals. While SRS is a costly procedure in itself, many trans and other gender non-conforming individuals have their own reasons not to undergo the surgery since it is an extremely personal, biological decision. The bill conveniently also does not say anything about creating education and job opportunities for trans Indians, but ironically, criminalizes begging for the community (it is interesting to note that the Indian constitution currently does not criminalize begging under any other law). Also, this bill also enforces that trans individuals get themselves admitted into government approved lodging and rehabilitation institutions, which may be extremely regressive, given that a lot of trans folks are forced to leave their homes in order to escape the abuse meted out to them by family and friends.

On the non-governmental front, however, things seem to be looking up for the trans community in the light of the recent governmental law changes. Godrej India Culture Lab has put out A Manifesto for Trans Inclusion in the Indian Workplace, in association with the Keshav Suri Foundation, Humsafar Trust, Periferry, TWEET Foundation, and Community Business. This could ensure some amount of accountability and safety for the Indian trans people in employment at private organizations. In February, the VLCC Institute announced a free ""Assistant Beauty Therapist"" training course for transgender individuals at its Hyderabad branch out of which over two dozen people have already completed the course. In July, Uber Eats -- the global ride-sharing company's online food delivery subsidiary - hired India's first transgender delivery agent in Chennai. In Kolkata, the Medica Superspecialty Hospital (part of the largest chain of hospitals in eastern India) hired two transgender operating theatre technicians on a six month internship. With such big names taking steps to integrate trans-inclusive policies in recent times, it looks like India Inc is finally waking up to the benefits of diversity and trans-inclusion.

The year has not been completely bereft of its share of homophobia as well. From a Kolkata girls' school accusing ten of its students of 'indulging in lesbianism', to Kamaal R Khan making homophobic and transphobic comments on his Youtube channel, to the death of Sridevi, a desi queer icon for most of us Bollywood loving gaysis, 2018 has not been an year of complete euphoria. However, we have had our small wins compared to our small losses as well. Akkai Padmashali, transwoman and activist, officially registered her marriage with Vasudev V, earlier this year in January, making the union to be the first officially recognized trans marriage. Earlier this year, Prince Manvendra Singh Gohil opened the doors of his palace for ostracized LGBTQ folks seeking home and protection. Many cities such as Jamshedpur and Bhubaneshwar had their first Pride march this year, with previous cities and editions recapping as well. Pride march attendance witnessed a massive increase post the striking down of Section 377, with many queer individuals coming out onto the streets for the first time to celebrate the verdict. Online dating for queer individuals has evolved, with the Delta app, India's first homegrown LGBTQ dating app dropping into the market, as well as Tinder upping their game by adding 23 new categories in the self gender identification, which previously only had male and female in its options.

When it comes to our media, we just received a first look of what may possibly be the first mainstream Bollywood major release (after Fire) with a lesbian couple at its centre, Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga, with Sonam Kapoor playing one of the leads! From the first look of the trailer, it seems to be made with a good and seasoned cast, and what really appeals to me is that the story seems to be set in small town Punjab, which as we all are used to seeing as a hotbed for toxic masculinity and ingrained misogyny in our Bollywood films. Here's to hoping the best for this film! We got our first look at Lihaaf, starring Tannishtha Chatterjee, the cinematic adaptation of the famous lesbian short story by Ismat Chughtai at the India Pavillion at Cannes Film Festival 2018 in May. Apart from this, we also have numerous web series streaming that showcase LGBTQ characters, one of the most recent ones being Selection Day by Netflix, which explores these themes. Priyanka Chopra starred in the Hollywood film A Kid Like Jake, which shows a young child being encouraged by their parents and teachers to explore their non-binary inclinations, among the many international releases this year.

Here's to 10 years of Gaysi, and many more in the years to come. Here's to hoping that 2019 has a better take on our laws, with more inclusion in Bollywood and Indian media beyond, with lesser hate crimes on gaysis. I, for one, would like to see more queer collectives grow and bloom in colleges and other institutions, seeing how the IIT queer collective, Pravriti, had such a pivotal role in the decriminalization of Section 377 this year. Now that some laws have changed, and some more need to be changed, let's hope for sensitization towards the LGBTQ community on a grassroots level from the new year onwards."

Among the many schemes and interventions like starting of English-medium 'schools of excellence' and teaching English courses, what really caught attention was the 'happiness curriculum'.

The curriculum was really a class for students from Nursery to Class VIII studying in Delhi government schools in which they were taught to concentrate and were taught values so that they could have holistic growth. Prepared after rigorous deliberations for six months by a team of teachers from Delhi government schools, principals of District Institute of Education and Training (DIET), members from different NGOs and officials of DoE, it was launched in July by the Dalai Lama.

Without books or tests, it was a joyful exercise of 45 minutes for the children. But teachers had to periodically assess the progress of the children. Teachers of all 1,100 government schools were trained in the course. But so far, the impact of the course is merely anecdotal -- from better attendance to increasing confidence among students.

For the teachers, the curriculum meant a new addition to their paperwork and another change in routine. School principals had a different take on this. ""How well this curriculum works depends on the teachers and the freedom s/he is given to teach. But in government schools, teachers have constraints in terms of having a model class ratio and abiding by rule books set by the government,"" said a principal of a south Delhi school.

The Delhi government saw the happiness curriculum as a step in imparting quality education. The other step was Mission Buniyaad.

It was an extension of the earlier Chunauti scheme, but included even corporation schools. Run during summer vacation, the government claimed to have improved learning levels of more children by dividing them into groups of those who could read texts and those who could not. Corporation schools, though, struggled to get their students attend it.

Education experts expressed reservations about segregating children into groups.

The other red mark was examination results. The performance of government schools in CBSE Class X exams didn't impress even though the government introduced several interventions.

The coming year would put the government's efforts to the test."

The elementary education department at Panchkula has decided to close or merge 62 GPSs having ""zero student strength"" this year. Of these, four are in Gurugram, including the one at Sehrawan, as well as GPS at Daultabad, Government Girls Primary School at Garhi, GPS at Rampur. An education department official said: ""This decision was taken by the department. We had no say in it. Officially, the reason is low attendance.""

According to official records that TOI has sourced, at the time of being closed down, GPS Sehrawan had zero students and two teachers. Charan Singh, one of the teachers at the school, said: ""I don't know what the records say, but at the time the school was unofficially shut down in 2015, we had around 26 students."" Today, the four rooms in the school lay deserted. A poster in one room displays the midday meal schedule, that includes among others chaat on Monday and dal on Wednesday. One of the walls has a political map of Haryana, showing different districts.

A letter sent by the education department earlier this year reads: ""The government has decided that 62 government primary schools having zero student strength may be closed down or merged. Posts sanctioned and teachers working in schools which are to be merged may be shifted to schools with which it is proposed to be merged. However, at the time of rationalisation, posts of teachers will be rationalised on the basis of actual requirement at that point of time. All such teachers shall compulsorily participate in the next transfer drive.""

Officially, there are no students at GPS, Sehrawan, although the school has two teachers. Following the education department notification, the staff have been told they may be transferred to a school facing staff crunch. Tarun Suhag of Haryana Primary Teachers Association said, ""Primary schools should never be shut down. If at all, closures should happen based on data from three consecutive years, not from a single year."""

Here's what to expect in key areas that touch your life. Learning beyond the four walls

Out of class learning is expected to be a key part of the Delhi government's education push in the coming year.

In Delhi government schools, which largely cater to children from economically disadvantaged families, ensuring attendance and establishing a classroom connect with students has been a struggle.

The coming year will see the flagship 'Happiness Curriculum' project completing one year, and implementation of the new 'Entrepreneurship Curriculum' for students in classes IX to XII.

Through storytelling, 'mindfulness' classes and interactive activities, 'happiness classes' for students of nursery to Class VIII have tried to help students ""get in touch with their emotions"". The objective of the 'entrepreneurship classes', an official said, will be to develop an ""entrepreneurial mindset"" in older children to help them re-orient their goals -- from simply seeking jobs towards innovation.

Shailendra Sharma, principal advisor to the Delhi government, said these curricular interventions are laying the ground for changing the education discourse in classrooms. ""The whole point of happiness classes is to reorient relationships between teachers, students and parents. Students are getting the opportunity to reflect on their thoughts and express themselves without fear of judgement, while teachers can experience their relationship with students beyond just teaching. This is setting the ground for the larger goal of education beyond knowledge transmission.""

On the 'entrepreneurship curriculum', he said, ""Hopefully, this will also help take the discourse to the next level, in terms of what students feel like they're ready for after stepping out of school and what roles they see for themselves in the public arena.""

Education, many believe, is also tied closely to AAP's political fortunes. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has often spoken about education reforms in Delhi during his rallies outside the state; AAP leader Atishi, best known for her work in the field of education, has been made a Lok Sabha candidate; and AAP has frequently harnessed the 'happiness curriculum' for international recognition -- most recently during an education conference in Austria in December.

Even though heads of schools have given positive feedback on happiness classes in review meetings -- such as a greater sense of belonging and an increase in attendance -- some have expressed concern that the flurry of new interventions take away time, effort and focus from the core need to deliver examination results.

This year, several schools delivered zero pass percentages in the internal examinations. The ability to match these interventions with results will be tested in 2019, particularly with children in board examination classes being brought under their ambit.

Move to check overpricing by hospitals

The Delhi government is set to roll out guidelines to regulate private hospitals and nursing homes. Once implemented, the policy is expected to be a landmark decision for Delhi residents who have often complained of overpricing by various private hospitals.

Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain told The Indian Express that the government will implement the guidelines by early 2019. The advisory was framed after the AAP government formed a nine-member committee, headed by the then Director-General of Health Services Kirti Bhushan, to monitor functioning of private hospitals.

The aim is to ensure rates of surgery packages are ""transparent, without hidden charges"", and hospitals disclose whether they cover any complications during the procedure.

The draft advisory states that private hospitals can charge patients for medicines at the MRP mentioned in the National List of Essential Medicines, 2015, as their prices have already been capped. The policy also prohibits private hospitals and nursing homes from refusing to hand over bodies over pending bills.

""The department is finalising work on the committee report and will release it soon. The guidelines will change the entire scenario of the medical profession,"" said a senior health department official.

In 2019, Delhi will also witness implementation of the Centre's ambitious Ayushman Bharat scheme, which has run into some turbulence in the capital over the name of the scheme. At the moment, both sides are in a deadlock.

It has so far been implemented in four government hospitals -- All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ram Manohar Lohia, Safdarjung Hospital and Lady Hardinge Medical College -- as well as a few private hospitals. The National Health Agency has asked private hospitals in the capital to join the insurance scheme, and 2019 will tell how many follow through.

AAP and Cong: Will they, won't they?

Wild swings in vote shares of the three big political players, AAP, BJP and Congress, which have come to characterise the city's politics since 2014, will largely determine the churning that lies ahead.

For the ruling AAP, doing well in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls is imperative for its ambition to go national. It has received jolts in the recent past owing to successive drubbings in state assembly polls, as seen recently in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.

The AAP's political fortunes appear to be tied closely with that of the Congress, with the two parties competing for acceptance among the same sections -- from residents of unauthorised colonies to Purvanchalis -- while the BJP continues to draw support from traders and the upper-middle class.

This is where coalition talks come in: Despite their apparent mutual dislike, there has been no outright rejection from the AAP and the Congress that they are in talks to arrive at an ""understanding"" so that the BJP does not romp home once again by taking advantage of the possible vote cutting.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has so far shied away from giving a straight answer -- whenever asked by reporters, he has maintained: ""We will let you know."" He also insists that the AAP will do ""all that is necessary"" to keep the BJP out of power.

Behind the ambiguous statements are hard facts: In 2015, the AAP won with a 54.3% vote share due to the massive dip in the Congress's vote share, which was down to 9.8%. However, in last year's municipal polls, Congress showed signs of revival as it increased its share to 21.09%, while AAP's came down to 26.23%.

On the other hand, the BJP's vote share has remained more or less constant -- 33.07% in the 2015 Assembly polls and 36.23% in the 2017 MCD polls. Only in 2014 had the BJP notched up an impressive share of 44.81%, on the back of a country-wide Modi wave that swept the party to power.

While back-channel talks may or may not yield results, the AAP has been critical of the Congress in public. At rally after rally, Kejriwal tried to drive home the point that voting for the Congress will end up strengthening the BJP. Addressing one such rally in August, he had said that the Delhi Congress has been reduced to a ""vote cutter for the AAP"".

Leaders in the AAP also point to the fact that Delhi will go to Assembly polls in less than a year after the Lok Sabha elections, and any coalition with the Congress in 2019 may end up harming AAP's prospects in 2020.

""What happens in the Lok Sabha elections will also have a bearing on the Assembly polls. Some leaders in AAP are looking at an alliance because arithmetic says both parties together will be able to keep the BJP out of power. But the implications have to be seen in context of the Assembly polls. Will AAP want to align with the very party whose vote bank shifted to it en masse in 2015?"" said a former party leader.

The Delhi Congress, still smarting from the 2015 drubbing, currently under the leadership of Ajay Maken, disapproves of all coalition talks. It has maintained that the AAP is a ""B-team"" of the BJP and that the Kejriwal-led party is ""desperate to stitch an alliance for its own survival"".

Eight years on, 1,500 buses may roll out

For a city that has been waiting for new buses to join its fleet since 2011, the coming year is going to be a crucial one. At least 500 standard-floor buses, with hydraulic lifts to make them accessible to the differently abled, have already got a go-ahead from courts.

Delhi Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot said 1,000 electric buses will also join the close to 6,000 buses on Delhi roads by June. ""The Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System is preparing a feasibility report, after which tenders will be floated,"" he said.

If all goes according to plan, Delhi will become the first Indian city to have such a large electric bus fleet. This will also be key to Delhi's fight against pollution -- according to recent studies by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and TERI, vehicular pollution contributes to over 35% of particulate matter in the city.

With construction of Metro Phase IV getting the green signal, the other gap that remains is providing last-mile connectivity.

Recently, the Delhi Metro tied up with private app-based cab aggregators to fill this gap. However, in an ever-expanding city, buses and a regulated e-rickshaw service are being seen as the only way to make sure people are incentivised to leave their personal vehicles at home and switch to greener modes of travel.

1.4 lakh cameras on streets, 1 lakh in schools

Education and health will be the focus of the Public Works Department (PWD) in 2019. According to a senior PWD official, ""by the end of 2019, the aim is to construct 12,000 additional classrooms in Delhi government schools"".

The department will also begin work on the hotly debated plan to install CCTV cameras inside schools. ""Over 1 lakh cameras will be put inside 726 schools. The project cost has been estimated at Rs 600 crore so far,"" said Sanjeev Rastogi, PWD PRO.

Cameras are also supposed to be installed in public places, such as markets, across the capital. ""The plan is to install 1.4 lakh cameras across the city; the allocated budget is Rs 350 crore,"" Rastogi said.

Also on the agenda is remodelling seven of the 17 government hospitals, and converting 94 dispensaries into polyclinics.

On the traffic front, PWD aims to clear congestion at Shastri Park and Seelampur by building a flyover. ""It's a two-year project to help manage traffic from Shahdara to Kashmere Gate,"" said Rastogi.

Staring at a financial crisis of Rs 3,000 crore, the North and East civic bodies have not undertaken any big projects for 2019, and will instead focus on completing pending projects.

The North Corporation wants to finish multi-level parking projects at Rani Bagh, Shiva Market, Shastri Park, Idgah and Gandhi Maidan to create parking space for 5,000 vehicles.

The East MCD is focusing on Krishna Nagar, Preet Vihar, Geeta Colony, Babarpur and Anand Nagri; and the South MCD on New Friends Colony, Rajouri Garden, Defence Colony and Hauz Khas.

The Army is reaching out to the civilian population under operation 'Sadhbavana' (goodwill) and it had helped the force to build a strong bond with the residents of remote pockets who are facing lot of hardships due to lack of basic facilities, Jammu-based Army PRO Lt Col Devender Anand told PTI.

He said the youth-oriented programmes has touched the hearts and minds of the people as the Army is organizing free coaching classes to help them in their studies, skill development courses, pre-recruitment training and counselling camps and also engaging them in sports activities.

""We have organised over 900 civic action programmes across Jammu region comprising 10 districts this year, benefiting thousands of people.

""The major thrust is on poor population living in the hilly districts especially the youth besides the ex-servicemen who are being educated about the latest schemes being announced from time to time for their welfare and address their problems, the army officer said.

He said this was in addition to the rescue missions undertaken by the force to help accidents victims and those stranded in inaccessible areas during snowfall.""Hundreds of people were rescued and some of them evacuated by choppers to save their lives in the recent past"".

He said the Army has organised 104 medical and veterinary aid camps this year, providing free service to the needy at their door steps.

Thousands of villagers, mostly nomadic shepherds who live in hilly areas, were provided solar lanterns, which brought smiles on their faces, the officer said.

He said the Army has organised dozens of tuition classes for both boys and girls to help them in their studies besides 123 lecture classes and 78 awareness drives were held for the benefit of the youth who were also engaged in sports activities like cricket, football, volleyball and chess competitions.

Last week, Lt Col Anand said said Army started tuition classes for children of rural areas in mountainous Ramban district with a twin objective to help poor students and generate employment for the educated youth.

The three-month long tuition classes were started at different locations including Lower Gund, Cheril, Halemaidan, Batu, Karalchihal, Ukhral and Rajgarh areas, he said.

""The aim of these classes is to impart quality education to children from rural areas who cannot afford private coaching. These classes are being conducted during winter vacations to ensure maximum attendance,"" he said.

He said more than 250 students would be accruing the benefits of quality coaching through this project which also generated employment for educated youths who have been hired as teachers for these coaching classes.

The PRO said the Army gifted gymnasiums and other sports items and also constructed toilets at various educational institutions.

Experts were engaged to deliver lectures on various important issues like women empowerment, health and hygiene, ill effects of drugs, water conservation, road safety, global warming, first aid and the need to maintain communal harmony, he said.

He said various short-term courses in nursing, stitching and awareness drives on career opportunities for girls in armed forces were regularly held for the women.

Over two dozen motivational drives were also undertaken to attract youth to take Army as profession while 37 communal harmony meetings were conducted to bring together various communities and maintain peace in the region, he added.

Although the Uttar Pradesh basic education department has been talking about higher school enrolments, what takes away from their claims is the huge dropout rate witnessed in the state, especially at the elementary level.

Now, a primary school has decided to combat this issue in its own unique way. The school's 'Bal Sansad' is doubling up as the 'Santa squad' this festive season, conducting a door-to-door drive to get back dropouts and classmates who have been irregular.

Students of the primary school in village Lakhesar of Jaunpur district have used this Christmas to make guardians of their former classmates and other irregular students understand the importance of education. In this direction, they have also created a small informative pamphlet that urges parents to send their children to school.

Headmaster Ramesh Chandra Yadav said that one of the reasons why the dropout rate at the school was high was its location. ""The school is situated in a remote part and the terrain is tough. As a result, attendance and retention figures have been suffering.""

However, members of the 'Santa squad' are now out to change this.

Harshit of Class 5, president of the Bal Sansad, Saumya of Class 5, vice president, Vanshi of Class 4, health and hygiene minister, Anshika of Class 4, education minister, Chandni of Class 5, cultural minister and Sohani of Class 4, environment minister, have taken up the responsibility to get students back to school.

""On Christmas Day and since then, we have been going out in the afternoon, with our teachers Shivam Singh and Mukesh Dubey, to convince villagers to send their children to school,"" said Harshit and Saumya.

Chandni and Sohani added that it had been a learning experience for them as well -- convincing elders and classmates on how important it was to attend classes daily.

""In the process, the squad succeeded in bringing back12 students -- 10who had been irregular and two dropouts,"" informed Shivam Singh, teacher.

Appreciating the idea of forming a 'Santa squad', village head Nisha Tiwari has promised to help the school improve its infrastructure, including construction of better toilets and getting a projector to facilitate lectures. ""With her help, the school will soon have new and better facilities,"" said a teacher.

The headmaster said that the goal of the 'Santa squad' wasto build confidence among students and guardians, strengthen teacher-student relationship, create a positive atmosphere for promoting education, and improve student retention and attendance.

According to available data, the Net Enrolment Rate (NER) in UP at the elementary level is 79.86% -- 9 percentage points lower than the all India average of 88.94%. The state has an annual dropout rate of 8.58% at the primary level -- the 6th highest in the country and more than double the all India average of 4.13%. Also, the state's primary to upper-primary transition rate of 79.1% is the 4th lowest in the country -- 11.04 percentage points below the national average of 90.14%."

(HT File)

With some school headmasters (HMs) dragging their feet over paying penalties for allegedly inflating attendance of students, the Bihar government has finally decided to recover fines by deducting the amount from their salary.

The HMs allegedly spiked attendance of students to claim more funds under the mid-day meal(MDM) programme.

Though the government received reports of irregularities long ago and imposed financial penalty on HMs, the fines could not be fully recovered. Many of the HMs moved court for relief citing their unwanted involvement in non-academic work, while others were just indifferent.

The government has ordered the recovery of a Rs8.68-crore penalty from HMs. Of which, Rs 4.21-crore (48%) has been recovered. More than 1,000 HMs have allegedly fudged the data since 2013, when the idea of penalty was first mooted by the state education department.

RK Mahajan, principal secretary of the department of education, recently directed all district programme officers (DPOs) to deduct the penalty amount from headmasters' salary in five instalments over as many months.

""The DPOs must ensure a monthly deduction from all those who have not deposited the penalty amount within a month of the receipt of the letter, except those who have got stay from the court,"" stated a letter by Mahajan.

""During inspections, the attendance of that particular day in the school and the average of the previous week is matched. If the deviation is within 10%, there is no issue. However, if the deviation is above 10%, a penalty equivalent to the amount given in the last three months is imposed on the headmaster,"" said Vinod Kumar Singh, director of the mid-day meal programme, .

Another official said that in several cases, the accused HMs with the help of their association approached the Patna high court or the Lokayukta, claiming that they were overburdened with non-academic work like management of MDM. The court has also asked the government to find an alternative to free teachers from MDM responsibilities.

Though the Bihar government tried to hand over MDM to NGOs or self-help groups (SHGs) and also ran pilot projects, a viable alternative has not been found because of the scale of the programme. In Bihar, despite a drop in enrolment numbers, 1.20 crore students from Class 1 to Class 8 are estimated to avail MDM daily.

In a Niti Ayog meeting a few months ago, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar advocated the direct benefit transfer for the centre's flagship MDM programme to plug leakages. ""Cooking in schools has a direct bearing on education. Instead of centres of learning, schools are viewed as centres of food. Poor quality and unhygienic conditions often lead to unpleasant incidents,"" he had said.

However, to achieve this, the Centre would have to change the policy at the national level, which seems unlikely. Bihar, on its part, has been seriously mulling the option of handing over MDM to women SHGs, which are 8 lakh in the state, the highest in the country. A pilot project has been launched in one block each of Jehanabad and Muzaffarpur to assess the feasibility."

Under this component, such information as students' registration, admission, attendance, internal assessment and all activities related to examinations, including filling up of examination forms, payment of examination fee, fixation of examination centres, distribution of admit cards, publication of examination results, mark sheets, certificates and degrees would have to be digitized.

All the colleges and postgraduate departments of different universities would have to ensure complete digitization of pre-examination and post-examination tasks well within time with a view to maintaining the academic calendar.

From February 02, our party would be launching a state-wide drive during which signatures of one crore citizens will be collected endorsing our charter of demands. A truckload of papers containing these documents would then be sent to the Chief Ministers residence, the RLSP chief who has now joined the Mahagathbandhan comprising parties like the RJD and the Congress said.

The drive is mainly aimed at raising awareness among the people that government schools have, in the recent years, become incapable of providing good education for want of competent teachers. We do not have any hopes from the Chief Minister but the signed documents will be sent to his doorsteps so that he gets a taste of his own medicine, Kushwaha said.

He was referring to an exercise undertaken by Nitish Kumar during the 2015 assembly polls when in response to Prime Minister Narendra Modis DNA remark he had sent samples of nails and hair of Biharis to New Delhi.

The issues raised in the charter of demands are, nevertheless, of paramount importance. I can promise that all these demands would be fulfilled if the Mahagathbandhan is voted to power in the next assembly polls, Kushwaha declared.

Teachers headed for battle with 'undemocratic' VC

The administrative regime is simply following the government's policy of rampant privatisation of public resources. Such a process is anti-democratic in its imagination and punitive in approach.

Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) is now in a new phase of life. Known as 'comply or perish' to us insiders, not a day passes without the administration issuing some circular demanding ""compliance"" from the faculty or students of the university.

Since most of these demands range from the absurd to the counterproductive, like enforcing students and faculty attendance or arbitrarily rescheduling the academic calendar, most do not comply. Often the faculty, after protracted discussions in the general body meetings of the teachers association, resorts to different modes of protesting this compliance enforcement raj. These protests are then promptly followed by threats and punitive action meant to ""discipline"" the 'non-compliant' - much in the fashion of bullies and thugs. These range from petty and vindictive methods - like docking leave and not processing medical papers - to issuing legal instruments like show-cause notices.

Legal threats are usually issued to just a few, perhaps with the aim of frightening the many. More importantly, issuing more than 150 notices at any given time also exposes the well-known fact that most in the university are opposed to the administration and find laughable the constant threat of disciplinary action against those who refuse to cow down. Those not in JNU or any other university in the country do not immediately understand what is being undertaken here.

Some even wonder why the JNU faculty and students seem to continuously be in protest mode. There are two ways of responding to this. Let's begin with the counterfactual.

Why did the university not witness this kind of anti-administration protest prior to February 2016? The answer is simple: because such anti-academic and anti-university measures had never been attempted by the administration prior to 2016. The present VC and his administrative coterie are not simply undoing every functioning structure of JNU, they are vandalising the idea of the university.

Here, the second reason to understand JNU's protests becomes important. The faculty has consistently stated that the changes being made to the university's structure are not only unnecessary, but also in repeated violation of ordinances and the very Act of parliament that created it. The ongoing protests demonstrate the present administration's consummate disregard for democratic procedures and well-established conventions, which is deeply injurious to every aspect of the university.

Why are the demands - be it marking of daily attendance (soon to be biometric) or online entrance examinations, followed by threats and punishments exemplifying the worst kinds of managerial practices?

The answer, once again, is obvious. Privatising a public university requires that its very character be changed completely. JNU was created as a research university in 1970, and has always maintained a very special character. It has provided a very high standard of higher education to students from different regions of India, belonging to any social or economic strata, at minimal cost.

The decades following its creation saw at least two kinds of developments in the university. One was a very high quality of research output, both of the faculty and of young researchers. This also helped in creating many generations of teachers who are presently employed in colleges and universities in India and abroad.

The other was an organic emergence of an extraordinary university culture that synthesised the intellectual and the political - enabling students not only to find their feet as scholars, but also articulate their selfhood as citizens. Students in JNU have historically debated everything from American imperialism, the many failures of the Indian state, to what the university itself ought to be.

The ability to knit this criticality into the very fibre of the university, by creating a space for student engagement in institutional processes (through department level student-faculty committees, or students union representation in boards of study or the Academic Council meetings), is what made JNU a truly democratic university.

The new tightly-managed and privatised university will not have space for any of this. We can already get glimpses of this in numerous such universities that have mushroomed all over the country. At the outset, they have a prohibitive fee structure that will keep out hundreds of brilliant, though poor and marginalised students, for whom higher education will become unaffordable.

Even ordinary middle class families will not be able to afford such an education. Besides, many new private universities have a biometric attendance system in place; they also do not permit any of its members - faculty, students or the non-teaching staff - to form unions. Contract structures are also beginning to reflect how the private is different from the public - at its most worrying, differential pay scales are being put in place - which will eventually create salary-driven divisions between colleagues appointed at the same level. This will also occur between Indians and non-Indian faculty.

The carrot usually dangled in front of the faculty is that they will have the space to create their own courses. For those of us quite used to doing so for decades in a public university like JNU, the stick that accompanies this privilege seems more like a police baton.

Inherent violence in government-led privatisation of public resources

The present administrative regime is simply following the current government's policy of rampant privatisation of public resources. Such a process is perforce managerial and anti-democratic in its imagination. The JNU instance makes clear that compliance enforcement and punitive measures are knitted into its very approach.

The only unexpected element in this is how JNU's university community - its students and faculty - have resisted all attempts at this wanton destruction of a nationally important public institution. They have not succumbed to the management's speak of becoming ""stakeholders""; they know what the stakes are, and continue to fight back as a community of scholars.

The battle for JNU's survival matters not only to those who work or study there - it has grave implications for the intellectual and political future of the country. Public higher education is a democratic right of all Indians. It is precisely for this reason that all who care about India's future, and wish to make it safe from ugly corporatisation or bigoted cultural agendas, must fight for the survival of the public university."

According to a report by The Epoch Times, students at more than 10 schools in Guizhou Province, one of China's poorer provinces, as well as the neighboring Guangxi region now have to wear ""intelligent uniforms,"" which are embedded with electronic chips that track their movements.

The 'smart' uniforms help school officials, teachers, and parents track the movements of students in real-time, Lin Zongwu, principal of the No. 11 School of Renhuai in Guizhou Province, told the state-run newspaper Global Times on December 20. If students skip school without permission, an alarm will be triggered.

The uniforms have a host of other features including alerting appropriate authorities if a student falls asleep in class, as well as letting parents monitor what their kids' are buying and even setting spending limits.

More Black Mirror-ish is the tracking technology being embedded into the uniforms with databases being set up to match each uniform to each student's face, with facial-recognition equipment being installed at school entrances that can match a student's face with the chip embedded in the uniform. This is to prevent students from exchanging uniforms or trying to manipulate the system.

According to authorities, attendance in schools has seen a surge since the new tech has been implemented now that students are aware that their every movement is being tracked.

While this may sound more and more like a police state's gambit, Chinese officials insist that it is part of the country's emphasis on digital education and smart campuses.

On its official website, Guizhou Guanyu, the firm that designs the chips and embeds, explains that it was established ""to respond to the country's and the Communist Party's call"" for the application of ""smart school campuses""."

Jashn-e-Rekhta, an organisation dedicated to the preservation and promotion of the Urdu language, its literature and culture, recently concluded its 5th edition in Delhi last week. Jashn-e-Rekhta, which literally means 'the festival of Urdu', has been extremely successful in attracting huge audiences to its events built around Urdu. The popularity of the event has led to the establishment of another organization, Rang-e-Rekhta, curated by the Rekhta Foundation, which takes the success of Urdu to other cities. So far it has held three events in Chandigarh, Jaipur and Gurugram.

This apparent success of Urdu also raises an important question about the de facto status of Urdu in India. Scholarly studies show that Urdu has suffered marginalisation and that its social landscape is shrinking. Against this backdrop, many claim that the success of Jashn marks the revival of the Urdu language and literature. For instance, the Bollywood artist Javed Jaffrey said: ""Urdu khatre mein nahin hai, Urdu to qatre qatre mein hai (Urdu is not in danger; Urdu is actually in every drop)."" This pithy line received a round of applause from the audience. Tanweer Ahmad of the Urdu Qaumi Awaz made it into a headline.

Similar claims were made at the end of the 2017 Jashn festival. Malini Nayar of the Times of India dismissed the idea that Urdu was dying. She too echoed the jubilation and enthusiasm about Urdu's revival with her headline, 'Urdu language is not only alive but rocking.' Urdu newspapers followed suit. The Siasat Daily published a report on the role of Jashn in reviving Urdu with the headline, 'Jashn-e-Rekhta has proved that Urdu is not only alive but is creating waves'. Twitter resonated with the excitement of revival too.

Such views about its 'revival' and 'resurgence' overlook the ground reality that Urdu is actually in sharp decline in North India, especially in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, considered its traditional strongholds. Clearly, if there is a revival, it will mean that the young generation, who will be the carriers of the language, is learning it. The attendance at a Jashn festival or a mushaira or a qawwali is not an indicator of the revival of a language.

Sudha Pai, a scholar of political science, notes that other than the two Urdu medium schools run by Aligarh Muslim University, there is not one single primary or junior high school in the whole of UP where Urdu is fully the medium of instruction . The symbolic second language status accorded to Urdu by the UP government has not arrested its decline either. The recommendations of Gujral Committee (1975), the Ale Ahmad Suroor Committee (1979), and the Ali Sardar Jafri Committee (1990) to revive and popularise Urdu have never been implemented.

The situation of Urdu teaching in Delhi is no less gloomy. As per an RTI filed in 2013, a whopping 73% of posts for Urdu teachers within Delhi government schools are vacant. This despite the fact that Urdu has been granted the second official language status in Delhi. Furthermore, 74 out of 80 textbooks needed in Urdu schools were not available in the market. The result was an abnormally high failure rate in Urdu schools in Delhi.

For the claim of Urdu revival to be true, it follows that the young generation has the opportunity to learn its script as well. This point was stressed by Gulzar, the legendary Bollywood figure in the 2017 Rekhta festival. A declining proficiency in the Urdu script can be seen in the mushrooming of Urdu books transliterated into Devanagari found in Urdu Bazar, Old Delhi. Urdu in Devanagari has emerged as a response to the lack of proficiency in the script among the younger generation of speakers in Delhi and UP.

Another indicator of its decline in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi is the loss of the pronunciation of Urdu sounds, especially /kh̲/,/gh̲/, and /q/, as in kh̲uda (God) gh̲alat (wrong) and qalam (pen) respectively. Considered the shibboleths of Urdu as a language, the young generation is increasingly non-observant of these sounds. The decline interestingly is also visible in the pronunciation of words in Bollywood songs; the new generation of singers pronounce words containing these sounds using the Hindi pronunciation norms.

So what does the success of Jashn festival actually mean? In my view, it says little about the 'health' of the language and more about the marketing of the event. First of all, utilising the linkages between Urdu and popular culture, they have successfully galvanised Bollywood celebrities to promote it. Not all the Bollywood stars who have graced the Jashn are stars of Urdu language and literature. But they are all big crowd pullers.

Secondly, on the socio-political front, Urdu is no longer a force to reckon with as it has lost its battle for survival in North India. Such events are, therefore, aimed at the elite - especially the English educated ones. The first few editions did not have the Jashn-e-Rekhta written in Urdu. The recent ones did include the Urdu script. However, the schedules were available only in English. The big 'I LOVE URDU' cut-out where the youth were seen taking pictures was only in English. Both speak volumes about the targeted audience.

The English-speaking elite, however, has not embraced Urdu as it is. This elite has a romanticised and orientalised view of the language of love, beauty, politeness, tahzeeb and romance. Contrary to this, for its traditional speakers, Urdu is a world of myriad lived experiences which include, but are not limited to, love, romance and politeness. For them, Urdu is as much about love (mohabbat) as it is about revolt and revolution (inqilab). The new admirers of Urdu may not know that Urdu has some of the strongest expletives as well.

The success of Jashn-e-Rekhta, then, seems to be analogous to the popularity of sarson ka saag and makke ki roti in elite hotels and restaurants where the dish is an exotica - an occasional item on the menu rather than a lived experience of a villager. For the non-Urdu elites, it is more a matter of yaadgaar - something memorable, butwhich also means an old building - than a matter of rozgaar, or employment."

It was in 2010 that Delhi's Shri Ram School Maths and Computer Science teacher Sujata Sahu first went on a trip to Ladakh. It was a solo trek, and on the third day, she began to face extreme difficulty breathing and walking. The low oxygen in the altitudes as high as 16,100 feet had given her Pulmonary Edema.

She needed to rest, and with the help of two passing trekkers, she decided to spend the night at a remote village --

""A village which has no road access, is reachable only after a day's walk, and one which boasted of just one home with three occupants. I had neither medicines, nor the ability to call my family, nor access to medical care,"" says 50-year-old Sahu, a resident of Gurugram.

In was in these conditions that she saw two tiny schools which totally changed her life.

The first primary school -- Sku-Kaya -- had five students and two teachers. It had two rooms which were being rebuilt. While one teacher had stayed in the village, the other had gone to Leh to get uniforms and mid-day meal supplies for the school.

The second school had eight children and three teachers. It was two of them who had stopped to help Sahu when she was feeling sick. They had been walking back to Leh for textbooks and uniforms

The children were being taught from English books, which was very alien to them as they had no electricity or TV or telephone connectivity and thus, had no idea what the outside world was like. Having never set foot out of their villages, the exposure level of these children was very low.

.In Ladakh, even the summer months were bitingly cold but that didn't stop the kids from coming to school to learn. ""One of the children even brought his little brother along, who was barely two years old and the love and care with which all the children and the teacher took care of the child was a lesson for me,"" says Sahu.

What really hit her on that fateful Ladakh trip was the sheer drive of the Ladakhi people there to keep growing and improving their circumstances.

""Their determination to come to school and learn, the eagerness of the teacher to learn something new to teach his students, and the aspiration of the parents to educate their children was my inspiration to drop everything and help these amazing people,"" says Sahu.

From a regular school teacher to Ladakh's 'Iron Lady'

""My experience with the schools in Ladakh gave me a path to follow, one that I knew I could contribute to,"" says Sujata Sahu, who had spent 12 years in the corporate world before starting to work with children.

But she had been working at the Shri Ram School for just two years at the time, and leaving this job was the hardest decision she had to make in her life.

""I was planning to take on a seemingly herculean task, in possibly one of the toughest terrains of the world. I had no idea about where I would get the funds from and was also not very clear on how much of an impact I alone could make,"" she says.

Moreover, no one had done something like this before her in Ladakh. But thankfully, she found with herself two strong founding partners -- her husband, Sandeep Sahu, who had been trekking in the region for almost 35 years, and Dawa Jora, a Ladakhi businessman, all of whom had the strong conviction that something like this was really needed for the region.

In 2011, unable to find other NGOs to partner with, the three founders went on a three-day trek to one of the most isolated villages in Lingshed (in Ladakh), carrying 1500 kg of education material on 25 horses, and crossing three mountains at extreme temperatures as low as minus 15 degrees.

The treacherous and steep pass they crossed at an altitude of almost 17000 ft inspired the name of the '17000 ft foundation'.

As she started off on her mission to provide Ladakh schools with the right resources to further the education of their students, she realised this wouldn't be very easy.

""One of our biggest challenges was convincing corporates that even remote areas with extremely scattered and small populations needed support,"" says Sahu.

For the first two years, the foundation worked only with the founders' own funds and kind contributions of friends and family members.

""Though no non-profit organisations were willing to take on Ladakh as a region, we were given support in the form of knowledge, pedagogy and even a large donation of books for our first 100 libraries,"" she says.

Sujata Sahu's undying passion to help the people of Ladakh earned her the nickname of the 'Iron Lady'.

How Ladakh poses a unique set of education problems

India is a geographical anomaly as it has every type of topographical setup, each of which comes with its own challenges. This makes it extremely difficult for the government to cater to every type of problem that can arise in this vast country owing to accessibility issues, extreme weather conditions etc.

Ladakh has almost a 1000 schools across Leh and Kargil, spread across 60,000 sq km of harsh mountains. Catering to a school going population of under 40,000 children, the average school strength of these schools is barely 25 students across the two districts, explains Sahu.

Teachers themselves come from remote villages and have to travel long distances for training, school supplies and even basic administrative functions, leading to long absences and shortage of staff, she adds.

Also, ""While teachers are given basic residential training during winters as well as in-service training, most of the trainings are not contextualized for the uniqueness of the Ladakhi education system,"" she says.

The extreme weather also adds to the problems with schools being shut for severe winters for three months in a year when the roads become inaccessible due to thick snow and temperatures as low as minus 35-40 degrees.

""Incredibly, despite the remoteness of the region, every little hamlet which has even 10 school going children has a tiny government school with teachers in attendance, thanks to the local administration. A little wonder then, that 89% of the schools in Ladakh are govt schools with the private schools present in just a handful of the larger villages,"" she says.

""What is commendable is that all these 900 plus schools are functional and have qualified teachers in attendance. What is even more remarkable is that every child in every village goes to school, managing to at least complete middle school,"" Sahu adds

However, it is only the larger villages which have middle schools and after passing class 5, children have to walk around two hours to get to school to continue their education. Public transport isn't available in such terrain and the army provides army vans for commuting.

.Despite the presence of these govt schools, the community here wants a better life and quality education for their children so they can get better jobs. This aspiration makes them send their very young children, often as young as three years old, to be enrolled in private schools, often extremely far away from their homes.

""Cut off from their villages and parents for months in a year, these children grow up in dormitories, hostels or with other families. Lacking the care and guidance they need in their growing up years, this leads to large-scale dropouts and a population of youth who are unable to go back to their villages,"" Sahu explains.

17000 ft works in these remote villages by improving existing govt schools so that parents would have faith in them and stop sending their children away so far that it disconnects them from their roots.

How voluntourism is helping 17000 ft foundation grow

Sujata Sahu started her non-profit organisation with just the founders and a few volunteers who were given the task to survey the entire length and breadth of Ladakh.

The team mapped around 600 schools after a seven-month-long study. Some of these schools had been bomb shelters during the Kargil war and the buildings had to be shifted multiple times.

The success of the volunteer programmes helped the foundation grow and each of these schools has been geo-mapped for travellers to find.

""We, very early on, piloted our volunteering programmes to involve outsiders in the work of our organization and to also understand if people could be encouraged to donate to such a cause. The enthusiasm and support shown by complete strangers told us that we were on the right track,"" says Sahu.

""Our volunteers, who are our brand ambassadors, then carried the story of our work into their workplaces and CSR then became our main source of funding. Voluntourism, as it is called today, still forms a good 25% of our annual budget and helps us maintain our backend costs,"" she adds.

Why playgrounds are so important in Ladakh schools

Though the govt schools all over Ladakh have proper buildings, they lack the proper facilities that make a school a happy, joyous and welcoming place for children. And in a remote location with rugged ground, a playground comes as a blessing.

""In these remote villages, where nothing is available, there are absolutely no options for children to play with. Though these schools have well-qualified teachers and very low pupil-teacher-ratio, parents often judge the performance of a school based just on the facilities they provide,"" says Sahu.

Thus, parents see the existence of a playground in govt schools as a very good incentive to not send away their kids to far-off private schools.

""Today, 17000 ft foundation has setup playgrounds in 140 schools with colourful swings, slides, see saws etc. many of which the team had to carry over horseback for days to reach our remotest schools,"" she says.

Solving the problem of no native language storybooks in Ladakh

A big aspect of Ladakh education that surprised Sujata Sahu was how the kids learned in English medium schools even though they have no exposure to the foreign language. Their native language was Bhoti.

""To add to this burden, children also have to study their local language as well an additional Hindi/Urdu from grade 1,"" says Sahu.

To enable the children to read better and get comfortable with the number of languages they have to deal with, 17000 ft set up libraries in 230 schools with simple and easy to read story books in English, Hindi and Urdu.

""However, sadly, there are absolutely no story books in Bhoti for children to read. Sensing this gap, we undertook a mission to translate storybooks from English to Bhoti.""

""In 2015, we launched our first phase where we translated 21 titles and published 21,000 storybooks for distribution into 300 schools,"" says Sahu.

This year again, the organisation not only translated another 20 titles, but also added illustrations and changed narratives to make them more relatable to the children of Ladakh.

What has 17000 ft foundation achieved so far?

In the span of just six years, Sujata Sahu's organisation has accomplished much.

""Today, 17000 ft works with 250 govt schools across Leh and Kargil and we are already seeing a reverse trend of children coming back from private schools back to the govt schools in their villages,"" says Sahu.

The organisation has set up libraries in 230 schools, playgrounds in 140 schools, and trained over 1500 teachers in various methodologies with a team which is in Ladakh every winter for training teachers.

17000 ft foundation has conducted multiple community workshops in 125 villages with over 10,000 villagers contributing to our workshops and programmes in the schools.

Recently, the organisation electrified and digitized 120 schools in Leh and Kargil, providing solar electricity and tablets with customized digital learning content, a TV, and a server to provide offline data syncing.

The DigiLab project is the non-profit's most ambitious programme bringing offline hybrid digital learning solutions to the remote villages.

The well-furnished digital labs supported by workshops from the team throughout the year can help the students learn independently with guidance from their teachers.

How crowfunding is helping 17000 ft foundation

Crowdfunding is increasingly coming up as a very important resource collection measure.

""17000 ft has been involved with ImpactGuru.com in multiple projects, the latest being the funding of a Playground for a very remote school in Kargil. We had also fundraised for our Bhoti Book Translation project through ImpactGuru.com and managed to raise more than we needed,"" says Sahu.

Fundraising platforms are great for helping nonprofits fund small projects that have tangible goals and timelines. It is an excellent way to help get the word out to potential supporters and garner more support for the non-profit, says the Iron Lady of Ladakh.

Future of 17000 ft foundation

Before 17000 ft was established, there was little or no attention on the remote schools of Ladakh, and today with all our work and efforts and the participation of the local communities, govt schools are looking and performing better and we are seeing a reverse trend of children coming back to their villages and govt schools.

""When we started, one of our biggest challenges was encouraging donors, volunteers, foundations and even corporates to focus on remote regions of Ladakh. Today, however, we are confident that our model is working and we can get the support we need,"" beams Sahu.

Sujata Sahu now wants to take this model to other remote and mountainous regions, like Arunachal Pradesh, or the remote areas of Himachal.

""We feel that we are closer now to our vision of a better life and education for all children, regardless of geography or terrain,"" she says.

Last week, I happened to meet one of my fair weather friend on way to college, who often boosts about his own achievements without giving other person a chance to speak about his own.

That day I was carrying a fiction novel in my hand to have a read while traveling, so he began his usual discourse about culture of reading books in contemporary times and without wasting any time he jumped to his own habit of self-praise and proclaimed with some confidence and authority that I have read this novel three years-ago and have almost hundred books of fiction in my library.

I was surprised on hearing his statement and shrugged in negative to negate his lie as said book had been published just one year back and when I asked for proof about his library, within no time he dragged smartphone from his pant pocket,drew a pattern lock to unlock Kindle which housed almost thousands eBook's.

So, this was his library the so called e-library about which he boosted.

To check the credentials of his reading, I enquired about the content of few books, he felt flat like tyre in his answers and knew nothing about them.

From that saga, I concluded that technology has not only outsmarted us scientifically but also bankrupted us morally like lying the way my friend did.

I am one of those guys who still considers library as his second home and I still prefer to spent hard earned bucks on buying hardcover books rather than availing the same book as eBooks free of cost on internet.

I still believe no matter how smart the technology is, e-libraries can't replace four walled libraries and it has been proven scientifically that reading from books leaves deeper imprint on our brain than reading same from LCD screens of mobile phones. Thus, we tend to remember things if we read it from books rather than from eBook's.

Cutting long story short the question which begs the answer is why don't our libraries act like magnets to pull readers towards itself?

The answer is very simple. We have created such a culture in our surroundings which doesn't motivate readers to explore libraries like it used to be in yesteryears.

Take an example of our district libraries. The person who happens to be caretaker of these libraries is not an expert of library sciences instead a class IV employees have been employed to handle these district libraries, who don't have any knowledge about managing these libraries thus they often end up creating mess the manner in which they mix books of different categories which should have been on separate shelves.

Those people who hold professional degrees in library sciences are working as clerks, VLW, storekeepers etc, it is clear cases of disguised unemployment.

In our educational institutions especially colleges, which have separate buildings for library present altogether a sad story with very low attendance of students using library facilities.

Although, these libraries are constantly updated with latest books and encyclopaedia's yet empty benches in library is usual image in our library reading rooms.

Academic syllabus is designed in such a way that it hardly encourages students to go through various books in libraries to enhance knowledge.

Instead our students have developed a habit of reading one book culture (guidebook)to pass the examination by cramming syllabus at eleventh hour of examination.

The onus here lies also on teachers as they act like role models for students who follow them like shadow in getting good habits.

So teachers need to use library themselves then only they can preach students about advantages of library reading. Also assignments should be designed in such a way which compels students to go through various books.

One of the examples of advantage of having good and updated library is Aligarh Muslim University. Majority of students prefer to go to Aligarh for competitive exam preparation all because of Maulana Azad library as it provides 24 *7 reading facility under one roof,but its irony our college run like aganwadis from 10 to 4 which discourages readers.

Hardly do our libraries department organise book festivals (melas)at district levels in which they could have invited national level publishers to settle stalls to make books of every category available under one roof at concession rates that would have certainly worked for good of libraries.

Need of an hour is that our libraries should evolve themselves as per demand of times to outsmart technology this is only possible if specialists are recruited and if proper resources and requirement are utilised to bring it back on track of progress."

""It was also informed that in case the protest is undertaken within 100 meters of the administrative block and academic complexes, appropriate action will be taken as per the University Rules and Regulations,"" the notice said.

The Karnataka legislative assembly was adjourned ""sine die"" Friday amid pandemonium as BJP members continued with their protest from the Well, seeking clarity from the government on the farm loan waiver scheme.

BJP members also demanded that Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy apologise to Leader of Opposition B S Yeddyurappa for his comments against the former chief minister during the debate.

As the House met for the day, BJP members squatted in the well of the House, shouting slogans such as ""down down to the anti-farmer government"", ""loan waiver should be implemented"".

However, amidst the din, the assembly passed three bills, following which Speaker Ramesh Kumar adjourned the House sine die.

The bills that were passed on Friday include, The Karnataka Legislature (Prevention of Disqualification) (Amendment) Bill, 2018, aimed at making provision to exempt the post of political secretary to the chief minister from incurring disqualification for being a member of the assembly or council, when he is appointed to the post.

Also passed was the Karnataka Civil Service (Procedure for Selection of Candidates during Recruitment) Bill, 2018, that provides for restoring a rule, wherein candidates belonging to reserved category securing high marks in KPSC exams would find themselves in the general merit list besides enjoying reservation benefits they are entitled to.

It was aimed at circumventing a High Court order that quashed the rule.

The BJP has been protesting from the Well since Wednesday evening seeking clarity from Kumaraswamy on loan waiver and the exact day by which debt-free certificates would be issued to the farmers.

They also wanted him to apologise to Yeddyurappa for accusing him of ""colluding"" with nationalised banks, who are now non-committal on their earlier one-time settlement offer to NPA accounts.

Kumaraswamy on Thursday had said he would not apologise as demanded by the BJP.

After the session, Speaker Ramesh Kumar told reporters that extra care was given to certain issues with respect to facilities provided to officials and public representatives during their stay in Belagavi.

He said, ""We are not happy about huge money that was spent last time, so we tried curtailing on it while not compromising on quality.""

""Compared to last year, we have been able to reduce the spending by about Rs 8 crore-10 crore this time.... last year according to information that I have, it had gone up to Rs 20 crore-22 crore,"" he said.

The speaker said he was ""pained"", as special discussion on issues relating to North Karnataka region, on transporting of sand, among other important things,could not be discussed due to ruckus, and had ""personal regret"" for it.

He also noted that attendance of MLAs during the session has ""by far improved"" this time.

Belagavi in north Karnataka, bordering Mahrarashtra has been hosting legislature session once a year since 2006 when the move was initiated by the JD(S)-BJP coalition government, with Kumaraswamy as its chief Minister.

""It was the first day of the exams and we feared that the students, who have been barred from taking the exams, might create trouble.

The school was invited for lunch in the village. The lunch was arranged with the elders in attendance, and the whole community present. The public (government) primary school was doing good work, led by its lone teacher, Sachin. It's his fire that had changed the school.

At the door of the house where the lunch was arranged, some of the students were told not to enter, but sit outside and eat. These children were from Dalit families. Sachin spoke to the organizers. He wanted that there be no discrimination; in the school there was none. The organizers would not let the Dalit children eat with those from ""upper caste"" families inside the house. The teacher did not relent. As the argument escalated, he decided to stop the lunch. Either all of them ate together or they would go back to the school. Frantic negotiations started among the organizers. In the end, the kids sat together.

This teacher is an exception. Even those who never discriminate between their students on any ground inside the school find it hard to take the battle out of the school. They and their students face such conflicts daily, on every dimension of prejudice and discrimination -- caste, gender, religion, poverty and more. This is not a trivial issue. We expect school education to play a crucial role in developing an equal society. But the school is fully embedded in this very world of discrimination. Teachers have to have the understanding and the courage to battle this inside the school and outside. What can support and enable the teacher, to develop this understanding, and have the tenacity to fight these battles day on day?

On a hot September evening, 53 teachers were watching the television screen showing Shyam Benegal's Samvidhan. The room in the government upper primary school was about 600 sq. ft, and sweltering. My colleague Ravi was running the third episode of the 10-part series on the screen. The full series was scheduled to be screened on 10 consecutive days. This was in a small town called Dhorimana. This is 55km from Barmer, Rajasthan.

Ravi would pause the show at crucial moments, throwing a question at the gathering. There is a particularly poignant moment when Rajkumari Amrit Kaur and Hansa Mehta discuss the depth of patriarchy that even they have to face. Ravi paused the show and asked, ""How are things today, almost 70 years after the Constitution?"" It sparked a furore. There were 10 women in the room. But the debate was not divided along the lines of gender. A few men admitted that despite progress in these 70 years, patriarchy and gender discrimination were alive, even within themselves. The discussion moved to caste and then to religion. A minority confessed to the seams of discrimination and prejudice running on all these dimensions. Ravi brought it to a close; the intention was to light a few sparks, not to conclude.

The next time he stopped was after an intense segment where B.R. Ambedkar, Alladi Krishnaswamy Iyer, Syama Prasad Mukherjee and others debate the right to freedom of expression. Till one man spoke, seemingly there was agreement that we had secured freedom of expression for all in the past 70 years. He said, ""What about that woman Gauri Lankesh? She was killed for expressing her views, wasn't she?"" I was surprised to hear that in Dhorimana. But it did spark a fiery 15 minutes. Ravi managed to end the session, without the intensity going down, but with no animosity remaining.

Thirty-five teachers attended the show across the 10 days on an average, with a low of 20 and a high of 58. They came because they were interested, there was no order or incentive. It was an intense 10 days of exploring the Constitution. All in the context of the reality that they live in. Much after the 10 days had ended, we asked the teachers the value of Festival of the Constitution. Understanding the Constitution was only a part of it. The real matter was the discovery of like-minded colleagues. A peer network, which could provide sorely needed support on conflict-ridden matters. This sense that there was someone close to you was a spur for action in the school and outside.

Policies and curriculum mostly enable the teacher. But that is inconsequential, when confronting all this within her community and social relationships. There are those few like Sachin who may have the inherent courage. Many of even those wilt over time. Most who would like to battle discrimination find it hard to act, even within the school.

These biases are deeply ingrained in our society. The question to ask of ourselves is: What supports the teacher (or anyone else) in her daily life in the quest for our Constitutions' ideals? There doesn't seem to be much. Most of those who battle to bring our Constitution to life, in the Dhorimanas of this country, feel alone. They need not, because they are not really alone in Dhorimana. Once they get talking, they build a coalition for the Constitution. But this has to be done, it doesn't happen on its own. We cannot await Godot, we have to do this ourselves."

The oath taking ceremony of chief minister-designate Ashok Gehlot and his deputy, Sachin Pilot, will be held against the backdrop of the majestic Albert hall. This will be for the first time that a new government would be sworn-in at the Albert Hall.

Sources inform that decision regarding the venue was taken after a meeting held at the residence of chief minister designate Ashok Gehlot in which the senior bureaucrats and party officials were present.

The decision was taken after the highcourt gave permission to the government to hold the ceremony at Janpath, albeit with some conditions. It has, however, given an option that the ceremony could be conducted at the Amrudon ka Bagh which is off-limits for public events.

Preparations have been started by government departments on a war-footing at the Albert Hall since late evening. It will be a big task for PWD and other departments to prepare for the ceremony at such a short notice. This will be a historic oath taking ceremony and congress president Rahul Gandhi is expected to be a witness the event.

Hence, the officials are not taking any chances and are making elaborate plans for the formal ceremony. Supporters of both Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot will be coming to Jaipur to witness this grand event. Large number of Congress workers are expected to arrive in Jaipur.

On previous two occasions, Gehlot had taken oath at ceremonies held at the Rajbhawan. However, till Saturday evening, the matter was being heard in the court where the government pleaded for permission to hold the ceremony at Janpath.

Notably, the High Court had a few months back, banned all such public functions and political events at Amrudon ka Bagh and nearby places after the teachers felicitation programme, which was held on September 5, led to massive inconvenience to the public.

In a suo-moto decision, the division bench of justices Manish Bhandari and DC Somani had issued notices to the government and the police directing them to stop organising public programmes at the Ambedkar Circle, including the Amrudon Ka Bagh.

The trend of celebrations at the Janpath was started by the former chief minister Vasundhara Raje government when she took oath on the assembly premises in front of a swell crowd. Visitors were then seated along the Janpath that leads to the Vidhan Sabha where an entire battery of BJP leaders, including Narendra Modi and outgoing chief minister Ashok Gehlot was also in attendance."
