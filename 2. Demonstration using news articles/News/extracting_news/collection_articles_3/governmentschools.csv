(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). With effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions.

The Samagra Shiksha scheme focuses on improvement of quality of education by providing support for different interventions like; in-service training of teachers and schools heads, conduct of achievement surveys at National and State level, provision of textbooks as per Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, ICT and digital initiatives, vocational education, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment has been increased and from this year provisions for library grants and grants for sports and physical education have also been introduced.

The Government has also launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities.

e PATHSHALA: a single point repository of e ­resources containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-­print materials.

The Central Government, supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme namely 'Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat' (PBBB) in foundational years of schooling.

(iii) MHRD, has launched a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform popularly known as SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) on 9 July, 2017. The portal is offering various online courses for school education and higher education. NCERT has been developing course modules for Massive Open and Online Course (MOOCs) for school education system in 12 subject areas (Accountancy, business studies, biology, chemistry, economic, history, geography, mathematics, physics, political science, psychology and sociology) for classes IX-XII. Twelve (12) courses and twenty one (21) courses have been completed in the first cycle and second cycle (completed on 30 Nov. 2018) on SWAYAM platform (https://swayam.gov.in/) respectively. Nearly 22,000 students and 30,000 students were registered in the first cycle and second cycle respectively.

(iv) CIET-NCERT has been assigned the task of developing e-resources for Master of Education (M.Ed.) course jointly with Allahabad University. One course (Educational Administration, Management and Leadership in School Education) has been completed first cycle on SWAYAM platform in which 2115 were enrolled. The second cycle of this course is offered from 2 July 2018.

Besides, an online course on action research for teachers is conducted in regular intervals in the MOODLE platform (http://ictcurriculum.gov.in/ ). Post Graduate Diploma in Guidance and Counselling for in-service teachers is also offered through the same course portal. Several other online courses are developed for inservice teachers professional development and delivered through the portal https://itpd.ncert.org.in/.

(v) A programme for utilization of satellite communication technologies for transmission of educational e-contents through 32 National Channels i.e. SWAYAM PRABHA DTH-TV has been launched. CIET-NCERT is the national coordinator for one DTH TV channel i.e., Kishore Manch (#31) and has started feeding a 24x7 educational TV channel w.e.f. 09 July, 2018. Everyday four hour fresh slot is telecast and repeated six times in 24 hours to provide learning opportunities for the stake holders, as per their convenience. Besides, NIOS is running 5 channels for teachers, for Secondary and Sr. Secondary levels and for sign language.

(vi) MHRD has launched Diksha Portal for providing digital platform to teachers giving them an opportunity to learn and train themselves and connect with teacher community. The portal envisages to help teachers boost their teaching skills and create their own separate profile with their skills and knowledge, and help in improving quality of education with use of latest technologies in education sector.

State governments have increased their budgets for school education in the past three years, but the allotment of funds has not been enough to attract permanent qualified teaching staff to government schools, finds a recent study conducted across six States.

The report, prepared jointly by Child Rights and You (CRY) and the Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability (CBGA), examines budgeting for school education in six States -- West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra -- during the 14th Finance Commission recommendation period, which started in April 2015.

The study finds that there has been an overall increase in revenue with the States following the 14th Finance Commission recommendations. This was a result of an increase in the share of the States in the divisible pool of Central taxes from 32% to 42%. At the same time, a reduction in the Union government's contribution to the States for Central schemes in social sectors forced the States to improve their tax revenue collection. The study analyses whether the availability of additional funds translated into prioritising of school education in these six States.

Between 2015-16 and 2017-18, there was a net decline in the share of school education budget in the total State Budget for three of the six States, according to the detailed demand for Grants and State Budget documents. Bihar saw a dip of 3.1%, Maharashtra a drop of 1% and West Bengal 0.9%. On the other hand, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh saw an increase in the size of school education budget by 0.4%, 2.6% and 3.2%, respectively.

The report examines whether the increase in the size of school education budget was more than the rise in size of the total budget, indicating a higher priority for the sector. It concluded that between 2014-15 and 2017-18, Uttar Pradesh saw a 98.8% increase in budget for schools, whereas its total budget increased by 63.3%. West Bengal's budget for school education increased by 49.4% while its total budget increased by 48.2% and in Tamil Nadu, the former increased by 38.7% but the total budget increased by 38.5%, indicating that school education was a priority for these three States.

At the same time, all the six States showed an increase in the magnitude of per-child and per-student spending for education between 2014-15 and 2016-17.

Despite a varying level of commitment towards school education across the six States, all of them struggle with a shortage of teachers. The report cites data from the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development to show that as on March 2017, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have from 19% to 34% of total teacher positions at the elementary level vacant. Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu were relatively better with 5.9% and 2.6% posts unfilled.

Data from the District Information System for Education show that at the upper primary level, there is a severe paucity of subject-specific teachers required under the Right to Education Act -- 77% upper primary schools in Maharashtra, 46% in Uttar Pradesh, 40% in West Bengal and 37% in Bihar do not have subject teachers.

More than one lakh schools in India are run with only one teacher and all the six States surveyed have shown the number of such schools on the rise. The shortage of teachers is more acute at the secondary level -- Bihar has 20,494 teaching posts vacant, Chhattisgarh 8,278 and Uttar Pradesh 12,008.

The figures don't entirely capture the severity of the shortfall as they do not reflect the shortage of subject teachers."

The development comes close on the heels of another such incident in Aligarh where farmers in the district herded stray cows inside government buildings to prevent crop damage.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath recently directed the officials concerned to make immediate arrangements for proper care of stray cows. He also ordered clearing of grazing grounds in different parts of the state from encroachments. In Agra, police had to intervene in at least six cases to free cows locked in schools and public health centres. On Saturday, villagers locked up stray cows in a school in Garhi Bachchi. A day earlier, cattle were locked up inside a primary school at Arela village in Etmadpur tehsil. Uttar Pradesh: Over 700 Stray Cows Locked in School, Health Centre in Aligarh.

Officials of the Basic Education department had to intervene to get the premises vacated for children who had been forced to stay away from classes.

A farmer from Bichpuri, Ram Bharosey, said a groups of villagers with sticks in hands have to keep moving around to ensure the cattle were kept away from fields. Several farmers also raised concern over what they called as 'population explosion' of cattle.

People do not know what to do with cattle which are usually chased away towards the urban clusters. The bulls in the city have caused several fatal accidents, they said. When contacted, the district authorities said plans for providing new pasture land and cow shelters will take time for implementation."

Bhadiya, who took charge as headmaster only a year ago, told how implementation of various programmes helped increase student enrolment from less than 200 to 222 this year. ""Innovative ideas such as no-bag day on Saturdays, concepts like emotional pillars, and teacher-student bonding, have worked well. They have boosted enrolment at this government school,"" said Bhadiya.

She was able to overcome a lot of issues with support from Piramal Foundation for Education Leadership (PFEL). The foundation has been offering leadership training programmes to school heads, youths and education administrators in the government system, while improving various education processes and deploying tools and technology.

""The idea of transforming schools through 'Headmaster Leadership' triggered during the Gujarat earthquake relief operations in Kutch,"" said Aditya Natraj, founder of PFEL. ""I noticed that while everyone was fleeing the affected area, one government school headmaster went back to help his students. Without waiting for support from the government, he mobilised the community and resumed classes under a tree.

Natraj noticed that there leadership courses for school headmasters were available only for some private schools, and not for government schools.

Following the mode of campaigns run by privately-managed educational institutions, government schools across the state have started a massive advertising campaign ahead of commencement of the new academic session on January 1, featuring achievements and facilities of the schools.

Sources in the education department said the state government's recent decision to provide annual administrative grants to schools on the basis of enrolled positions has added an impetus to this campaign.

Banners portraying facilities and accomplishments at entrances of schools has become a common sight. Some school authorities have also launched a social media campaign, named Utsav Vidyarambha, an annual enrolment drive conducted every year with the help of local community and students, to enhance enrolment in schools.

""From this year, the publicity campaign for Utsav Vidyarambha has been launched on a massive scale. The prime thrust is to change the prevailing notion of most guardians that the quality of education in the state-government schools are not at par with private schools. Let's spread the message that trained and qualified teachers are imparting education in government-run schools and the admissions as well as other facilities are totally free for the newly enrolled kids at the primary level,"" a senior official of the education department told TOI on Friday.

All 56 papers of 20 marks each, albeit a revision test, would serve as a mock exam just to give the students the feel of the Boards and also help students to understand areas they need to focus on. By December 31, all government schools under the DSE across the State will receive these papers.

""In the last exam most students failed in Math and Science so we have decided to focus on revisions. From January 2 for the next 3-4 days students will do revision and then appear for the practice test which has been prepared by a panel of experts,"" explained B Venkata Narassama, District Education Officer, Hyderabad.

In addition, the DSE has also organised a day-long orientation programme for Math and Science teachers on how to conduct revision, evaluation of answer sheets and helping students clear backlogs.

Yet the evidence is mounting that UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath cares more about the welfare of cows than people inhabiting his state. Consider his latest order that in case of encroachers on grazing land, the encroachments be removed immediately and strict action initiated against the accused. As Adityanath continued to drive his administration hard on ill-conceived cow schemes, irate farmers in Aligarh locked up stray cows inside classrooms while schoolchildren and teachers were left in the lurch.

In truth, the scale of the problem unleashed by Hindutva-inspired curbs on cattle trade is unmanageable. A 2012 livestock census found 3.9 crore cows in UP. Six years later, imagine many of these cows past their productive age roaming the countryside and cities in search of food. No government is in a position to earmark shelters or grazing lands for such a huge population. Adityanath's desperate search for cow welfare solutions is bound to fail and he must instead focus on the rising farm anger against stray cows now directed at government property like schools and hospitals. Even those encroaching grazing land deserve a better reason than stray cows to be asked to go.

Farmers have paid dearly for this proliferation of stray cows. Unable to sell unproductive cows and now struggling to fend off stray cows from fields, it has been a double whammy for them. Reviving the cattle trade will solve these problems. In light of growing agrarian distress BJP should not lose sight of the fact that it is humans, not cows, who will be voting at the hustings."

(HT File)

After four rounds of admissions, less than a quarter of the 1,400 reserved seats on offer in the city's private schools for differently abled students were filled this year. This has prompted the government to carry forward the vacant seats to the next academic year.

Hindustan Times had reported last week that the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) had invited fresh online applications for 1,268 entry-level reserved seats for a fourth round of admissions to the current academic year which has just three months left.

On Wednesday, the draw of lots were held for these seats but only 123 were filled. The DoE cited ""lack of applications"" for the large number of seats going vacant.

""Of the 125 applications we received during the fresh round of admission, 123 candidates were absorbed. The selected candidates have to approach the allotted school on or before December 31,"" DoE director Sanjay Goel said.

According to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (PWD) Act, 2016, three per cent of the total number of seats meant for the economically weaker section and disadvantaged groups (EWS/DG) category are reserved for children with disabilities.

Goel said that the department will carry forward the remaining reserved seats to next academic session (2019-20). ""The seats will be counted in the category during next year's admission,"" he said. The notification of admission in the entry level classes under the 25% reserved seats for the EWS/DG category is likely to be announced in the first week of January, next year.

Officials in the DoE said that they are planning to organise awareness campaigns among parents to motivate them to apply.

""There is lack of awareness among parents about the reserved seats because this was the first time the quota was introduced within the 25% EWS/DG seats. We are planning to organise campaigns to aware parents from the coming admission session,"" an official said.

Experts, however, said that the ""lack of inclusiveness"" in schools make parents reluctant from applying. ""Though the situation in private schools is better than the government schools, parents of children with disabilities are still reluctant from applying there. They think their kids will only be able to adjust in special schools. More efforts need to be put in to make campuses more inclusive by appointing trained special educators and providing better infrastructure facilities,"" said Dr Satender Singh, disability rights activist."

The two schools, along with numerous other establishments like the handloom weaving centre, which bore the brunt of the floods, are on the path of fast revival -- thanks to the effective intervention of voluntary agencies and the local people.

While rebuilding by the government agencies in different parts of the state is only in the initial stages, the UP and LP schools which remained half submerged in the flood waters for over five days suffering huge damage to their facilities, have come back to life. In the forefront of the effort to revive them was the Deepalaya Trust in Delhi which lost no time in identifying the devastated schools and offering its help.

In a commendable operation coordinated by A J Philip, Deepalaya executive officer and eminent journalist; Dr George Mathew, Chairman, Institute of Social Sciences, New Delhi; and A J Abraham, social activist in Ernakulam, the rebuilding of the school started in right earnest in September itself and the work was completed within two months.

The so-called government red-tapes and delays were overcome with the strong support provided by the school authorities, including the AEO Latha, school headmaster V K Santhosh, panchayat president T G Anoop, Cartoonist Academy and the local people.

The Trust spent Rs 33 lakh in replacing the damaged computers, reconstructing the collapsed compound walls, removing the slush and debris from the compound and classrooms, laying tiles on the floors, painting the walls and re-equipping the library. Soon, other NGOs joined hands, including 'Human Values' and 'Rapid Response' of Pondicherry, which replaced the old furniture, desks and benches with modern ones.

Now the schools sport a completely new look and none who visits the place will realise that these were the ones the floods had ravaged only a few months ago. To celebrate its rejuvenation, the school organised a function on Saturday, which was attended by Sethu, writer and former chairman of South Indian Bank, Dr George Mathew, Cartoon Academy members, panchayat president, ward members, school children, parents, teachers and local people."

The state government has allotted around 14 crore to acquire and install the machines in all government schools. The department has already installed 1,136 incinerators and has delivered 1,520 to schools. Most of the schools in Cuddalore, Villupuram, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur, and nine other districts have begun using the machines. Schools will bear the machines' maintenance cost.

The incinerators, as students claim, will be very beneficial. ""What is more inconvenient than the having periods is disposing the soiled napkins. We will not have to worry about maintaining hygiene in the campus anymore,"" said Prateeksha, a Class X student. The fully automated machine, prevents foul odour from used napkins and can burn 150 to 200 napkins a day. The department has also provided cupboard facilities in all schools to store toiletries including sanitary napkins, at 64.01 lakh.

While the state is busy promoting hygiene in government schools, there are complaints that incinerators at a few corporation schools are not being maintained. ""Based on complaints we repair the machines,"" said E Govindasamy, educational officer, Greater Chennai Corporation. The Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 mandates installing incinerators or special disposal dustbins to prevent pollution."

After merger of 4,600 primary schools, the Jharkhand government is planning to shut over 6,466 middle schools (classes 6 to 8), having less than 100 students.

These schools would be merged with upgraded high schools in phases, starting with the institutions, which have less than 50 students, education department officials said on Thursday.

Initially, 3,732 middle schools having less than 50 students would be undertaken for merger. The process of merging has already been started.

""Merger is an effort to provide quality education to students in a better educational ambience. Jharkhand has around 411 such middle schools where number of students is less than 10. If these schools are merged with high schools, students would get better education,"" said state education secretary AP Singh.

""As per the rules in the right to education (RTE), there should be at least three trained graduate teacher (TGT) in middle schools where number of students is less than 100. It means, we would have to afford additional Rs 18 lakh on teachers' salary even in the schools where number of students is less than 10, which is not logical,"" he added.

The decision comes at a time when the opposition parties and critics have been criticising the state government for merging the primary schools. Several ruling party elected representatives have also been lobbying with the government against the move. There have been protests in several parts of the state as well, against merger of schools.

The officials, however, argue that, ideally, there should be one middle school and five to seven primary schools in a panchayat. As many as 6,466 middle schools have been identified in Jharkhand, which could be merged with high schools within a 5-km radius in a panchayat, Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) officials said.

The state government has decided to offer bicycles to the students, who would be shifted to other schools so that they do not face any trouble in commuting to the school.

Meanwhile, the JEPC officials said they have completed the merging exercise of 4,600 primary schools.

JEPC director Uma Shankar Singh said there were 39,600 schools in 2016-17 under education department in Jharkhand. ""Of them, 18,000 schools had 60 or few students. These schools had an average of 1 or two teachers per school. Providing quality education was a major challenge. One teacher was handling four to five classes at a time. How could one expect a better education in these schools,"" he said.

The council said four-step process including field inspection, cross-district verification, block and district consultation and final notification to merge the schools.

Singh said 98% students from the 4,600 primary schools have been shifted and 96% students have expressed satisfaction with the consolidation. ""We faced difficulty to shift 150 students due to some technical reasons. Now, the issue is resolved and 120 students were shifted,"" he said.

The reorganisation of primary schools benefited seven lakh students with better teachers' availability and reduced the requirements of teachers by 4,500. Besides, the process saved government's Rs 400 crore through reduced teachers and infrastructure requirements, JEPC officials said.

Education Dept ropes in IIM Ranchi for merged school evaluation

State education secretary AP Singh said the department has roped in Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ranchi, for evaluation of the merged schools. The IIM, Ranchi would see if the reorganization process brought any difference in improving the education of students, who were shifted in merging process.

Primary school teacher makes NHAI shift toll plaza

he grit, tenacity and commitment T of a government primary school teacher forced National Highways Authority of India to change its acquisition plan on Ludhiana-Chandigarh national highway, which is still being built.

LIFE IN COLOUR: Students are encouraged to be well turned out here

For 11 years, Sanjeev Kumar, a teacher at Government Primary School, Ghulal village near Samrala in district Ludhiana, worked to construct a new school building with the help of philanthropists from the village.

In July, a team of NHAI officials told him to vacate the school in two months.

""The NHAI planned to build a toll plaza here. They needed to widen the road for this and the school building was in the way. Over the past decade, we spent around Rs 26 lakh to construct the new building. When I told village residents, they were shattered,"" says Sanjeev Kumar.

Kumar first approached the district education officer and sent a message to secretary, education Krishan Kumar.

""He called me immediately. I went with a few village residents who have been helping us. As we sat there, he sent a letter to the Ludhiana deputy commissioner, asking him to do everything possible to save the school,"" Sanjeev recalls.

Ludhiana DC Pardeep Aggarwal sent SDM, Samrala and other officials to the school. The SDM called NHAI officials to the school. I heard the SDM telling NHAI officials that the school had to be saved at any cost and NHAI officials were asked to shift the toll plaza,"" he says.

Sanjeev pursued the issue till NHAI issued a fresh notification in October saying that the toll plaza would be shifted.

It is an incident secretary, education Krishan Kumar will not forget anytime soon. ""I could see his desperation and determination to save the school. Village residents were also committed to the cause. Such teachers deserve complete support. The Ludhiana deputy commissioner also took great interest in the endeavour and we are all happy with the result,"" he says.

Education dept steps in

It is remarkable that despite their tough circumstances, government school teachers are trying to bring about a qualitative change in their institutions.

""I learnt that a few teachers in the state improved their schools on their own, because of which more students got enrolled. In February, we called a meeting of such teachers. As they spoke about their experiences, we thought the idea was worth replicating across the state and called on principals and teachers to volunteer,"" says Krishan Kumar.

The officer pursued reforms in the education department during his previous stint as director general, school education for almost three years.

""By July, we had 425 schools with buildings turned into learning aids, improved infrastructure, amenities and sports facilities. The idea was to improve students' learning experience. We fixed the ambitious target of ""Mission 4,250"" by the beginning of the next academic session and asked these 425 teachers to motivate their friends and relatives in 10 other schools. Already, 1,700 schools have accomplished the task,"" he says.

According to the secretary, education, these teachers and communities are the biggest stakeholders in improving educational standards.

""Social accountability is much more result-oriented than departmental accountability,"" he said.

Incentives offered to teachers include transfer of choice, promotion and good ACR. ""All these benefits are non-monetary and the huge improvement in schools is without any extra burden on the state exchequer,"" Kumar adds.

Govt primary school, Jhans, Hoshiarpur

The school had just 17 students when Narinder Arora and his wife Manjit Kaur, both ETT teachers, joined in 2006. Now, there are 224 students. In an act that inspired trust, the couple got their daughter enrolled in the same school.

""There was nothing going for the small school but we decided to do everything possible to set things right. Apart from enrolling my daughter here, we motivated a few friends and fellow teachers to enroll their children as well. We assured them that their children's education or overall development would not suffer. Rather, we said they would see a marked improvement. My son is a UKG student here,"" said Narinder.

The teachers' dedication showed in exam results and students' performance in co-curricular activities.

""Soon, educated families also started sending their children to the school. We also had our own uniform,"" says Narinder Arora.

With this, village residents started pooling money for infrastructure upgrade. ""Philanthropists opened their hearts and pockets to us. Jalandharbased Satpal Singh Multani constructed two rooms. Jagjeet Singh

The Mathematics room in the school is its latest addition. The walls of the verandah have pictures of donors and those of well turned out students on a board with the title, Ajj De Sohne Bache (the smart children of today).

""We write names of five children on this board every day to inspire the children to remain clean,"" says teacher Ajmer Singh who started the transformation in 2007.

""When I joined the school, two snakes were found in the storeroom,"" he recalls. It is now an office.

Outer walls and walls inside the classrooms have paintings, poems and messages painted on them. ""We want to attract students. Coming to school should be a pleasant experience for them,"" he says. It has worked with the children. ""Tanvi, a Class II student sustained an injury on her Jeeta and his family in the village opened their house for us to accommodate 100 students as the school did not have enough space,"" Arora said, estimating that people spent around Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh on the school.

Two years back, they started kindergarten classes on the lines of private schools. ""Now, we get children in nursery and have around 125 kids in kindergarten,"" he says. In June, Arora was promoted as master in a secondary school.

""It was very difficult for me to leave the school and children. Residents literally pleaded with me to stay. When a village elder asked me to stay in a choked voice, I decided to decline the promotion. After this, village residents provided 56 marlas of land to the school and raised a boundary wall. Now, we have enough space,"" he says, adding that they need the education department to provide more teachers as the strength of students is increasing.

""NRIs and other villagers have helped to improve the school. Now, the entire village is involved. People from other villages also come to get their children enrolled here. We have transferred 56 marlas of land to the school. If the number increases, we will provide an acre-and-a-half more of Panchayat land to the school,"" says Jagjeet Singh.

finger last year. But she came to school the next day,"" Ajmer says. According to him, NRIs and philanthropists from outside the village pitched in and around Rs 22 lakh has been spent so far.

""Apart from improving the amenities, I have been focusing on the core issue - improving learning outcomes among students,"" he adds. The school has a sprawling park and playground. Students have mid-day meals on tables with granite tops.

Rurka Kalan (Jalandhar)

The village has two government primary schools - one for girls and one for boys. In ambience and facilities, these schools could give private schools a run for their money.

Walls of both government primary schools have been turned into learning aids for children. They also have libraries and reading rooms. The girls' school also has an LCD screen to screen educational programmes.

""When I joined on July 1, 2006, the school building was in bad shape, with doors and windows missing. There were around 80 students but not a single bench. The first thing to do was to get desks for students before winter. The Youth Football Club of Rurka Kalan, which is working to promote football in the area, helped us procure desks at a cost of Rs 50,000,"" says school teacher Sanjiv Kumar, the man behind the transformation.

This was just the beginning. Over the years, infrastructure, education and sports in the school were upgraded.

""Philanthropists spent Rs 19 lakh on the school. With the way things have come up, more donors are volunteering,"" he says.

At Government Primary School for Girls, Buta Ram, who was promoted as centre head teacher and shifted to the boys' school a few days back, brought about the transformation.

""My daughter studies in this school. After I joined here in 2013, we managed to mobilize resources and undertake works worth around Rs 22 lakh,"" he says.

The school has its own logo and calendar. Numbers and letters are painted on the walls and a park based on the theme of mathematics is being constructed. Sanjiv and I are competing with each other to improve our schools,"" smiles Buta Ram.

Both schools have well-furnished and neat kitchens to cook mid-day meals.

The boys' school is in stark contrast with the street. The backyard of the adjoining senior secondary school is also overrun with weeds like a dark reminder of how things used to be and what could happen if these efforts are not sustained.

SETTING AN EXAMPLE

Secretary education, Krishan Kumar gets pictures from the pathbreaking schools. Every day, he picks the picture of one school and forwards it on WhatsApp groups of the education department. This motivates the others and generates healthy competition. The schools are promoting extra-curricular activities and helping students speak English

TAKING THE LEAD

As school infrastructure is improved, teachers feel more motivated. They share ideas and help each other even while competing. Sometimes, we spend from our own pockets as bonding with schools and children has improved,"" says Ashok Basra, principal, Government Senior Secondary School, Jamsher Khaas near Jalandhar.

They aren't sure if the authorities would do all that is needed to enhance the quality of government schools and bring them on a par with private ones.

Notably, Section 3 of the Act, which is considered the core of the legislation, provides children the fundamental right to free and compulsory education in a neighbourhood school.

According to the proposal, if there's a government school in neighbourhood of a child -- within 1km for primary education and 3km for higher primary -- he/she should get admitted to that instead of a private school.

Nagasimha G Rao, state convener of the RTE task force, said, ""The government is citing the example of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where government schools are in high demand. We're in touch with RTE activists there too. But the Karnataka scenario is different. Parents prefer English medium schools over government institutions.""

Mohammed Yousuf, a Marappa Garden resident and parent of a child who's an RTE beneficiary, said, ""I don't think government schools are up to the mark. They don't have good English teachers and lack infrastructure. Moreover, the nearest government school in our area is located on defence land, can be accessed by every passerby and has a dumpsite too. My son will not be safe.""

Education department officials admit that no new government school has been opened in the state in the past three years.

Citing a 2017 study by the RTE Forum, a national organization, which states that 90% of RTE students paid fees to private schools,Y Mariswamy, chairperson (in charge), Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights said, ""We get a lot of complaints from parents. It is sad that students are still made to pay fees at private schools despite being admitted under RTE. As we are the monitoring body for RTE and as well as child protection laws, I feel this move will give a boost to government schools and put in place systems required in these institutions.""

Niranjan Aradhya, senior fellow and programme head, Universalisation of Equitable Quality Education Programme, Centre for Child and the Law, NLSIU, said: ""This is a chance for government schools to improve. The government just needs to do a few basic things like recruit more English teachers and upgrade schools to the level of Kendriya Vidyalayas. To make RTE effective, they need to implement section 12(2) of the RTE Act which mandates private unaided schools receiving government largesse to reserve seats for weaker sections from their neighbourhood without the state having the obligation to reimburse them. Delhi has been following this since 2004."""

The Directorate of Elementary Education under the School and Mass Education (S&ME) department has issued an order to the District Education Officers (DEOs) and Block Education Officers (BEOs) in this regard seeking an action taken report at the earliest.

Sources said the move came after the Chief Minister's Office (CMO) intervened into the matter and asked the department to look into it. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, which came into force in 2016, has provisions for appointment of special educators in schools at primary and upper primary levels to improve the standard of education for children with special needs. As per provisions, the Government will ensure appointment of at least one special educator in each primary and upper primary school. However, not a single special educator has been appointed in these schools so far, sources added.

In June, the Secretary of Social Security and Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (SSEPD) had urged the S&ME department to implement the provisions and submit an action taken report in this regard. However, the department had failed to act, sources said.

Sources in the Directorate of the Elementary Education said there is a provision of '3,000 per year for every child with special needs studying in Government and Government-aided schools for his/her study materials and stipend."

But this doesn't translate into government owning and running schools.

No matter which way one looks at it, there is no widespread market failure in school education. There is the matter of supporting poor children, but as far as the supply of high-quality supply is concerned, there is overwhelming evidence that the market is competent to do so without any government involvement.

On the other hand, there is overwhelming evidence of the failure of government education. As the Secretary to the government of Assam for Education in the early 1990s, I quickly became aware of how the Minister of Education (in a Congress government in my time) used the appointment and transfers of teachers as the key mechanism to extract bribes. The director of education of Assam was the conduit for this. The entire system was totally broken: many schools only existed on paper and ""teachers"" drew salaries when there was nothing on the ground.

The seriously misguided policy idea that the government must directly own and run schools came about as a result of a grievous error of analysis made by Lord Macaulay nearly two hundred years ago. This misconception continues till today among the ""educated"" who are not aware of the ground reality. The socialist Aam Aadmi Party's misplaced passion for government schools is one such example, and discuss my meeting on this issue with a senior AAP leader some other time.

The ""educated"" typically have a belief that parents won't send their children to school unless they are compelled by the state to do so. It is believed that given a chance, poor parents prefer to deploy their children as child labour. But the reality is that - as James Tooley's research has confirmed this fact that was well-known to many of us - all over India hundreds of millions of poor parents are sending their children to for-profit low-cost private schools. Roughly a third of India's poor children attend such schools.

Further, that some parents may indeed deploy their children as labour (extremely rare today) is actually the inevitable consequence of socialist policies that make parents view education dimly - as not being worthwhile since it won't improve their children's job prospects. There is a strong factual basis for this perception since millions of low quality ""graduates"", who are totally unsuited for the job market, are found unemployed today across India in second-tier towns and in the villages. Let's us, therefore, agree that there is no one more keenly interested in the welfare of their children than the parents. We must harness this powerful force instead of rejecting it.

Second, there is a mistaken belief that a school must have significant infrastructure and paraphernalia, or that its teachers must necessarily be ""highly qualified"". But as Gandhi said in a speech at Chatham House in 1931: ""the schools established after the European pattern were too expensive for the people"" and ""The village schools were not good enough for the British administrator, so he came out with his programme. Every school must have so much paraphernalia, building, and so forth"".

Gandhi, therefore, said: ""I defy anybody to fulfil a programme of compulsory primary education of these masses inside of a century. This very poor country of mine is ill able to sustain such an expensive method of education. Our State would revive the old village schoolmaster and dot every village with a school both for boys and girls"". What a brilliant thought! - except that there must not be any direct role for the state even in such schools.

James Tooley's book, The Beautiful Tree, shows that children who attend low cost for-profit private schools (including in India) achieve much higher educational outcomes than children from comparable government schools, despite such private schools having virtually no infrastructure and the teachers of such schools not even being ""adequately"" qualified. The reason these schools succeed while government schools fail is that teachers in the private schools are held to account for outcomes by the Principal, who is often the school owner. These for-profit undertakings depend critically on demonstrating real results in order to continue to get the custom of the poor parents who pay a small fee on a monthly basis and will quickly switch their child to a competing school if they don't' see significant progress each month.

Tooley's research enables us to totally dispense with the myth that government schools are required to educate children. This research has also confirmed Gandhi's assertion that excellent village schools operated in India prior to British rule. These schools functioned from the houses of the teachers, did not need a vast paraphernalia of infrastructure, and all sections of the community were able to send their children to these schools to avail high quality, low-cost education. In Shanti Niketan, Rabindranath Tagore was basically attempting to replicate this form of education, with a focus on learning and not on facilities or infrastructure.

Unfortunately, Macaulay's misplaced paternalism injected government into schools in India and was also copied by the UK, which had an entirely private (or local) school education system prior to that. In both cases, the effect was harmful, as the number of students and quality of education plummeted. Till today, an average government school across the world performs much worse than an average private school, barring a few exceptions.

We noted at the outset that the government must support the poor to access education - to ensure equality of opportunity. There is a simple and direct way to achieve this without owning and running schools, by providing vouchers of certain nominal value (depending on the income level of parents) for each poor child up to year 12 that can only be exchanged for school education (including for vocational education). This is our party's policy. These vouchers would enable the children of poor parents to attend a good for-profit private school.

The idea of vouchers has a long history and has also been tried out in a number of ways across the world, although not in the full-blown manner that's our party's policy. Milton Friedman is probably best known for his advocacy of this system but his ideas did not go far enough. He was willing to allow competition between private and government schools but our party does not see any role whatsoever for even a single government school. Our party is committed to the total privatisation of all government schools - in a well-structured manner.

The alignment of incentives when parents choose (and themselves fund, even if to a small extent) for-profit private schools is the best way to quickly and significantly improve India's dismal quality of school education.

Our party would, of course, remove most regulations in this area, such as requirements for infrastructure, playgrounds or even for the qualification of teachers. The market will determine who is best placed to teach. All we would require is that each school pick an affiliating board (such as CBSE, but that would need to be disbanded and private boards would emerge) and demonstrate high quality student outcomes in order to be eligible for the school vouchers. This would be an outcomes-based regulatory system, with detailed management (including things like the medium of instruction) left to schools and parents: the parties with the deepest direct interest in outcomes.

We therefore disagree with things like the Right to Education Act which we see as a socialist anachronism. India needs to fully liberate the education sector to allow the best private sector initiatives to emerge, unfettered by the misguided notions of any delusional (and mostly corrupt) bureaucrat or minister.

The government has sufficient core work to perform, in which it has repeatedly failed. When Indian governments can't deliver security and justice, how can they possibly deliver education? Today India is led by a government which can't distinguish between mythology and cosmetic surgery, between homeopathy and medicine. So what makes us think it can teach our children?"

The survey found that 88% students were allegedly beaten up, as a matter of routine, multiple times a week in some government schools, while in other government schools, around 30% experienced corporal punishment multiple times. All 50 students from low-cost public schools, who were part of the survey, reported that they were beaten up.

On an average, almost half of the children interviewed were allegedly beaten by teachers multiple times a week. The report, Choking Childhood, is based on the findings of research undertaken by social organisation Agrasar, which works with disadvantaged communities.

A total of 521 children and 100 parents sampled randomly were surveyed, and an informal group interview with 12 teachers from two different government schools was undertaken.

There are around 130 primary government schools in Gurugram, from which the students were randomly selected. There are around 18,000 students in the primary schools, as per estimates.

The Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, prohibits 'physical punishment' & 'mental harassment' under Section 17(1) and makes it a punishable offence under Section 17(2).

""The report studies the impact of corporal punishment on the psyche of children who are doubly disadvantaged by virtue of them being children who are predominantly from poor migrant communities and first-generation learners,"" said Prerit Rana, co-founder and CEO of Agrasar. He added that corporal punishment in schools was not only a violation of human rights, but also impaired the health and education of the children.

According to the report, 70% of the children reported that they were beaten at home after parents learnt that they were beaten in school. More than 70% of the parents said that they beat their children, as they believe punishment is for their child's well being.

The report also outlined the challenging working conditions and lack of professional conduct among teachers in government schools fostered an environment that puts deprived children at risk of experiencing corporal punishment.

Responding to the findings of the report, Premlata Yadav, the district elementary education officer said, ""I will have to see the report to know how the survey was conducted. I do not agree with the findings of the report. One can expect 1-2% of such cases but it is incorrect to say that 80% of the children are beaten.""

Yadav added that teachers are not allowed to punish students and strict action is taken if such a complaint is raised. ""If we receive information of this nature, we warn the teachers and sometimes, it can also lead to their suspension. We take strict action on reports of corporal punishment,"" she said.

A Sanskrit teacher at a government school said that corporal punishment is rarely doled out. ""Teachers rarely beat students. However, sometimes children do not understand and teachers are compelled to take matters into their hands. I do not raise my hands at my students. I either ask them to do rounds of the ground with their hands raised up or call their parents,"" she said."

Subject-wise performance evaluation of students from government and private schools from the state, revealed the performance of government school students to be poorer than private schools in all districts, apart from Hyderabad where the performance was on par.

Looking at the data, it should not be a surprise that parents prefer shelling out more money in sending their children to private schools for education than government for better education. As per available data, more than half of the about 48 lakh students studying in various schools in Telangana, are studying in private schools.

For example, while the performance of students from government schools in Nalgonda was 31 per cent and 33 per cent in Mathematics and Science, it was 39 per cent and 40 percent respectively by private school students. Similarly, while the performance of government school students in Karimnagar in Social Science and English subjects was 38 per cent and 34 per cent respectively, it was 46 per cent and 56 per cent in private schools.

Only in Hyderabad, the difference between performance of government and private school students was not significant.

Urban-rural divide also deep

Significant difference in performance of students in various subjects has also been observed with respect to whether a student belongs to rural or urban area, indicating the disparity in quality of education received by students depending on where they belong from.

In the NAS it has been observed that in all districts of the state the performance of students in urban areas is higher than those from rural areas. For example, in Rangareddy district while the performance of students in Mathematics and Science in rural areas was found to be 33 per cent and 35 per cent respectively, in the urban areas it was 41 per cent in each subject. Similar is the case in all other districts.

Caste affects spoken English

The NAS also highlights the need for ensuring that education reaches every student equitably, regardless of the caste of the student. Significant difference has been found in the performance of students from the general category and those from the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes.

A difference of almost 5-10 per cent was observed in the performances of students from general categories as compared to those from reserved categories. The difference was prominent in all the subjects that students study at the high school level.

However, the difference is most pronounced, as much as 15 per cent, in case of English language. For example, while the students belonging to the general category had an average performance percentage in Mathematics of 41 per cent while English had 50 per cent. On the other hand, among the students from Scheduled Castes it was 31 per cent and 35 per cent respectively."

At a time when Government talks about ""Digital Literacy "" how is it possible that people especially students don't have access to electricity? Despite the obvious connection between electricity and educational achievement, however, the troubling scenes in Jammu and Kashmir are repeated as there are thousands of Government run schools without electricity. Present and past Governments in J&K, have been focusing on administrative affairs of education department or even pedagogy, but very little focus has been given to electricity in Government schools. The absence of focus on this issue is detrimental because, a study has put it like this, ""education is also widely recognized as one of the most essential components for poverty reduction"". Lack of electricity at primary, middle and secondary schools therefore creates considerable obstacles towards escaping poverty and correlates with many factors that contribute directly towards it. It is a big impediment towards digital literacy as well because when there is no electricity in a Government school, the children will have no access to computers and other digital equipment. The report on link between education and poverty assesses the direct link between electricity and education.

Based on the most recently available survey data from the World Bank and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the report first describes the current state of electrification of schools. According to the this data, roughly four out of every five primary and secondary schools in African countries (Govt and Private schools) surveyed lacked access to electricity, along with almost three quarters of village schools in India. This is much worst in Jammu & Kashmir state as more than 70 percent Government schools are un-electrified in this 21st century. When it comes to Kashmir division, more than 80 percent of Government schools are un electrified and these details I have been provided officially by several Chief Education Officer (CEOs) when I sought details under Right to Information Act (RTI). In Jammu province also the majority of Government schools in Rajouri , Poonch , Doda , Ramban , Reasi , Kishtwar and Doda are still un electrified.

Based on a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and policy literature concerning electricity and education, the report mentioned above assesses the educational benefits of electrification of primary and secondary schools, including lighting and access to information and communications technologies (ICT) as well improvement in staff retention and student completion and graduation rates. The final two main parts of the report, drawn from energy policy, development studies, and innovations in financing and public private partnerships literature, discuss the challenges facing school electrification, such as lack of financing and technical problems with equipment, along with the solutions and incentives with the potential to overcome them, such as Public Private Partnerships (PPPs).

Rajouri , Srinagar

At a time when Government of India is celebrating achievement of 100 percent electrification feat across country, information available reveals some astonishing facts. As per the Government figures, there are 1720 Govt schools in Rajouri district and out of them 1484 (over 86 percent) don't have access to electricity. Out of 1720 Government schools in Rajouri district , there are 995 primary, 557 middle, 117 high and 41 higher secondary schools. In addition to these there are 6 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalyas (KGBV) across the district.

In Srinagar district, more than 300 Government schools have not been provided electricity connection by Government till date. More than two years have passed since Government had ordered to get all the schools electrified. In Srinagar there are around 519 Govt run schools out of which there are 204 primary schools, 211 middle schools, 74 high schools and 30 higher secondary schools. Out of the 519 Govt schools, there are around 305 schools which are still un electrified.

Budgam, Ganderbal

In Budgam district there are more than 81 percent Government run schools which are un-electrified. This is an official information that was provided to me by Chief Education Officer (CEO) of Budgam under RTI Act. CEO Budgam informed me in his reply that there are around 1,036 schools in the district out of total 1278 that are ""without proper electricity connection"". Actually I had sought the details of all the un electrified Govt schools in Kashmir valley under RTI Act. I filed application before the designated Public Information Officer (PIO) in the Directorate of School Education Kashmir (DSEK). Instead of providing the information , PIO passed the buck to all the Chief Education Officers (CEOs) of Kashmir valley plus Leh and Kargil . That is why I got the details from each district. I also sought information about the number of girls' schools without a toilet facility and the number of schools without a proper electricity connection, boundary wall and drinking water facility. CEO Budgam in his reply said that ""all"" the girls' schools had a washroom facility, ""there are dysfunctional toilets "".

In Ganderbal district out of 587 government schools, 434 schools are un electrified which means around 83 percent Government schools have no access to electricity. These details were revealed by Chief Education Officer (CEO) Ganderbal in a reply to my Right to Information (RTI) application.

Conclusion

Why is Government compromising on providing the basic infrastructure to Government schools while as no such compromise is done when it comes to perks and salaries of Government employees especially Govt school teachers ? Infrastructure and level of education is coming down in Govt schools , but this is not the case with Government's own employees ? Their salaries continue to be hiked. Govt spends more than Rs 1.40 lakhs every month on an average Government school in J&K. Do poor kids enrolled in these schools get the desired facilities ? On contrary to this, not even Rs 50,000 is spent on an average private school in J&K by local school management, but the results are quite different. Board of School Education (BOSE) collected an amount of Rs 16.81 crores from students in shape of exam fees in Kashmir valley recently, but the class Xth & XIIth students were forced to write exams under candle light as there is no facility of gen-sets in the exam centers. Not even heaters are made available in Govt schools (exam centers) by BOSE and children are made to shiver in the cold. I have been forced to seek intervention of J&K State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) where I filed a petition recently.

I hope to get some good direction soon from SHRC. Imagine kind of trauma poor kids are facing in classrooms during June , July and August when temperature rises above 30 degree in valley and more than 40 in Jammu plains or in Rajouri , Ramban or Poonch districts ? After missing the initial deadline of May 2017, the Narendra Modi government on April 29th this year announced ""electrification"" of all inhabited villages in India has been completed.After having all the data available vis a vis un electrified schools in J&K , it clearly indicates that announcement by Government was largely symbolic. In a state where 75 to 80 percent Government schools are still un electrified how can Government claim to have achieved 100 percent electrification target ? How can Government claim to achieve digital literacy target in future if Govt schools are not electrified?

""My children go to a private school Madam, it is close to home, they learn English and mathematics"", says Selvi with a big smile on her face. Selvi, a Marathahalli-based domestic worker, like many others from low income households in Bangalore, finds private schools a better choice for her child.

Research has often pointed out that there is not much difference in the learning outcomes of children in government schools and in private schools. Yet in Bengaluru, like many urban centres in the country, children across income groups are flocking to private schools. While the number of private schools are rapidly rising, government schools are increasingly being merged/shut down in the name of low student enrolment. The narrative around government schools remains one of poor accountability and infrastructure, poorly trained or absent teachers, poor attendance and pass rates of students.

In 2016-17, Bangalore Urban had 1403 government schools, and almost thrice as many - 3426 - private schools. Student enrolments illustrate the trend better. That year, only 1.8 lakh children were enrolled in government schools, compared to nearly 11 lakh children in private schools.

The most commonly cited concern about government schools is the lack of sufficient, well-qualified teachers.

Dr V P Niranjan Aradhya, Programme Head (Right To Education) at the Centre for Child and Law, NLSIU, points out that there were over 28,000 vacancies for government elementary school teachers in Karnataka as of 2016-17. ""The number of sanctioned posts was 1.94 lakh, but only 1.66 lakh teachers were working then. The department has been talking about plans to recruit teachers, but currently poorly-paid guest teachers are being appointed in many vacancies,"" he says.

Given the low rate of enrolment in government schools in the city, there are schools with only 10-15 students spread across grade 1-5, or schools that have only 30 students overall from class 1-7. Such schools often have only one or two teachers. These teachers have to teach every subject to students across all grades, even if they are not qualified for it, says Aradhya. Teachers are also burdened with additional duties and administrative tasks. There are even schools in the city that lack a Headmaster, requiring one among the skeletal teaching staff to do the additional administrative tasks of the HM.

Anurag Behar, Vice Chancellor at Azim Premji University, says the low quality of schools comes down to the poor quality of teacher education. Behar was part of the implementation committee for the Justice J S Verma Commission report on teacher education. The Justice Verma Commission, set up by the Supreme Court, had pointed out in its 2012 report that the majority of Teacher Education Institutions (TEI) in the country were highly commercial private establishments.

Behar says: ""In the 1960s, India had only about 1300 TEIs. In the early 1990s, it was about 1500. Then, between 1993 and 2011, this number rose to about 16,000. In this period, the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) gave licenses to many private institutions that were fraudulent and corrupt; many of these institutions don't even hold classes."" He says that out of nearly 18,000 TEIs in the country now, about 92% are private.

Other issues pointed out by the Verma Commission Report include: teacher education curriculum remaining unchanged for over 65 years, TEIs being standalone institutions rather than being part of universities, the generalist nature of M.Ed programmes etc. The Commission had in fact reviewed 291 TEIs in Maharashtra, and recommended that 85% of these should be shut down.

Though much of the Commission's recommendations have been ignored, there have been a few initiatives such as the centre's budget announcement this year to introduce an integrated B.Ed course. ""But what about the existing 16,000-odd TEIs that are of low quality? Nothing much has been done about those,"" says Behar.

While shortage of qualified teachers is a major concern, both Aradhya and Behar say that teachers are not respected or incentivised enough in the education system. Teacher absenteeism - i.e., absence without a valid reason - has been blamed for much of the shortcomings of government schools.

But a 2016 study by Azim Premji Foundation (APF) across over 600 schools in six states including Karnataka, had shown that teacher absenteeism was only 2.5%. However, the overall teacher absence was around 19%, which was due to other administrative or departmental work they were assigned, trainings, or legitimate leaves; that is, teachers were absent due to systemic issues rather than a lack of professionalism.

The current system, wherein teachers' promotions are based entirely on tenure, hardly incentivises high-performing teachers as well.

Bengaluru's government schools are also affected by bureaucratic procedures like frequent teacher transfers. ""The transfer process is lengthy, and happens just a few months into the academic year. Events like elections can delay it even more. Neither the teacher nor the students would know if the teacher would remain in the school that year. This affects consistency in academic inputs,"" says Kapil Dawda, Bengaluru City Director for the non-profit Teach for India. Teach for India's fellows work as full-time teachers in low-income schools; currently they work with 24 government schools in the city.

Jean Boddu, Senior Program Manager at Mentor Together, another non-profit that works with government schools, says the distribution of bags and books to students also gets delayed by 2-3 months from the start of the academic year. ""Also, there is a huge dropout of students in 9th standard, as students who are academically weak are neglected, and fail exams."" Boddu says such students are not supported well enough as the school is worried that its 10th standard pass percentage may drop down if they continue there.

In terms of infrastructure, Bengaluru's government schools do have basic infrastructure like toilets and electricity, but in many cases the infrastructure is not functional. For example, schools that have toilets may lack water; or the toilet is kept locked. There is little investment in the operation and maintenance of existing infrastructure. In Bengaluru, corporates have adopted many government schools, providing funds, books, infrastructure etc.

Dawda says that schools located in areas like Whitefield which have a high concentration of corporates, tend to have better essential infrastructure because of this. ""Government schools in these areas often have a science lab, computer lab etc., which schools in areas like Ejipura or Goripalya don't have,"" he says. Since such philanthropic work is not streamlined and coordinated by the Department of Public Instruction, the results are often skewed and less effective.

In education system, the Cluster Resource Person (CRP) who oversees some 10-12 government schools per cluster, is the academic authority, says Aradhya. ""CRP has to monitor the quality of learning process, but he usually ends up doing administrative work and collecting data from schools. Parents also don't know that it's the CRP they have to approach, to hold their child's school accountable,"" he says.

The Karnataka School Quality Assessment and Accreditation Council (KSQAAC) routinely assesses government schools in the state and accredits them. Schools have to undergo both a self-assessment and external assessment, and are graded on multiple aspects like learning achievement, learning environment and physical environment. They are then given accreditation in grades ranging from A+ to D.

The Council has routinely ranked schools poorly. In 2014-15, for example, it had assessed 1220 government schools, 917 aided schools and 24 unaided schools in the state. In Bangalore Urban overall (Bangalore North and South educational districts combined), out of 78 schools, no schools got A or A+ grade, and only eight got B+. Sixteen schools got B grade, 33 got C+, 17 got C and four schools got D grade.

Aradhya opines that the accreditation system is useless as long as there is no initiative to improve the quality of schools. ""If the government is providing functional infrastructure, recruiting teachers and monitoring the learning process in schools, then it has the right to give accreditation. Else, continuing this exercise without doing anything to improve quality, only sends the message that government schools are bad,"" he says.

While government schools compulsorily have to submit to the KSQAAC accreditation process, private schools are not bound to. In the current system, private schools can participate in the accreditation process if they want to, by paying a fee to KSQAAC. Very few usually do.

Currently there isn't a system to assess private schools on their quality. The majority of private schools in Bangalore are low-income schools without adequate infrastructure or well-qualified teachers. However parents are keen to send their children to these schools because of the English language education offered, and the general perception that these schools are better.

Accountability remains the core difference between public schools and private ones, according to Shashi Kumar D, General Secretary of KAMS (Associated Management of Private Schools in Karnataka). ""There are issues with private schools, they are not isolated from the problems of running a school. For example there may be a lacuna with the lessons offered, or the hire of unskilled teachers. But because of the pervasive accountability in these establishments the teachers increase their skills, knowledge and teaching ability,"" Kumar says.

However, research has often showed that there isn't much of a difference in the quality of education in government and private schools. World Bank's World Development Report 2018 says that, in the 40 countries it researched on, including India, there were no differences in the learning outcomes of children in private and public schools, given that they had matching familial backgrounds. Any marginal difference was because private schools mainly admitted students from advantaged backgrounds. That is, student performance depended on the student's household, and not the quality of education offered by the school. Another study by APF in rural Andhra Pradesh in 2015 had shown similar results.

Behar says, ""There would be less than 2% private schools that are elite and actually have the resources to run a high quality school. But even their quality of education is suspect. The remaining low-fee private schools are mostly much worse in quality."" Behar says there would be only 10-15% private schools that are truly committed to providing good quality education. ""For the rest, it is a business,"" he says.

Dr Shalini Rajneesh, Principal Secretary (Primary and Secondary Education Department), says that government school students often lack a good support system. ""First-generation school goers cannot study the way a typical private school student studies - by rote. There are no support systems for public school students, no remedies and no help at home. That is why, now we are attempting to bring a more holistic form of learning; and we are doing this along with NGOs across the city, like Akshara.""

Whether government schools will in fact get the right support, or whether they will continue to be shut down further in the name of low enrolment, remains to be seen."

The government had introduced digital classrooms in high schools, infused of ICT as part of pedagogy, brought in subjects like robotics in residential schools, and most recently, made over government schools by turning their walls into canvases.

However, it seems their efforts don't prove much because the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE), National Achievement Survey (NAS) by MHRD, and the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) have thoroughly highlighted the poor quality of government schools in Telangana, with respect to infrastructure as well as quality of education being imparted.

In fact, compared to the data published in the UDISE for the academic year 2014-15, this year's report revealed that not much has changed in government schools since TRS had come to power. One glaring example is that of computer availability in government schools, which has actually gone down to 36 percent from being 37.5 percent in 2014, as per the UDISE numbers. In secondary schools, it has increased slightly from 29 to 31 percent.

When it comes to matters of infrastructure in primary schools such as having boundary walls, single-room classrooms, playgrounds, and kitchen sheds, the data indicates stagnancy. While studies showed that there was a steady improvement in the performance of residential schools run by the social welfare department -- where just about 15 per cent of students studied -- other government schools like the zilla parishad schools were constantly ignored.

Another example is that of science laboratories in secondary schools. The percentage of schools having Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Computer and Maths labs have down to 17.6, 17.5, 16.9. 11.7 and 6.3 percent from 19.3, 19.2, 18.5, 12.7 and 8 percent respectively.

Poor quality of education

Various reports released in the last four years raised questions over the quality of education being imparted in government schools of Telangana. For example the NAS report released this year pointed out that performance of school students in Telangana in all the subjects was poorer than that of students from most districts of other southern states.

Even the Comptroller and Auditor General in its audit report released this year pulled up the Telangana government as it found that 14-26 percent children in primary schools and 21-47 percent children in upper primary schools scored less than 40 percent in the years 2014-17. It also pointed out issues like unhygienic conditions of kitchens in schools used for cooking midday meals.

TRS government can't walk the talk?

It's no news that the TRS government has never forgone an opportunity to talk about its achievements in residential educational institutions run by the social welfare department. Good performance of students in SSC exams, competitive exams, academic and extra-curricular initiatives has often been the talk of the town during TRS rule.

However, government teachers point out that these residential schools -- home to jus10 percent of the 22 lakh students enrolled in different government schools across the State -- are not run by the Department of School Education (DSE) and receive ample funds, as a result they deliver better results. The government is all-talk when it comes to these schools and mum when it comes schools that come under the DSE.

The stark difference could be seen in this year's SSC results as the pass percentage in residential schools was above 90 percent whereas in zilla parishad schools it was just about 75 percent.

Telangana State United Teachers Federation, general secretary, Chava Ravi, said, ""Around 20,000 teacher positions are vacant in government schools. The TRS government has not recruited a single teacher since 2014, even though the TRT was announced for 8,972 posts last year.""

""There are several schools where one to two teachers teach 5 classes and cover 18 subjects. Moreover, in this academic year, school maintenance funds have not been released yet by the State government and the amount is expected to go down with the merger of SSA (Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan) and RMSA (Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan).

Negative marks for TRS government on school fee regulation issue : Parents

Parents across the State have been crying hoarse demanding fee regulation. The Hyderabad Schools Parents Association (HSPA) has conducted many protests on this issue, including writing a post card to the Chief Minister and producing a song chiding him for not taking any action on the issue. The post even went viral on social media.

These protests and promises by the government -- especially the education minister -- notwithstanding, the TRS government has failed to address problems of exorbitant fee. The State government constituted a committee to look into the issue, headed by former Osmania University Vice Chancellor, Prof Tirupati Rao. The committee was formed in March 2017 and was supposed to submit its report in the next one month. It actually did so only in December. It's a year since the report was submitted, but it has not been made public yet. The government did not even form the district fee regulatory committees."

Furthermore, the bench directed the authorities concerned to file their counter affidavit by December 6. It also impleaded the Director of State Council for Education, Research and Training, as a party.

According to the petitioner, there are about 37,211 government schools, 8,403 government aided and 12,419 private self-financing schools, imparting education to about 1.25 crore students. Around 40 lakh students study in 12,419 private schools. The State spends Rs 27,000 crore for education per annum.

Although as per the State's education policy, English is taught as the second language from Class 2 to 12 in Tamil medium aided and unaided schools, despite having successfully completing Plus Two with high marks, a student was unable to speak or understand any communication in English.

Moreover, he was also unable to converse or write fluently in English.

This leads to communication problems for him when he pursues professional courses or higher education that are imparted only in English.

However, the students who study in CBSE schools find it easier to understand and communicate in English. Therefore, a need has arisen to lay emphasis on spoken English, said the petitioner."

Just 22 percent had learned about safe sex in relation to same-sex relationships, the study found.

""Under these new proposals, teachers will have access to the resources and training they need to create more inclusive learning environments and better support LGBT students,"" said Colin Macfarlane, director of Stonewall Scotland.

""In schools that teach about LGBT issues, LGBT young people are more likely to feel welcomed, safe and accepted.""

Scotland only decriminalized homosexuality in 1980, 13 years after England and Wales. Yet it was ranked as the most gay-friendly and tolerant nation in Europe in the 2016 Rainbow Index compiled by campaign group ILGA-Europe.

The announcement comes after equality campaigners said a planned overhaul of sex education in government schools in England failed to address needs of LGBT+ students.

Scotland's schools operate under a separate curriculum."

Just that morning a few of them had visited the Government Urdu Higher Primary School at Nachanahalli Palya on Manandavadi Road and soon after lunch, nearly ten of them led by Dame Hilary Blume (Director, The Green Hotel and Founder, Charities Advisory Trust in UK) were ready to hop into the mini bus and visit a few more schools run by the Government of Karnataka.

As the bus drove towards the congested Kyathamaranahalli and entered a small lane, the women, who alighted from the bus, were surprised to see a clean, well-maintained Government Higher Primary School. There was a welcome committee with the Head Master of the School V. Ramaswamy, a disciplined, dedicated teacher and H. Saraswathi, the Director of RLHP (Rural Literacy and Health Programme) who is coordinating with Charities Advisory Trust, greeting the group of lively women.

Walking up a flight of stairs that led to the library of the school at the far end, the students, both boys and girls, all dressed neatly in green uniforms got up shyly but most of them immediately recognised the familiar of face of Dame Hilary Blume, who is no stranger to Mysuru.

""Do you recognise Madam Hilary?"" asked the Head Master and most of the students immediately recalled her earlier visit to the school. The library is well- equipped with books, desks and benches (all funded by the Charities Advisory Trust) and the visitors were keen to see how many students were really into reading the books.

A few of the students got up to demonstrate how helpful the reading habits they had been inculcated with had worked. A girl from eighth standard picked up a book in English and read without any mistakes in clear diction while a few others read from books in Kannada related to freedom fighters and scientists. Then they sang a few patriotic songs.

Now, it was the turn of the motley group of exuberant women, mostly in their sixties and seventies, to become children. They started singing the nursery rhyme for kids, 'Head, Shoulder, Knees and Toes.' Led by 'Good Giver' Annie Taylor, who had taught little children in Ethiopia, they began on a slow pitch and accelerated. The children who joined them sang with gusto and joy.

Impressed by the kind of work done by the school and RLHP, Hilary Blume asked the Head Master, what else they required for their school. He said that they needed a water filter and a LCD screen projector. She promised to install both through the profits earned in The Green Hotel.

""The profit of every meal eaten in The Green Hotel helps buy an egg for a child or for the books of children,"" she told SOM.

The children then wanted to know more about the visitors and they introduced themselves. There were two Elizabeths, one from Canada and another from England, both of whom were doctors. There was Ann Kingston, who was the knitting teacher for the ""Knit for Peace"" group and Danielle Liebech, who had visited The Green Hotel five times and there was also the young L. Marie, originally from France, who is working with Hilary Blume.

After a satisfying visit at Kyathamaranahalli, the group moved towards Sathagalli, where there is a slum and another Government Higher Primary School. It was around 4.30 pm. The RLHP runs a nutrition programme here in the school premises. A few of the infants and children were sitting there along with their mothers. A young woman, fondly called Akhila aunty by the Sathagalli slum residents, had brought ragi porridge which had a healthy mix of pulses and greens like drumstick leaves.

Along with the porridge, the kids were also given boiled eggs. A few of the mothers told this reporter how useful this programme was, as it had helped their malnourished children gain weight and improve their health.

Then right next door was the Government Higher Primary School where in the evening free supplementary classes are run for the children. Children in the age group of six to 14 were sitting there quietly waiting for the classes to begin.

All of them in unison welcomed the idea of the evening classes and how they were all happy to be there studying.

RLHP Director Saraswathi asked one of the students to get up and welcome the visitors. A tenth standard student B.B. Mehak got up and welcomed the group. This girl, who is the Malala Yousafzai, (Nobel Laureate from Pakistan who is an activist for female education) of Mysuru, had stopped a child marriage in her area a couple of years ago.

One of the teachers, Seema, was a child labourer, who used to roll agarbathis. But today she has completed her Pre-University education because of the support of RLHP and Charities Advisory Trust.

The slum children here are so vibrant that when they were asked to sing a song, four girls got up and began singing Jalle Kabbu..., a folk song in faultless Kannada and dancing to choreographed steps. Asked for their names, they said Luhia, Simran, Husna and Rafia.

Everyone was moved by the effort that had gone into preparing the deprived sections of the society to face the world boldly.

""The Charities Advisory Trust is supporting many causes including the beauticians' course, nutrition programme, sponsoring health camps from the funds collected through Good Gift India. Their focus is also on libraries and they have helped setting it up in nearly 100 Government Higher Primary Schools,"" said Saraswathi.

Later, speaking to Star of Mysore, Hilary Blume said that 'Knit for Peace' is an initiative of the Charities Advisory Trust started as an income generation project for Hutu and Tutsi widows, victims of the Rwandan genocide and civil war.

""At our suggestion, the widows knitted school jumpers for the many orphans and we paid them by raising funds through featuring the project in Good Gift Catalogue, another of the Trust's initiative,"" said Hilary Blume.

""Good Gifts is an initiative started by me. This is a concept where the giver knows exactly where the money goes. Hence, we came out with Good Gifts Catalogue where people can identify with a range of causes; in fact, there are over 400 ways to help people take their first step out of poverty, enjoy better health and increased opportunities,"" she said and added, ""I ask the givers to come and see how the concept works. That is how I bring such people to visit Mysuru to see the schools and slums and how the money they have given is spent. Our next visit with the 'Knit for Peace' group is in early January,"" she said

Asked whether she believed like many others who are doing charity work that charity is also a business, Hilary Blume said, ""These are causes that I was introduced to, and continue to support, as I believe in them. I believe that once I give money, then the money is out of my hands to control. So it is important that I can trust those organisations I support. Administration is critical to keep a charity going, but too many big charities waste too much money.""

On whether she has written any books on charity having worked for more than 40 years in the field, she recalled five books titled, 'Fund Raising - A Comprehensive Handbook,' 'Accounting and Financial Management for Charities,' 'Charity Trading Handbook,' 'Museum Trading Handbook' and 'Charity Shop Handbook' she has written. Hilary Blume also revealed that she is penning the sixth one now called 'The Ethics of Charity Giving.'"

However, the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR), a state government department constituted under the Child Rights Act of 2005, aims to change this.

Next month, the DCPCR will undertake a rigorous assessment of 5,800 schools in the capital -- all of which are administered by the state government's education ministry and/or New Delhi's three municipal corporations- as a precursor to creating the country's first ever 'School Development Index' for a state.

Owing to the sheer number of schools involved and data required, earlier indices compiled by the government have focussed on the state or districts as a whole rather than individual schools.

Unde the School Development Index, Delhi's schools will be ranked according to three parameters, as devised by the Adhyayan Foundation - an NGO that focuses on capacity building of schools.

The first parameter is safety and security, the second is teaching and learning outcomes while the third parameter is community participation and social integration. Each school will be given a rank between 1 to 4 for each criteria, with 1 indicating that it has the most room for improvement.

The assessment of Delhi's schools is expected to continue into next year, with a final report from the DCPCR due in May. The government body has made sure to clarify that the exercise is not a punitive one but an instructive one. The exercise will give the administrators of these schools an insight into best practices and facilitate an environment for collaboration.

Education has long been a priority for the current state government of Delhi. When contesting state elections for Delhi in 2015, the made the improvement of education outcomes one of the core aspects of their platform.

So far, it seems that they have kept their word. For example, in July this year, the government launched libraries in 100 primary schools in the city, in addition to a 100 last year. In June, it announced the planned launch of a ' happiness curriculum' in government schools, which involves meditation and life skills training. They have also instituted school management committees, improved the infrastructure of schools and invested in teacher training."

The education official also claimed the provision of not reimbursing schools that are built on government land has always been in place, although its mention has been formalised thanks to the government resolution.

Scenes from two government schools in Delhi

The walls of the entryway of the school are covered with bright charts that talk about everything from sustainable development and 'Swachh Bharat' to 'happiness goals' and exam schedules. The cream-coloured floor gleams and the sun peeps out from the clouds behind the rows of students -- dupattas pinned, shirts tucked in, not a hair out of place -- sitting quietly for morning assembly. It's 8 a.m. on a hazy Delhi morning and this school in Dwarka Sector 10 is about to flip my perception of government schools completely.

""Government schools in India get a bad rap,"" says Principal T.P. Singh. ""But with RPVV, we try to do better."" The results are evident. The Dwarka branch of RPVV or Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya, along with its counterparts in Lajpat Nagar and Rohini Sector 11, are the three schools from Delhi that have made it to the nationwide list of top 12 government schools that's been compiled by EducationWorld portal as part of its India School Rankings 2017-18. In fact, the Dwarka school tops the list, with the Lajpat Nagar and Rohini schools at No. 6 and No. 12, respectively.

Labs and libraries

The RPVV schools, a Delhi government initiative to provide quality education to marginalised sections, were first opened in 1997, with one each in Rohini, Paschim Vihar and Surajmal Vihar. Twenty-one years later, there are 22 schools, with five of them launched last year alone.

All of them boast of language labs, upgraded auditoriums, relatively well-stocked libraries and, most importantly, a teacher-student ratio of 1:35. They take in students from Classes VI to XII and admissions are through an entrance test. Students are eligible only if they have studied in a government school for a minimum of two years.

When RPVVs were started as schools for high performers, they had the same shortcomings as other government schools -- poor infrastructure, undefined learning outcomes, dated teaching methods. ""But the last four or five years have seen a lot of change,"" says geography teacher Neerja Lamba, who has been with the school since 2003. ""We have a stress-free learning and teaching environment now. There are cultural activities and exchange programmes; students want to come to school,"" she says. Singh points out that the Delhi government has given the schools a free hand for improvements. ""For example, for any expenditure below ₹50,000, I don't have to write to the government. Little things like this make it so much easier.""

Over the past four years, the Delhi government has steadily increased funding for education, from 20% budgetary allocation in 2015 to 23.5% in 2017 and 26% in 2018.

The schools' improved infrastructure is testament to that. In the Dwarka branch, there's a fully air-conditioned auditorium, a conference hall open to both teachers and students, and a spanking new running track that instantly catches the eye. The labs have the latest equipment; there's a 'project development' room where students are recycling paper; and there are working water purifiers on every floor.

Robot Gangnam Style

The change is nowhere more perceptible than in the Rohini Sector 11 school, halfway across the city, where I find Class X student Prashant Kumar elbow-deep in a half-built drone. He is working after school hours in what the school calls the 'Atal Tinkering Lab'. ""I'm pretty sure I can get it to fly in a day or two; I just need to stabilise the gyro sensor,"" Kumar says confidently. His supervisor Vivek smiles behind him. ""That's going to need another month or two,"" he says. Close by, Class XII student Pratham Chopra's robot is dancing to 'Gangnam Style'. The coding took four months, says Chopra.

In the corner there is an actual 3D printer, the table around it littered with prototypes of printed whistles. The design's final version is now being used by the school's PT teachers. Science teacher Sadaf Fathima shows us a keychain printed in the shape of her name. The lab is the school's pride and joy, set up as part of the Central government's Atal Innovation Mission. Nearly 10,000 schools across the country applied for the grant, and RPVV-Rohini was among those to bag it in the first round.

Food, water, lessons

The one-year-old lab has sparked an interest in science among students, helping also to bring more girls in, say teachers. There are only three girls in the Class XII science stream this year, but the trend is beginning to slowly change in the younger classes, they say.

Social sciences teacher Shivani Singh says such facilities help immensely to address one of the biggest

problems of government schools: dropouts. In the Dwarka school, 63% of students come from families with monthly incomes below ₹5,000; their parents are rickshaw-pullers, labourers, sweepers, tailors, mechanics, domestic help, etc. When these students come into Class VI, they are undernourished, unable to take home school work, and, in some cases, have to contribute to the household income by taking up odd jobs.

But even as the dropout rate in Delhi government schools has been increasing, from 2.9% in 2014-15 to 3.4% in 2016-17 (Praja.org study), with worse results in municipal corporation schools, the RPVVs don't have any dropouts. ""Children want to do more than just study from textbooks. The 'more' is what we provide,"" says Shivani. ""They get clean water and nutritious food like dal chawal, daliya porridge, poori-sabzi. Girls get sanitary napkins,"" she says.

Walking through the school's corridors, both at Dwarka and Rohini, there is a steady stream of 'good morning' greetings around us. The students, free for the day after a gruelling exam, are not reticent and engage with their teachers comfortably. ""That took a lot of hard work,"" says Principal Singh. It was not just academics but also student-teacher relationships that needed overhauling. From improving teachers' listening and communication skills to newer teaching methods and learning objectives, ""we needed a change in pedagogy,"" says Singh.

A new pedagogy

It was this need that led him to begin the Cluster Leadership Development Programme, running now in all schools under the Directorate of Education in Delhi. ""We select 10 or so principals, area-wise, and get them to work with a facilitator-trainer. The principals, in turn, go back to their schools and work with the teachers,"" he says.

This has reduced teacher-student conflict, Singh says. ""And communication skills among students have improved; it's not great, but it's much better than what it used to be.""

The clubs and extra-curricular activities also play a big role. RPVV Rohini, for instance, has a Legal Advocacy Club where lawyers and judges address the children once a month. The Bal Bhavan Kendra is an arts and crafts initiative sponsored by the government's National Bal Bhavan in addition to regular art classes. I find a classroom filled with Madhubani paintings, wall hangings, home decor items, and more.

We walk into a room full of Class X students, and when they hear of their school's ranking, they break into ear-to-ear grins. Asked about their ambitions, they list scientists, doctors and more, but among them a handful says 'teacher'. They are as excited to teach in this school as they are to learn. The teachers accompanying us couldn't have been prouder."

The decision to convert hundreds of primary schools into English medium schools in districts like Karimnagar, Warangal and Nizamabad by teachers and its success led to the government giving the official nod to other schools across the State to follow suit.

As expected the enrolment rate in government schools has shot up. But the education experts think that despite the change in medium of instruction, it has had little effect on learning outcomes of government school students.

In 2016-17, for instance, 4,872 schools in the State were given permission to convert to English medium. Earlier back in 2008, in the united Andhra Pradesh, for the first time the then government had granted permission to run high schools with parallel mediums - 5,500 in Andhra and 2,200 Telagana area.

A social audit of learning outcomes carried out on 1,302 students from Class V to X by Campaign for Learning Outcomes, released last week confirmed this belief. It revealed that while 650 students could neither read nor write English, 271 could read only small sentences but not entire paragraphs.

Problem of parallel medium

Apart from granting the approval for change of medium of instruction, teaching community alleges, that the government did little to ensure that the move actually benefits students. In fact, the decision to run two parallel mediums is part of the problem. With the teacher-student ratio dismal in government schools, forcing one teacher to handle not just several classes but to even teach in two different languages.

""Most teachers are from Telugu medium background so for the sake for convenience they end up teaching in Telugu. Also, they find it difficult to alternate between Telugu in one period and English in the next. Students are not able to get acquainted with the language"" said T Venkateshwar Rao, President, English Language Teachers Association.

Proper training needed

The problem is further compounded by insufficient training of the lack thereof. For instance, in 2016, select primary teachers were provided five-day English language training. This was supplemented a year later by another five-day training for the same set of teachers.

""Now only a couple of teachers are trained from each school and later they too were transferred. Last academic year in Warangal, teachers from 132 primary schools have been trained but soon they got transferred to Telugu medium schools. This beats the very purpose of having English medium schools,"" said Nagati Narayana, an educationist.

Since a number of teachers themselves took the initiative to start classes in English medium and when it started showing positive results, teachers feel the government became complacent.

Improved training mechanism in terms of both quality and quantity

Post training, need for evaluation

The revamped 'CBSE Affiliation Bye-Laws 2018', brought out recently by the board has given more control to the state government over the functioning of such schools and also upcoming ones in the state.

The new bye-laws have also designated the state as the 'appropriate government' which would solely decide if the existing 1,300 CBSE schools in the state, as well as those in the pipeline, meet the prescribed norms in terms of infrastructure, safety, sanitation and land ownership. ""The CBSE would not re-check any aspects vetted by the state government during its inspection of schools,"" the bye-laws state.

The state government has also been given the power to bring in regulations on fees levied in CBSE schools. As per the bye-laws, fees would be charged as per the regulation of the appropriate government (state) and fee revision shall be subject to its laws, regulations and directions.

The 'Recognition' clause

Moreover, CBSE's insistence on 'recognition certificate' would be another crucial aspect which would enable the state government to make errant CBSE schools fall in line. Though CBSE schools in Kerala obtained a one-year relaxation from the board, all 1,300 plus schools will have to obtain it fairly soon from the state.

Aggrieved school managements had taken legal recourse and obtained a court verdict that schools which meet the prescribed norms are eligible for NOC.

""The government is planning to approach the court seeking more time for implementation of the order. Though we have no issues with the functioning of existing CBSE schools, permission for new ones will be subject to strict scrutiny as we do not want mushrooming of such schools without any regulation,"" said a top source in the government."

""I could no longer endure the constant bullying of the schoolboys. The boys wanted to touch me and made lewd remarks about me because I behaved like a girl, but that is who I really am,"" said Nikita, the once schoolboy who now identifies as a transgender.

Saying how the attitude of her teacher and principal made here question who she was, on Tuesday north Delhi resident Nikita addressed the principals of government schools and told them of her years of trauma while a student. She was speaking at an event organised to sensitise government schools about people like Nikita under the Purple Board project, being implemented by the Society for Peoples' Awareness Care and Empowerment (SPACE) in collaboration with the Directorate of Education and supported by the embassy of the Netherlands.

The first phase of the project, targeted at the ones in a leadership position, will create awareness among principals and teach them about gender identities, including transgenders and homosexuals, and issues like Article 377. On Tuesday, the principals were encouraged to designate one toilet in their school as a unisex one, to frame anti-trans bullying rules and to organise multi-gender activities in their institutions.

Santosh Gupta, principal of a Seelampur school, admitted that for inclusive education, it was important to embrace the transgender community. ""I agree that education is the only way in which we can empower people from disadvantaged communities. Along with us, it is also important that the parents are included in this awareness programme,"" said Gupta.

In another phase, sensitisation events will be held for the nodal teachers of a school and then for the secondary students of the schools involved. Following this, a school that is determined to be ""trans friendly"" will be given an award.

Sanjay Goel, director, DOE, asked the principals to accept people from gender communities and work for their empowerment. ""They have their own way of living and they should be accepted as an important part of inclusive education,"" said Goel.

Meanwhile, lauding the government for accommodating of the rights of transgender, Anjaan Joshi of SPACE pointed out that people belonging to that community faced several hurdles. ""The first and the foremost of the problems is there is no separate column for the third gender in school forms. Also, it has been quite a challenge to advocate the issue of transgender rights and inclusion in public schools,"" said Joshi."

The project will be implemented jointly with the Social Justice Department.

As part of its first step, the state government will start 1,000 pre-primary schools in the state with adequate facilities and necessary infrastructure by coordinating with the available anganwadis in the vicinity of government schools.

The schools will give stress on educating children through activities, games without using text books or slates. However, the government could not give a timeframe as to when it start the new system owing to delay in the release of fund from the Union Government. The schools will focus on a unified child-friendly curriculum encompassing physical, social, intellectual, and emotional development of the child.

The General Education Department has also decided to provide space for anganwadis in government schools where excess accommodation was available and pre-primary school was not functioning.

SCERT Director J Prasad told Express that the new curriculum will focus on activity cards rather than using textbooks.

""In an effort to make the pre-primary education system scientific, we are introducing a new curriculum. As part of this, we have already started activity cards named 'Kalithoni'. The cards have 30 different themes and the first part is the collection of 10 themes.

""The cards aim at children's physical, creative, language, scientific and social and emotional development. Besides children, the new programme will also benefit the pre-primary school teachers"", Prasad said.

""Apart from benefiting the children, it could also help to give a good pay to the teachers. The engaging of pre-primary staff by the PTAs could not be termed as statutory appointments by the government.

""Therefore, their claim for salary was not sustainable. Similarly, employees in the government sector, such as anganwadi workers, helpers and alternative school teachers, were paid only honorarium. So a hike in honorarium will be considered along with the project,"" Shahjahan said."

(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). With effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions.

The Samagra Shiksha scheme focuses on improvement of quality of education by providing support for different interventions like; in-service training of teachers and schools heads, conduct of achievement surveys at National and State level, provision of textbooks as per Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, ICT and digital initiatives, vocational education, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment has been increased and from this year provisions for library grants and grants for sports and physical education have also been introduced.

The Government has also launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities.

e PATHSHALA: a single point repository of e ­resources containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-­print materials.

The Central Government, supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme namely 'Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat' (PBBB) in foundational years of schooling.

(iii) MHRD, has launched a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform popularly known as SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) on 9 July, 2017. The portal is offering various online courses for school education and higher education. NCERT has been developing course modules for Massive Open and Online Course (MOOCs) for school education system in 12 subject areas (Accountancy, business studies, biology, chemistry, economic, history, geography, mathematics, physics, political science, psychology and sociology) for classes IX-XII. Twelve (12) courses and twenty one (21) courses have been completed in the first cycle and second cycle (completed on 30 Nov. 2018) on SWAYAM platform (https://swayam.gov.in/) respectively. Nearly 22,000 students and 30,000 students were registered in the first cycle and second cycle respectively.

(iv) CIET-NCERT has been assigned the task of developing e-resources for Master of Education (M.Ed.) course jointly with Allahabad University. One course (Educational Administration, Management and Leadership in School Education) has been completed first cycle on SWAYAM platform in which 2115 were enrolled.

State governments have increased their budgets for school education in the past three years, but the allotment of funds has not been enough to attract permanent qualified teaching staff to government schools, finds a recent study conducted across six States.

The report, prepared jointly by Child Rights and You (CRY) and the Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability (CBGA), examines budgeting for school education in six States -- West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra -- during the 14th Finance Commission recommendation period, which started in April 2015.

The study finds that there has been an overall increase in revenue with the States following the 14th Finance Commission recommendations. This was a result of an increase in the share of the States in the divisible pool of Central taxes from 32% to 42%. At the same time, a reduction in the Union government's contribution to the States for Central schemes in social sectors forced the States to improve their tax revenue collection. The study analyses whether the availability of additional funds translated into prioritising of school education in these six States.

Between 2015-16 and 2017-18, there was a net decline in the share of school education budget in the total State Budget for three of the six States, according to the detailed demand for Grants and State Budget documents. Bihar saw a dip of 3.1%, Maharashtra a drop of 1% and West Bengal 0.9%. On the other hand, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh saw an increase in the size of school education budget by 0.4%, 2.6% and 3.2%, respectively.

The report examines whether the increase in the size of school education budget was more than the rise in size of the total budget, indicating a higher priority for the sector. It concluded that between 2014-15 and 2017-18, Uttar Pradesh saw a 98.8% increase in budget for schools, whereas its total budget increased by 63.3%. West Bengal's budget for school education increased by 49.4% while its total budget increased by 48.2% and in Tamil Nadu, the former increased by 38.7% but the total budget increased by 38.5%, indicating that school education was a priority for these three States.

At the same time, all the six States showed an increase in the magnitude of per-child and per-student spending for education between 2014-15 and 2016-17.

Despite a varying level of commitment towards school education across the six States, all of them struggle with a shortage of teachers. The report cites data from the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development to show that as on March 2017, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have from 19% to 34% of total teacher positions at the elementary level vacant. Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu were relatively better with 5.9% and 2.6% posts unfilled.

Data from the District Information System for Education show that at the upper primary level, there is a severe paucity of subject-specific teachers required under the Right to Education Act -- 77% upper primary schools in Maharashtra, 46% in Uttar Pradesh, 40% in West Bengal and 37% in Bihar do not have subject teachers.

More than one lakh schools in India are run with only one teacher and all the six States surveyed have shown the number of such schools on the rise. The shortage of teachers is more acute at the secondary level -- Bihar has 20,494 teaching posts vacant, Chhattisgarh 8,278 and Uttar Pradesh 12,008.

The figures don't entirely capture the severity of the shortfall as they do not reflect the shortage of subject teachers."

In Agra, police had to intervene in at least six cases to free cows locked in schools and public health centres. On Saturday, villagers locked up stray cows in a school in Garhi Bachchi. A day earlier, cattle were locked up inside a primary school at Arela village in Etmadpur tehsil. Uttar Pradesh: Over 700 Stray Cows Locked in School, Health Centre in Aligarh.

Officials of the Basic Education department had to intervene to get the premises vacated for children who had been forced to stay away from classes.

Farmers rued that the bovines were destroying crops. ""Cows and bulls have become a huge nuisance, eating crops and destroying greenery,"" complained a farmer of Barauli Ahir block, Ramesh. Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath Instructs Officials to 'Ensure Shelter for Stray Cows'.

A farmer from Bichpuri, Ram Bharosey, said a groups of villagers with sticks in hands have to keep moving around to ensure the cattle were kept away from fields. Several farmers also raised concern over what they called as 'population explosion' of cattle.

People do not know what to do with cattle which are usually chased away towards the urban clusters. The bulls in the city have caused several fatal accidents, they said. When contacted, the district authorities said plans for providing new pasture land and cow shelters will take time for implementation."

Bhadiya, who took charge as headmaster only a year ago, told how implementation of various programmes helped increase student enrolment from less than 200 to 222 this year.

""From this year, the publicity campaign for Utsav Vidyarambha has been launched on a massive scale.

Yet the evidence is mounting that UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath cares more about the welfare of cows than people inhabiting his state. Consider his latest order that in case of encroachers on grazing land, the encroachments be removed immediately and strict action initiated against the accused. As Adityanath continued to drive his administration hard on ill-conceived cow schemes, irate farmers in Aligarh locked up stray cows inside classrooms while schoolchildren and teachers were left in the lurch.

In truth, the scale of the problem unleashed by Hindutva-inspired curbs on cattle trade is unmanageable. A 2012 livestock census found 3.9 crore cows in UP. Six years later, imagine many of these cows past their productive age roaming the countryside and cities in search of food. No government is in a position to earmark shelters or grazing lands for such a huge population. Adityanath's desperate search for cow welfare solutions is bound to fail and he must instead focus on the rising farm anger against stray cows now directed at government property like schools and hospitals. Even those encroaching grazing land deserve a better reason than stray cows to be asked to go.

Farmers have paid dearly for this proliferation of stray cows. Unable to sell unproductive cows and now struggling to fend off stray cows from fields, it has been a double whammy for them. Reviving the cattle trade will solve these problems. In light of growing agrarian distress BJP should not lose sight of the fact that it is humans, not cows, who will be voting at the hustings."

(HT File)

After four rounds of admissions, less than a quarter of the 1,400 reserved seats on offer in the city's private schools for differently abled students were filled this year. This has prompted the government to carry forward the vacant seats to the next academic year.

Hindustan Times had reported last week that the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) had invited fresh online applications for 1,268 entry-level reserved seats for a fourth round of admissions to the current academic year which has just three months left.

On Wednesday, the draw of lots were held for these seats but only 123 were filled. The DoE cited ""lack of applications"" for the large number of seats going vacant.

""Of the 125 applications we received during the fresh round of admission, 123 candidates were absorbed. The selected candidates have to approach the allotted school on or before December 31,"" DoE director Sanjay Goel said.

According to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (PWD) Act, 2016, three per cent of the total number of seats meant for the economically weaker section and disadvantaged groups (EWS/DG) category are reserved for children with disabilities.

Goel said that the department will carry forward the remaining reserved seats to next academic session (2019-20). ""The seats will be counted in the category during next year's admission,"" he said. The notification of admission in the entry level classes under the 25% reserved seats for the EWS/DG category is likely to be announced in the first week of January, next year.

Officials in the DoE said that they are planning to organise awareness campaigns among parents to motivate them to apply.

""There is lack of awareness among parents about the reserved seats because this was the first time the quota was introduced within the 25% EWS/DG seats. We are planning to organise campaigns to aware parents from the coming admission session,"" an official said.

Experts, however, said that the ""lack of inclusiveness"" in schools make parents reluctant from applying. ""Though the situation in private schools is better than the government schools, parents of children with disabilities are still reluctant from applying there. They think their kids will only be able to adjust in special schools. More efforts need to be put in to make campuses more inclusive by appointing trained special educators and providing better infrastructure facilities,"" said Dr Satender Singh, disability rights activist."

While rebuilding by the government agencies in different parts of the state is only in the initial stages, the UP and LP schools which remained half submerged in the flood waters for over five days suffering huge damage to their facilities, have come back to life. In the forefront of the effort to revive them was the Deepalaya Trust in Delhi which lost no time in identifying the devastated schools and offering its help.

In a commendable operation coordinated by A J Philip, Deepalaya executive officer and eminent journalist; Dr George Mathew, Chairman, Institute of Social Sciences, New Delhi; and A J Abraham, social activist in Ernakulam, the rebuilding of the school started in right earnest in September itself and the work was completed within two months.

The so-called government red-tapes and delays were overcome with the strong support provided by the school authorities, including the AEO Latha, school headmaster V K Santhosh, panchayat president T G Anoop, Cartoonist Academy and the local people.

The Trust spent Rs 33 lakh in replacing the damaged computers, reconstructing the collapsed compound walls, removing the slush and debris from the compound and classrooms, laying tiles on the floors, painting the walls and re-equipping the library. Soon, other NGOs joined hands, including 'Human Values' and 'Rapid Response' of Pondicherry, which replaced the old furniture, desks and benches with modern ones.

Now the schools sport a completely new look and none who visits the place will realise that these were the ones the floods had ravaged only a few months ago. To celebrate its rejuvenation, the school organised a function on Saturday, which was attended by Sethu, writer and former chairman of South Indian Bank, Dr George Mathew, Cartoon Academy members, panchayat president, ward members, school children, parents, teachers and local people."

These schools would be merged with upgraded high schools in phases, starting with the institutions, which have less than 50 students, education department officials said on Thursday.

Initially, 3,732 middle schools having less than 50 students would be undertaken for merger. The process of merging has already been started.

""Merger is an effort to provide quality education to students in a better educational ambience. Jharkhand has around 411 such middle schools where number of students is less than 10. If these schools are merged with high schools, students would get better education,"" said state education secretary AP Singh.

""As per the rules in the right to education (RTE), there should be at least three trained graduate teacher (TGT) in middle schools where number of students is less than 100.

The decision comes at a time when the opposition parties and critics have been criticising the state government for merging the primary schools. Several ruling party elected representatives have also been lobbying with the government against the move. There have been protests in several parts of the state as well, against merger of schools.

The officials, however, argue that, ideally, there should be one middle school and five to seven primary schools in a panchayat. As many as 6,466 middle schools have been identified in Jharkhand, which could be merged with high schools within a 5-km radius in a panchayat, Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) officials said.

The state government has decided to offer bicycles to the students, who would be shifted to other schools so that they do not face any trouble in commuting to the school.

Meanwhile, the JEPC officials said they have completed the merging exercise of 4,600 primary schools.

JEPC director Uma Shankar Singh said there were 39,600 schools in 2016-17 under education department in Jharkhand. ""Of them, 18,000 schools had 60 or few students. These schools had an average of 1 or two teachers per school. Providing quality education was a major challenge. One teacher was handling four to five classes at a time. How could one expect a better education in these schools,"" he said.

The council said four-step process including field inspection, cross-district verification, block and district consultation and final notification to merge the schools.

Singh said 98% students from the 4,600 primary schools have been shifted and 96% students have expressed satisfaction with the consolidation. ""We faced difficulty to shift 150 students due to some technical reasons. Now, the issue is resolved and 120 students were shifted,"" he said.

The reorganisation of primary schools benefited seven lakh students with better teachers' availability and reduced the requirements of teachers by 4,500. Besides, the process saved government's Rs 400 crore through reduced teachers and infrastructure requirements, JEPC officials said.

Sisodia said, ""Barring few exceptions, once the child completes elementary schooling and joins the secondary class, his entire orientation, which is largely shaped by the teachers and parents, is to secure good marks in exams, get admission in a good college and get a job with decent pay package after completing education.

Ludhiana DC Pardeep Aggarwal sent SDM, Samrala and other officials to the school. The SDM called NHAI officials to the school. I heard the SDM telling NHAI officials that the school had to be saved at any cost and NHAI officials were asked to shift the toll plaza,"" he says.

Sanjeev pursued the issue till NHAI issued a fresh notification in October saying that the toll plaza would be shifted.

It is an incident secretary, education Krishan Kumar will not forget anytime soon. ""I could see his desperation and determination to save the school. Village residents were also committed to the cause. Such teachers deserve complete support. The Ludhiana deputy commissioner also took great interest in the endeavour and we are all happy with the result,"" he says.

Education dept steps in

It is remarkable that despite their tough circumstances, government school teachers are trying to bring about a qualitative change in their institutions.

""I learnt that a few teachers in the state improved their schools on their own, because of which more students got enrolled. In February, we called a meeting of such teachers. As they spoke about their experiences, we thought the idea was worth replicating across the state and called on principals and teachers to volunteer,"" says Krishan Kumar.

The officer pursued reforms in the education department during his previous stint as director general, school education for almost three years.

""By July, we had 425 schools with buildings turned into learning aids, improved infrastructure, amenities and sports facilities. The idea was to improve students' learning experience. We fixed the ambitious target of ""Mission 4,250"" by the beginning of the next academic session and asked these 425 teachers to motivate their friends and relatives in 10 other schools. Already, 1,700 schools have accomplished the task,"" he says.

According to the secretary, education, these teachers and communities are the biggest stakeholders in improving educational standards.

""Social accountability is much more result-oriented than departmental accountability,"" he said.

Incentives offered to teachers include transfer of choice, promotion and good ACR. ""All these benefits are non-monetary and the huge improvement in schools is without any extra burden on the state exchequer,"" Kumar adds.

Govt primary school, Jhans, Hoshiarpur

The school had just 17 students when Narinder Arora and his wife Manjit Kaur, both ETT teachers, joined in 2006. Now, there are 224 students. In an act that inspired trust, the couple got their daughter enrolled in the same school.

""There was nothing going for the small school but we decided to do everything possible to set things right. Apart from enrolling my daughter here, we motivated a few friends and fellow teachers to enroll their children as well. We assured them that their children's education or overall development would not suffer. Rather, we said they would see a marked improvement. My son is a UKG student here,"" said Narinder.

The teachers' dedication showed in exam results and students' performance in co-curricular activities.

""Soon, educated families also started sending their children to the school. We also had our own uniform,"" says Narinder Arora.

With this, village residents started pooling money for infrastructure upgrade. ""Philanthropists opened their hearts and pockets to us. Jalandharbased Satpal Singh Multani constructed two rooms. Jagjeet Singh

Government Primary School, Nathewal

The Mathematics room in the school is its latest addition. The walls of the verandah have pictures of donors and those of well turned out students on a board with the title, Ajj De Sohne Bache (the smart children of today).

""We write names of five children on this board every day to inspire the children to remain clean,"" says teacher Ajmer Singh who started the transformation in 2007.

""When I joined the school, two snakes were found in the storeroom,"" he recalls. It is now an office.

Outer walls and walls inside the classrooms have paintings, poems and messages painted on them. ""We want to attract students. Coming to school should be a pleasant experience for them,"" he says. It has worked with the children. ""Tanvi, a Class II student sustained an injury on her Jeeta and his family in the village opened their house for us to accommodate 100 students as the school did not have enough space,"" Arora said, estimating that people spent around Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh on the school.

Two years back, they started kindergarten classes on the lines of private schools. ""Now, we get children in nursery and have around 125 kids in kindergarten,"" he says. In June, Arora was promoted as master in a secondary school.

""It was very difficult for me to leave the school and children. Residents literally pleaded with me to stay. When a village elder asked me to stay in a choked voice, I decided to decline the promotion. After this, village residents provided 56 marlas of land to the school and raised a boundary wall. Now, we have enough space,"" he says, adding that they need the education department to provide more teachers as the strength of students is increasing.

""NRIs and other villagers have helped to improve the school. Now, the entire village is involved. People from other villages also come to get their children enrolled here. We have transferred 56 marlas of land to the school. If the number increases, we will provide an acre-and-a-half more of Panchayat land to the school,"" says Jagjeet Singh.

finger last year. But she came to school the next day,"" Ajmer says. According to him, NRIs and philanthropists from outside the village pitched in and around Rs 22 lakh has been spent so far.

""Apart from improving the amenities, I have been focusing on the core issue - improving learning outcomes among students,"" he adds. The school has a sprawling park and playground. Students have mid-day meals on tables with granite tops.

Rurka Kalan (Jalandhar)

The village has two government primary schools - one for girls and one for boys. In ambience and facilities, these schools could give private schools a run for their money.

Walls of both government primary schools have been turned into learning aids for children. They also have libraries and reading rooms. The girls' school also has an LCD screen to screen educational programmes.

""When I joined on July 1, 2006, the school building was in bad shape, with doors and windows missing. There were around 80 students but not a single bench. The first thing to do was to get desks for students before winter. The Youth Football Club of Rurka Kalan, which is working to promote football in the area, helped us procure desks at a cost of Rs 50,000,"" says school teacher Sanjiv Kumar, the man behind the transformation.

This was just the beginning. Over the years, infrastructure, education and sports in the school were upgraded.

""Philanthropists spent Rs 19 lakh on the school. With the way things have come up, more donors are volunteering,"" he says.

At Government Primary School for Girls, Buta Ram, who was promoted as centre head teacher and shifted to the boys' school a few days back, brought about the transformation.

""My daughter studies in this school. After I joined here in 2013, we managed to mobilize resources and undertake works worth around Rs 22 lakh,"" he says.

The school has its own logo and calendar. Numbers and letters are painted on the walls and a park based on the theme of mathematics is being constructed. Sanjiv and I are competing with each other to improve our schools,"" smiles Buta Ram.

Both schools have well-furnished and neat kitchens to cook mid-day meals.

The boys' school is in stark contrast with the street. The backyard of the adjoining senior secondary school is also overrun with weeds like a dark reminder of how things used to be and what could happen if these efforts are not sustained.

SETTING AN EXAMPLE

Secretary education, Krishan Kumar gets pictures from the pathbreaking schools. Every day, he picks the picture of one school and forwards it on WhatsApp groups of the education department. This motivates the others and generates healthy competition. The schools are promoting extra-curricular activities and helping students speak English

TAKING THE LEAD

As school infrastructure is improved, teachers feel more motivated. They share ideas and help each other even while competing. Sometimes, we spend from our own pockets as bonding with schools and children has improved,"" says Ashok Basra, principal, Government Senior Secondary School, Jamsher Khaas near Jalandhar.

He has now been asked to guide other schools in the district"

They aren't sure if the authorities would do all that is needed to enhance the quality of government schools and bring them on a par with private ones.

Notably, Section 3 of the Act, which is considered the core of the legislation, provides children the fundamental right to free and compulsory education in a neighbourhood school.

According to the proposal, if there's a government school in neighbourhood of a child -- within 1km for primary education and 3km for higher primary -- he/she should get admitted to that instead of a private school.

Nagasimha G Rao, state convener of the RTE task force, said, ""The government is citing the example of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where government schools are in high demand. We're in touch with RTE activists there too. But the Karnataka scenario is different. Parents prefer English medium schools over government institutions.""

Mohammed Yousuf, a Marappa Garden resident and parent of a child who's an RTE beneficiary, said, ""I don't think government schools are up to the mark. They don't have good English teachers and lack infrastructure. Moreover, the nearest government school in our area is located on defence land, can be accessed by every passerby and has a dumpsite too. My son will not be safe.""

Education department officials admit that no new government school has been opened in the state in the past three years.

Citing a 2017 study by the RTE Forum, a national organization, which states that 90% of RTE students paid fees to private schools,Y Mariswamy, chairperson (in charge), Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights said, ""We get a lot of complaints from parents. It is sad that students are still made to pay fees at private schools despite being admitted under RTE. As we are the monitoring body for RTE and as well as child protection laws, I feel this move will give a boost to government schools and put in place systems required in these institutions.""

Niranjan Aradhya, senior fellow and programme head, Universalisation of Equitable Quality Education Programme, Centre for Child and the Law, NLSIU, said: ""This is a chance for government schools to improve. The government just needs to do a few basic things like recruit more English teachers and upgrade schools to the level of Kendriya Vidyalayas. To make RTE effective, they need to implement section 12(2) of the RTE Act which mandates private unaided schools receiving government largesse to reserve seats for weaker sections from their neighbourhood without the state having the obligation to reimburse them. Delhi has been following this since 2004."""

But this doesn't translate into government owning and running schools.

No matter which way one looks at it, there is no widespread market failure in school education. There is the matter of supporting poor children, but as far as the supply of high-quality supply is concerned, there is overwhelming evidence that the market is competent to do so without any government involvement.

On the other hand, there is overwhelming evidence of the failure of government education. As the Secretary to the government of Assam for Education in the early 1990s, I quickly became aware of how the Minister of Education (in a Congress government in my time) used the appointment and transfers of teachers as the key mechanism to extract bribes. The director of education of Assam was the conduit for this. The entire system was totally broken: many schools only existed on paper and ""teachers"" drew salaries when there was nothing on the ground.

The seriously misguided policy idea that the government must directly own and run schools came about as a result of a grievous error of analysis made by Lord Macaulay nearly two hundred years ago. This misconception continues till today among the ""educated"" who are not aware of the ground reality. The socialist Aam Aadmi Party's misplaced passion for government schools is one such example, and discuss my meeting on this issue with a senior AAP leader some other time.

The ""educated"" typically have a belief that parents won't send their children to school unless they are compelled by the state to do so. It is believed that given a chance, poor parents prefer to deploy their children as child labour. But the reality is that - as James Tooley's research has confirmed this fact that was well-known to many of us - all over India hundreds of millions of poor parents are sending their children to for-profit low-cost private schools. Roughly a third of India's poor children attend such schools.

Further, that some parents may indeed deploy their children as labour (extremely rare today) is actually the inevitable consequence of socialist policies that make parents view education dimly - as not being worthwhile since it won't improve their children's job prospects. There is a strong factual basis for this perception since millions of low quality ""graduates"", who are totally unsuited for the job market, are found unemployed today across India in second-tier towns and in the villages. Let's us, therefore, agree that there is no one more keenly interested in the welfare of their children than the parents. We must harness this powerful force instead of rejecting it.

Second, there is a mistaken belief that a school must have significant infrastructure and paraphernalia, or that its teachers must necessarily be ""highly qualified"". But as Gandhi said in a speech at Chatham House in 1931: ""the schools established after the European pattern were too expensive for the people"" and ""The village schools were not good enough for the British administrator, so he came out with his programme. Every school must have so much paraphernalia, building, and so forth"".

Gandhi, therefore, said: ""I defy anybody to fulfil a programme of compulsory primary education of these masses inside of a century. This very poor country of mine is ill able to sustain such an expensive method of education. Our State would revive the old village schoolmaster and dot every village with a school both for boys and girls"". What a brilliant thought! - except that there must not be any direct role for the state even in such schools.

James Tooley's book, The Beautiful Tree, shows that children who attend low cost for-profit private schools (including in India) achieve much higher educational outcomes than children from comparable government schools, despite such private schools having virtually no infrastructure and the teachers of such schools not even being ""adequately"" qualified. The reason these schools succeed while government schools fail is that teachers in the private schools are held to account for outcomes by the Principal, who is often the school owner. These for-profit undertakings depend critically on demonstrating real results in order to continue to get the custom of the poor parents who pay a small fee on a monthly basis and will quickly switch their child to a competing school if they don't' see significant progress each month.

Tooley's research enables us to totally dispense with the myth that government schools are required to educate children. This research has also confirmed Gandhi's assertion that excellent village schools operated in India prior to British rule. These schools functioned from the houses of the teachers, did not need a vast paraphernalia of infrastructure, and all sections of the community were able to send their children to these schools to avail high quality, low-cost education. In Shanti Niketan, Rabindranath Tagore was basically attempting to replicate this form of education, with a focus on learning and not on facilities or infrastructure.

Unfortunately, Macaulay's misplaced paternalism injected government into schools in India and was also copied by the UK, which had an entirely private (or local) school education system prior to that. In both cases, the effect was harmful, as the number of students and quality of education plummeted. Till today, an average government school across the world performs much worse than an average private school, barring a few exceptions.

We noted at the outset that the government must support the poor to access education - to ensure equality of opportunity. There is a simple and direct way to achieve this without owning and running schools, by providing vouchers of certain nominal value (depending on the income level of parents) for each poor child up to year 12 that can only be exchanged for school education (including for vocational education). This is our party's policy. These vouchers would enable the children of poor parents to attend a good for-profit private school.

The idea of vouchers has a long history and has also been tried out in a number of ways across the world, although not in the full-blown manner that's our party's policy. Milton Friedman is probably best known for his advocacy of this system but his ideas did not go far enough. He was willing to allow competition between private and government schools but our party does not see any role whatsoever for even a single government school. Our party is committed to the total privatisation of all government schools - in a well-structured manner.

The alignment of incentives when parents choose (and themselves fund, even if to a small extent) for-profit private schools is the best way to quickly and significantly improve India's dismal quality of school education.

Our party would, of course, remove most regulations in this area, such as requirements for infrastructure, playgrounds or even for the qualification of teachers. The market will determine who is best placed to teach. All we would require is that each school pick an affiliating board (such as CBSE, but that would need to be disbanded and private boards would emerge) and demonstrate high quality student outcomes in order to be eligible for the school vouchers. This would be an outcomes-based regulatory system, with detailed management (including things like the medium of instruction) left to schools and parents: the parties with the deepest direct interest in outcomes.

We therefore disagree with things like the Right to Education Act which we see as a socialist anachronism. India needs to fully liberate the education sector to allow the best private sector initiatives to emerge, unfettered by the misguided notions of any delusional (and mostly corrupt) bureaucrat or minister.

The government has sufficient core work to perform, in which it has repeatedly failed. When Indian governments can't deliver security and justice, how can they possibly deliver education? Today India is led by a government which can't distinguish between mythology and cosmetic surgery, between homeopathy and medicine. So what makes us think it can teach our children?"

Bengaluru: Acting tough on students on rampant usage of mobile phones in schools and colleges, the Department of Public Instruction has issued a circular prohibiting the use of mobile phones in all primary, high school and pre-university colleges in the State.

A Nov.22 circular, issued by the Department of Pre-University Education, says that the students of PU institutions coming under the PU Board, including government, aided and private colleges, are barred from using mobile phones during college.

The circular has been issued as per instructions from Chief Minister H .D.

The circular comes amidst rising concerns over the rampant use of mobile phones by teachers and students.

This order has been updated to hold headmasters and headmistresses of government schools responsible for ensuring that teachers and students do not use phones during school hours."

The Government of Maharashtra is mulling to make Marathi a compulsory subject in schools for students studying classes one to ten, India Today has reported.

On Tuesday (20 November), Minister for Education Vinod Tawde said that the proposal is being considered by the government.

The minister gave the above reply while addressing a question raised by Shiv Sena MLA Vilas Potnis, claimed the report. He had highlighted that states like Bengal, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Kerala has made it compulsory for the students between Class I and X to learn the local language.

However, the minister later told reporters that the proposal is 'difficult' to implement.

It was reported in 2016 that an earlier proposal of teaching everyone Marathi till class 7 was opposed by certain education institutions in the state. They contended that such a move should not be made mandatory for students coming from other states or outside India. One school also complained that it had found it tough to hire a Marathi teacher.

The survey found that 88% students were allegedly beaten up, as a matter of routine, multiple times a week in some government schools, while in other government schools, around 30% experienced corporal punishment multiple times. All 50 students from low-cost public schools, who were part of the survey, reported that they were beaten up.

On an average, almost half of the children interviewed were allegedly beaten by teachers multiple times a week. The report, Choking Childhood, is based on the findings of research undertaken by social organisation Agrasar, which works with disadvantaged communities.

A total of 521 children and 100 parents sampled randomly were surveyed, and an informal group interview with 12 teachers from two different government schools was undertaken.

There are around 130 primary government schools in Gurugram, from which the students were randomly selected. There are around 18,000 students in the primary schools, as per estimates.

The Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, prohibits 'physical punishment' & 'mental harassment' under Section 17(1) and makes it a punishable offence under Section 17(2).

""The report studies the impact of corporal punishment on the psyche of children who are doubly disadvantaged by virtue of them being children who are predominantly from poor migrant communities and first-generation learners,"" said Prerit Rana, co-founder and CEO of Agrasar. He added that corporal punishment in schools was not only a violation of human rights, but also impaired the health and education of the children.

According to the report, 70% of the children reported that they were beaten at home after parents learnt that they were beaten in school. More than 70% of the parents said that they beat their children, as they believe punishment is for their child's well being.

The report also outlined the challenging working conditions and lack of professional conduct among teachers in government schools fostered an environment that puts deprived children at risk of experiencing corporal punishment.

Responding to the findings of the report, Premlata Yadav, the district elementary education officer said, ""I will have to see the report to know how the survey was conducted. I do not agree with the findings of the report. One can expect 1-2% of such cases but it is incorrect to say that 80% of the children are beaten.""

Yadav added that teachers are not allowed to punish students and strict action is taken if such a complaint is raised. ""If we receive information of this nature, we warn the teachers and sometimes, it can also lead to their suspension. We take strict action on reports of corporal punishment,"" she said.

A Sanskrit teacher at a government school said that corporal punishment is rarely doled out. ""Teachers rarely beat students. However, sometimes children do not understand and teachers are compelled to take matters into their hands. I do not raise my hands at my students. I either ask them to do rounds of the ground with their hands raised up or call their parents,"" she said."

Subject-wise performance evaluation of students from government and private schools from the state, revealed the performance of government school students to be poorer than private schools in all districts, apart from Hyderabad where the performance was on par.

Looking at the data, it should not be a surprise that parents prefer shelling out more money in sending their children to private schools for education than government for better education. As per available data, more than half of the about 48 lakh students studying in various schools in Telangana, are studying in private schools.

For example, while the performance of students from government schools in Nalgonda was 31 per cent and 33 per cent in Mathematics and Science, it was 39 per cent and 40 percent respectively by private school students. Similarly, while the performance of government school students in Karimnagar in Social Science and English subjects was 38 per cent and 34 per cent respectively, it was 46 per cent and 56 per cent in private schools.

Only in Hyderabad, the difference between performance of government and private school students was not significant.

Urban-rural divide also deep

Significant difference in performance of students in various subjects has also been observed with respect to whether a student belongs to rural or urban area, indicating the disparity in quality of education received by students depending on where they belong from.

In the NAS it has been observed that in all districts of the state the performance of students in urban areas is higher than those from rural areas. For example, in Rangareddy district while the performance of students in Mathematics and Science in rural areas was found to be 33 per cent and 35 per cent respectively, in the urban areas it was 41 per cent in each subject. Similar is the case in all other districts.

Caste affects spoken English

The NAS also highlights the need for ensuring that education reaches every student equitably, regardless of the caste of the student. Significant difference has been found in the performance of students from the general category and those from the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes.

A difference of almost 5-10 per cent was observed in the performances of students from general categories as compared to those from reserved categories. The difference was prominent in all the subjects that students study at the high school level.

However, the difference is most pronounced, as much as 15 per cent, in case of English language. For example, while the students belonging to the general category had an average performance percentage in Mathematics of 41 per cent while English had 50 per cent. On the other hand, among the students from Scheduled Castes it was 31 per cent and 35 per cent respectively."

At a time when Government talks about ""Digital Literacy "" how is it possible that people especially students don't have access to electricity? Despite the obvious connection between electricity and educational achievement, however, the troubling scenes in Jammu and Kashmir are repeated as there are thousands of Government run schools without electricity. Present and past Governments in J&K, have been focusing on administrative affairs of education department or even pedagogy, but very little focus has been given to electricity in Government schools. The absence of focus on this issue is detrimental because, a study has put it like this, ""education is also widely recognized as one of the most essential components for poverty reduction"". Lack of electricity at primary, middle and secondary schools therefore creates considerable obstacles towards escaping poverty and correlates with many factors that contribute directly towards it. It is a big impediment towards digital literacy as well because when there is no electricity in a Government school, the children will have no access to computers and other digital equipment. The report on link between education and poverty assesses the direct link between electricity and education.

Based on the most recently available survey data from the World Bank and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the report first describes the current state of electrification of schools. According to the this data, roughly four out of every five primary and secondary schools in African countries (Govt and Private schools) surveyed lacked access to electricity, along with almost three quarters of village schools in India. This is much worst in Jammu & Kashmir state as more than 70 percent Government schools are un-electrified in this 21st century. When it comes to Kashmir division, more than 80 percent of Government schools are un electrified and these details I have been provided officially by several Chief Education Officer (CEOs) when I sought details under Right to Information Act (RTI). In Jammu province also the majority of Government schools in Rajouri , Poonch , Doda , Ramban , Reasi , Kishtwar and Doda are still un electrified.

Based on a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and policy literature concerning electricity and education, the report mentioned above assesses the educational benefits of electrification of primary and secondary schools, including lighting and access to information and communications technologies (ICT) as well improvement in staff retention and student completion and graduation rates. The final two main parts of the report, drawn from energy policy, development studies, and innovations in financing and public private partnerships literature, discuss the challenges facing school electrification, such as lack of financing and technical problems with equipment, along with the solutions and incentives with the potential to overcome them, such as Public Private Partnerships (PPPs).

Rajouri , Srinagar

At a time when Government of India is celebrating achievement of 100 percent electrification feat across country, information available reveals some astonishing facts. As per the Government figures, there are 1720 Govt schools in Rajouri district and out of them 1484 (over 86 percent) don't have access to electricity. Out of 1720 Government schools in Rajouri district , there are 995 primary, 557 middle, 117 high and 41 higher secondary schools. In addition to these there are 6 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalyas (KGBV) across the district.

In Srinagar district, more than 300 Government schools have not been provided electricity connection by Government till date. More than two years have passed since Government had ordered to get all the schools electrified. In Srinagar there are around 519 Govt run schools out of which there are 204 primary schools, 211 middle schools, 74 high schools and 30 higher secondary schools. Out of the 519 Govt schools, there are around 305 schools which are still un electrified.

Budgam, Ganderbal

In Budgam district there are more than 81 percent Government run schools which are un-electrified. This is an official information that was provided to me by Chief Education Officer (CEO) of Budgam under RTI Act. CEO Budgam informed me in his reply that there are around 1,036 schools in the district out of total 1278 that are ""without proper electricity connection"". Actually I had sought the details of all the un electrified Govt schools in Kashmir valley under RTI Act. I filed application before the designated Public Information Officer (PIO) in the Directorate of School Education Kashmir (DSEK). Instead of providing the information , PIO passed the buck to all the Chief Education Officers (CEOs) of Kashmir valley plus Leh and Kargil . That is why I got the details from each district. I also sought information about the number of girls' schools without a toilet facility and the number of schools without a proper electricity connection, boundary wall and drinking water facility. CEO Budgam in his reply said that ""all"" the girls' schools had a washroom facility, ""there are dysfunctional toilets "".

In Ganderbal district out of 587 government schools, 434 schools are un electrified which means around 83 percent Government schools have no access to electricity. These details were revealed by Chief Education Officer (CEO) Ganderbal in a reply to my Right to Information (RTI) application.

Conclusion

Why is Government compromising on providing the basic infrastructure to Government schools while as no such compromise is done when it comes to perks and salaries of Government employees especially Govt school teachers ? Infrastructure and level of education is coming down in Govt schools , but this is not the case with Government's own employees ? Their salaries continue to be hiked. Govt spends more than Rs 1.40 lakhs every month on an average Government school in J&K. Do poor kids enrolled in these schools get the desired facilities ? On contrary to this, not even Rs 50,000 is spent on an average private school in J&K by local school management, but the results are quite different. Board of School Education (BOSE) collected an amount of Rs 16.81 crores from students in shape of exam fees in Kashmir valley recently, but the class Xth & XIIth students were forced to write exams under candle light as there is no facility of gen-sets in the exam centers. Not even heaters are made available in Govt schools (exam centers) by BOSE and children are made to shiver in the cold. I have been forced to seek intervention of J&K State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) where I filed a petition recently.

I hope to get some good direction soon from SHRC. Imagine kind of trauma poor kids are facing in classrooms during June , July and August when temperature rises above 30 degree in valley and more than 40 in Jammu plains or in Rajouri , Ramban or Poonch districts ? After missing the initial deadline of May 2017, the Narendra Modi government on April 29th this year announced ""electrification"" of all inhabited villages in India has been completed.After having all the data available vis a vis un electrified schools in J&K , it clearly indicates that announcement by Government was largely symbolic. In a state where 75 to 80 percent Government schools are still un electrified how can Government claim to have achieved 100 percent electrification target ? How can Government claim to achieve digital literacy target in future if Govt schools are not electrified?

""My children go to a private school Madam, it is close to home, they learn English and mathematics"", says Selvi with a big smile on her face. Selvi, a Marathahalli-based domestic worker, like many others from low income households in Bangalore, finds private schools a better choice for her child.

Research has often pointed out that there is not much difference in the learning outcomes of children in government schools and in private schools. Yet in Bengaluru, like many urban centres in the country, children across income groups are flocking to private schools. While the number of private schools are rapidly rising, government schools are increasingly being merged/shut down in the name of low student enrolment. The narrative around government schools remains one of poor accountability and infrastructure, poorly trained or absent teachers, poor attendance and pass rates of students.

In 2016-17, Bangalore Urban had 1403 government schools, and almost thrice as many - 3426 - private schools. Student enrolments illustrate the trend better. That year, only 1.8 lakh children were enrolled in government schools, compared to nearly 11 lakh children in private schools.

The most commonly cited concern about government schools is the lack of sufficient, well-qualified teachers.

Dr V P Niranjan Aradhya, Programme Head (Right To Education) at the Centre for Child and Law, NLSIU, points out that there were over 28,000 vacancies for government elementary school teachers in Karnataka as of 2016-17. ""The number of sanctioned posts was 1.94 lakh, but only 1.66 lakh teachers were working then. The department has been talking about plans to recruit teachers, but currently poorly-paid guest teachers are being appointed in many vacancies,"" he says.

Given the low rate of enrolment in government schools in the city, there are schools with only 10-15 students spread across grade 1-5, or schools that have only 30 students overall from class 1-7. Such schools often have only one or two teachers. These teachers have to teach every subject to students across all grades, even if they are not qualified for it, says Aradhya. Teachers are also burdened with additional duties and administrative tasks. There are even schools in the city that lack a Headmaster, requiring one among the skeletal teaching staff to do the additional administrative tasks of the HM.

Anurag Behar, Vice Chancellor at Azim Premji University, says the low quality of schools comes down to the poor quality of teacher education. Behar was part of the implementation committee for the Justice J S Verma Commission report on teacher education. The Justice Verma Commission, set up by the Supreme Court, had pointed out in its 2012 report that the majority of Teacher Education Institutions (TEI) in the country were highly commercial private establishments.

Behar says: ""In the 1960s, India had only about 1300 TEIs. In the early 1990s, it was about 1500. Then, between 1993 and 2011, this number rose to about 16,000. In this period, the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) gave licenses to many private institutions that were fraudulent and corrupt; many of these institutions don't even hold classes."" He says that out of nearly 18,000 TEIs in the country now, about 92% are private.

Other issues pointed out by the Verma Commission Report include: teacher education curriculum remaining unchanged for over 65 years, TEIs being standalone institutions rather than being part of universities, the generalist nature of M.Ed programmes etc. The Commission had in fact reviewed 291 TEIs in Maharashtra, and recommended that 85% of these should be shut down.

Though much of the Commission's recommendations have been ignored, there have been a few initiatives such as the centre's budget announcement this year to introduce an integrated B.Ed course. ""But what about the existing 16,000-odd TEIs that are of low quality? Nothing much has been done about those,"" says Behar.

While shortage of qualified teachers is a major concern, both Aradhya and Behar say that teachers are not respected or incentivised enough in the education system. Teacher absenteeism - i.e., absence without a valid reason - has been blamed for much of the shortcomings of government schools.

But a 2016 study by Azim Premji Foundation (APF) across over 600 schools in six states including Karnataka, had shown that teacher absenteeism was only 2.5%. However, the overall teacher absence was around 19%, which was due to other administrative or departmental work they were assigned, trainings, or legitimate leaves; that is, teachers were absent due to systemic issues rather than a lack of professionalism.

The current system, wherein teachers' promotions are based entirely on tenure, hardly incentivises high-performing teachers as well.

Bengaluru's government schools are also affected by bureaucratic procedures like frequent teacher transfers. ""The transfer process is lengthy, and happens just a few months into the academic year. Events like elections can delay it even more. Neither the teacher nor the students would know if the teacher would remain in the school that year. This affects consistency in academic inputs,"" says Kapil Dawda, Bengaluru City Director for the non-profit Teach for India. Teach for India's fellows work as full-time teachers in low-income schools; currently they work with 24 government schools in the city.

Jean Boddu, Senior Program Manager at Mentor Together, another non-profit that works with government schools, says the distribution of bags and books to students also gets delayed by 2-3 months from the start of the academic year. ""Also, there is a huge dropout of students in 9th standard, as students who are academically weak are neglected, and fail exams."" Boddu says such students are not supported well enough as the school is worried that its 10th standard pass percentage may drop down if they continue there.

In terms of infrastructure, Bengaluru's government schools do have basic infrastructure like toilets and electricity, but in many cases the infrastructure is not functional. For example, schools that have toilets may lack water; or the toilet is kept locked. There is little investment in the operation and maintenance of existing infrastructure. In Bengaluru, corporates have adopted many government schools, providing funds, books, infrastructure etc.

Dawda says that schools located in areas like Whitefield which have a high concentration of corporates, tend to have better essential infrastructure because of this. ""Government schools in these areas often have a science lab, computer lab etc., which schools in areas like Ejipura or Goripalya don't have,"" he says. Since such philanthropic work is not streamlined and coordinated by the Department of Public Instruction, the results are often skewed and less effective.

In education system, the Cluster Resource Person (CRP) who oversees some 10-12 government schools per cluster, is the academic authority, says Aradhya. ""CRP has to monitor the quality of learning process, but he usually ends up doing administrative work and collecting data from schools. Parents also don't know that it's the CRP they have to approach, to hold their child's school accountable,"" he says.

The Karnataka School Quality Assessment and Accreditation Council (KSQAAC) routinely assesses government schools in the state and accredits them. Schools have to undergo both a self-assessment and external assessment, and are graded on multiple aspects like learning achievement, learning environment and physical environment. They are then given accreditation in grades ranging from A+ to D.

The Council has routinely ranked schools poorly. In 2014-15, for example, it had assessed 1220 government schools, 917 aided schools and 24 unaided schools in the state. In Bangalore Urban overall (Bangalore North and South educational districts combined), out of 78 schools, no schools got A or A+ grade, and only eight got B+. Sixteen schools got B grade, 33 got C+, 17 got C and four schools got D grade.

Aradhya opines that the accreditation system is useless as long as there is no initiative to improve the quality of schools. ""If the government is providing functional infrastructure, recruiting teachers and monitoring the learning process in schools, then it has the right to give accreditation. Else, continuing this exercise without doing anything to improve quality, only sends the message that government schools are bad,"" he says.

While government schools compulsorily have to submit to the KSQAAC accreditation process, private schools are not bound to. In the current system, private schools can participate in the accreditation process if they want to, by paying a fee to KSQAAC. Very few usually do.

Currently there isn't a system to assess private schools on their quality. The majority of private schools in Bangalore are low-income schools without adequate infrastructure or well-qualified teachers. However parents are keen to send their children to these schools because of the English language education offered, and the general perception that these schools are better.

Accountability remains the core difference between public schools and private ones, according to Shashi Kumar D, General Secretary of KAMS (Associated Management of Private Schools in Karnataka). ""There are issues with private schools, they are not isolated from the problems of running a school. For example there may be a lacuna with the lessons offered, or the hire of unskilled teachers. But because of the pervasive accountability in these establishments the teachers increase their skills, knowledge and teaching ability,"" Kumar says.

However, research has often showed that there isn't much of a difference in the quality of education in government and private schools. World Bank's World Development Report 2018 says that, in the 40 countries it researched on, including India, there were no differences in the learning outcomes of children in private and public schools, given that they had matching familial backgrounds. Any marginal difference was because private schools mainly admitted students from advantaged backgrounds. That is, student performance depended on the student's household, and not the quality of education offered by the school. Another study by APF in rural Andhra Pradesh in 2015 had shown similar results.

Behar says, ""There would be less than 2% private schools that are elite and actually have the resources to run a high quality school. But even their quality of education is suspect. The remaining low-fee private schools are mostly much worse in quality."" Behar says there would be only 10-15% private schools that are truly committed to providing good quality education. ""For the rest, it is a business,"" he says.

Dr Shalini Rajneesh, Principal Secretary (Primary and Secondary Education Department), says that government school students often lack a good support system. ""First-generation school goers cannot study the way a typical private school student studies - by rote. There are no support systems for public school students, no remedies and no help at home. That is why, now we are attempting to bring a more holistic form of learning; and we are doing this along with NGOs across the city, like Akshara.""

Whether government schools will in fact get the right support, or whether they will continue to be shut down further in the name of low enrolment, remains to be seen."

The government had introduced digital classrooms in high schools, infused of ICT as part of pedagogy, brought in subjects like robotics in residential schools, and most recently, made over government schools by turning their walls into canvases.

However, it seems their efforts don't prove much because the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE), National Achievement Survey (NAS) by MHRD, and the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) have thoroughly highlighted the poor quality of government schools in Telangana, with respect to infrastructure as well as quality of education being imparted.

In fact, compared to the data published in the UDISE for the academic year 2014-15, this year's report revealed that not much has changed in government schools since TRS had come to power. One glaring example is that of computer availability in government schools, which has actually gone down to 36 percent from being 37.5 percent in 2014, as per the UDISE numbers. In secondary schools, it has increased slightly from 29 to 31 percent.

When it comes to matters of infrastructure in primary schools such as having boundary walls, single-room classrooms, playgrounds, and kitchen sheds, the data indicates stagnancy. While studies showed that there was a steady improvement in the performance of residential schools run by the social welfare department -- where just about 15 per cent of students studied -- other government schools like the zilla parishad schools were constantly ignored.

Another example is that of science laboratories in secondary schools. The percentage of schools having Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Computer and Maths labs have down to 17.6, 17.5, 16.9. 11.7 and 6.3 percent from 19.3, 19.2, 18.5, 12.7 and 8 percent respectively.

Poor quality of education

Various reports released in the last four years raised questions over the quality of education being imparted in government schools of Telangana. For example the NAS report released this year pointed out that performance of school students in Telangana in all the subjects was poorer than that of students from most districts of other southern states.

Even the Comptroller and Auditor General in its audit report released this year pulled up the Telangana government as it found that 14-26 percent children in primary schools and 21-47 percent children in upper primary schools scored less than 40 percent in the years 2014-17. It also pointed out issues like unhygienic conditions of kitchens in schools used for cooking midday meals.

TRS government can't walk the talk?

It's no news that the TRS government has never forgone an opportunity to talk about its achievements in residential educational institutions run by the social welfare department. Good performance of students in SSC exams, competitive exams, academic and extra-curricular initiatives has often been the talk of the town during TRS rule.

However, government teachers point out that these residential schools -- home to jus10 percent of the 22 lakh students enrolled in different government schools across the State -- are not run by the Department of School Education (DSE) and receive ample funds, as a result they deliver better results. The government is all-talk when it comes to these schools and mum when it comes schools that come under the DSE.

The stark difference could be seen in this year's SSC results as the pass percentage in residential schools was above 90 percent whereas in zilla parishad schools it was just about 75 percent.

Telangana State United Teachers Federation, general secretary, Chava Ravi, said, ""Around 20,000 teacher positions are vacant in government schools. The TRS government has not recruited a single teacher since 2014, even though the TRT was announced for 8,972 posts last year.""

""There are several schools where one to two teachers teach 5 classes and cover 18 subjects. Moreover, in this academic year, school maintenance funds have not been released yet by the State government and the amount is expected to go down with the merger of SSA (Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan) and RMSA (Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan).

Negative marks for TRS government on school fee regulation issue : Parents

Parents across the State have been crying hoarse demanding fee regulation. The Hyderabad Schools Parents Association (HSPA) has conducted many protests on this issue, including writing a post card to the Chief Minister and producing a song chiding him for not taking any action on the issue. The post even went viral on social media.

These protests and promises by the government -- especially the education minister -- notwithstanding, the TRS government has failed to address problems of exorbitant fee. The State government constituted a committee to look into the issue, headed by former Osmania University Vice Chancellor, Prof Tirupati Rao. The committee was formed in March 2017 and was supposed to submit its report in the next one month. It actually did so only in December. It's a year since the report was submitted, but it has not been made public yet. The government did not even form the district fee regulatory committees."

Furthermore, the bench directed the authorities concerned to file their counter affidavit by December 6. It also impleaded the Director of State Council for Education, Research and Training, as a party.

According to the petitioner, there are about 37,211 government schools, 8,403 government aided and 12,419 private self-financing schools, imparting education to about 1.25 crore students. Around 40 lakh students study in 12,419 private schools. The State spends Rs 27,000 crore for education per annum.

Although as per the State's education policy, English is taught as the second language from Class 2 to 12 in Tamil medium aided and unaided schools, despite having successfully completing Plus Two with high marks, a student was unable to speak or understand any communication in English.

Moreover, he was also unable to converse or write fluently in English.

This leads to communication problems for him when he pursues professional courses or higher education that are imparted only in English.

However, the students who study in CBSE schools find it easier to understand and communicate in English. Therefore, a need has arisen to lay emphasis on spoken English, said the petitioner."

Just that morning a few of them had visited the Government Urdu Higher Primary School at Nachanahalli Palya on Manandavadi Road and soon after lunch, nearly ten of them led by Dame Hilary Blume (Director, The Green Hotel and Founder, Charities Advisory Trust in UK) were ready to hop into the mini bus and visit a few more schools run by the Government of Karnataka.

As the bus drove towards the congested Kyathamaranahalli and entered a small lane, the women, who alighted from the bus, were surprised to see a clean, well-maintained Government Higher Primary School. There was a welcome committee with the Head Master of the School V. Ramaswamy, a disciplined, dedicated teacher and H. Saraswathi, the Director of RLHP (Rural Literacy and Health Programme) who is coordinating with Charities Advisory Trust, greeting the group of lively women.

Walking up a flight of stairs that led to the library of the school at the far end, the students, both boys and girls, all dressed neatly in green uniforms got up shyly but most of them immediately recognised the familiar of face of Dame Hilary Blume, who is no stranger to Mysuru.

""Do you recognise Madam Hilary?"" asked the Head Master and most of the students immediately recalled her earlier visit to the school. The library is well- equipped with books, desks and benches (all funded by the Charities Advisory Trust) and the visitors were keen to see how many students were really into reading the books.

A few of the students got up to demonstrate how helpful the reading habits they had been inculcated with had worked. A girl from eighth standard picked up a book in English and read without any mistakes in clear diction while a few others read from books in Kannada related to freedom fighters and scientists. Then they sang a few patriotic songs.

Now, it was the turn of the motley group of exuberant women, mostly in their sixties and seventies, to become children. They started singing the nursery rhyme for kids, 'Head, Shoulder, Knees and Toes.' Led by 'Good Giver' Annie Taylor, who had taught little children in Ethiopia, they began on a slow pitch and accelerated. The children who joined them sang with gusto and joy.

Impressed by the kind of work done by the school and RLHP, Hilary Blume asked the Head Master, what else they required for their school. He said that they needed a water filter and a LCD screen projector. She promised to install both through the profits earned in The Green Hotel.

""The profit of every meal eaten in The Green Hotel helps buy an egg for a child or for the books of children,"" she told SOM.

The children then wanted to know more about the visitors and they introduced themselves. There were two Elizabeths, one from Canada and another from England, both of whom were doctors. There was Ann Kingston, who was the knitting teacher for the ""Knit for Peace"" group and Danielle Liebech, who had visited The Green Hotel five times and there was also the young L. Marie, originally from France, who is working with Hilary Blume.

After a satisfying visit at Kyathamaranahalli, the group moved towards Sathagalli, where there is a slum and another Government Higher Primary School. It was around 4.30 pm. The RLHP runs a nutrition programme here in the school premises. A few of the infants and children were sitting there along with their mothers. A young woman, fondly called Akhila aunty by the Sathagalli slum residents, had brought ragi porridge which had a healthy mix of pulses and greens like drumstick leaves.

Along with the porridge, the kids were also given boiled eggs. A few of the mothers told this reporter how useful this programme was, as it had helped their malnourished children gain weight and improve their health.

Then right next door was the Government Higher Primary School where in the evening free supplementary classes are run for the children. Children in the age group of six to 14 were sitting there quietly waiting for the classes to begin.

All of them in unison welcomed the idea of the evening classes and how they were all happy to be there studying.

RLHP Director Saraswathi asked one of the students to get up and welcome the visitors. A tenth standard student B.B. Mehak got up and welcomed the group. This girl, who is the Malala Yousafzai, (Nobel Laureate from Pakistan who is an activist for female education) of Mysuru, had stopped a child marriage in her area a couple of years ago.

One of the teachers, Seema, was a child labourer, who used to roll agarbathis. But today she has completed her Pre-University education because of the support of RLHP and Charities Advisory Trust.

The slum children here are so vibrant that when they were asked to sing a song, four girls got up and began singing Jalle Kabbu..., a folk song in faultless Kannada and dancing to choreographed steps. Asked for their names, they said Luhia, Simran, Husna and Rafia.

Everyone was moved by the effort that had gone into preparing the deprived sections of the society to face the world boldly.

""The Charities Advisory Trust is supporting many causes including the beauticians' course, nutrition programme, sponsoring health camps from the funds collected through Good Gift India. Their focus is also on libraries and they have helped setting it up in nearly 100 Government Higher Primary Schools,"" said Saraswathi.

Later, speaking to Star of Mysore, Hilary Blume said that 'Knit for Peace' is an initiative of the Charities Advisory Trust started as an income generation project for Hutu and Tutsi widows, victims of the Rwandan genocide and civil war.

""At our suggestion, the widows knitted school jumpers for the many orphans and we paid them by raising funds through featuring the project in Good Gift Catalogue, another of the Trust's initiative,"" said Hilary Blume.

""Good Gifts is an initiative started by me. This is a concept where the giver knows exactly where the money goes. Hence, we came out with Good Gifts Catalogue where people can identify with a range of causes; in fact, there are over 400 ways to help people take their first step out of poverty, enjoy better health and increased opportunities,"" she said and added, ""I ask the givers to come and see how the concept works. That is how I bring such people to visit Mysuru to see the schools and slums and how the money they have given is spent. Our next visit with the 'Knit for Peace' group is in early January,"" she said

Asked whether she believed like many others who are doing charity work that charity is also a business, Hilary Blume said, ""These are causes that I was introduced to, and continue to support, as I believe in them. I believe that once I give money, then the money is out of my hands to control. So it is important that I can trust those organisations I support. Administration is critical to keep a charity going, but too many big charities waste too much money.""

On whether she has written any books on charity having worked for more than 40 years in the field, she recalled five books titled, 'Fund Raising - A Comprehensive Handbook,' 'Accounting and Financial Management for Charities,' 'Charity Trading Handbook,' 'Museum Trading Handbook' and 'Charity Shop Handbook' she has written. Hilary Blume also revealed that she is penning the sixth one now called 'The Ethics of Charity Giving.'"

However, the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR), a state government department constituted under the Child Rights Act of 2005, aims to change this.

Next month, the DCPCR will undertake a rigorous assessment of 5,800 schools in the capital -- all of which are administered by the state government's education ministry and/or New Delhi's three municipal corporations- as a precursor to creating the country's first ever 'School Development Index' for a state.

Owing to the sheer number of schools involved and data required, earlier indices compiled by the government have focussed on the state or districts as a whole rather than individual schools.

Unde the School Development Index, Delhi's schools will be ranked according to three parameters, as devised by the Adhyayan Foundation - an NGO that focuses on capacity building of schools.

The first parameter is safety and security, the second is teaching and learning outcomes while the third parameter is community participation and social integration. Each school will be given a rank between 1 to 4 for each criteria, with 1 indicating that it has the most room for improvement.

The assessment of Delhi's schools is expected to continue into next year, with a final report from the DCPCR due in May. The government body has made sure to clarify that the exercise is not a punitive one but an instructive one. The exercise will give the administrators of these schools an insight into best practices and facilitate an environment for collaboration.

Education has long been a priority for the current state government of Delhi. When contesting state elections for Delhi in 2015, the made the improvement of education outcomes one of the core aspects of their platform.

So far, it seems that they have kept their word. For example, in July this year, the government launched libraries in 100 primary schools in the city, in addition to a 100 last year. In June, it announced the planned launch of a ' happiness curriculum' in government schools, which involves meditation and life skills training. They have also instituted school management committees, improved the infrastructure of schools and invested in teacher training."

The resolution, issued on November 1, has also directed education inspectors to check attendance records of students who were given admission under the 25 per cent quota of the RTE Act before disbursing reimbursements to the schools.

The education official also claimed the provision of not reimbursing schools that are built on government land has always been in place, although its mention has been formalised thanks to the government resolution. Moreover, different directives have been given to the education department after a meeting held in September of higher officials from education and sports departments.

This apart, education officers have also been asked to visit schools to check if audit reports have mentioned the school fees, to hold meetings with parents and ask them about the fees charged by the schools, and to check for schools that were given government land on a lease for minimal charges. Moreover, the schools themselves will also have to mention fees charged for classes I to VIII on the SARAL government portal.

""The rule of not reimbursing schools that got land from the government was always there in the RTE norms. But it wasn't present in any government resolution form, which has now been rectified by the government.

Scenes from two government schools in Delhi

The walls of the entryway of the school are covered with bright charts that talk about everything from sustainable development and 'Swachh Bharat' to 'happiness goals' and exam schedules. The cream-coloured floor gleams and the sun peeps out from the clouds behind the rows of students -- dupattas pinned, shirts tucked in, not a hair out of place -- sitting quietly for morning assembly. It's 8 a.m. on a hazy Delhi morning and this school in Dwarka Sector 10 is about to flip my perception of government schools completely.

""Government schools in India get a bad rap,"" says Principal T.P. Singh. ""But with RPVV, we try to do better."" The results are evident. The Dwarka branch of RPVV or Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya, along with its counterparts in Lajpat Nagar and Rohini Sector 11, are the three schools from Delhi that have made it to the nationwide list of top 12 government schools that's been compiled by EducationWorld portal as part of its India School Rankings 2017-18. In fact, the Dwarka school tops the list, with the Lajpat Nagar and Rohini schools at No. 6 and No. 12, respectively.

Labs and libraries

The RPVV schools, a Delhi government initiative to provide quality education to marginalised sections, were first opened in 1997, with one each in Rohini, Paschim Vihar and Surajmal Vihar. Twenty-one years later, there are 22 schools, with five of them launched last year alone.

All of them boast of language labs, upgraded auditoriums, relatively well-stocked libraries and, most importantly, a teacher-student ratio of 1:35. They take in students from Classes VI to XII and admissions are through an entrance test. Students are eligible only if they have studied in a government school for a minimum of two years.

When RPVVs were started as schools for high performers, they had the same shortcomings as other government schools -- poor infrastructure, undefined learning outcomes, dated teaching methods. ""But the last four or five years have seen a lot of change,"" says geography teacher Neerja Lamba, who has been with the school since 2003. ""We have a stress-free learning and teaching environment now. There are cultural activities and exchange programmes; students want to come to school,"" she says. Singh points out that the Delhi government has given the schools a free hand for improvements. ""For example, for any expenditure below ₹50,000, I don't have to write to the government. Little things like this make it so much easier.""

Over the past four years, the Delhi government has steadily increased funding for education, from 20% budgetary allocation in 2015 to 23.5% in 2017 and 26% in 2018.

The schools' improved infrastructure is testament to that. In the Dwarka branch, there's a fully air-conditioned auditorium, a conference hall open to both teachers and students, and a spanking new running track that instantly catches the eye. The labs have the latest equipment; there's a 'project development' room where students are recycling paper; and there are working water purifiers on every floor.

Robot Gangnam Style

The change is nowhere more perceptible than in the Rohini Sector 11 school, halfway across the city, where I find Class X student Prashant Kumar elbow-deep in a half-built drone. He is working after school hours in what the school calls the 'Atal Tinkering Lab'. ""I'm pretty sure I can get it to fly in a day or two; I just need to stabilise the gyro sensor,"" Kumar says confidently. His supervisor Vivek smiles behind him. ""That's going to need another month or two,"" he says. Close by, Class XII student Pratham Chopra's robot is dancing to 'Gangnam Style'. The coding took four months, says Chopra.

In the corner there is an actual 3D printer, the table around it littered with prototypes of printed whistles. The design's final version is now being used by the school's PT teachers. Science teacher Sadaf Fathima shows us a keychain printed in the shape of her name. The lab is the school's pride and joy, set up as part of the Central government's Atal Innovation Mission. Nearly 10,000 schools across the country applied for the grant, and RPVV-Rohini was among those to bag it in the first round.

Food, water, lessons

The one-year-old lab has sparked an interest in science among students, helping also to bring more girls in, say teachers. There are only three girls in the Class XII science stream this year, but the trend is beginning to slowly change in the younger classes, they say.

Social sciences teacher Shivani Singh says such facilities help immensely to address one of the biggest

problems of government schools: dropouts. In the Dwarka school, 63% of students come from families with monthly incomes below ₹5,000; their parents are rickshaw-pullers, labourers, sweepers, tailors, mechanics, domestic help, etc. When these students come into Class VI, they are undernourished, unable to take home school work, and, in some cases, have to contribute to the household income by taking up odd jobs.

But even as the dropout rate in Delhi government schools has been increasing, from 2.9% in 2014-15 to 3.4% in 2016-17 (Praja.org study), with worse results in municipal corporation schools, the RPVVs don't have any dropouts. ""Children want to do more than just study from textbooks. The 'more' is what we provide,"" says Shivani. ""They get clean water and nutritious food like dal chawal, daliya porridge, poori-sabzi. Girls get sanitary napkins,"" she says.

Walking through the school's corridors, both at Dwarka and Rohini, there is a steady stream of 'good morning' greetings around us. The students, free for the day after a gruelling exam, are not reticent and engage with their teachers comfortably. ""That took a lot of hard work,"" says Principal Singh. It was not just academics but also student-teacher relationships that needed overhauling. From improving teachers' listening and communication skills to newer teaching methods and learning objectives, ""we needed a change in pedagogy,"" says Singh.

A new pedagogy

It was this need that led him to begin the Cluster Leadership Development Programme, running now in all schools under the Directorate of Education in Delhi. ""We select 10 or so principals, area-wise, and get them to work with a facilitator-trainer. The principals, in turn, go back to their schools and work with the teachers,"" he says.

This has reduced teacher-student conflict, Singh says. ""And communication skills among students have improved; it's not great, but it's much better than what it used to be.""

The clubs and extra-curricular activities also play a big role. RPVV Rohini, for instance, has a Legal Advocacy Club where lawyers and judges address the children once a month. The Bal Bhavan Kendra is an arts and crafts initiative sponsored by the government's National Bal Bhavan in addition to regular art classes. I find a classroom filled with Madhubani paintings, wall hangings, home decor items, and more.

We walk into a room full of Class X students, and when they hear of their school's ranking, they break into ear-to-ear grins. Asked about their ambitions, they list scientists, doctors and more, but among them a handful says 'teacher'. They are as excited to teach in this school as they are to learn. The teachers accompanying us couldn't have been prouder."

The decision to convert hundreds of primary schools into English medium schools in districts like Karimnagar, Warangal and Nizamabad by teachers and its success led to the government giving the official nod to other schools across the State to follow suit.

As expected the enrolment rate in government schools has shot up. But the education experts think that despite the change in medium of instruction, it has had little effect on learning outcomes of government school students.

In 2016-17, for instance, 4,872 schools in the State were given permission to convert to English medium. Earlier back in 2008, in the united Andhra Pradesh, for the first time the then government had granted permission to run high schools with parallel mediums - 5,500 in Andhra and 2,200 Telagana area.

A social audit of learning outcomes carried out on 1,302 students from Class V to X by Campaign for Learning Outcomes, released last week confirmed this belief. It revealed that while 650 students could neither read nor write English, 271 could read only small sentences but not entire paragraphs.

Problem of parallel medium

Apart from granting the approval for change of medium of instruction, teaching community alleges, that the government did little to ensure that the move actually benefits students. In fact, the decision to run two parallel mediums is part of the problem. With the teacher-student ratio dismal in government schools, forcing one teacher to handle not just several classes but to even teach in two different languages.

""Most teachers are from Telugu medium background so for the sake for convenience they end up teaching in Telugu. Also, they find it difficult to alternate between Telugu in one period and English in the next. Students are not able to get acquainted with the language"" said T Venkateshwar Rao, President, English Language Teachers Association.

Proper training needed

The problem is further compounded by insufficient training of the lack thereof. For instance, in 2016, select primary teachers were provided five-day English language training. This was supplemented a year later by another five-day training for the same set of teachers.

""Now only a couple of teachers are trained from each school and later they too were transferred. Last academic year in Warangal, teachers from 132 primary schools have been trained but soon they got transferred to Telugu medium schools. This beats the very purpose of having English medium schools,"" said Nagati Narayana, an educationist.

Since a number of teachers themselves took the initiative to start classes in English medium and when it started showing positive results, teachers feel the government became complacent.

""Teachers at government schools are suffering because of the government's apathy. Saturday's incident was not the first time when a teacher was assaulted by a student.

The revamped 'CBSE Affiliation Bye-Laws 2018', brought out recently by the board has given more control to the state government over the functioning of such schools and also upcoming ones in the state.

The new bye-laws have also designated the state as the 'appropriate government' which would solely decide if the existing 1,300 CBSE schools in the state, as well as those in the pipeline, meet the prescribed norms in terms of infrastructure, safety, sanitation and land ownership. ""The CBSE would not re-check any aspects vetted by the state government during its inspection of schools,"" the bye-laws state.

The state government has also been given the power to bring in regulations on fees levied in CBSE schools. As per the bye-laws, fees would be charged as per the regulation of the appropriate government (state) and fee revision shall be subject to its laws, regulations and directions.

The 'Recognition' clause

Moreover, CBSE's insistence on 'recognition certificate' would be another crucial aspect which would enable the state government to make errant CBSE schools fall in line. Though CBSE schools in Kerala obtained a one-year relaxation from the board, all 1,300 plus schools will have to obtain it fairly soon from the state. ""Earlier, once the NOC was obtained, we had no business with the state government. We only needed to renew our affiliation every three years with the CBSE.

""If the school managements have concerns about the state government getting a decisive role in affiliation process, it can be addressed through dialogue with all stakeholders,"" she said.

'NOC a policy matter'

General Education Secretary A Shajahan said the grant of NOC to CBSE schools is a 'policy decision' which needs to be taken at the highest level. Since the LDF Government assumed power, fresh NOC has not been granted to any CBSE school. Aggrieved school managements had taken legal recourse and obtained a court verdict that schools which meet the prescribed norms are eligible for NOC.

Though we have no issues with the functioning of existing CBSE schools, permission for new ones will be subject to strict scrutiny as we do not want mushrooming of such schools without any regulation,"" said a top source in the government."

Santosh Gupta, principal of a Seelampur school, admitted that for inclusive education, it was important to embrace the transgender community. ""I agree that education is the only way in which we can empower people from disadvantaged communities.

The project will be implemented jointly with the Social Justice Department.

As part of its first step, the state government will start 1,000 pre-primary schools in the state with adequate facilities and necessary infrastructure by coordinating with the available anganwadis in the vicinity of government schools.

The schools will give stress on educating children through activities, games without using text books or slates. However, the government could not give a timeframe as to when it start the new system owing to delay in the release of fund from the Union Government. The schools will focus on a unified child-friendly curriculum encompassing physical, social, intellectual, and emotional development of the child.

The General Education Department has also decided to provide space for anganwadis in government schools where excess accommodation was available and pre-primary school was not functioning.

SCERT Director J Prasad told Express that the new curriculum will focus on activity cards rather than using textbooks.

""In an effort to make the pre-primary education system scientific, we are introducing a new curriculum. As part of this, we have already started activity cards named 'Kalithoni'. The cards have 30 different themes and the first part is the collection of 10 themes.

""The cards aim at children's physical, creative, language, scientific and social and emotional development. Besides children, the new programme will also benefit the pre-primary school teachers"", Prasad said.

He, however, is apprehensive about the fund for implementing the project. ""We had long back submitted a project report to the union government for the funds. However, the funds are yet to be released. If the Centre doesn't sanction the funds, the state government has decided to move on with the state funds,"" said Prasad. General Education Secretary A Shahjahan said the SCERT and Samagra Shiksha Abhiyaan are on the job to implement the programme.

""Apart from benefiting the children, it could also help to give a good pay to the teachers. The engaging of pre-primary staff by the PTAs could not be termed as statutory appointments by the government.

""Therefore, their claim for salary was not sustainable. Similarly, employees in the government sector, such as anganwadi workers, helpers and alternative school teachers, were paid only honorarium. So a hike in honorarium will be considered along with the project,"" Shahjahan said."

(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). With effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions.

The Samagra Shiksha scheme focuses on improvement of quality of education by providing support for different interventions like; in-service training of teachers and schools heads, conduct of achievement surveys at National and State level, provision of textbooks as per Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, ICT and digital initiatives, vocational education, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment has been increased and from this year provisions for library grants and grants for sports and physical education have also been introduced.

The Government has also launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities.

e PATHSHALA: a single point repository of e ­resources containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-­print materials.

The Central Government, supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme namely 'Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat' (PBBB) in foundational years of schooling.

(iii) MHRD, has launched a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform popularly known as SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) on 9 July, 2017. The portal is offering various online courses for school education and higher education. NCERT has been developing course modules for Massive Open and Online Course (MOOCs) for school education system in 12 subject areas (Accountancy, business studies, biology, chemistry, economic, history, geography, mathematics, physics, political science, psychology and sociology) for classes IX-XII. Twelve (12) courses and twenty one (21) courses have been completed in the first cycle and second cycle (completed on 30 Nov. 2018) on SWAYAM platform (https://swayam.gov.in/) respectively. Nearly 22,000 students and 30,000 students were registered in the first cycle and second cycle respectively.

(iv) CIET-NCERT has been assigned the task of developing e-resources for Master of Education (M.Ed.) course jointly with Allahabad University. One course (Educational Administration, Management and Leadership in School Education) has been completed first cycle on SWAYAM platform in which 2115 were enrolled. The second cycle of this course is offered from 2 July 2018.

Besides, an online course on action research for teachers is conducted in regular intervals in the MOODLE platform (http://ictcurriculum.gov.in/ ). Post Graduate Diploma in Guidance and Counselling for in-service teachers is also offered through the same course portal. Several other online courses are developed for inservice teachers professional development and delivered through the portal https://itpd.ncert.org.in/.

(v) A programme for utilization of satellite communication technologies for transmission of educational e-contents through 32 National Channels i.e. SWAYAM PRABHA DTH-TV has been launched. CIET-NCERT is the national coordinator for one DTH TV channel i.e., Kishore Manch (#31) and has started feeding a 24x7 educational TV channel w.e.f. 09 July, 2018. Everyday four hour fresh slot is telecast and repeated six times in 24 hours to provide learning opportunities for the stake holders, as per their convenience. Besides, NIOS is running 5 channels for teachers, for Secondary and Sr. Secondary levels and for sign language.

(vi) MHRD has launched Diksha Portal for providing digital platform to teachers giving them an opportunity to learn and train themselves and connect with teacher community. The portal envisages to help teachers boost their teaching skills and create their own separate profile with their skills and knowledge, and help in improving quality of education with use of latest technologies in education sector.

State governments have increased their budgets for school education in the past three years, but the allotment of funds has not been enough to attract permanent qualified teaching staff to government schools, finds a recent study conducted across six States.

The report, prepared jointly by Child Rights and You (CRY) and the Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability (CBGA), examines budgeting for school education in six States -- West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra -- during the 14th Finance Commission recommendation period, which started in April 2015.

The study finds that there has been an overall increase in revenue with the States following the 14th Finance Commission recommendations. This was a result of an increase in the share of the States in the divisible pool of Central taxes from 32% to 42%. At the same time, a reduction in the Union government's contribution to the States for Central schemes in social sectors forced the States to improve their tax revenue collection. The study analyses whether the availability of additional funds translated into prioritising of school education in these six States.

Between 2015-16 and 2017-18, there was a net decline in the share of school education budget in the total State Budget for three of the six States, according to the detailed demand for Grants and State Budget documents. Bihar saw a dip of 3.1%, Maharashtra a drop of 1% and West Bengal 0.9%. On the other hand, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh saw an increase in the size of school education budget by 0.4%, 2.6% and 3.2%, respectively.

The report examines whether the increase in the size of school education budget was more than the rise in size of the total budget, indicating a higher priority for the sector. It concluded that between 2014-15 and 2017-18, Uttar Pradesh saw a 98.8% increase in budget for schools, whereas its total budget increased by 63.3%. West Bengal's budget for school education increased by 49.4% while its total budget increased by 48.2% and in Tamil Nadu, the former increased by 38.7% but the total budget increased by 38.5%, indicating that school education was a priority for these three States.

At the same time, all the six States showed an increase in the magnitude of per-child and per-student spending for education between 2014-15 and 2016-17.

Despite a varying level of commitment towards school education across the six States, all of them struggle with a shortage of teachers. The report cites data from the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development to show that as on March 2017, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have from 19% to 34% of total teacher positions at the elementary level vacant. Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu were relatively better with 5.9% and 2.6% posts unfilled.

Data from the District Information System for Education show that at the upper primary level, there is a severe paucity of subject-specific teachers required under the Right to Education Act -- 77% upper primary schools in Maharashtra, 46% in Uttar Pradesh, 40% in West Bengal and 37% in Bihar do not have subject teachers.

More than one lakh schools in India are run with only one teacher and all the six States surveyed have shown the number of such schools on the rise. The shortage of teachers is more acute at the secondary level -- Bihar has 20,494 teaching posts vacant, Chhattisgarh 8,278 and Uttar Pradesh 12,008.

The figures don't entirely capture the severity of the shortfall as they do not reflect the shortage of subject teachers."

Yet the evidence is mounting that UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath cares more about the welfare of cows than people inhabiting his state. Consider his latest order that in case of encroachers on grazing land, the encroachments be removed immediately and strict action initiated against the accused. As Adityanath continued to drive his administration hard on ill-conceived cow schemes, irate farmers in Aligarh locked up stray cows inside classrooms while schoolchildren and teachers were left in the lurch.

In truth, the scale of the problem unleashed by Hindutva-inspired curbs on cattle trade is unmanageable. A 2012 livestock census found 3.9 crore cows in UP. Six years later, imagine many of these cows past their productive age roaming the countryside and cities in search of food. No government is in a position to earmark shelters or grazing lands for such a huge population. Adityanath's desperate search for cow welfare solutions is bound to fail and he must instead focus on the rising farm anger against stray cows now directed at government property like schools and hospitals. Even those encroaching grazing land deserve a better reason than stray cows to be asked to go.

Farmers have paid dearly for this proliferation of stray cows. Unable to sell unproductive cows and now struggling to fend off stray cows from fields, it has been a double whammy for them. Reviving the cattle trade will solve these problems. In light of growing agrarian distress BJP should not lose sight of the fact that it is humans, not cows, who will be voting at the hustings."

Hindustan Times had reported last week that the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) had invited fresh online applications for 1,268 entry-level reserved seats for a fourth round of admissions to the current academic year which has just three months left.

On Wednesday, the draw of lots were held for these seats but only 123 were filled. The DoE cited ""lack of applications"" for the large number of seats going vacant.

""Of the 125 applications we received during the fresh round of admission, 123 candidates were absorbed. The selected candidates have to approach the allotted school on or before December 31,"" DoE director Sanjay Goel said.

According to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (PWD) Act, 2016, three per cent of the total number of seats meant for the economically weaker section and disadvantaged groups (EWS/DG) category are reserved for children with disabilities.

Goel said that the department will carry forward the remaining reserved seats to next academic session (2019-20). ""The seats will be counted in the category during next year's admission,"" he said. The notification of admission in the entry level classes under the 25% reserved seats for the EWS/DG category is likely to be announced in the first week of January, next year.

Officials in the DoE said that they are planning to organise awareness campaigns among parents to motivate them to apply.

""There is lack of awareness among parents about the reserved seats because this was the first time the quota was introduced within the 25% EWS/DG seats. We are planning to organise campaigns to aware parents from the coming admission session,"" an official said.

Experts, however, said that the ""lack of inclusiveness"" in schools make parents reluctant from applying. ""Though the situation in private schools is better than the government schools, parents of children with disabilities are still reluctant from applying there. They think their kids will only be able to adjust in special schools. More efforts need to be put in to make campuses more inclusive by appointing trained special educators and providing better infrastructure facilities,"" said Dr Satender Singh, disability rights activist."

As per officials, the plants would be set up at rooftops from where water will be added to water coolers and dispensers.

MHRD had approved water purifier plants for government model senior secondary schools and government high schools in June this year. The purification capacity of the plants would be 1,000 litre per hour. Education department came up with the list of schools.

Sharing details, director school education Rubinderjit Singh Brar said, ""I had a meeting with the officials from public health department. I have asked them to plan a proper design so that maintenance is not a problem for at least three to four years. We don't want the schools to be struggling for the maintenance of the water purifying plant once it is installed.""

He added, ""We have also asked them to make sure that a separate connection is provided for the water purifier such that the purified water is not wasted in washrooms. A separate tank should solve the problem.""

Besides this, UT education department has released funds for science and knowledge parks to come up in 20 schools this year. A budget of Rs 3 lakh per school is being proposed for development of the same by the education department. Through these parks department further looks forward to popularizing science, general knowledge/awareness and to give practical experience of the theoretical concept."

The two schools, along with numerous other establishments like the handloom weaving centre, which bore the brunt of the floods, are on the path of fast revival -- thanks to the effective intervention of voluntary agencies and the local people.

While rebuilding by the government agencies in different parts of the state is only in the initial stages, the UP and LP schools which remained half submerged in the flood waters for over five days suffering huge damage to their facilities, have come back to life. In the forefront of the effort to revive them was the Deepalaya Trust in Delhi which lost no time in identifying the devastated schools and offering its help.

In a commendable operation coordinated by A J Philip, Deepalaya executive officer and eminent journalist; Dr George Mathew, Chairman, Institute of Social Sciences, New Delhi; and A J Abraham, social activist in Ernakulam, the rebuilding of the school started in right earnest in September itself and the work was completed within two months.

The so-called government red-tapes and delays were overcome with the strong support provided by the school authorities, including the AEO Latha, school headmaster V K Santhosh, panchayat president T G Anoop, Cartoonist Academy and the local people.

The Trust spent Rs 33 lakh in replacing the damaged computers, reconstructing the collapsed compound walls, removing the slush and debris from the compound and classrooms, laying tiles on the floors, painting the walls and re-equipping the library. Soon, other NGOs joined hands, including 'Human Values' and 'Rapid Response' of Pondicherry, which replaced the old furniture, desks and benches with modern ones.

Now the schools sport a completely new look and none who visits the place will realise that these were the ones the floods had ravaged only a few months ago. To celebrate its rejuvenation, the school organised a function on Saturday, which was attended by Sethu, writer and former chairman of South Indian Bank, Dr George Mathew, Cartoon Academy members, panchayat president, ward members, school children, parents, teachers and local people."

The incinerators, as students claim, will be very beneficial. ""What is more inconvenient than the having periods is disposing the soiled napkins.

After merger of 4,600 primary schools, the Jharkhand government is planning to shut over 6,466 middle schools (classes 6 to 8), having less than 100 students.

These schools would be merged with upgraded high schools in phases, starting with the institutions, which have less than 50 students, education department officials said on Thursday.

Initially, 3,732 middle schools having less than 50 students would be undertaken for merger. The process of merging has already been started.

""Merger is an effort to provide quality education to students in a better educational ambience. Jharkhand has around 411 such middle schools where number of students is less than 10. If these schools are merged with high schools, students would get better education,"" said state education secretary AP Singh.

""As per the rules in the right to education (RTE), there should be at least three trained graduate teacher (TGT) in middle schools where number of students is less than 100. It means, we would have to afford additional Rs 18 lakh on teachers' salary even in the schools where number of students is less than 10, which is not logical,"" he added.

The decision comes at a time when the opposition parties and critics have been criticising the state government for merging the primary schools. Several ruling party elected representatives have also been lobbying with the government against the move. There have been protests in several parts of the state as well, against merger of schools.

The officials, however, argue that, ideally, there should be one middle school and five to seven primary schools in a panchayat. As many as 6,466 middle schools have been identified in Jharkhand, which could be merged with high schools within a 5-km radius in a panchayat, Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) officials said.

The state government has decided to offer bicycles to the students, who would be shifted to other schools so that they do not face any trouble in commuting to the school.

Meanwhile, the JEPC officials said they have completed the merging exercise of 4,600 primary schools.

JEPC director Uma Shankar Singh said there were 39,600 schools in 2016-17 under education department in Jharkhand. ""Of them, 18,000 schools had 60 or few students. These schools had an average of 1 or two teachers per school. Providing quality education was a major challenge. One teacher was handling four to five classes at a time. How could one expect a better education in these schools,"" he said.

The council said four-step process including field inspection, cross-district verification, block and district consultation and final notification to merge the schools.

Singh said 98% students from the 4,600 primary schools have been shifted and 96% students have expressed satisfaction with the consolidation. ""We faced difficulty to shift 150 students due to some technical reasons. Now, the issue is resolved and 120 students were shifted,"" he said.

The reorganisation of primary schools benefited seven lakh students with better teachers' availability and reduced the requirements of teachers by 4,500. Besides, the process saved government's Rs 400 crore through reduced teachers and infrastructure requirements, JEPC officials said.

Education Dept ropes in IIM Ranchi for merged school evaluation

State education secretary AP Singh said the department has roped in Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ranchi, for evaluation of the merged schools. The IIM, Ranchi would see if the reorganization process brought any difference in improving the education of students, who were shifted in merging process.

The involvement of teachers in elections has derailed the course schedule and examination process.

The exam for Class VIII is conducted by the Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education (RBSE) which is already overburdened with class X and XII board exams and has expressed reluctance in taking up any additional responsibility.

""It has certainly affected the process but I am sure that teachers will complete the curriculum on time. Examination forms are being submitted in schools for both classes,"" said Arunesh Sinha, director of DIET, Jaipur.

Some officials shared the inside story. ""Since the model code of conduct is in place since October, the decision-making has become extremely slow. The system will not normalise until the new government is formed. Other than human resources, huge financial resources are also required to conduct these exams which are bigger in volume than the class X and XII exams,"" said an official.

LIFE IN COLOUR: Students are encouraged to be well turned out here

For 11 years, Sanjeev Kumar, a teacher at Government Primary School, Ghulal village near Samrala in district Ludhiana, worked to construct a new school building with the help of philanthropists from the village.

In July, a team of NHAI officials told him to vacate the school in two months.

""The NHAI planned to build a toll plaza here. They needed to widen the road for this and the school building was in the way. Over the past decade, we spent around Rs 26 lakh to construct the new building. When I told village residents, they were shattered,"" says Sanjeev Kumar.

Kumar first approached the district education officer and sent a message to secretary, education Krishan Kumar.

""He called me immediately. I went with a few village residents who have been helping us. As we sat there, he sent a letter to the Ludhiana deputy commissioner, asking him to do everything possible to save the school,"" Sanjeev recalls.

Ludhiana DC Pardeep Aggarwal sent SDM, Samrala and other officials to the school. The SDM called NHAI officials to the school. I heard the SDM telling NHAI officials that the school had to be saved at any cost and NHAI officials were asked to shift the toll plaza,"" he says.

Sanjeev pursued the issue till NHAI issued a fresh notification in October saying that the toll plaza would be shifted.

It is an incident secretary, education Krishan Kumar will not forget anytime soon. ""I could see his desperation and determination to save the school. Village residents were also committed to the cause. Such teachers deserve complete support. The Ludhiana deputy commissioner also took great interest in the endeavour and we are all happy with the result,"" he says.

Education dept steps in

It is remarkable that despite their tough circumstances, government school teachers are trying to bring about a qualitative change in their institutions.

""I learnt that a few teachers in the state improved their schools on their own, because of which more students got enrolled. In February, we called a meeting of such teachers. As they spoke about their experiences, we thought the idea was worth replicating across the state and called on principals and teachers to volunteer,"" says Krishan Kumar.

The officer pursued reforms in the education department during his previous stint as director general, school education for almost three years.

""By July, we had 425 schools with buildings turned into learning aids, improved infrastructure, amenities and sports facilities. The idea was to improve students' learning experience. We fixed the ambitious target of ""Mission 4,250"" by the beginning of the next academic session and asked these 425 teachers to motivate their friends and relatives in 10 other schools. Already, 1,700 schools have accomplished the task,"" he says.

According to the secretary, education, these teachers and communities are the biggest stakeholders in improving educational standards.

""Social accountability is much more result-oriented than departmental accountability,"" he said.

Incentives offered to teachers include transfer of choice, promotion and good ACR. ""All these benefits are non-monetary and the huge improvement in schools is without any extra burden on the state exchequer,"" Kumar adds.

Govt primary school, Jhans, Hoshiarpur

The school had just 17 students when Narinder Arora and his wife Manjit Kaur, both ETT teachers, joined in 2006. Now, there are 224 students. In an act that inspired trust, the couple got their daughter enrolled in the same school.

""There was nothing going for the small school but we decided to do everything possible to set things right. Apart from enrolling my daughter here, we motivated a few friends and fellow teachers to enroll their children as well. We assured them that their children's education or overall development would not suffer. Rather, we said they would see a marked improvement. My son is a UKG student here,"" said Narinder.

The teachers' dedication showed in exam results and students' performance in co-curricular activities.

""Soon, educated families also started sending their children to the school. We also had our own uniform,"" says Narinder Arora.

With this, village residents started pooling money for infrastructure upgrade. ""Philanthropists opened their hearts and pockets to us. Jalandharbased Satpal Singh Multani constructed two rooms. Jagjeet Singh

The Mathematics room in the school is its latest addition. The walls of the verandah have pictures of donors and those of well turned out students on a board with the title, Ajj De Sohne Bache (the smart children of today).

""When I joined the school, two snakes were found in the storeroom,"" he recalls. It is now an office.

It has worked with the children. ""Tanvi, a Class II student sustained an injury on her Jeeta and his family in the village opened their house for us to accommodate 100 students as the school did not have enough space,"" Arora said, estimating that people spent around Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh on the school.

Two years back, they started kindergarten classes on the lines of private schools. ""Now, we get children in nursery and have around 125 kids in kindergarten,"" he says. In June, Arora was promoted as master in a secondary school.

""It was very difficult for me to leave the school and children. Residents literally pleaded with me to stay. When a village elder asked me to stay in a choked voice, I decided to decline the promotion. After this, village residents provided 56 marlas of land to the school and raised a boundary wall. Now, we have enough space,"" he says, adding that they need the education department to provide more teachers as the strength of students is increasing.

""NRIs and other villagers have helped to improve the school. Now, the entire village is involved. People from other villages also come to get their children enrolled here. We have transferred 56 marlas of land to the school. If the number increases, we will provide an acre-and-a-half more of Panchayat land to the school,"" says Jagjeet Singh.

finger last year. But she came to school the next day,"" Ajmer says. According to him, NRIs and philanthropists from outside the village pitched in and around Rs 22 lakh has been spent so far.

""Apart from improving the amenities, I have been focusing on the core issue - improving learning outcomes among students,"" he adds. The school has a sprawling park and playground. Students have mid-day meals on tables with granite tops.

Rurka Kalan (Jalandhar)

The village has two government primary schools - one for girls and one for boys. In ambience and facilities, these schools could give private schools a run for their money.

Walls of both government primary schools have been turned into learning aids for children. They also have libraries and reading rooms. The girls' school also has an LCD screen to screen educational programmes.

""When I joined on July 1, 2006, the school building was in bad shape, with doors and windows missing. There were around 80 students but not a single bench. The first thing to do was to get desks for students before winter. The Youth Football Club of Rurka Kalan, which is working to promote football in the area, helped us procure desks at a cost of Rs 50,000,"" says school teacher Sanjiv Kumar, the man behind the transformation.

This was just the beginning. Over the years, infrastructure, education and sports in the school were upgraded.

""Philanthropists spent Rs 19 lakh on the school. With the way things have come up, more donors are volunteering,"" he says.

At Government Primary School for Girls, Buta Ram, who was promoted as centre head teacher and shifted to the boys' school a few days back, brought about the transformation.

""My daughter studies in this school. After I joined here in 2013, we managed to mobilize resources and undertake works worth around Rs 22 lakh,"" he says.

The school has its own logo and calendar. Numbers and letters are painted on the walls and a park based on the theme of mathematics is being constructed. Sanjiv and I are competing with each other to improve our schools,"" smiles Buta Ram.

Both schools have well-furnished and neat kitchens to cook mid-day meals.

The boys' school is in stark contrast with the street. The backyard of the adjoining senior secondary school is also overrun with weeds like a dark reminder of how things used to be and what could happen if these efforts are not sustained.

They aren't sure if the authorities would do all that is needed to enhance the quality of government schools and bring them on a par with private ones.

Notably, Section 3 of the Act, which is considered the core of the legislation, provides children the fundamental right to free and compulsory education in a neighbourhood school.

According to the proposal, if there's a government school in neighbourhood of a child -- within 1km for primary education and 3km for higher primary -- he/she should get admitted to that instead of a private school.

Nagasimha G Rao, state convener of the RTE task force, said, ""The government is citing the example of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where government schools are in high demand. We're in touch with RTE activists there too. But the Karnataka scenario is different. Parents prefer English medium schools over government institutions.""

Mohammed Yousuf, a Marappa Garden resident and parent of a child who's an RTE beneficiary, said, ""I don't think government schools are up to the mark. They don't have good English teachers and lack infrastructure. Moreover, the nearest government school in our area is located on defence land, can be accessed by every passerby and has a dumpsite too. My son will not be safe.""

Education department officials admit that no new government school has been opened in the state in the past three years.

It is sad that students are still made to pay fees at private schools despite being admitted under RTE. As we are the monitoring body for RTE and as well as child protection laws, I feel this move will give a boost to government schools and put in place systems required in these institutions.""

Niranjan Aradhya, senior fellow and programme head, Universalisation of Equitable Quality Education Programme, Centre for Child and the Law, NLSIU, said: ""This is a chance for government schools to improve. The government just needs to do a few basic things like recruit more English teachers and upgrade schools to the level of Kendriya Vidyalayas. To make RTE effective, they need to implement section 12(2) of the RTE Act which mandates private unaided schools receiving government largesse to reserve seats for weaker sections from their neighbourhood without the state having the obligation to reimburse them.

Emulating models of neighbouring states like Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the state government plans to amend the Act allowing parents to enrol children in private schools only if there are no government schools in the vicinity. The Act defines vicinity as a radius of 1km.

Briefing mediapersons after the cabinet meeting, state minister for law Krishna Byregowda said: ""The primary intention of RTE is to provide education to all class of students. For students from BPL families it is free of cost. Till date, Karnataka had allowed parents to admit children in private schools despite having government schools in the same neighbourhood.

We have decided to amend the RTE Act allowing parents to admit children in a private school only if there are no government schools in the vicinity.""

States like Kerala and Tamil Nadu already have such a law in place and it is said to have yielded positive results in terms of the number of students enroling in government schools.

The move to reduce admissions in private schools under RTE was first initiated in 2017 when then education minister Tanveer Sait had said the cost of educating children in private schools was a huge burden on the exchequer.

""In the past five years (2013-2017), the Karnataka government has spent over Rs 800 crore to educate children in private schools,"" Sait had said. ""It means we have lost so many students to private schools, who otherwise would have studied in our schools. We want to promote government schools."""

The Directorate of Elementary Education under the School and Mass Education (S&ME) department has issued an order to the District Education Officers (DEOs) and Block Education Officers (BEOs) in this regard seeking an action taken report at the earliest.

Sources said the move came after the Chief Minister's Office (CMO) intervened into the matter and asked the department to look into it. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, which came into force in 2016, has provisions for appointment of special educators in schools at primary and upper primary levels to improve the standard of education for children with special needs.

But this doesn't translate into government owning and running schools.

No matter which way one looks at it, there is no widespread market failure in school education. There is the matter of supporting poor children, but as far as the supply of high-quality supply is concerned, there is overwhelming evidence that the market is competent to do so without any government involvement.

On the other hand, there is overwhelming evidence of the failure of government education. As the Secretary to the government of Assam for Education in the early 1990s, I quickly became aware of how the Minister of Education (in a Congress government in my time) used the appointment and transfers of teachers as the key mechanism to extract bribes. The director of education of Assam was the conduit for this. The entire system was totally broken: many schools only existed on paper and ""teachers"" drew salaries when there was nothing on the ground.

The seriously misguided policy idea that the government must directly own and run schools came about as a result of a grievous error of analysis made by Lord Macaulay nearly two hundred years ago. This misconception continues till today among the ""educated"" who are not aware of the ground reality. The socialist Aam Aadmi Party's misplaced passion for government schools is one such example, and discuss my meeting on this issue with a senior AAP leader some other time.

The ""educated"" typically have a belief that parents won't send their children to school unless they are compelled by the state to do so. It is believed that given a chance, poor parents prefer to deploy their children as child labour. But the reality is that - as James Tooley's research has confirmed this fact that was well-known to many of us - all over India hundreds of millions of poor parents are sending their children to for-profit low-cost private schools. Roughly a third of India's poor children attend such schools.

Further, that some parents may indeed deploy their children as labour (extremely rare today) is actually the inevitable consequence of socialist policies that make parents view education dimly - as not being worthwhile since it won't improve their children's job prospects. There is a strong factual basis for this perception since millions of low quality ""graduates"", who are totally unsuited for the job market, are found unemployed today across India in second-tier towns and in the villages. Let's us, therefore, agree that there is no one more keenly interested in the welfare of their children than the parents. We must harness this powerful force instead of rejecting it.

Second, there is a mistaken belief that a school must have significant infrastructure and paraphernalia, or that its teachers must necessarily be ""highly qualified"". But as Gandhi said in a speech at Chatham House in 1931: ""the schools established after the European pattern were too expensive for the people"" and ""The village schools were not good enough for the British administrator, so he came out with his programme. Every school must have so much paraphernalia, building, and so forth"".

Gandhi, therefore, said: ""I defy anybody to fulfil a programme of compulsory primary education of these masses inside of a century. This very poor country of mine is ill able to sustain such an expensive method of education. Our State would revive the old village schoolmaster and dot every village with a school both for boys and girls"". What a brilliant thought! - except that there must not be any direct role for the state even in such schools.

James Tooley's book, The Beautiful Tree, shows that children who attend low cost for-profit private schools (including in India) achieve much higher educational outcomes than children from comparable government schools, despite such private schools having virtually no infrastructure and the teachers of such schools not even being ""adequately"" qualified. The reason these schools succeed while government schools fail is that teachers in the private schools are held to account for outcomes by the Principal, who is often the school owner. These for-profit undertakings depend critically on demonstrating real results in order to continue to get the custom of the poor parents who pay a small fee on a monthly basis and will quickly switch their child to a competing school if they don't' see significant progress each month.

Tooley's research enables us to totally dispense with the myth that government schools are required to educate children. This research has also confirmed Gandhi's assertion that excellent village schools operated in India prior to British rule. These schools functioned from the houses of the teachers, did not need a vast paraphernalia of infrastructure, and all sections of the community were able to send their children to these schools to avail high quality, low-cost education. In Shanti Niketan, Rabindranath Tagore was basically attempting to replicate this form of education, with a focus on learning and not on facilities or infrastructure.

Unfortunately, Macaulay's misplaced paternalism injected government into schools in India and was also copied by the UK, which had an entirely private (or local) school education system prior to that. In both cases, the effect was harmful, as the number of students and quality of education plummeted. Till today, an average government school across the world performs much worse than an average private school, barring a few exceptions.

We noted at the outset that the government must support the poor to access education - to ensure equality of opportunity. There is a simple and direct way to achieve this without owning and running schools, by providing vouchers of certain nominal value (depending on the income level of parents) for each poor child up to year 12 that can only be exchanged for school education (including for vocational education). This is our party's policy. These vouchers would enable the children of poor parents to attend a good for-profit private school.

The idea of vouchers has a long history and has also been tried out in a number of ways across the world, although not in the full-blown manner that's our party's policy. Milton Friedman is probably best known for his advocacy of this system but his ideas did not go far enough. He was willing to allow competition between private and government schools but our party does not see any role whatsoever for even a single government school. Our party is committed to the total privatisation of all government schools - in a well-structured manner.

The alignment of incentives when parents choose (and themselves fund, even if to a small extent) for-profit private schools is the best way to quickly and significantly improve India's dismal quality of school education.

Our party would, of course, remove most regulations in this area, such as requirements for infrastructure, playgrounds or even for the qualification of teachers. The market will determine who is best placed to teach. All we would require is that each school pick an affiliating board (such as CBSE, but that would need to be disbanded and private boards would emerge) and demonstrate high quality student outcomes in order to be eligible for the school vouchers. This would be an outcomes-based regulatory system, with detailed management (including things like the medium of instruction) left to schools and parents: the parties with the deepest direct interest in outcomes.

We therefore disagree with things like the Right to Education Act which we see as a socialist anachronism. India needs to fully liberate the education sector to allow the best private sector initiatives to emerge, unfettered by the misguided notions of any delusional (and mostly corrupt) bureaucrat or minister.

The government has sufficient core work to perform, in which it has repeatedly failed. When Indian governments can't deliver security and justice, how can they possibly deliver education? Today India is led by a government which can't distinguish between mythology and cosmetic surgery, between homeopathy and medicine. So what makes us think it can teach our children?"

The survey found that 88% students were allegedly beaten up, as a matter of routine, multiple times a week in some government schools, while in other government schools, around 30% experienced corporal punishment multiple times. All 50 students from low-cost public schools, who were part of the survey, reported that they were beaten up.

On an average, almost half of the children interviewed were allegedly beaten by teachers multiple times a week. The report, Choking Childhood, is based on the findings of research undertaken by social organisation Agrasar, which works with disadvantaged communities.

A total of 521 children and 100 parents sampled randomly were surveyed, and an informal group interview with 12 teachers from two different government schools was undertaken.

There are around 130 primary government schools in Gurugram, from which the students were randomly selected. There are around 18,000 students in the primary schools, as per estimates.

The Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, prohibits 'physical punishment' & 'mental harassment' under Section 17(1) and makes it a punishable offence under Section 17(2).

""The report studies the impact of corporal punishment on the psyche of children who are doubly disadvantaged by virtue of them being children who are predominantly from poor migrant communities and first-generation learners,"" said Prerit Rana, co-founder and CEO of Agrasar. He added that corporal punishment in schools was not only a violation of human rights, but also impaired the health and education of the children.

According to the report, 70% of the children reported that they were beaten at home after parents learnt that they were beaten in school. More than 70% of the parents said that they beat their children, as they believe punishment is for their child's well being.

The report also outlined the challenging working conditions and lack of professional conduct among teachers in government schools fostered an environment that puts deprived children at risk of experiencing corporal punishment.

Responding to the findings of the report, Premlata Yadav, the district elementary education officer said, ""I will have to see the report to know how the survey was conducted. I do not agree with the findings of the report. One can expect 1-2% of such cases but it is incorrect to say that 80% of the children are beaten.""

Yadav added that teachers are not allowed to punish students and strict action is taken if such a complaint is raised. ""If we receive information of this nature, we warn the teachers and sometimes, it can also lead to their suspension. We take strict action on reports of corporal punishment,"" she said.

A Sanskrit teacher at a government school said that corporal punishment is rarely doled out. ""Teachers rarely beat students. However, sometimes children do not understand and teachers are compelled to take matters into their hands. I do not raise my hands at my students. I either ask them to do rounds of the ground with their hands raised up or call their parents,"" she said."

Subject-wise performance evaluation of students from government and private schools from the state, revealed the performance of government school students to be poorer than private schools in all districts, apart from Hyderabad where the performance was on par.

Looking at the data, it should not be a surprise that parents prefer shelling out more money in sending their children to private schools for education than government for better education. As per available data, more than half of the about 48 lakh students studying in various schools in Telangana, are studying in private schools.

For example, while the performance of students from government schools in Nalgonda was 31 per cent and 33 per cent in Mathematics and Science, it was 39 per cent and 40 percent respectively by private school students. Similarly, while the performance of government school students in Karimnagar in Social Science and English subjects was 38 per cent and 34 per cent respectively, it was 46 per cent and 56 per cent in private schools.

Only in Hyderabad, the difference between performance of government and private school students was not significant.

Urban-rural divide also deep

Significant difference in performance of students in various subjects has also been observed with respect to whether a student belongs to rural or urban area, indicating the disparity in quality of education received by students depending on where they belong from.

In the NAS it has been observed that in all districts of the state the performance of students in urban areas is higher than those from rural areas. For example, in Rangareddy district while the performance of students in Mathematics and Science in rural areas was found to be 33 per cent and 35 per cent respectively, in the urban areas it was 41 per cent in each subject. Similar is the case in all other districts.

Caste affects spoken English

The NAS also highlights the need for ensuring that education reaches every student equitably, regardless of the caste of the student. Significant difference has been found in the performance of students from the general category and those from the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes.

A difference of almost 5-10 per cent was observed in the performances of students from general categories as compared to those from reserved categories. The difference was prominent in all the subjects that students study at the high school level.

However, the difference is most pronounced, as much as 15 per cent, in case of English language.

At a time when Government talks about ""Digital Literacy "" how is it possible that people especially students don't have access to electricity? Despite the obvious connection between electricity and educational achievement, however, the troubling scenes in Jammu and Kashmir are repeated as there are thousands of Government run schools without electricity. Present and past Governments in J&K, have been focusing on administrative affairs of education department or even pedagogy, but very little focus has been given to electricity in Government schools. The absence of focus on this issue is detrimental because, a study has put it like this, ""education is also widely recognized as one of the most essential components for poverty reduction"". Lack of electricity at primary, middle and secondary schools therefore creates considerable obstacles towards escaping poverty and correlates with many factors that contribute directly towards it. It is a big impediment towards digital literacy as well because when there is no electricity in a Government school, the children will have no access to computers and other digital equipment. The report on link between education and poverty assesses the direct link between electricity and education.

Based on the most recently available survey data from the World Bank and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the report first describes the current state of electrification of schools. According to the this data, roughly four out of every five primary and secondary schools in African countries (Govt and Private schools) surveyed lacked access to electricity, along with almost three quarters of village schools in India. This is much worst in Jammu & Kashmir state as more than 70 percent Government schools are un-electrified in this 21st century. When it comes to Kashmir division, more than 80 percent of Government schools are un electrified and these details I have been provided officially by several Chief Education Officer (CEOs) when I sought details under Right to Information Act (RTI). In Jammu province also the majority of Government schools in Rajouri , Poonch , Doda , Ramban , Reasi , Kishtwar and Doda are still un electrified.

Based on a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and policy literature concerning electricity and education, the report mentioned above assesses the educational benefits of electrification of primary and secondary schools, including lighting and access to information and communications technologies (ICT) as well improvement in staff retention and student completion and graduation rates. The final two main parts of the report, drawn from energy policy, development studies, and innovations in financing and public private partnerships literature, discuss the challenges facing school electrification, such as lack of financing and technical problems with equipment, along with the solutions and incentives with the potential to overcome them, such as Public Private Partnerships (PPPs).

Rajouri , Srinagar

At a time when Government of India is celebrating achievement of 100 percent electrification feat across country, information available reveals some astonishing facts. As per the Government figures, there are 1720 Govt schools in Rajouri district and out of them 1484 (over 86 percent) don't have access to electricity. Out of 1720 Government schools in Rajouri district , there are 995 primary, 557 middle, 117 high and 41 higher secondary schools. In addition to these there are 6 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalyas (KGBV) across the district.

In Srinagar district, more than 300 Government schools have not been provided electricity connection by Government till date. More than two years have passed since Government had ordered to get all the schools electrified. In Srinagar there are around 519 Govt run schools out of which there are 204 primary schools, 211 middle schools, 74 high schools and 30 higher secondary schools. Out of the 519 Govt schools, there are around 305 schools which are still un electrified.

Budgam, Ganderbal

In Budgam district there are more than 81 percent Government run schools which are un-electrified. This is an official information that was provided to me by Chief Education Officer (CEO) of Budgam under RTI Act. CEO Budgam informed me in his reply that there are around 1,036 schools in the district out of total 1278 that are ""without proper electricity connection"". Actually I had sought the details of all the un electrified Govt schools in Kashmir valley under RTI Act. I filed application before the designated Public Information Officer (PIO) in the Directorate of School Education Kashmir (DSEK). Instead of providing the information , PIO passed the buck to all the Chief Education Officers (CEOs) of Kashmir valley plus Leh and Kargil . That is why I got the details from each district. I also sought information about the number of girls' schools without a toilet facility and the number of schools without a proper electricity connection, boundary wall and drinking water facility. CEO Budgam in his reply said that ""all"" the girls' schools had a washroom facility, ""there are dysfunctional toilets "".

In Ganderbal district out of 587 government schools, 434 schools are un electrified which means around 83 percent Government schools have no access to electricity. These details were revealed by Chief Education Officer (CEO) Ganderbal in a reply to my Right to Information (RTI) application.

Conclusion

Why is Government compromising on providing the basic infrastructure to Government schools while as no such compromise is done when it comes to perks and salaries of Government employees especially Govt school teachers ? Infrastructure and level of education is coming down in Govt schools , but this is not the case with Government's own employees ? Their salaries continue to be hiked. Govt spends more than Rs 1.40 lakhs every month on an average Government school in J&K. Do poor kids enrolled in these schools get the desired facilities ? On contrary to this, not even Rs 50,000 is spent on an average private school in J&K by local school management, but the results are quite different. Board of School Education (BOSE) collected an amount of Rs 16.81 crores from students in shape of exam fees in Kashmir valley recently, but the class Xth & XIIth students were forced to write exams under candle light as there is no facility of gen-sets in the exam centers. Not even heaters are made available in Govt schools (exam centers) by BOSE and children are made to shiver in the cold. I have been forced to seek intervention of J&K State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) where I filed a petition recently.

I hope to get some good direction soon from SHRC. Imagine kind of trauma poor kids are facing in classrooms during June , July and August when temperature rises above 30 degree in valley and more than 40 in Jammu plains or in Rajouri , Ramban or Poonch districts ? After missing the initial deadline of May 2017, the Narendra Modi government on April 29th this year announced ""electrification"" of all inhabited villages in India has been completed.After having all the data available vis a vis un electrified schools in J&K , it clearly indicates that announcement by Government was largely symbolic. In a state where 75 to 80 percent Government schools are still un electrified how can Government claim to have achieved 100 percent electrification target ? How can Government claim to achieve digital literacy target in future if Govt schools are not electrified?

""My children go to a private school Madam, it is close to home, they learn English and mathematics"", says Selvi with a big smile on her face. Selvi, a Marathahalli-based domestic worker, like many others from low income households in Bangalore, finds private schools a better choice for her child.

Research has often pointed out that there is not much difference in the learning outcomes of children in government schools and in private schools. Yet in Bengaluru, like many urban centres in the country, children across income groups are flocking to private schools. While the number of private schools are rapidly rising, government schools are increasingly being merged/shut down in the name of low student enrolment. The narrative around government schools remains one of poor accountability and infrastructure, poorly trained or absent teachers, poor attendance and pass rates of students.

In 2016-17, Bangalore Urban had 1403 government schools, and almost thrice as many - 3426 - private schools. Student enrolments illustrate the trend better. That year, only 1.8 lakh children were enrolled in government schools, compared to nearly 11 lakh children in private schools.

The most commonly cited concern about government schools is the lack of sufficient, well-qualified teachers.

Dr V P Niranjan Aradhya, Programme Head (Right To Education) at the Centre for Child and Law, NLSIU, points out that there were over 28,000 vacancies for government elementary school teachers in Karnataka as of 2016-17. ""The number of sanctioned posts was 1.94 lakh, but only 1.66 lakh teachers were working then. The department has been talking about plans to recruit teachers, but currently poorly-paid guest teachers are being appointed in many vacancies,"" he says.

Given the low rate of enrolment in government schools in the city, there are schools with only 10-15 students spread across grade 1-5, or schools that have only 30 students overall from class 1-7. Such schools often have only one or two teachers. These teachers have to teach every subject to students across all grades, even if they are not qualified for it, says Aradhya. Teachers are also burdened with additional duties and administrative tasks. There are even schools in the city that lack a Headmaster, requiring one among the skeletal teaching staff to do the additional administrative tasks of the HM.

Anurag Behar, Vice Chancellor at Azim Premji University, says the low quality of schools comes down to the poor quality of teacher education. Behar was part of the implementation committee for the Justice J S Verma Commission report on teacher education. The Justice Verma Commission, set up by the Supreme Court, had pointed out in its 2012 report that the majority of Teacher Education Institutions (TEI) in the country were highly commercial private establishments.

Behar says: ""In the 1960s, India had only about 1300 TEIs. In the early 1990s, it was about 1500. Then, between 1993 and 2011, this number rose to about 16,000. In this period, the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) gave licenses to many private institutions that were fraudulent and corrupt; many of these institutions don't even hold classes."" He says that out of nearly 18,000 TEIs in the country now, about 92% are private.

Other issues pointed out by the Verma Commission Report include: teacher education curriculum remaining unchanged for over 65 years, TEIs being standalone institutions rather than being part of universities, the generalist nature of M.Ed programmes etc. The Commission had in fact reviewed 291 TEIs in Maharashtra, and recommended that 85% of these should be shut down.

Though much of the Commission's recommendations have been ignored, there have been a few initiatives such as the centre's budget announcement this year to introduce an integrated B.Ed course. ""But what about the existing 16,000-odd TEIs that are of low quality? Nothing much has been done about those,"" says Behar.

While shortage of qualified teachers is a major concern, both Aradhya and Behar say that teachers are not respected or incentivised enough in the education system. Teacher absenteeism - i.e., absence without a valid reason - has been blamed for much of the shortcomings of government schools.

But a 2016 study by Azim Premji Foundation (APF) across over 600 schools in six states including Karnataka, had shown that teacher absenteeism was only 2.5%. However, the overall teacher absence was around 19%, which was due to other administrative or departmental work they were assigned, trainings, or legitimate leaves; that is, teachers were absent due to systemic issues rather than a lack of professionalism.

The current system, wherein teachers' promotions are based entirely on tenure, hardly incentivises high-performing teachers as well.

Bengaluru's government schools are also affected by bureaucratic procedures like frequent teacher transfers. ""The transfer process is lengthy, and happens just a few months into the academic year. Events like elections can delay it even more. Neither the teacher nor the students would know if the teacher would remain in the school that year. This affects consistency in academic inputs,"" says Kapil Dawda, Bengaluru City Director for the non-profit Teach for India. Teach for India's fellows work as full-time teachers in low-income schools; currently they work with 24 government schools in the city.

Jean Boddu, Senior Program Manager at Mentor Together, another non-profit that works with government schools, says the distribution of bags and books to students also gets delayed by 2-3 months from the start of the academic year. ""Also, there is a huge dropout of students in 9th standard, as students who are academically weak are neglected, and fail exams."" Boddu says such students are not supported well enough as the school is worried that its 10th standard pass percentage may drop down if they continue there.

In terms of infrastructure, Bengaluru's government schools do have basic infrastructure like toilets and electricity, but in many cases the infrastructure is not functional. For example, schools that have toilets may lack water; or the toilet is kept locked. There is little investment in the operation and maintenance of existing infrastructure. In Bengaluru, corporates have adopted many government schools, providing funds, books, infrastructure etc.

Dawda says that schools located in areas like Whitefield which have a high concentration of corporates, tend to have better essential infrastructure because of this. ""Government schools in these areas often have a science lab, computer lab etc., which schools in areas like Ejipura or Goripalya don't have,"" he says. Since such philanthropic work is not streamlined and coordinated by the Department of Public Instruction, the results are often skewed and less effective.

In education system, the Cluster Resource Person (CRP) who oversees some 10-12 government schools per cluster, is the academic authority, says Aradhya. ""CRP has to monitor the quality of learning process, but he usually ends up doing administrative work and collecting data from schools. Parents also don't know that it's the CRP they have to approach, to hold their child's school accountable,"" he says.

The Karnataka School Quality Assessment and Accreditation Council (KSQAAC) routinely assesses government schools in the state and accredits them. Schools have to undergo both a self-assessment and external assessment, and are graded on multiple aspects like learning achievement, learning environment and physical environment. They are then given accreditation in grades ranging from A+ to D.

The Council has routinely ranked schools poorly. In 2014-15, for example, it had assessed 1220 government schools, 917 aided schools and 24 unaided schools in the state. In Bangalore Urban overall (Bangalore North and South educational districts combined), out of 78 schools, no schools got A or A+ grade, and only eight got B+. Sixteen schools got B grade, 33 got C+, 17 got C and four schools got D grade.

Aradhya opines that the accreditation system is useless as long as there is no initiative to improve the quality of schools. ""If the government is providing functional infrastructure, recruiting teachers and monitoring the learning process in schools, then it has the right to give accreditation. Else, continuing this exercise without doing anything to improve quality, only sends the message that government schools are bad,"" he says.

While government schools compulsorily have to submit to the KSQAAC accreditation process, private schools are not bound to. In the current system, private schools can participate in the accreditation process if they want to, by paying a fee to KSQAAC. Very few usually do.

Currently there isn't a system to assess private schools on their quality. The majority of private schools in Bangalore are low-income schools without adequate infrastructure or well-qualified teachers. However parents are keen to send their children to these schools because of the English language education offered, and the general perception that these schools are better.

Accountability remains the core difference between public schools and private ones, according to Shashi Kumar D, General Secretary of KAMS (Associated Management of Private Schools in Karnataka). ""There are issues with private schools, they are not isolated from the problems of running a school. For example there may be a lacuna with the lessons offered, or the hire of unskilled teachers. But because of the pervasive accountability in these establishments the teachers increase their skills, knowledge and teaching ability,"" Kumar says.

However, research has often showed that there isn't much of a difference in the quality of education in government and private schools. World Bank's World Development Report 2018 says that, in the 40 countries it researched on, including India, there were no differences in the learning outcomes of children in private and public schools, given that they had matching familial backgrounds. Any marginal difference was because private schools mainly admitted students from advantaged backgrounds. That is, student performance depended on the student's household, and not the quality of education offered by the school. Another study by APF in rural Andhra Pradesh in 2015 had shown similar results.

Behar says, ""There would be less than 2% private schools that are elite and actually have the resources to run a high quality school. But even their quality of education is suspect. The remaining low-fee private schools are mostly much worse in quality."" Behar says there would be only 10-15% private schools that are truly committed to providing good quality education. ""For the rest, it is a business,"" he says.

Dr Shalini Rajneesh, Principal Secretary (Primary and Secondary Education Department), says that government school students often lack a good support system. ""First-generation school goers cannot study the way a typical private school student studies - by rote. There are no support systems for public school students, no remedies and no help at home. That is why, now we are attempting to bring a more holistic form of learning; and we are doing this along with NGOs across the city, like Akshara.""

Whether government schools will in fact get the right support, or whether they will continue to be shut down further in the name of low enrolment, remains to be seen."

The government had introduced digital classrooms in high schools, infused of ICT as part of pedagogy, brought in subjects like robotics in residential schools, and most recently, made over government schools by turning their walls into canvases.

However, it seems their efforts don't prove much because the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE), National Achievement Survey (NAS) by MHRD, and the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) have thoroughly highlighted the poor quality of government schools in Telangana, with respect to infrastructure as well as quality of education being imparted.

In fact, compared to the data published in the UDISE for the academic year 2014-15, this year's report revealed that not much has changed in government schools since TRS had come to power. One glaring example is that of computer availability in government schools, which has actually gone down to 36 percent from being 37.5 percent in 2014, as per the UDISE numbers. In secondary schools, it has increased slightly from 29 to 31 percent.

When it comes to matters of infrastructure in primary schools such as having boundary walls, single-room classrooms, playgrounds, and kitchen sheds, the data indicates stagnancy. While studies showed that there was a steady improvement in the performance of residential schools run by the social welfare department -- where just about 15 per cent of students studied -- other government schools like the zilla parishad schools were constantly ignored.

Another example is that of science laboratories in secondary schools. The percentage of schools having Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Computer and Maths labs have down to 17.6, 17.5, 16.9. 11.7 and 6.3 percent from 19.3, 19.2, 18.5, 12.7 and 8 percent respectively.

Poor quality of education

Various reports released in the last four years raised questions over the quality of education being imparted in government schools of Telangana. For example the NAS report released this year pointed out that performance of school students in Telangana in all the subjects was poorer than that of students from most districts of other southern states.

Even the Comptroller and Auditor General in its audit report released this year pulled up the Telangana government as it found that 14-26 percent children in primary schools and 21-47 percent children in upper primary schools scored less than 40 percent in the years 2014-17. It also pointed out issues like unhygienic conditions of kitchens in schools used for cooking midday meals.

TRS government can't walk the talk?

It's no news that the TRS government has never forgone an opportunity to talk about its achievements in residential educational institutions run by the social welfare department. Good performance of students in SSC exams, competitive exams, academic and extra-curricular initiatives has often been the talk of the town during TRS rule.

However, government teachers point out that these residential schools -- home to jus10 percent of the 22 lakh students enrolled in different government schools across the State -- are not run by the Department of School Education (DSE) and receive ample funds, as a result they deliver better results. The government is all-talk when it comes to these schools and mum when it comes schools that come under the DSE.

The stark difference could be seen in this year's SSC results as the pass percentage in residential schools was above 90 percent whereas in zilla parishad schools it was just about 75 percent.

Telangana State United Teachers Federation, general secretary, Chava Ravi, said, ""Around 20,000 teacher positions are vacant in government schools. The TRS government has not recruited a single teacher since 2014, even though the TRT was announced for 8,972 posts last year.""

""There are several schools where one to two teachers teach 5 classes and cover 18 subjects. Moreover, in this academic year, school maintenance funds have not been released yet by the State government and the amount is expected to go down with the merger of SSA (Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan) and RMSA (Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan).

Negative marks for TRS government on school fee regulation issue : Parents

Parents across the State have been crying hoarse demanding fee regulation. The Hyderabad Schools Parents Association (HSPA) has conducted many protests on this issue, including writing a post card to the Chief Minister and producing a song chiding him for not taking any action on the issue. The post even went viral on social media.

These protests and promises by the government -- especially the education minister -- notwithstanding, the TRS government has failed to address problems of exorbitant fee. The State government constituted a committee to look into the issue, headed by former Osmania University Vice Chancellor, Prof Tirupati Rao. The committee was formed in March 2017 and was supposed to submit its report in the next one month. It actually did so only in December. It's a year since the report was submitted, but it has not been made public yet. The government did not even form the district fee regulatory committees."

Furthermore, the bench directed the authorities concerned to file their counter affidavit by December 6. It also impleaded the Director of State Council for Education, Research and Training, as a party.

According to the petitioner, there are about 37,211 government schools, 8,403 government aided and 12,419 private self-financing schools, imparting education to about 1.25 crore students.

Although as per the State's education policy, English is taught as the second language from Class 2 to 12 in Tamil medium aided and unaided schools, despite having successfully completing Plus Two with high marks, a student was unable to speak or understand any communication in English.

Moreover, he was also unable to converse or write fluently in English.

This leads to communication problems for him when he pursues professional courses or higher education that are imparted only in English.

However, the students who study in CBSE schools find it easier to understand and communicate in English. Therefore, a need has arisen to lay emphasis on spoken English, said the petitioner."

Just that morning a few of them had visited the Government Urdu Higher Primary School at Nachanahalli Palya on Manandavadi Road and soon after lunch, nearly ten of them led by Dame Hilary Blume (Director, The Green Hotel and Founder, Charities Advisory Trust in UK) were ready to hop into the mini bus and visit a few more schools run by the Government of Karnataka.

As the bus drove towards the congested Kyathamaranahalli and entered a small lane, the women, who alighted from the bus, were surprised to see a clean, well-maintained Government Higher Primary School. There was a welcome committee with the Head Master of the School V. Ramaswamy, a disciplined, dedicated teacher and H. Saraswathi, the Director of RLHP (Rural Literacy and Health Programme) who is coordinating with Charities Advisory Trust, greeting the group of lively women.

Walking up a flight of stairs that led to the library of the school at the far end, the students, both boys and girls, all dressed neatly in green uniforms got up shyly but most of them immediately recognised the familiar of face of Dame Hilary Blume, who is no stranger to Mysuru.

""Do you recognise Madam Hilary?"" asked the Head Master and most of the students immediately recalled her earlier visit to the school. The library is well- equipped with books, desks and benches (all funded by the Charities Advisory Trust) and the visitors were keen to see how many students were really into reading the books.

A few of the students got up to demonstrate how helpful the reading habits they had been inculcated with had worked. A girl from eighth standard picked up a book in English and read without any mistakes in clear diction while a few others read from books in Kannada related to freedom fighters and scientists. Then they sang a few patriotic songs.

Now, it was the turn of the motley group of exuberant women, mostly in their sixties and seventies, to become children. They started singing the nursery rhyme for kids, 'Head, Shoulder, Knees and Toes.' Led by 'Good Giver' Annie Taylor, who had taught little children in Ethiopia, they began on a slow pitch and accelerated. The children who joined them sang with gusto and joy.

Impressed by the kind of work done by the school and RLHP, Hilary Blume asked the Head Master, what else they required for their school. He said that they needed a water filter and a LCD screen projector. She promised to install both through the profits earned in The Green Hotel.

""The profit of every meal eaten in The Green Hotel helps buy an egg for a child or for the books of children,"" she told SOM.

The children then wanted to know more about the visitors and they introduced themselves. There were two Elizabeths, one from Canada and another from England, both of whom were doctors. There was Ann Kingston, who was the knitting teacher for the ""Knit for Peace"" group and Danielle Liebech, who had visited The Green Hotel five times and there was also the young L. Marie, originally from France, who is working with Hilary Blume.

After a satisfying visit at Kyathamaranahalli, the group moved towards Sathagalli, where there is a slum and another Government Higher Primary School. It was around 4.30 pm. The RLHP runs a nutrition programme here in the school premises. A few of the infants and children were sitting there along with their mothers. A young woman, fondly called Akhila aunty by the Sathagalli slum residents, had brought ragi porridge which had a healthy mix of pulses and greens like drumstick leaves.

Along with the porridge, the kids were also given boiled eggs. A few of the mothers told this reporter how useful this programme was, as it had helped their malnourished children gain weight and improve their health.

Then right next door was the Government Higher Primary School where in the evening free supplementary classes are run for the children. Children in the age group of six to 14 were sitting there quietly waiting for the classes to begin.

All of them in unison welcomed the idea of the evening classes and how they were all happy to be there studying.

RLHP Director Saraswathi asked one of the students to get up and welcome the visitors. A tenth standard student B.B. Mehak got up and welcomed the group. This girl, who is the Malala Yousafzai, (Nobel Laureate from Pakistan who is an activist for female education) of Mysuru, had stopped a child marriage in her area a couple of years ago.

One of the teachers, Seema, was a child labourer, who used to roll agarbathis. But today she has completed her Pre-University education because of the support of RLHP and Charities Advisory Trust.

The slum children here are so vibrant that when they were asked to sing a song, four girls got up and began singing Jalle Kabbu..., a folk song in faultless Kannada and dancing to choreographed steps. Asked for their names, they said Luhia, Simran, Husna and Rafia.

Everyone was moved by the effort that had gone into preparing the deprived sections of the society to face the world boldly.

""The Charities Advisory Trust is supporting many causes including the beauticians' course, nutrition programme, sponsoring health camps from the funds collected through Good Gift India. Their focus is also on libraries and they have helped setting it up in nearly 100 Government Higher Primary Schools,"" said Saraswathi.

Later, speaking to Star of Mysore, Hilary Blume said that 'Knit for Peace' is an initiative of the Charities Advisory Trust started as an income generation project for Hutu and Tutsi widows, victims of the Rwandan genocide and civil war.

""At our suggestion, the widows knitted school jumpers for the many orphans and we paid them by raising funds through featuring the project in Good Gift Catalogue, another of the Trust's initiative,"" said Hilary Blume.

""Good Gifts is an initiative started by me. This is a concept where the giver knows exactly where the money goes. Hence, we came out with Good Gifts Catalogue where people can identify with a range of causes; in fact, there are over 400 ways to help people take their first step out of poverty, enjoy better health and increased opportunities,"" she said and added, ""I ask the givers to come and see how the concept works. That is how I bring such people to visit Mysuru to see the schools and slums and how the money they have given is spent. Our next visit with the 'Knit for Peace' group is in early January,"" she said

Asked whether she believed like many others who are doing charity work that charity is also a business, Hilary Blume said, ""These are causes that I was introduced to, and continue to support, as I believe in them. I believe that once I give money, then the money is out of my hands to control. So it is important that I can trust those organisations I support. Administration is critical to keep a charity going, but too many big charities waste too much money.""

On whether she has written any books on charity having worked for more than 40 years in the field, she recalled five books titled, 'Fund Raising - A Comprehensive Handbook,' 'Accounting and Financial Management for Charities,' 'Charity Trading Handbook,' 'Museum Trading Handbook' and 'Charity Shop Handbook' she has written. Hilary Blume also revealed that she is penning the sixth one now called 'The Ethics of Charity Giving.'"

However, the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR), a state government department constituted under the Child Rights Act of 2005, aims to change this.

Next month, the DCPCR will undertake a rigorous assessment of 5,800 schools in the capital -- all of which are administered by the state government's education ministry and/or New Delhi's three municipal corporations- as a precursor to creating the country's first ever 'School Development Index' for a state.

Owing to the sheer number of schools involved and data required, earlier indices compiled by the government have focussed on the state or districts as a whole rather than individual schools.

Unde the School Development Index, Delhi's schools will be ranked according to three parameters, as devised by the Adhyayan Foundation - an NGO that focuses on capacity building of schools.

The first parameter is safety and security, the second is teaching and learning outcomes while the third parameter is community participation and social integration. Each school will be given a rank between 1 to 4 for each criteria, with 1 indicating that it has the most room for improvement.

The assessment of Delhi's schools is expected to continue into next year, with a final report from the DCPCR due in May. The government body has made sure to clarify that the exercise is not a punitive one but an instructive one. The exercise will give the administrators of these schools an insight into best practices and facilitate an environment for collaboration.

Education has long been a priority for the current state government of Delhi. When contesting state elections for Delhi in 2015, the made the improvement of education outcomes one of the core aspects of their platform.

So far, it seems that they have kept their word. For example, in July this year, the government launched libraries in 100 primary schools in the city, in addition to a 100 last year. In June, it announced the planned launch of a ' happiness curriculum' in government schools, which involves meditation and life skills training.

Scenes from two government schools in Delhi

The walls of the entryway of the school are covered with bright charts that talk about everything from sustainable development and 'Swachh Bharat' to 'happiness goals' and exam schedules. The cream-coloured floor gleams and the sun peeps out from the clouds behind the rows of students -- dupattas pinned, shirts tucked in, not a hair out of place -- sitting quietly for morning assembly. It's 8 a.m. on a hazy Delhi morning and this school in Dwarka Sector 10 is about to flip my perception of government schools completely.

""Government schools in India get a bad rap,"" says Principal T.P. Singh. ""But with RPVV, we try to do better."" The results are evident. The Dwarka branch of RPVV or Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya, along with its counterparts in Lajpat Nagar and Rohini Sector 11, are the three schools from Delhi that have made it to the nationwide list of top 12 government schools that's been compiled by EducationWorld portal as part of its India School Rankings 2017-18. In fact, the Dwarka school tops the list, with the Lajpat Nagar and Rohini schools at No. 6 and No. 12, respectively.

Labs and libraries

The RPVV schools, a Delhi government initiative to provide quality education to marginalised sections, were first opened in 1997, with one each in Rohini, Paschim Vihar and Surajmal Vihar. Twenty-one years later, there are 22 schools, with five of them launched last year alone.

All of them boast of language labs, upgraded auditoriums, relatively well-stocked libraries and, most importantly, a teacher-student ratio of 1:35. They take in students from Classes VI to XII and admissions are through an entrance test. Students are eligible only if they have studied in a government school for a minimum of two years.

When RPVVs were started as schools for high performers, they had the same shortcomings as other government schools -- poor infrastructure, undefined learning outcomes, dated teaching methods. ""But the last four or five years have seen a lot of change,"" says geography teacher Neerja Lamba, who has been with the school since 2003. ""We have a stress-free learning and teaching environment now. There are cultural activities and exchange programmes; students want to come to school,"" she says. Singh points out that the Delhi government has given the schools a free hand for improvements. ""For example, for any expenditure below ₹50,000, I don't have to write to the government. Little things like this make it so much easier.""

Over the past four years, the Delhi government has steadily increased funding for education, from 20% budgetary allocation in 2015 to 23.5% in 2017 and 26% in 2018.

The schools' improved infrastructure is testament to that. In the Dwarka branch, there's a fully air-conditioned auditorium, a conference hall open to both teachers and students, and a spanking new running track that instantly catches the eye. The labs have the latest equipment; there's a 'project development' room where students are recycling paper; and there are working water purifiers on every floor.

Robot Gangnam Style

The change is nowhere more perceptible than in the Rohini Sector 11 school, halfway across the city, where I find Class X student Prashant Kumar elbow-deep in a half-built drone. He is working after school hours in what the school calls the 'Atal Tinkering Lab'. ""I'm pretty sure I can get it to fly in a day or two; I just need to stabilise the gyro sensor,"" Kumar says confidently. His supervisor Vivek smiles behind him. ""That's going to need another month or two,"" he says. Close by, Class XII student Pratham Chopra's robot is dancing to 'Gangnam Style'. The coding took four months, says Chopra.

In the corner there is an actual 3D printer, the table around it littered with prototypes of printed whistles. The design's final version is now being used by the school's PT teachers. Science teacher Sadaf Fathima shows us a keychain printed in the shape of her name. The lab is the school's pride and joy, set up as part of the Central government's Atal Innovation Mission. Nearly 10,000 schools across the country applied for the grant, and RPVV-Rohini was among those to bag it in the first round.

Food, water, lessons

The one-year-old lab has sparked an interest in science among students, helping also to bring more girls in, say teachers. There are only three girls in the Class XII science stream this year, but the trend is beginning to slowly change in the younger classes, they say.

Social sciences teacher Shivani Singh says such facilities help immensely to address one of the biggest

problems of government schools: dropouts. In the Dwarka school, 63% of students come from families with monthly incomes below ₹5,000; their parents are rickshaw-pullers, labourers, sweepers, tailors, mechanics, domestic help, etc. When these students come into Class VI, they are undernourished, unable to take home school work, and, in some cases, have to contribute to the household income by taking up odd jobs.

But even as the dropout rate in Delhi government schools has been increasing, from 2.9% in 2014-15 to 3.4% in 2016-17 (Praja.org study), with worse results in municipal corporation schools, the RPVVs don't have any dropouts. ""Children want to do more than just study from textbooks. The 'more' is what we provide,"" says Shivani. ""They get clean water and nutritious food like dal chawal, daliya porridge, poori-sabzi. Girls get sanitary napkins,"" she says.

Walking through the school's corridors, both at Dwarka and Rohini, there is a steady stream of 'good morning' greetings around us. The students, free for the day after a gruelling exam, are not reticent and engage with their teachers comfortably. ""That took a lot of hard work,"" says Principal Singh. It was not just academics but also student-teacher relationships that needed overhauling. From improving teachers' listening and communication skills to newer teaching methods and learning objectives, ""we needed a change in pedagogy,"" says Singh.

A new pedagogy

It was this need that led him to begin the Cluster Leadership Development Programme, running now in all schools under the Directorate of Education in Delhi. ""We select 10 or so principals, area-wise, and get them to work with a facilitator-trainer. The principals, in turn, go back to their schools and work with the teachers,"" he says.

This has reduced teacher-student conflict, Singh says. ""And communication skills among students have improved; it's not great, but it's much better than what it used to be.""

The clubs and extra-curricular activities also play a big role. RPVV Rohini, for instance, has a Legal Advocacy Club where lawyers and judges address the children once a month. The Bal Bhavan Kendra is an arts and crafts initiative sponsored by the government's National Bal Bhavan in addition to regular art classes. I find a classroom filled with Madhubani paintings, wall hangings, home decor items, and more.

We walk into a room full of Class X students, and when they hear of their school's ranking, they break into ear-to-ear grins. Asked about their ambitions, they list scientists, doctors and more, but among them a handful says 'teacher'. They are as excited to teach in this school as they are to learn. The teachers accompanying us couldn't have been prouder."

The decision to convert hundreds of primary schools into English medium schools in districts like Karimnagar, Warangal and Nizamabad by teachers and its success led to the government giving the official nod to other schools across the State to follow suit.

As expected the enrolment rate in government schools has shot up. But the education experts think that despite the change in medium of instruction, it has had little effect on learning outcomes of government school students.

In 2016-17, for instance, 4,872 schools in the State were given permission to convert to English medium. Earlier back in 2008, in the united Andhra Pradesh, for the first time the then government had granted permission to run high schools with parallel mediums - 5,500 in Andhra and 2,200 Telagana area.

A social audit of learning outcomes carried out on 1,302 students from Class V to X by Campaign for Learning Outcomes, released last week confirmed this belief. It revealed that while 650 students could neither read nor write English, 271 could read only small sentences but not entire paragraphs.

Problem of parallel medium

Apart from granting the approval for change of medium of instruction, teaching community alleges, that the government did little to ensure that the move actually benefits students. In fact, the decision to run two parallel mediums is part of the problem. With the teacher-student ratio dismal in government schools, forcing one teacher to handle not just several classes but to even teach in two different languages.

""Most teachers are from Telugu medium background so for the sake for convenience they end up teaching in Telugu. Also, they find it difficult to alternate between Telugu in one period and English in the next. Students are not able to get acquainted with the language"" said T Venkateshwar Rao, President, English Language Teachers Association.

Proper training needed

The problem is further compounded by insufficient training of the lack thereof. For instance, in 2016, select primary teachers were provided five-day English language training. This was supplemented a year later by another five-day training for the same set of teachers.

""Now only a couple of teachers are trained from each school and later they too were transferred. Last academic year in Warangal, teachers from 132 primary schools have been trained but soon they got transferred to Telugu medium schools. This beats the very purpose of having English medium schools,"" said Nagati Narayana, an educationist.

Since a number of teachers themselves took the initiative to start classes in English medium and when it started showing positive results, teachers feel the government became complacent.

The move comes two days after a government school teacher was assaulted with a metal rod by a student in Saket because the teacher reprimanded him over low attendance.

On Monday, the government schools teachers' association (GSTA) held a meeting attended by hundreds of teachers to raise concerns over their security at school campuses. ""Teachers at government schools are suffering because of the government's apathy. Saturday's incident was not the first time when a teacher was assaulted by a student. Earlier this year, another teacher was assaulted by parents of a student. In 2016, a teacher was stabbed to death by a student,"" GSTA general secretary Ajay Veer Singh said.

Singh said the teachers will be sitting on a strike outside Delhi Secretariat from November 20. ""We will not call off the sit-in till we are given a written assurance from the government,"" he said.

Sanjay Goel, director of the Delhi government's Directorate of Education (DoE) said he will meet the teachers and discuss their issues soon. ""How can we give protection to teachers from students? We cannot deploy security guards inside classrooms. We will anyway discuss what they want us to do,"" he said.

Teachers, however, said that the government should itself decide what measures can be taken for their safety. ""The government cannot deprive us from our right to live a dignified life. We are not here to be humiliated and assaulted by students and their parents,"" Singh said.

In September, a government school teacher was injured when a chunk of roof fell on her head. ""After this incident, we had written to the education department demanding teachers' safety but to no avail. This time we will not end the protest as long as something concrete is done by the government,"" he said."

The revamped 'CBSE Affiliation Bye-Laws 2018', brought out recently by the board has given more control to the state government over the functioning of such schools and also upcoming ones in the state.

The new bye-laws have also designated the state as the 'appropriate government' which would solely decide if the existing 1,300 CBSE schools in the state, as well as those in the pipeline, meet the prescribed norms in terms of infrastructure, safety, sanitation and land ownership. ""The CBSE would not re-check any aspects vetted by the state government during its inspection of schools,"" the bye-laws state.

The state government has also been given the power to bring in regulations on fees levied in CBSE schools. As per the bye-laws, fees would be charged as per the regulation of the appropriate government (state) and fee revision shall be subject to its laws, regulations and directions.

The 'Recognition' clause

Moreover, CBSE's insistence on 'recognition certificate' would be another crucial aspect which would enable the state government to make errant CBSE schools fall in line. Though CBSE schools in Kerala obtained a one-year relaxation from the board, all 1,300 plus schools will have to obtain it fairly soon from the state. ""Earlier, once the NOC was obtained, we had no business with the state government. We only needed to renew our affiliation every three years with the CBSE. Now, the state can cancel the NOC and prescribe a new set of rules while granting fresh NOC or during issuance of recognition certificate,"" said the manager of a leading CBSE school.

Kerala CBSE School Managements Association general secretary Indira Rajan said the new bye-laws have reduced procedural delay in getting affiliation. ""If the school managements have concerns about the state government getting a decisive role in affiliation process, it can be addressed through dialogue with all stakeholders,"" she said.

'NOC a policy matter'

General Education Secretary A Shajahan said the grant of NOC to CBSE schools is a 'policy decision' which needs to be taken at the highest level. Since the LDF Government assumed power, fresh NOC has not been granted to any CBSE school. Aggrieved school managements had taken legal recourse and obtained a court verdict that schools which meet the prescribed norms are eligible for NOC.

""The government is planning to approach the court seeking more time for implementation of the order. Though we have no issues with the functioning of existing CBSE schools, permission for new ones will be subject to strict scrutiny as we do not want mushrooming of such schools without any regulation,"" said a top source in the government."

The first phase of the project, targeted at the ones in a leadership position, will create awareness among principals and teach them about gender identities, including transgenders and homosexuals, and issues like Article 377. On Tuesday, the principals were encouraged to designate one toilet in their school as a unisex one, to frame anti-trans bullying rules and to organise multi-gender activities in their institutions.

Santosh Gupta, principal of a Seelampur school, admitted that for inclusive education, it was important to embrace the transgender community. ""I agree that education is the only way in which we can empower people from disadvantaged communities. Along with us, it is also important that the parents are included in this awareness programme,"" said Gupta.

In another phase, sensitisation events will be held for the nodal teachers of a school and then for the secondary students of the schools involved. Following this, a school that is determined to be ""trans friendly"" will be given an award.

Sanjay Goel, director, DOE, asked the principals to accept people from gender communities and work for their empowerment. ""They have their own way of living and they should be accepted as an important part of inclusive education,"" said Goel.

Meanwhile, lauding the government for accommodating of the rights of transgender, Anjaan Joshi of SPACE pointed out that people belonging to that community faced several hurdles. ""The first and the foremost of the problems is there is no separate column for the third gender in school forms. Also, it has been quite a challenge to advocate the issue of transgender rights and inclusion in public schools,"" said Joshi."

As part of its first step, the state government will start 1,000 pre-primary schools in the state with adequate facilities and necessary infrastructure by coordinating with the available anganwadis in the vicinity of government schools.

The schools will give stress on educating children through activities, games without using text books or slates. However, the government could not give a timeframe as to when it start the new system owing to delay in the release of fund from the Union Government. The schools will focus on a unified child-friendly curriculum encompassing physical, social, intellectual, and emotional development of the child.

The General Education Department has also decided to provide space for anganwadis in government schools where excess accommodation was available and pre-primary school was not functioning.

SCERT Director J Prasad told Express that the new curriculum will focus on activity cards rather than using textbooks.

""In an effort to make the pre-primary education system scientific, we are introducing a new curriculum. As part of this, we have already started activity cards named 'Kalithoni'. The cards have 30 different themes and the first part is the collection of 10 themes.

""The cards aim at children's physical, creative, language, scientific and social and emotional development. Besides children, the new programme will also benefit the pre-primary school teachers"", Prasad said.

(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). With effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions.

The Samagra Shiksha scheme focuses on improvement of quality of education by providing support for different interventions like; in-service training of teachers and schools heads, conduct of achievement surveys at National and State level, provision of textbooks as per Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, ICT and digital initiatives, vocational education, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment has been increased and from this year provisions for library grants and grants for sports and physical education have also been introduced.

The Government has also launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities.

e PATHSHALA: a single point repository of e ­resources containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-­print materials.

The Central Government, supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme namely 'Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat' (PBBB) in foundational years of schooling.

State governments have increased their budgets for school education in the past three years, but the allotment of funds has not been enough to attract permanent qualified teaching staff to government schools, finds a recent study conducted across six States.

The report, prepared jointly by Child Rights and You (CRY) and the Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability (CBGA), examines budgeting for school education in six States -- West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra -- during the 14th Finance Commission recommendation period, which started in April 2015.

The study finds that there has been an overall increase in revenue with the States following the 14th Finance Commission recommendations. This was a result of an increase in the share of the States in the divisible pool of Central taxes from 32% to 42%. At the same time, a reduction in the Union government's contribution to the States for Central schemes in social sectors forced the States to improve their tax revenue collection. The study analyses whether the availability of additional funds translated into prioritising of school education in these six States.

Between 2015-16 and 2017-18, there was a net decline in the share of school education budget in the total State Budget for three of the six States, according to the detailed demand for Grants and State Budget documents. Bihar saw a dip of 3.1%, Maharashtra a drop of 1% and West Bengal 0.9%. On the other hand, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh saw an increase in the size of school education budget by 0.4%, 2.6% and 3.2%, respectively.

The report examines whether the increase in the size of school education budget was more than the rise in size of the total budget, indicating a higher priority for the sector. It concluded that between 2014-15 and 2017-18, Uttar Pradesh saw a 98.8% increase in budget for schools, whereas its total budget increased by 63.3%. West Bengal's budget for school education increased by 49.4% while its total budget increased by 48.2% and in Tamil Nadu, the former increased by 38.7% but the total budget increased by 38.5%, indicating that school education was a priority for these three States.

At the same time, all the six States showed an increase in the magnitude of per-child and per-student spending for education between 2014-15 and 2016-17.

Despite a varying level of commitment towards school education across the six States, all of them struggle with a shortage of teachers. The report cites data from the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development to show that as on March 2017, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have from 19% to 34% of total teacher positions at the elementary level vacant. Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu were relatively better with 5.9% and 2.6% posts unfilled.

Data from the District Information System for Education show that at the upper primary level, there is a severe paucity of subject-specific teachers required under the Right to Education Act -- 77% upper primary schools in Maharashtra, 46% in Uttar Pradesh, 40% in West Bengal and 37% in Bihar do not have subject teachers.

More than one lakh schools in India are run with only one teacher and all the six States surveyed have shown the number of such schools on the rise. The shortage of teachers is more acute at the secondary level -- Bihar has 20,494 teaching posts vacant, Chhattisgarh 8,278 and Uttar Pradesh 12,008.

The figures don't entirely capture the severity of the shortfall as they do not reflect the shortage of subject teachers."

Following the mode of campaigns run by privately-managed educational institutions, government schools across the state have started a massive advertising campaign ahead of commencement of the new academic session on January 1, featuring achievements and facilities of the schools.

Sources in the education department said the state government's recent decision to provide annual administrative grants to schools on the basis of enrolled positions has added an impetus to this campaign.

Banners portraying facilities and accomplishments at entrances of schools has become a common sight. Some school authorities have also launched a social media campaign, named Utsav Vidyarambha, an annual enrolment drive conducted every year with the help of local community and students, to enhance enrolment in schools.

""From this year, the publicity campaign for Utsav Vidyarambha has been launched on a massive scale.

Yet the evidence is mounting that UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath cares more about the welfare of cows than people inhabiting his state. Consider his latest order that in case of encroachers on grazing land, the encroachments be removed immediately and strict action initiated against the accused. As Adityanath continued to drive his administration hard on ill-conceived cow schemes, irate farmers in Aligarh locked up stray cows inside classrooms while schoolchildren and teachers were left in the lurch.

In truth, the scale of the problem unleashed by Hindutva-inspired curbs on cattle trade is unmanageable. A 2012 livestock census found 3.9 crore cows in UP. Six years later, imagine many of these cows past their productive age roaming the countryside and cities in search of food. No government is in a position to earmark shelters or grazing lands for such a huge population. Adityanath's desperate search for cow welfare solutions is bound to fail and he must instead focus on the rising farm anger against stray cows now directed at government property like schools and hospitals. Even those encroaching grazing land deserve a better reason than stray cows to be asked to go.

Farmers have paid dearly for this proliferation of stray cows. Unable to sell unproductive cows and now struggling to fend off stray cows from fields, it has been a double whammy for them. Reviving the cattle trade will solve these problems. In light of growing agrarian distress BJP should not lose sight of the fact that it is humans, not cows, who will be voting at the hustings."

(HT File)

After four rounds of admissions, less than a quarter of the 1,400 reserved seats on offer in the city's private schools for differently abled students were filled this year. This has prompted the government to carry forward the vacant seats to the next academic year.

Hindustan Times had reported last week that the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) had invited fresh online applications for 1,268 entry-level reserved seats for a fourth round of admissions to the current academic year which has just three months left.

On Wednesday, the draw of lots were held for these seats but only 123 were filled. The DoE cited ""lack of applications"" for the large number of seats going vacant.

""Of the 125 applications we received during the fresh round of admission, 123 candidates were absorbed. The selected candidates have to approach the allotted school on or before December 31,"" DoE director Sanjay Goel said.

According to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (PWD) Act, 2016, three per cent of the total number of seats meant for the economically weaker section and disadvantaged groups (EWS/DG) category are reserved for children with disabilities.

Goel said that the department will carry forward the remaining reserved seats to next academic session (2019-20). ""The seats will be counted in the category during next year's admission,"" he said. The notification of admission in the entry level classes under the 25% reserved seats for the EWS/DG category is likely to be announced in the first week of January, next year.

Officials in the DoE said that they are planning to organise awareness campaigns among parents to motivate them to apply.

""There is lack of awareness among parents about the reserved seats because this was the first time the quota was introduced within the 25% EWS/DG seats. We are planning to organise campaigns to aware parents from the coming admission session,"" an official said.

Experts, however, said that the ""lack of inclusiveness"" in schools make parents reluctant from applying. ""Though the situation in private schools is better than the government schools, parents of children with disabilities are still reluctant from applying there. They think their kids will only be able to adjust in special schools. More efforts need to be put in to make campuses more inclusive by appointing trained special educators and providing better infrastructure facilities,"" said Dr Satender Singh, disability rights activist."

While rebuilding by the government agencies in different parts of the state is only in the initial stages, the UP and LP schools which remained half submerged in the flood waters for over five days suffering huge damage to their facilities, have come back to life. In the forefront of the effort to revive them was the Deepalaya Trust in Delhi which lost no time in identifying the devastated schools and offering its help.

In a commendable operation coordinated by A J Philip, Deepalaya executive officer and eminent journalist; Dr George Mathew, Chairman, Institute of Social Sciences, New Delhi; and A J Abraham, social activist in Ernakulam, the rebuilding of the school started in right earnest in September itself and the work was completed within two months.

The so-called government red-tapes and delays were overcome with the strong support provided by the school authorities, including the AEO Latha, school headmaster V K Santhosh, panchayat president T G Anoop, Cartoonist Academy and the local people.

The Trust spent Rs 33 lakh in replacing the damaged computers, reconstructing the collapsed compound walls, removing the slush and debris from the compound and classrooms, laying tiles on the floors, painting the walls and re-equipping the library. Soon, other NGOs joined hands, including 'Human Values' and 'Rapid Response' of Pondicherry, which replaced the old furniture, desks and benches with modern ones.

Now the schools sport a completely new look and none who visits the place will realise that these were the ones the floods had ravaged only a few months ago.

After merger of 4,600 primary schools, the Jharkhand government is planning to shut over 6,466 middle schools (classes 6 to 8), having less than 100 students.

These schools would be merged with upgraded high schools in phases, starting with the institutions, which have less than 50 students, education department officials said on Thursday.

Initially, 3,732 middle schools having less than 50 students would be undertaken for merger. The process of merging has already been started.

""Merger is an effort to provide quality education to students in a better educational ambience. Jharkhand has around 411 such middle schools where number of students is less than 10. If these schools are merged with high schools, students would get better education,"" said state education secretary AP Singh.

""As per the rules in the right to education (RTE), there should be at least three trained graduate teacher (TGT) in middle schools where number of students is less than 100. It means, we would have to afford additional Rs 18 lakh on teachers' salary even in the schools where number of students is less than 10, which is not logical,"" he added.

The decision comes at a time when the opposition parties and critics have been criticising the state government for merging the primary schools. Several ruling party elected representatives have also been lobbying with the government against the move. There have been protests in several parts of the state as well, against merger of schools.

The officials, however, argue that, ideally, there should be one middle school and five to seven primary schools in a panchayat. As many as 6,466 middle schools have been identified in Jharkhand, which could be merged with high schools within a 5-km radius in a panchayat, Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) officials said.

The state government has decided to offer bicycles to the students, who would be shifted to other schools so that they do not face any trouble in commuting to the school.

Meanwhile, the JEPC officials said they have completed the merging exercise of 4,600 primary schools.

JEPC director Uma Shankar Singh said there were 39,600 schools in 2016-17 under education department in Jharkhand. ""Of them, 18,000 schools had 60 or few students. These schools had an average of 1 or two teachers per school. Providing quality education was a major challenge. One teacher was handling four to five classes at a time. How could one expect a better education in these schools,"" he said.

The council said four-step process including field inspection, cross-district verification, block and district consultation and final notification to merge the schools.

Singh said 98% students from the 4,600 primary schools have been shifted and 96% students have expressed satisfaction with the consolidation. ""We faced difficulty to shift 150 students due to some technical reasons. Now, the issue is resolved and 120 students were shifted,"" he said.

The reorganisation of primary schools benefited seven lakh students with better teachers' availability and reduced the requirements of teachers by 4,500. Besides, the process saved government's Rs 400 crore through reduced teachers and infrastructure requirements, JEPC officials said.

Education Dept ropes in IIM Ranchi for merged school evaluation

State education secretary AP Singh said the department has roped in Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ranchi, for evaluation of the merged schools. The IIM, Ranchi would see if the reorganization process brought any difference in improving the education of students, who were shifted in merging process.

He said IIM Bangalore has also expressed willingness for a study of the reorganization process and its benefit."

Principals, head teachers and teachers are spearheading the change with the help of philanthropists.

Here are a few stories of faith and transformation.

Primary school teacher makes NHAI shift toll plaza

he grit, tenacity and commitment T of a government primary school teacher forced National Highways Authority of India to change its acquisition plan on Ludhiana-Chandigarh national highway, which is still being built.

LIFE IN COLOUR: Students are encouraged to be well turned out here

For 11 years, Sanjeev Kumar, a teacher at Government Primary School, Ghulal village near Samrala in district Ludhiana, worked to construct a new school building with the help of philanthropists from the village.

In July, a team of NHAI officials told him to vacate the school in two months.

""The NHAI planned to build a toll plaza here. They needed to widen the road for this and the school building was in the way. Over the past decade, we spent around Rs 26 lakh to construct the new building. When I told village residents, they were shattered,"" says Sanjeev Kumar.

Kumar first approached the district education officer and sent a message to secretary, education Krishan Kumar.

""He called me immediately. I went with a few village residents who have been helping us. As we sat there, he sent a letter to the Ludhiana deputy commissioner, asking him to do everything possible to save the school,"" Sanjeev recalls.

Ludhiana DC Pardeep Aggarwal sent SDM, Samrala and other officials to the school. The SDM called NHAI officials to the school. I heard the SDM telling NHAI officials that the school had to be saved at any cost and NHAI officials were asked to shift the toll plaza,"" he says.

Sanjeev pursued the issue till NHAI issued a fresh notification in October saying that the toll plaza would be shifted.

It is an incident secretary, education Krishan Kumar will not forget anytime soon. ""I could see his desperation and determination to save the school. Village residents were also committed to the cause. Such teachers deserve complete support. The Ludhiana deputy commissioner also took great interest in the endeavour and we are all happy with the result,"" he says.

Education dept steps in

It is remarkable that despite their tough circumstances, government school teachers are trying to bring about a qualitative change in their institutions.

""I learnt that a few teachers in the state improved their schools on their own, because of which more students got enrolled. In February, we called a meeting of such teachers. As they spoke about their experiences, we thought the idea was worth replicating across the state and called on principals and teachers to volunteer,"" says Krishan Kumar.

The officer pursued reforms in the education department during his previous stint as director general, school education for almost three years.

""By July, we had 425 schools with buildings turned into learning aids, improved infrastructure, amenities and sports facilities. The idea was to improve students' learning experience. We fixed the ambitious target of ""Mission 4,250"" by the beginning of the next academic session and asked these 425 teachers to motivate their friends and relatives in 10 other schools. Already, 1,700 schools have accomplished the task,"" he says.

According to the secretary, education, these teachers and communities are the biggest stakeholders in improving educational standards.

""Social accountability is much more result-oriented than departmental accountability,"" he said.

Incentives offered to teachers include transfer of choice, promotion and good ACR. ""All these benefits are non-monetary and the huge improvement in schools is without any extra burden on the state exchequer,"" Kumar adds.

Govt primary school, Jhans, Hoshiarpur

The school had just 17 students when Narinder Arora and his wife Manjit Kaur, both ETT teachers, joined in 2006. Now, there are 224 students. In an act that inspired trust, the couple got their daughter enrolled in the same school.

""There was nothing going for the small school but we decided to do everything possible to set things right. Apart from enrolling my daughter here, we motivated a few friends and fellow teachers to enroll their children as well. We assured them that their children's education or overall development would not suffer. Rather, we said they would see a marked improvement. My son is a UKG student here,"" said Narinder.

The teachers' dedication showed in exam results and students' performance in co-curricular activities.

""Soon, educated families also started sending their children to the school. We also had our own uniform,"" says Narinder Arora.

With this, village residents started pooling money for infrastructure upgrade. ""Philanthropists opened their hearts and pockets to us. Jalandharbased Satpal Singh Multani constructed two rooms. Jagjeet Singh

Government Primary School, Nathewal

The Mathematics room in the school is its latest addition. The walls of the verandah have pictures of donors and those of well turned out students on a board with the title, Ajj De Sohne Bache (the smart children of today).

""We write names of five children on this board every day to inspire the children to remain clean,"" says teacher Ajmer Singh who started the transformation in 2007.

""When I joined the school, two snakes were found in the storeroom,"" he recalls. It is now an office.

Outer walls and walls inside the classrooms have paintings, poems and messages painted on them. ""We want to attract students. Coming to school should be a pleasant experience for them,"" he says. It has worked with the children. ""Tanvi, a Class II student sustained an injury on her Jeeta and his family in the village opened their house for us to accommodate 100 students as the school did not have enough space,"" Arora said, estimating that people spent around Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh on the school.

Two years back, they started kindergarten classes on the lines of private schools. ""Now, we get children in nursery and have around 125 kids in kindergarten,"" he says. In June, Arora was promoted as master in a secondary school.

""It was very difficult for me to leave the school and children. Residents literally pleaded with me to stay. When a village elder asked me to stay in a choked voice, I decided to decline the promotion. After this, village residents provided 56 marlas of land to the school and raised a boundary wall. Now, we have enough space,"" he says, adding that they need the education department to provide more teachers as the strength of students is increasing.

""NRIs and other villagers have helped to improve the school. Now, the entire village is involved. People from other villages also come to get their children enrolled here. We have transferred 56 marlas of land to the school. If the number increases, we will provide an acre-and-a-half more of Panchayat land to the school,"" says Jagjeet Singh.

finger last year. But she came to school the next day,"" Ajmer says. According to him, NRIs and philanthropists from outside the village pitched in and around Rs 22 lakh has been spent so far.

""Apart from improving the amenities, I have been focusing on the core issue - improving learning outcomes among students,"" he adds. The school has a sprawling park and playground. Students have mid-day meals on tables with granite tops.

Rurka Kalan (Jalandhar)

The village has two government primary schools - one for girls and one for boys. In ambience and facilities, these schools could give private schools a run for their money.

Walls of both government primary schools have been turned into learning aids for children. They also have libraries and reading rooms. The girls' school also has an LCD screen to screen educational programmes.

""When I joined on July 1, 2006, the school building was in bad shape, with doors and windows missing. There were around 80 students but not a single bench. The first thing to do was to get desks for students before winter. The Youth Football Club of Rurka Kalan, which is working to promote football in the area, helped us procure desks at a cost of Rs 50,000,"" says school teacher Sanjiv Kumar, the man behind the transformation.

This was just the beginning. Over the years, infrastructure, education and sports in the school were upgraded.

""Philanthropists spent Rs 19 lakh on the school. With the way things have come up, more donors are volunteering,"" he says.

At Government Primary School for Girls, Buta Ram, who was promoted as centre head teacher and shifted to the boys' school a few days back, brought about the transformation.

""My daughter studies in this school. After I joined here in 2013, we managed to mobilize resources and undertake works worth around Rs 22 lakh,"" he says.

The school has its own logo and calendar. Numbers and letters are painted on the walls and a park based on the theme of mathematics is being constructed. Sanjiv and I are competing with each other to improve our schools,"" smiles Buta Ram.

Both schools have well-furnished and neat kitchens to cook mid-day meals.

The boys' school is in stark contrast with the street. The backyard of the adjoining senior secondary school is also overrun with weeds like a dark reminder of how things used to be and what could happen if these efforts are not sustained.

SETTING AN EXAMPLE

Secretary education, Krishan Kumar gets pictures from the pathbreaking schools. Every day, he picks the picture of one school and forwards it on WhatsApp groups of the education department. This motivates the others and generates healthy competition. The schools are promoting extra-curricular activities and helping students speak English

TAKING THE LEAD

As school infrastructure is improved, teachers feel more motivated. They share ideas and help each other even while competing. Sometimes, we spend from our own pockets as bonding with schools and children has improved,"" says Ashok Basra, principal, Government Senior Secondary School, Jamsher Khaas near Jalandhar.

They aren't sure if the authorities would do all that is needed to enhance the quality of government schools and bring them on a par with private ones.

Notably, Section 3 of the Act, which is considered the core of the legislation, provides children the fundamental right to free and compulsory education in a neighbourhood school.

According to the proposal, if there's a government school in neighbourhood of a child -- within 1km for primary education and 3km for higher primary -- he/she should get admitted to that instead of a private school.

Nagasimha G Rao, state convener of the RTE task force, said, ""The government is citing the example of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where government schools are in high demand. We're in touch with RTE activists there too. But the Karnataka scenario is different. Parents prefer English medium schools over government institutions.""

Mohammed Yousuf, a Marappa Garden resident and parent of a child who's an RTE beneficiary, said, ""I don't think government schools are up to the mark. They don't have good English teachers and lack infrastructure. Moreover, the nearest government school in our area is located on defence land, can be accessed by every passerby and has a dumpsite too. My son will not be safe.""

Education department officials admit that no new government school has been opened in the state in the past three years.

Citing a 2017 study by the RTE Forum, a national organization, which states that 90% of RTE students paid fees to private schools,Y Mariswamy, chairperson (in charge), Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights said, ""We get a lot of complaints from parents. It is sad that students are still made to pay fees at private schools despite being admitted under RTE. As we are the monitoring body for RTE and as well as child protection laws, I feel this move will give a boost to government schools and put in place systems required in these institutions.""

Niranjan Aradhya, senior fellow and programme head, Universalisation of Equitable Quality Education Programme, Centre for Child and the Law, NLSIU, said: ""This is a chance for government schools to improve. The government just needs to do a few basic things like recruit more English teachers and upgrade schools to the level of Kendriya Vidyalayas. To make RTE effective, they need to implement section 12(2) of the RTE Act which mandates private unaided schools receiving government largesse to reserve seats for weaker sections from their neighbourhood without the state having the obligation to reimburse them. Delhi has been following this since 2004."""

Sources said the move came after the Chief Minister's Office (CMO) intervened into the matter and asked the department to look into it.

But this doesn't translate into government owning and running schools.

No matter which way one looks at it, there is no widespread market failure in school education. There is the matter of supporting poor children, but as far as the supply of high-quality supply is concerned, there is overwhelming evidence that the market is competent to do so without any government involvement.

On the other hand, there is overwhelming evidence of the failure of government education. As the Secretary to the government of Assam for Education in the early 1990s, I quickly became aware of how the Minister of Education (in a Congress government in my time) used the appointment and transfers of teachers as the key mechanism to extract bribes. The director of education of Assam was the conduit for this. The entire system was totally broken: many schools only existed on paper and ""teachers"" drew salaries when there was nothing on the ground.

The seriously misguided policy idea that the government must directly own and run schools came about as a result of a grievous error of analysis made by Lord Macaulay nearly two hundred years ago. This misconception continues till today among the ""educated"" who are not aware of the ground reality. The socialist Aam Aadmi Party's misplaced passion for government schools is one such example, and discuss my meeting on this issue with a senior AAP leader some other time.

The ""educated"" typically have a belief that parents won't send their children to school unless they are compelled by the state to do so. It is believed that given a chance, poor parents prefer to deploy their children as child labour. But the reality is that - as James Tooley's research has confirmed this fact that was well-known to many of us - all over India hundreds of millions of poor parents are sending their children to for-profit low-cost private schools. Roughly a third of India's poor children attend such schools.

Further, that some parents may indeed deploy their children as labour (extremely rare today) is actually the inevitable consequence of socialist policies that make parents view education dimly - as not being worthwhile since it won't improve their children's job prospects. There is a strong factual basis for this perception since millions of low quality ""graduates"", who are totally unsuited for the job market, are found unemployed today across India in second-tier towns and in the villages. Let's us, therefore, agree that there is no one more keenly interested in the welfare of their children than the parents. We must harness this powerful force instead of rejecting it.

Second, there is a mistaken belief that a school must have significant infrastructure and paraphernalia, or that its teachers must necessarily be ""highly qualified"". But as Gandhi said in a speech at Chatham House in 1931: ""the schools established after the European pattern were too expensive for the people"" and ""The village schools were not good enough for the British administrator, so he came out with his programme. Every school must have so much paraphernalia, building, and so forth"".

Gandhi, therefore, said: ""I defy anybody to fulfil a programme of compulsory primary education of these masses inside of a century. This very poor country of mine is ill able to sustain such an expensive method of education. Our State would revive the old village schoolmaster and dot every village with a school both for boys and girls"". What a brilliant thought! - except that there must not be any direct role for the state even in such schools.

James Tooley's book, The Beautiful Tree, shows that children who attend low cost for-profit private schools (including in India) achieve much higher educational outcomes than children from comparable government schools, despite such private schools having virtually no infrastructure and the teachers of such schools not even being ""adequately"" qualified. The reason these schools succeed while government schools fail is that teachers in the private schools are held to account for outcomes by the Principal, who is often the school owner. These for-profit undertakings depend critically on demonstrating real results in order to continue to get the custom of the poor parents who pay a small fee on a monthly basis and will quickly switch their child to a competing school if they don't' see significant progress each month.

Tooley's research enables us to totally dispense with the myth that government schools are required to educate children. This research has also confirmed Gandhi's assertion that excellent village schools operated in India prior to British rule. These schools functioned from the houses of the teachers, did not need a vast paraphernalia of infrastructure, and all sections of the community were able to send their children to these schools to avail high quality, low-cost education. In Shanti Niketan, Rabindranath Tagore was basically attempting to replicate this form of education, with a focus on learning and not on facilities or infrastructure.

Unfortunately, Macaulay's misplaced paternalism injected government into schools in India and was also copied by the UK, which had an entirely private (or local) school education system prior to that. In both cases, the effect was harmful, as the number of students and quality of education plummeted. Till today, an average government school across the world performs much worse than an average private school, barring a few exceptions.

We noted at the outset that the government must support the poor to access education - to ensure equality of opportunity. There is a simple and direct way to achieve this without owning and running schools, by providing vouchers of certain nominal value (depending on the income level of parents) for each poor child up to year 12 that can only be exchanged for school education (including for vocational education). This is our party's policy. These vouchers would enable the children of poor parents to attend a good for-profit private school.

The idea of vouchers has a long history and has also been tried out in a number of ways across the world, although not in the full-blown manner that's our party's policy. Milton Friedman is probably best known for his advocacy of this system but his ideas did not go far enough. He was willing to allow competition between private and government schools but our party does not see any role whatsoever for even a single government school. Our party is committed to the total privatisation of all government schools - in a well-structured manner.

The alignment of incentives when parents choose (and themselves fund, even if to a small extent) for-profit private schools is the best way to quickly and significantly improve India's dismal quality of school education.

Our party would, of course, remove most regulations in this area, such as requirements for infrastructure, playgrounds or even for the qualification of teachers. The market will determine who is best placed to teach. All we would require is that each school pick an affiliating board (such as CBSE, but that would need to be disbanded and private boards would emerge) and demonstrate high quality student outcomes in order to be eligible for the school vouchers. This would be an outcomes-based regulatory system, with detailed management (including things like the medium of instruction) left to schools and parents: the parties with the deepest direct interest in outcomes.

We therefore disagree with things like the Right to Education Act which we see as a socialist anachronism. India needs to fully liberate the education sector to allow the best private sector initiatives to emerge, unfettered by the misguided notions of any delusional (and mostly corrupt) bureaucrat or minister.

The government has sufficient core work to perform, in which it has repeatedly failed. When Indian governments can't deliver security and justice, how can they possibly deliver education? Today India is led by a government which can't distinguish between mythology and cosmetic surgery, between homeopathy and medicine. So what makes us think it can teach our children?"

A Nov.22 circular, issued by the Department of Pre-University Education, says that the students of PU institutions coming under the PU Board, including government, aided and private colleges, are barred from using mobile phones during college.

The circular has been issued as per instructions from Chief Minister H .D.

On Tuesday (20 November), Minister for Education Vinod Tawde said that the proposal is being considered by the government.

The minister gave the above reply while addressing a question raised by Shiv Sena MLA Vilas Potnis, claimed the report. He had highlighted that states like Bengal, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Kerala has made it compulsory for the students between Class I and X to learn the local language.

However, the minister later told reporters that the proposal is 'difficult' to implement.

It was reported in 2016 that an earlier proposal of teaching everyone Marathi till class 7 was opposed by certain education institutions in the state. They contended that such a move should not be made mandatory for students coming from other states or outside India. One school also complained that it had found it tough to hire a Marathi teacher.

The survey found that 88% students were allegedly beaten up, as a matter of routine, multiple times a week in some government schools, while in other government schools, around 30% experienced corporal punishment multiple times. All 50 students from low-cost public schools, who were part of the survey, reported that they were beaten up.

On an average, almost half of the children interviewed were allegedly beaten by teachers multiple times a week. The report, Choking Childhood, is based on the findings of research undertaken by social organisation Agrasar, which works with disadvantaged communities.

A total of 521 children and 100 parents sampled randomly were surveyed, and an informal group interview with 12 teachers from two different government schools was undertaken.

There are around 130 primary government schools in Gurugram, from which the students were randomly selected. There are around 18,000 students in the primary schools, as per estimates.

The Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, prohibits 'physical punishment' & 'mental harassment' under Section 17(1) and makes it a punishable offence under Section 17(2).

""The report studies the impact of corporal punishment on the psyche of children who are doubly disadvantaged by virtue of them being children who are predominantly from poor migrant communities and first-generation learners,"" said Prerit Rana, co-founder and CEO of Agrasar. He added that corporal punishment in schools was not only a violation of human rights, but also impaired the health and education of the children.

According to the report, 70% of the children reported that they were beaten at home after parents learnt that they were beaten in school. More than 70% of the parents said that they beat their children, as they believe punishment is for their child's well being.

The report also outlined the challenging working conditions and lack of professional conduct among teachers in government schools fostered an environment that puts deprived children at risk of experiencing corporal punishment.

Responding to the findings of the report, Premlata Yadav, the district elementary education officer said, ""I will have to see the report to know how the survey was conducted. I do not agree with the findings of the report. One can expect 1-2% of such cases but it is incorrect to say that 80% of the children are beaten.""

Yadav added that teachers are not allowed to punish students and strict action is taken if such a complaint is raised. ""If we receive information of this nature, we warn the teachers and sometimes, it can also lead to their suspension. We take strict action on reports of corporal punishment,"" she said.

A Sanskrit teacher at a government school said that corporal punishment is rarely doled out. ""Teachers rarely beat students. However, sometimes children do not understand and teachers are compelled to take matters into their hands. I do not raise my hands at my students. I either ask them to do rounds of the ground with their hands raised up or call their parents,"" she said."

Subject-wise performance evaluation of students from government and private schools from the state, revealed the performance of government school students to be poorer than private schools in all districts, apart from Hyderabad where the performance was on par.

Looking at the data, it should not be a surprise that parents prefer shelling out more money in sending their children to private schools for education than government for better education. As per available data, more than half of the about 48 lakh students studying in various schools in Telangana, are studying in private schools.

For example, while the performance of students from government schools in Nalgonda was 31 per cent and 33 per cent in Mathematics and Science, it was 39 per cent and 40 percent respectively by private school students. Similarly, while the performance of government school students in Karimnagar in Social Science and English subjects was 38 per cent and 34 per cent respectively, it was 46 per cent and 56 per cent in private schools.

Only in Hyderabad, the difference between performance of government and private school students was not significant.

Urban-rural divide also deep

Significant difference in performance of students in various subjects has also been observed with respect to whether a student belongs to rural or urban area, indicating the disparity in quality of education received by students depending on where they belong from.

In the NAS it has been observed that in all districts of the state the performance of students in urban areas is higher than those from rural areas. For example, in Rangareddy district while the performance of students in Mathematics and Science in rural areas was found to be 33 per cent and 35 per cent respectively, in the urban areas it was 41 per cent in each subject. Similar is the case in all other districts.

Caste affects spoken English

The NAS also highlights the need for ensuring that education reaches every student equitably, regardless of the caste of the student. Significant difference has been found in the performance of students from the general category and those from the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes.

A difference of almost 5-10 per cent was observed in the performances of students from general categories as compared to those from reserved categories. The difference was prominent in all the subjects that students study at the high school level.

However, the difference is most pronounced, as much as 15 per cent, in case of English language. For example, while the students belonging to the general category had an average performance percentage in Mathematics of 41 per cent while English had 50 per cent. On the other hand, among the students from Scheduled Castes it was 31 per cent and 35 per cent respectively."

At a time when Government talks about ""Digital Literacy "" how is it possible that people especially students don't have access to electricity? Despite the obvious connection between electricity and educational achievement, however, the troubling scenes in Jammu and Kashmir are repeated as there are thousands of Government run schools without electricity. Present and past Governments in J&K, have been focusing on administrative affairs of education department or even pedagogy, but very little focus has been given to electricity in Government schools. The absence of focus on this issue is detrimental because, a study has put it like this, ""education is also widely recognized as one of the most essential components for poverty reduction"". Lack of electricity at primary, middle and secondary schools therefore creates considerable obstacles towards escaping poverty and correlates with many factors that contribute directly towards it. It is a big impediment towards digital literacy as well because when there is no electricity in a Government school, the children will have no access to computers and other digital equipment. The report on link between education and poverty assesses the direct link between electricity and education.

Based on the most recently available survey data from the World Bank and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the report first describes the current state of electrification of schools. According to the this data, roughly four out of every five primary and secondary schools in African countries (Govt and Private schools) surveyed lacked access to electricity, along with almost three quarters of village schools in India. This is much worst in Jammu & Kashmir state as more than 70 percent Government schools are un-electrified in this 21st century. When it comes to Kashmir division, more than 80 percent of Government schools are un electrified and these details I have been provided officially by several Chief Education Officer (CEOs) when I sought details under Right to Information Act (RTI). In Jammu province also the majority of Government schools in Rajouri , Poonch , Doda , Ramban , Reasi , Kishtwar and Doda are still un electrified.

Based on a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and policy literature concerning electricity and education, the report mentioned above assesses the educational benefits of electrification of primary and secondary schools, including lighting and access to information and communications technologies (ICT) as well improvement in staff retention and student completion and graduation rates. The final two main parts of the report, drawn from energy policy, development studies, and innovations in financing and public private partnerships literature, discuss the challenges facing school electrification, such as lack of financing and technical problems with equipment, along with the solutions and incentives with the potential to overcome them, such as Public Private Partnerships (PPPs).

Rajouri , Srinagar

At a time when Government of India is celebrating achievement of 100 percent electrification feat across country, information available reveals some astonishing facts. As per the Government figures, there are 1720 Govt schools in Rajouri district and out of them 1484 (over 86 percent) don't have access to electricity. Out of 1720 Government schools in Rajouri district , there are 995 primary, 557 middle, 117 high and 41 higher secondary schools. In addition to these there are 6 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalyas (KGBV) across the district.

In Srinagar district, more than 300 Government schools have not been provided electricity connection by Government till date. More than two years have passed since Government had ordered to get all the schools electrified. In Srinagar there are around 519 Govt run schools out of which there are 204 primary schools, 211 middle schools, 74 high schools and 30 higher secondary schools. Out of the 519 Govt schools, there are around 305 schools which are still un electrified.

Budgam, Ganderbal

In Budgam district there are more than 81 percent Government run schools which are un-electrified. This is an official information that was provided to me by Chief Education Officer (CEO) of Budgam under RTI Act. CEO Budgam informed me in his reply that there are around 1,036 schools in the district out of total 1278 that are ""without proper electricity connection"". Actually I had sought the details of all the un electrified Govt schools in Kashmir valley under RTI Act. I filed application before the designated Public Information Officer (PIO) in the Directorate of School Education Kashmir (DSEK). Instead of providing the information , PIO passed the buck to all the Chief Education Officers (CEOs) of Kashmir valley plus Leh and Kargil . That is why I got the details from each district. I also sought information about the number of girls' schools without a toilet facility and the number of schools without a proper electricity connection, boundary wall and drinking water facility. CEO Budgam in his reply said that ""all"" the girls' schools had a washroom facility, ""there are dysfunctional toilets "".

In Ganderbal district out of 587 government schools, 434 schools are un electrified which means around 83 percent Government schools have no access to electricity. These details were revealed by Chief Education Officer (CEO) Ganderbal in a reply to my Right to Information (RTI) application.

Conclusion

Why is Government compromising on providing the basic infrastructure to Government schools while as no such compromise is done when it comes to perks and salaries of Government employees especially Govt school teachers ? Infrastructure and level of education is coming down in Govt schools , but this is not the case with Government's own employees ? Their salaries continue to be hiked. Govt spends more than Rs 1.40 lakhs every month on an average Government school in J&K. Do poor kids enrolled in these schools get the desired facilities ? On contrary to this, not even Rs 50,000 is spent on an average private school in J&K by local school management, but the results are quite different. Board of School Education (BOSE) collected an amount of Rs 16.81 crores from students in shape of exam fees in Kashmir valley recently, but the class Xth & XIIth students were forced to write exams under candle light as there is no facility of gen-sets in the exam centers. Not even heaters are made available in Govt schools (exam centers) by BOSE and children are made to shiver in the cold. I have been forced to seek intervention of J&K State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) where I filed a petition recently.

I hope to get some good direction soon from SHRC. Imagine kind of trauma poor kids are facing in classrooms during June , July and August when temperature rises above 30 degree in valley and more than 40 in Jammu plains or in Rajouri , Ramban or Poonch districts ? After missing the initial deadline of May 2017, the Narendra Modi government on April 29th this year announced ""electrification"" of all inhabited villages in India has been completed.After having all the data available vis a vis un electrified schools in J&K , it clearly indicates that announcement by Government was largely symbolic. In a state where 75 to 80 percent Government schools are still un electrified how can Government claim to have achieved 100 percent electrification target ? How can Government claim to achieve digital literacy target in future if Govt schools are not electrified?

""My children go to a private school Madam, it is close to home, they learn English and mathematics"", says Selvi with a big smile on her face. Selvi, a Marathahalli-based domestic worker, like many others from low income households in Bangalore, finds private schools a better choice for her child.

Research has often pointed out that there is not much difference in the learning outcomes of children in government schools and in private schools. Yet in Bengaluru, like many urban centres in the country, children across income groups are flocking to private schools. While the number of private schools are rapidly rising, government schools are increasingly being merged/shut down in the name of low student enrolment. The narrative around government schools remains one of poor accountability and infrastructure, poorly trained or absent teachers, poor attendance and pass rates of students.

In 2016-17, Bangalore Urban had 1403 government schools, and almost thrice as many - 3426 - private schools. Student enrolments illustrate the trend better. That year, only 1.8 lakh children were enrolled in government schools, compared to nearly 11 lakh children in private schools.

The most commonly cited concern about government schools is the lack of sufficient, well-qualified teachers.

Dr V P Niranjan Aradhya, Programme Head (Right To Education) at the Centre for Child and Law, NLSIU, points out that there were over 28,000 vacancies for government elementary school teachers in Karnataka as of 2016-17. ""The number of sanctioned posts was 1.94 lakh, but only 1.66 lakh teachers were working then. The department has been talking about plans to recruit teachers, but currently poorly-paid guest teachers are being appointed in many vacancies,"" he says.

Given the low rate of enrolment in government schools in the city, there are schools with only 10-15 students spread across grade 1-5, or schools that have only 30 students overall from class 1-7. Such schools often have only one or two teachers. These teachers have to teach every subject to students across all grades, even if they are not qualified for it, says Aradhya. Teachers are also burdened with additional duties and administrative tasks. There are even schools in the city that lack a Headmaster, requiring one among the skeletal teaching staff to do the additional administrative tasks of the HM.

Anurag Behar, Vice Chancellor at Azim Premji University, says the low quality of schools comes down to the poor quality of teacher education. Behar was part of the implementation committee for the Justice J S Verma Commission report on teacher education. The Justice Verma Commission, set up by the Supreme Court, had pointed out in its 2012 report that the majority of Teacher Education Institutions (TEI) in the country were highly commercial private establishments.

Behar says: ""In the 1960s, India had only about 1300 TEIs. In the early 1990s, it was about 1500. Then, between 1993 and 2011, this number rose to about 16,000. In this period, the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) gave licenses to many private institutions that were fraudulent and corrupt; many of these institutions don't even hold classes."" He says that out of nearly 18,000 TEIs in the country now, about 92% are private.

Other issues pointed out by the Verma Commission Report include: teacher education curriculum remaining unchanged for over 65 years, TEIs being standalone institutions rather than being part of universities, the generalist nature of M.Ed programmes etc. The Commission had in fact reviewed 291 TEIs in Maharashtra, and recommended that 85% of these should be shut down.

Though much of the Commission's recommendations have been ignored, there have been a few initiatives such as the centre's budget announcement this year to introduce an integrated B.Ed course. ""But what about the existing 16,000-odd TEIs that are of low quality? Nothing much has been done about those,"" says Behar.

While shortage of qualified teachers is a major concern, both Aradhya and Behar say that teachers are not respected or incentivised enough in the education system. Teacher absenteeism - i.e., absence without a valid reason - has been blamed for much of the shortcomings of government schools.

But a 2016 study by Azim Premji Foundation (APF) across over 600 schools in six states including Karnataka, had shown that teacher absenteeism was only 2.5%. However, the overall teacher absence was around 19%, which was due to other administrative or departmental work they were assigned, trainings, or legitimate leaves; that is, teachers were absent due to systemic issues rather than a lack of professionalism.

The current system, wherein teachers' promotions are based entirely on tenure, hardly incentivises high-performing teachers as well.

Bengaluru's government schools are also affected by bureaucratic procedures like frequent teacher transfers. ""The transfer process is lengthy, and happens just a few months into the academic year. Events like elections can delay it even more. Neither the teacher nor the students would know if the teacher would remain in the school that year. This affects consistency in academic inputs,"" says Kapil Dawda, Bengaluru City Director for the non-profit Teach for India. Teach for India's fellows work as full-time teachers in low-income schools; currently they work with 24 government schools in the city.

Jean Boddu, Senior Program Manager at Mentor Together, another non-profit that works with government schools, says the distribution of bags and books to students also gets delayed by 2-3 months from the start of the academic year. ""Also, there is a huge dropout of students in 9th standard, as students who are academically weak are neglected, and fail exams."" Boddu says such students are not supported well enough as the school is worried that its 10th standard pass percentage may drop down if they continue there.

In terms of infrastructure, Bengaluru's government schools do have basic infrastructure like toilets and electricity, but in many cases the infrastructure is not functional. For example, schools that have toilets may lack water; or the toilet is kept locked. There is little investment in the operation and maintenance of existing infrastructure. In Bengaluru, corporates have adopted many government schools, providing funds, books, infrastructure etc.

Dawda says that schools located in areas like Whitefield which have a high concentration of corporates, tend to have better essential infrastructure because of this. ""Government schools in these areas often have a science lab, computer lab etc., which schools in areas like Ejipura or Goripalya don't have,"" he says. Since such philanthropic work is not streamlined and coordinated by the Department of Public Instruction, the results are often skewed and less effective.

In education system, the Cluster Resource Person (CRP) who oversees some 10-12 government schools per cluster, is the academic authority, says Aradhya. ""CRP has to monitor the quality of learning process, but he usually ends up doing administrative work and collecting data from schools. Parents also don't know that it's the CRP they have to approach, to hold their child's school accountable,"" he says.

The Karnataka School Quality Assessment and Accreditation Council (KSQAAC) routinely assesses government schools in the state and accredits them. Schools have to undergo both a self-assessment and external assessment, and are graded on multiple aspects like learning achievement, learning environment and physical environment. They are then given accreditation in grades ranging from A+ to D.

The Council has routinely ranked schools poorly. In 2014-15, for example, it had assessed 1220 government schools, 917 aided schools and 24 unaided schools in the state. In Bangalore Urban overall (Bangalore North and South educational districts combined), out of 78 schools, no schools got A or A+ grade, and only eight got B+. Sixteen schools got B grade, 33 got C+, 17 got C and four schools got D grade.

Aradhya opines that the accreditation system is useless as long as there is no initiative to improve the quality of schools. ""If the government is providing functional infrastructure, recruiting teachers and monitoring the learning process in schools, then it has the right to give accreditation. Else, continuing this exercise without doing anything to improve quality, only sends the message that government schools are bad,"" he says.

While government schools compulsorily have to submit to the KSQAAC accreditation process, private schools are not bound to. In the current system, private schools can participate in the accreditation process if they want to, by paying a fee to KSQAAC. Very few usually do.

Currently there isn't a system to assess private schools on their quality. The majority of private schools in Bangalore are low-income schools without adequate infrastructure or well-qualified teachers. However parents are keen to send their children to these schools because of the English language education offered, and the general perception that these schools are better.

Accountability remains the core difference between public schools and private ones, according to Shashi Kumar D, General Secretary of KAMS (Associated Management of Private Schools in Karnataka). ""There are issues with private schools, they are not isolated from the problems of running a school. For example there may be a lacuna with the lessons offered, or the hire of unskilled teachers. But because of the pervasive accountability in these establishments the teachers increase their skills, knowledge and teaching ability,"" Kumar says.

However, research has often showed that there isn't much of a difference in the quality of education in government and private schools. World Bank's World Development Report 2018 says that, in the 40 countries it researched on, including India, there were no differences in the learning outcomes of children in private and public schools, given that they had matching familial backgrounds. Any marginal difference was because private schools mainly admitted students from advantaged backgrounds. That is, student performance depended on the student's household, and not the quality of education offered by the school. Another study by APF in rural Andhra Pradesh in 2015 had shown similar results.

Behar says, ""There would be less than 2% private schools that are elite and actually have the resources to run a high quality school. But even their quality of education is suspect. The remaining low-fee private schools are mostly much worse in quality."" Behar says there would be only 10-15% private schools that are truly committed to providing good quality education. ""For the rest, it is a business,"" he says.

Dr Shalini Rajneesh, Principal Secretary (Primary and Secondary Education Department), says that government school students often lack a good support system. ""First-generation school goers cannot study the way a typical private school student studies - by rote. There are no support systems for public school students, no remedies and no help at home. That is why, now we are attempting to bring a more holistic form of learning; and we are doing this along with NGOs across the city, like Akshara.""

Whether government schools will in fact get the right support, or whether they will continue to be shut down further in the name of low enrolment, remains to be seen."

The government had introduced digital classrooms in high schools, infused of ICT as part of pedagogy, brought in subjects like robotics in residential schools, and most recently, made over government schools by turning their walls into canvases.

However, it seems their efforts don't prove much because the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE), National Achievement Survey (NAS) by MHRD, and the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) have thoroughly highlighted the poor quality of government schools in Telangana, with respect to infrastructure as well as quality of education being imparted.

In fact, compared to the data published in the UDISE for the academic year 2014-15, this year's report revealed that not much has changed in government schools since TRS had come to power. One glaring example is that of computer availability in government schools, which has actually gone down to 36 percent from being 37.5 percent in 2014, as per the UDISE numbers. In secondary schools, it has increased slightly from 29 to 31 percent.

When it comes to matters of infrastructure in primary schools such as having boundary walls, single-room classrooms, playgrounds, and kitchen sheds, the data indicates stagnancy. While studies showed that there was a steady improvement in the performance of residential schools run by the social welfare department -- where just about 15 per cent of students studied -- other government schools like the zilla parishad schools were constantly ignored.

Another example is that of science laboratories in secondary schools. The percentage of schools having Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Computer and Maths labs have down to 17.6, 17.5, 16.9. 11.7 and 6.3 percent from 19.3, 19.2, 18.5, 12.7 and 8 percent respectively.

Poor quality of education

Various reports released in the last four years raised questions over the quality of education being imparted in government schools of Telangana. For example the NAS report released this year pointed out that performance of school students in Telangana in all the subjects was poorer than that of students from most districts of other southern states.

Even the Comptroller and Auditor General in its audit report released this year pulled up the Telangana government as it found that 14-26 percent children in primary schools and 21-47 percent children in upper primary schools scored less than 40 percent in the years 2014-17. It also pointed out issues like unhygienic conditions of kitchens in schools used for cooking midday meals.

TRS government can't walk the talk?

It's no news that the TRS government has never forgone an opportunity to talk about its achievements in residential educational institutions run by the social welfare department. Good performance of students in SSC exams, competitive exams, academic and extra-curricular initiatives has often been the talk of the town during TRS rule.

However, government teachers point out that these residential schools -- home to jus10 percent of the 22 lakh students enrolled in different government schools across the State -- are not run by the Department of School Education (DSE) and receive ample funds, as a result they deliver better results. The government is all-talk when it comes to these schools and mum when it comes schools that come under the DSE.

The stark difference could be seen in this year's SSC results as the pass percentage in residential schools was above 90 percent whereas in zilla parishad schools it was just about 75 percent.

Telangana State United Teachers Federation, general secretary, Chava Ravi, said, ""Around 20,000 teacher positions are vacant in government schools. The TRS government has not recruited a single teacher since 2014, even though the TRT was announced for 8,972 posts last year.""

""There are several schools where one to two teachers teach 5 classes and cover 18 subjects. Moreover, in this academic year, school maintenance funds have not been released yet by the State government and the amount is expected to go down with the merger of SSA (Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan) and RMSA (Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan).

Negative marks for TRS government on school fee regulation issue : Parents

Parents across the State have been crying hoarse demanding fee regulation. The Hyderabad Schools Parents Association (HSPA) has conducted many protests on this issue, including writing a post card to the Chief Minister and producing a song chiding him for not taking any action on the issue. The post even went viral on social media.

These protests and promises by the government -- especially the education minister -- notwithstanding, the TRS government has failed to address problems of exorbitant fee. The State government constituted a committee to look into the issue, headed by former Osmania University Vice Chancellor, Prof Tirupati Rao. The committee was formed in March 2017 and was supposed to submit its report in the next one month. It actually did so only in December. It's a year since the report was submitted, but it has not been made public yet. The government did not even form the district fee regulatory committees."

Furthermore, the bench directed the authorities concerned to file their counter affidavit by December 6. It also impleaded the Director of State Council for Education, Research and Training, as a party.

According to the petitioner, there are about 37,211 government schools, 8,403 government aided and 12,419 private self-financing schools, imparting education to about 1.25 crore students.

Although as per the State's education policy, English is taught as the second language from Class 2 to 12 in Tamil medium aided and unaided schools, despite having successfully completing Plus Two with high marks, a student was unable to speak or understand any communication in English.

Moreover, he was also unable to converse or write fluently in English.

This leads to communication problems for him when he pursues professional courses or higher education that are imparted only in English.

However, the students who study in CBSE schools find it easier to understand and communicate in English. Therefore, a need has arisen to lay emphasis on spoken English, said the petitioner."

Just that morning a few of them had visited the Government Urdu Higher Primary School at Nachanahalli Palya on Manandavadi Road and soon after lunch, nearly ten of them led by Dame Hilary Blume (Director, The Green Hotel and Founder, Charities Advisory Trust in UK) were ready to hop into the mini bus and visit a few more schools run by the Government of Karnataka.

As the bus drove towards the congested Kyathamaranahalli and entered a small lane, the women, who alighted from the bus, were surprised to see a clean, well-maintained Government Higher Primary School. There was a welcome committee with the Head Master of the School V. Ramaswamy, a disciplined, dedicated teacher and H. Saraswathi, the Director of RLHP (Rural Literacy and Health Programme) who is coordinating with Charities Advisory Trust, greeting the group of lively women.

Walking up a flight of stairs that led to the library of the school at the far end, the students, both boys and girls, all dressed neatly in green uniforms got up shyly but most of them immediately recognised the familiar of face of Dame Hilary Blume, who is no stranger to Mysuru.

""Do you recognise Madam Hilary?"" asked the Head Master and most of the students immediately recalled her earlier visit to the school. The library is well- equipped with books, desks and benches (all funded by the Charities Advisory Trust) and the visitors were keen to see how many students were really into reading the books.

A few of the students got up to demonstrate how helpful the reading habits they had been inculcated with had worked. A girl from eighth standard picked up a book in English and read without any mistakes in clear diction while a few others read from books in Kannada related to freedom fighters and scientists. Then they sang a few patriotic songs.

Now, it was the turn of the motley group of exuberant women, mostly in their sixties and seventies, to become children. They started singing the nursery rhyme for kids, 'Head, Shoulder, Knees and Toes.' Led by 'Good Giver' Annie Taylor, who had taught little children in Ethiopia, they began on a slow pitch and accelerated. The children who joined them sang with gusto and joy.

Impressed by the kind of work done by the school and RLHP, Hilary Blume asked the Head Master, what else they required for their school. He said that they needed a water filter and a LCD screen projector. She promised to install both through the profits earned in The Green Hotel.

""The profit of every meal eaten in The Green Hotel helps buy an egg for a child or for the books of children,"" she told SOM.

The children then wanted to know more about the visitors and they introduced themselves. There were two Elizabeths, one from Canada and another from England, both of whom were doctors. There was Ann Kingston, who was the knitting teacher for the ""Knit for Peace"" group and Danielle Liebech, who had visited The Green Hotel five times and there was also the young L. Marie, originally from France, who is working with Hilary Blume.

After a satisfying visit at Kyathamaranahalli, the group moved towards Sathagalli, where there is a slum and another Government Higher Primary School. It was around 4.30 pm. The RLHP runs a nutrition programme here in the school premises. A few of the infants and children were sitting there along with their mothers. A young woman, fondly called Akhila aunty by the Sathagalli slum residents, had brought ragi porridge which had a healthy mix of pulses and greens like drumstick leaves.

Along with the porridge, the kids were also given boiled eggs. A few of the mothers told this reporter how useful this programme was, as it had helped their malnourished children gain weight and improve their health.

Then right next door was the Government Higher Primary School where in the evening free supplementary classes are run for the children. Children in the age group of six to 14 were sitting there quietly waiting for the classes to begin.

All of them in unison welcomed the idea of the evening classes and how they were all happy to be there studying.

RLHP Director Saraswathi asked one of the students to get up and welcome the visitors. A tenth standard student B.B. Mehak got up and welcomed the group. This girl, who is the Malala Yousafzai, (Nobel Laureate from Pakistan who is an activist for female education) of Mysuru, had stopped a child marriage in her area a couple of years ago.

One of the teachers, Seema, was a child labourer, who used to roll agarbathis. But today she has completed her Pre-University education because of the support of RLHP and Charities Advisory Trust.

The slum children here are so vibrant that when they were asked to sing a song, four girls got up and began singing Jalle Kabbu..., a folk song in faultless Kannada and dancing to choreographed steps. Asked for their names, they said Luhia, Simran, Husna and Rafia.

Everyone was moved by the effort that had gone into preparing the deprived sections of the society to face the world boldly.

""The Charities Advisory Trust is supporting many causes including the beauticians' course, nutrition programme, sponsoring health camps from the funds collected through Good Gift India. Their focus is also on libraries and they have helped setting it up in nearly 100 Government Higher Primary Schools,"" said Saraswathi.

Later, speaking to Star of Mysore, Hilary Blume said that 'Knit for Peace' is an initiative of the Charities Advisory Trust started as an income generation project for Hutu and Tutsi widows, victims of the Rwandan genocide and civil war.

""At our suggestion, the widows knitted school jumpers for the many orphans and we paid them by raising funds through featuring the project in Good Gift Catalogue, another of the Trust's initiative,"" said Hilary Blume.

""Good Gifts is an initiative started by me. This is a concept where the giver knows exactly where the money goes. Hence, we came out with Good Gifts Catalogue where people can identify with a range of causes; in fact, there are over 400 ways to help people take their first step out of poverty, enjoy better health and increased opportunities,"" she said and added, ""I ask the givers to come and see how the concept works. That is how I bring such people to visit Mysuru to see the schools and slums and how the money they have given is spent. Our next visit with the 'Knit for Peace' group is in early January,"" she said

Asked whether she believed like many others who are doing charity work that charity is also a business, Hilary Blume said, ""These are causes that I was introduced to, and continue to support, as I believe in them. I believe that once I give money, then the money is out of my hands to control. So it is important that I can trust those organisations I support. Administration is critical to keep a charity going, but too many big charities waste too much money.""

On whether she has written any books on charity having worked for more than 40 years in the field, she recalled five books titled, 'Fund Raising - A Comprehensive Handbook,' 'Accounting and Financial Management for Charities,' 'Charity Trading Handbook,' 'Museum Trading Handbook' and 'Charity Shop Handbook' she has written. Hilary Blume also revealed that she is penning the sixth one now called 'The Ethics of Charity Giving.'"

However, the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR), a state government department constituted under the Child Rights Act of 2005, aims to change this.

Next month, the DCPCR will undertake a rigorous assessment of 5,800 schools in the capital -- all of which are administered by the state government's education ministry and/or New Delhi's three municipal corporations- as a precursor to creating the country's first ever 'School Development Index' for a state.

Owing to the sheer number of schools involved and data required, earlier indices compiled by the government have focussed on the state or districts as a whole rather than individual schools.

Unde the School Development Index, Delhi's schools will be ranked according to three parameters, as devised by the Adhyayan Foundation - an NGO that focuses on capacity building of schools.

The first parameter is safety and security, the second is teaching and learning outcomes while the third parameter is community participation and social integration. Each school will be given a rank between 1 to 4 for each criteria, with 1 indicating that it has the most room for improvement.

The assessment of Delhi's schools is expected to continue into next year, with a final report from the DCPCR due in May. The government body has made sure to clarify that the exercise is not a punitive one but an instructive one. The exercise will give the administrators of these schools an insight into best practices and facilitate an environment for collaboration.

Education has long been a priority for the current state government of Delhi. When contesting state elections for Delhi in 2015, the made the improvement of education outcomes one of the core aspects of their platform.

So far, it seems that they have kept their word. For example, in July this year, the government launched libraries in 100 primary schools in the city, in addition to a 100 last year. In June, it announced the planned launch of a ' happiness curriculum' in government schools, which involves meditation and life skills training. They have also instituted school management committees, improved the infrastructure of schools and invested in teacher training."

Scenes from two government schools in Delhi

The walls of the entryway of the school are covered with bright charts that talk about everything from sustainable development and 'Swachh Bharat' to 'happiness goals' and exam schedules. The cream-coloured floor gleams and the sun peeps out from the clouds behind the rows of students -- dupattas pinned, shirts tucked in, not a hair out of place -- sitting quietly for morning assembly. It's 8 a.m. on a hazy Delhi morning and this school in Dwarka Sector 10 is about to flip my perception of government schools completely.

""Government schools in India get a bad rap,"" says Principal T.P. Singh. ""But with RPVV, we try to do better."" The results are evident. The Dwarka branch of RPVV or Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya, along with its counterparts in Lajpat Nagar and Rohini Sector 11, are the three schools from Delhi that have made it to the nationwide list of top 12 government schools that's been compiled by EducationWorld portal as part of its India School Rankings 2017-18. In fact, the Dwarka school tops the list, with the Lajpat Nagar and Rohini schools at No. 6 and No. 12, respectively.

Labs and libraries

The RPVV schools, a Delhi government initiative to provide quality education to marginalised sections, were first opened in 1997, with one each in Rohini, Paschim Vihar and Surajmal Vihar. Twenty-one years later, there are 22 schools, with five of them launched last year alone.

All of them boast of language labs, upgraded auditoriums, relatively well-stocked libraries and, most importantly, a teacher-student ratio of 1:35. They take in students from Classes VI to XII and admissions are through an entrance test. Students are eligible only if they have studied in a government school for a minimum of two years.

When RPVVs were started as schools for high performers, they had the same shortcomings as other government schools -- poor infrastructure, undefined learning outcomes, dated teaching methods. ""But the last four or five years have seen a lot of change,"" says geography teacher Neerja Lamba, who has been with the school since 2003. ""We have a stress-free learning and teaching environment now. There are cultural activities and exchange programmes; students want to come to school,"" she says. Singh points out that the Delhi government has given the schools a free hand for improvements. ""For example, for any expenditure below ₹50,000, I don't have to write to the government. Little things like this make it so much easier.""

Over the past four years, the Delhi government has steadily increased funding for education, from 20% budgetary allocation in 2015 to 23.5% in 2017 and 26% in 2018.

The schools' improved infrastructure is testament to that. In the Dwarka branch, there's a fully air-conditioned auditorium, a conference hall open to both teachers and students, and a spanking new running track that instantly catches the eye. The labs have the latest equipment; there's a 'project development' room where students are recycling paper; and there are working water purifiers on every floor.

Robot Gangnam Style

The change is nowhere more perceptible than in the Rohini Sector 11 school, halfway across the city, where I find Class X student Prashant Kumar elbow-deep in a half-built drone. He is working after school hours in what the school calls the 'Atal Tinkering Lab'. ""I'm pretty sure I can get it to fly in a day or two; I just need to stabilise the gyro sensor,"" Kumar says confidently. His supervisor Vivek smiles behind him. ""That's going to need another month or two,"" he says. Close by, Class XII student Pratham Chopra's robot is dancing to 'Gangnam Style'. The coding took four months, says Chopra.

In the corner there is an actual 3D printer, the table around it littered with prototypes of printed whistles. The design's final version is now being used by the school's PT teachers. Science teacher Sadaf Fathima shows us a keychain printed in the shape of her name. The lab is the school's pride and joy, set up as part of the Central government's Atal Innovation Mission. Nearly 10,000 schools across the country applied for the grant, and RPVV-Rohini was among those to bag it in the first round.

Food, water, lessons

The one-year-old lab has sparked an interest in science among students, helping also to bring more girls in, say teachers. There are only three girls in the Class XII science stream this year, but the trend is beginning to slowly change in the younger classes, they say.

Social sciences teacher Shivani Singh says such facilities help immensely to address one of the biggest

problems of government schools: dropouts. In the Dwarka school, 63% of students come from families with monthly incomes below ₹5,000; their parents are rickshaw-pullers, labourers, sweepers, tailors, mechanics, domestic help, etc. When these students come into Class VI, they are undernourished, unable to take home school work, and, in some cases, have to contribute to the household income by taking up odd jobs.

But even as the dropout rate in Delhi government schools has been increasing, from 2.9% in 2014-15 to 3.4% in 2016-17 (Praja.org study), with worse results in municipal corporation schools, the RPVVs don't have any dropouts. ""Children want to do more than just study from textbooks. The 'more' is what we provide,"" says Shivani. ""They get clean water and nutritious food like dal chawal, daliya porridge, poori-sabzi. Girls get sanitary napkins,"" she says.

Walking through the school's corridors, both at Dwarka and Rohini, there is a steady stream of 'good morning' greetings around us. The students, free for the day after a gruelling exam, are not reticent and engage with their teachers comfortably. ""That took a lot of hard work,"" says Principal Singh. It was not just academics but also student-teacher relationships that needed overhauling. From improving teachers' listening and communication skills to newer teaching methods and learning objectives, ""we needed a change in pedagogy,"" says Singh.

A new pedagogy

It was this need that led him to begin the Cluster Leadership Development Programme, running now in all schools under the Directorate of Education in Delhi. ""We select 10 or so principals, area-wise, and get them to work with a facilitator-trainer. The principals, in turn, go back to their schools and work with the teachers,"" he says.

This has reduced teacher-student conflict, Singh says. ""And communication skills among students have improved; it's not great, but it's much better than what it used to be.""

The clubs and extra-curricular activities also play a big role. RPVV Rohini, for instance, has a Legal Advocacy Club where lawyers and judges address the children once a month. The Bal Bhavan Kendra is an arts and crafts initiative sponsored by the government's National Bal Bhavan in addition to regular art classes. I find a classroom filled with Madhubani paintings, wall hangings, home decor items, and more.

We walk into a room full of Class X students, and when they hear of their school's ranking, they break into ear-to-ear grins. Asked about their ambitions, they list scientists, doctors and more, but among them a handful says 'teacher'. They are as excited to teach in this school as they are to learn. The teachers accompanying us couldn't have been prouder."

The decision to convert hundreds of primary schools into English medium schools in districts like Karimnagar, Warangal and Nizamabad by teachers and its success led to the government giving the official nod to other schools across the State to follow suit.

As expected the enrolment rate in government schools has shot up. But the education experts think that despite the change in medium of instruction, it has had little effect on learning outcomes of government school students.

In 2016-17, for instance, 4,872 schools in the State were given permission to convert to English medium. Earlier back in 2008, in the united Andhra Pradesh, for the first time the then government had granted permission to run high schools with parallel mediums - 5,500 in Andhra and 2,200 Telagana area.

A social audit of learning outcomes carried out on 1,302 students from Class V to X by Campaign for Learning Outcomes, released last week confirmed this belief. It revealed that while 650 students could neither read nor write English, 271 could read only small sentences but not entire paragraphs.

Problem of parallel medium

Apart from granting the approval for change of medium of instruction, teaching community alleges, that the government did little to ensure that the move actually benefits students. In fact, the decision to run two parallel mediums is part of the problem. With the teacher-student ratio dismal in government schools, forcing one teacher to handle not just several classes but to even teach in two different languages.

""Most teachers are from Telugu medium background so for the sake for convenience they end up teaching in Telugu. Also, they find it difficult to alternate between Telugu in one period and English in the next. Students are not able to get acquainted with the language"" said T Venkateshwar Rao, President, English Language Teachers Association.

Proper training needed

The problem is further compounded by insufficient training of the lack thereof. For instance, in 2016, select primary teachers were provided five-day English language training. This was supplemented a year later by another five-day training for the same set of teachers.

""Now only a couple of teachers are trained from each school and later they too were transferred. Last academic year in Warangal, teachers from 132 primary schools have been trained but soon they got transferred to Telugu medium schools. This beats the very purpose of having English medium schools,"" said Nagati Narayana, an educationist.

Since a number of teachers themselves took the initiative to start classes in English medium and when it started showing positive results, teachers feel the government became complacent.

Teachers suggest

Start cluster schools: provide transportation from village to schools

Improved training mechanism in terms of both quality and quantity

Post training, need for evaluation

Refreshers training programmes to keep teachers up to date

The new bye-laws have also designated the state as the 'appropriate government' which would solely decide if the existing 1,300 CBSE schools in the state, as well as those in the pipeline, meet the prescribed norms in terms of infrastructure, safety, sanitation and land ownership. ""The CBSE would not re-check any aspects vetted by the state government during its inspection of schools,"" the bye-laws state.

The state government has also been given the power to bring in regulations on fees levied in CBSE schools. As per the bye-laws, fees would be charged as per the regulation of the appropriate government (state) and fee revision shall be subject to its laws, regulations and directions.

The 'Recognition' clause

Moreover, CBSE's insistence on 'recognition certificate' would be another crucial aspect which would enable the state government to make errant CBSE schools fall in line. Though CBSE schools in Kerala obtained a one-year relaxation from the board, all 1,300 plus schools will have to obtain it fairly soon from the state. ""Earlier, once the NOC was obtained, we had no business with the state government. We only needed to renew our affiliation every three years with the CBSE.

She was speaking at an event organised to sensitise government schools about people like Nikita under the Purple Board project, being implemented by the Society for Peoples' Awareness Care and Empowerment (SPACE) in collaboration with the Directorate of Education and supported by the embassy of the Netherlands.

The first phase of the project, targeted at the ones in a leadership position, will create awareness among principals and teach them about gender identities, including transgenders and homosexuals, and issues like Article 377. On Tuesday, the principals were encouraged to designate one toilet in their school as a unisex one, to frame anti-trans bullying rules and to organise multi-gender activities in their institutions.

Santosh Gupta, principal of a Seelampur school, admitted that for inclusive education, it was important to embrace the transgender community. ""I agree that education is the only way in which we can empower people from disadvantaged communities.

The project will be implemented jointly with the Social Justice Department.

As part of its first step, the state government will start 1,000 pre-primary schools in the state with adequate facilities and necessary infrastructure by coordinating with the available anganwadis in the vicinity of government schools.

The schools will give stress on educating children through activities, games without using text books or slates. However, the government could not give a timeframe as to when it start the new system owing to delay in the release of fund from the Union Government. The schools will focus on a unified child-friendly curriculum encompassing physical, social, intellectual, and emotional development of the child.

The General Education Department has also decided to provide space for anganwadis in government schools where excess accommodation was available and pre-primary school was not functioning.

SCERT Director J Prasad told Express that the new curriculum will focus on activity cards rather than using textbooks.

""In an effort to make the pre-primary education system scientific, we are introducing a new curriculum. As part of this, we have already started activity cards named 'Kalithoni'. The cards have 30 different themes and the first part is the collection of 10 themes.

""The cards aim at children's physical, creative, language, scientific and social and emotional development. Besides children, the new programme will also benefit the pre-primary school teachers"", Prasad said.

""Apart from benefiting the children, it could also help to give a good pay to the teachers. The engaging of pre-primary staff by the PTAs could not be termed as statutory appointments by the government.

(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). With effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions.

The Samagra Shiksha scheme focuses on improvement of quality of education by providing support for different interventions like; in-service training of teachers and schools heads, conduct of achievement surveys at National and State level, provision of textbooks as per Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, ICT and digital initiatives, vocational education, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment has been increased and from this year provisions for library grants and grants for sports and physical education have also been introduced.

The Government has also launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities.

e PATHSHALA: a single point repository of e ­resources containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-­print materials.

The Central Government, supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme namely 'Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat' (PBBB) in foundational years of schooling.

(iii) MHRD, has launched a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform popularly known as SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) on 9 July, 2017. The portal is offering various online courses for school education and higher education. NCERT has been developing course modules for Massive Open and Online Course (MOOCs) for school education system in 12 subject areas (Accountancy, business studies, biology, chemistry, economic, history, geography, mathematics, physics, political science, psychology and sociology) for classes IX-XII. Twelve (12) courses and twenty one (21) courses have been completed in the first cycle and second cycle (completed on 30 Nov. 2018) on SWAYAM platform (https://swayam.gov.in/) respectively. Nearly 22,000 students and 30,000 students were registered in the first cycle and second cycle respectively.

State governments have increased their budgets for school education in the past three years, but the allotment of funds has not been enough to attract permanent qualified teaching staff to government schools, finds a recent study conducted across six States.

The report, prepared jointly by Child Rights and You (CRY) and the Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability (CBGA), examines budgeting for school education in six States -- West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra -- during the 14th Finance Commission recommendation period, which started in April 2015.

The study finds that there has been an overall increase in revenue with the States following the 14th Finance Commission recommendations. This was a result of an increase in the share of the States in the divisible pool of Central taxes from 32% to 42%. At the same time, a reduction in the Union government's contribution to the States for Central schemes in social sectors forced the States to improve their tax revenue collection. The study analyses whether the availability of additional funds translated into prioritising of school education in these six States.

Between 2015-16 and 2017-18, there was a net decline in the share of school education budget in the total State Budget for three of the six States, according to the detailed demand for Grants and State Budget documents. Bihar saw a dip of 3.1%, Maharashtra a drop of 1% and West Bengal 0.9%. On the other hand, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh saw an increase in the size of school education budget by 0.4%, 2.6% and 3.2%, respectively.

The report examines whether the increase in the size of school education budget was more than the rise in size of the total budget, indicating a higher priority for the sector. It concluded that between 2014-15 and 2017-18, Uttar Pradesh saw a 98.8% increase in budget for schools, whereas its total budget increased by 63.3%. West Bengal's budget for school education increased by 49.4% while its total budget increased by 48.2% and in Tamil Nadu, the former increased by 38.7% but the total budget increased by 38.5%, indicating that school education was a priority for these three States.

At the same time, all the six States showed an increase in the magnitude of per-child and per-student spending for education between 2014-15 and 2016-17.

Despite a varying level of commitment towards school education across the six States, all of them struggle with a shortage of teachers. The report cites data from the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development to show that as on March 2017, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have from 19% to 34% of total teacher positions at the elementary level vacant. Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu were relatively better with 5.9% and 2.6% posts unfilled.

Data from the District Information System for Education show that at the upper primary level, there is a severe paucity of subject-specific teachers required under the Right to Education Act -- 77% upper primary schools in Maharashtra, 46% in Uttar Pradesh, 40% in West Bengal and 37% in Bihar do not have subject teachers.

More than one lakh schools in India are run with only one teacher and all the six States surveyed have shown the number of such schools on the rise. The shortage of teachers is more acute at the secondary level -- Bihar has 20,494 teaching posts vacant, Chhattisgarh 8,278 and Uttar Pradesh 12,008.

The figures don't entirely capture the severity of the shortfall as they do not reflect the shortage of subject teachers."

Some school authorities have also launched a social media campaign, named Utsav Vidyarambha, an annual enrolment drive conducted every year with the help of local community and students, to enhance enrolment in schools.

""From this year, the publicity campaign for Utsav Vidyarambha has been launched on a massive scale. The prime thrust is to change the prevailing notion of most guardians that the quality of education in the state-government schools are not at par with private schools. Let's spread the message that trained and qualified teachers are imparting education in government-run schools and the admissions as well as other facilities are totally free for the newly enrolled kids at the primary level,"" a senior official of the education department told TOI on Friday.

Checking the decrease in enrolment, something which was detected as a major worry in Gunotsav, is the primary agenda behind launching such a publicity campaign, he added.

As per the new guidelines, schools with enrolment of 60 or below will not get any financial support, schools having enrolment of 61 to 400 will get financial support of Rs 20,000, schools having enrolment of 401 to 600 will get financial support of Rs 25,000 and schools having enrolment of more than 600 will get financial support of Rs 35,000."

Yet the evidence is mounting that UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath cares more about the welfare of cows than people inhabiting his state. Consider his latest order that in case of encroachers on grazing land, the encroachments be removed immediately and strict action initiated against the accused. As Adityanath continued to drive his administration hard on ill-conceived cow schemes, irate farmers in Aligarh locked up stray cows inside classrooms while schoolchildren and teachers were left in the lurch.

In truth, the scale of the problem unleashed by Hindutva-inspired curbs on cattle trade is unmanageable. A 2012 livestock census found 3.9 crore cows in UP. Six years later, imagine many of these cows past their productive age roaming the countryside and cities in search of food. No government is in a position to earmark shelters or grazing lands for such a huge population. Adityanath's desperate search for cow welfare solutions is bound to fail and he must instead focus on the rising farm anger against stray cows now directed at government property like schools and hospitals. Even those encroaching grazing land deserve a better reason than stray cows to be asked to go.

Farmers have paid dearly for this proliferation of stray cows. Unable to sell unproductive cows and now struggling to fend off stray cows from fields, it has been a double whammy for them. Reviving the cattle trade will solve these problems. In light of growing agrarian distress BJP should not lose sight of the fact that it is humans, not cows, who will be voting at the hustings."

(HT File)

After four rounds of admissions, less than a quarter of the 1,400 reserved seats on offer in the city's private schools for differently abled students were filled this year. This has prompted the government to carry forward the vacant seats to the next academic year.

Hindustan Times had reported last week that the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) had invited fresh online applications for 1,268 entry-level reserved seats for a fourth round of admissions to the current academic year which has just three months left.

On Wednesday, the draw of lots were held for these seats but only 123 were filled. The DoE cited ""lack of applications"" for the large number of seats going vacant.

""Of the 125 applications we received during the fresh round of admission, 123 candidates were absorbed. The selected candidates have to approach the allotted school on or before December 31,"" DoE director Sanjay Goel said.

According to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (PWD) Act, 2016, three per cent of the total number of seats meant for the economically weaker section and disadvantaged groups (EWS/DG) category are reserved for children with disabilities.

Goel said that the department will carry forward the remaining reserved seats to next academic session (2019-20). ""The seats will be counted in the category during next year's admission,"" he said. The notification of admission in the entry level classes under the 25% reserved seats for the EWS/DG category is likely to be announced in the first week of January, next year.

Officials in the DoE said that they are planning to organise awareness campaigns among parents to motivate them to apply.

""There is lack of awareness among parents about the reserved seats because this was the first time the quota was introduced within the 25% EWS/DG seats. We are planning to organise campaigns to aware parents from the coming admission session,"" an official said.

Experts, however, said that the ""lack of inclusiveness"" in schools make parents reluctant from applying. ""Though the situation in private schools is better than the government schools, parents of children with disabilities are still reluctant from applying there. They think their kids will only be able to adjust in special schools. More efforts need to be put in to make campuses more inclusive by appointing trained special educators and providing better infrastructure facilities,"" said Dr Satender Singh, disability rights activist."

While rebuilding by the government agencies in different parts of the state is only in the initial stages, the UP and LP schools which remained half submerged in the flood waters for over five days suffering huge damage to their facilities, have come back to life. In the forefront of the effort to revive them was the Deepalaya Trust in Delhi which lost no time in identifying the devastated schools and offering its help.

In a commendable operation coordinated by A J Philip, Deepalaya executive officer and eminent journalist; Dr George Mathew, Chairman, Institute of Social Sciences, New Delhi; and A J Abraham, social activist in Ernakulam, the rebuilding of the school started in right earnest in September itself and the work was completed within two months.

The so-called government red-tapes and delays were overcome with the strong support provided by the school authorities, including the AEO Latha, school headmaster V K Santhosh, panchayat president T G Anoop, Cartoonist Academy and the local people.

The Trust spent Rs 33 lakh in replacing the damaged computers, reconstructing the collapsed compound walls, removing the slush and debris from the compound and classrooms, laying tiles on the floors, painting the walls and re-equipping the library. Soon, other NGOs joined hands, including 'Human Values' and 'Rapid Response' of Pondicherry, which replaced the old furniture, desks and benches with modern ones.

Now the schools sport a completely new look and none who visits the place will realise that these were the ones the floods had ravaged only a few months ago. To celebrate its rejuvenation, the school organised a function on Saturday, which was attended by Sethu, writer and former chairman of South Indian Bank, Dr George Mathew, Cartoon Academy members, panchayat president, ward members, school children, parents, teachers and local people."

These schools would be merged with upgraded high schools in phases, starting with the institutions, which have less than 50 students, education department officials said on Thursday.

Initially, 3,732 middle schools having less than 50 students would be undertaken for merger. The process of merging has already been started.

""Merger is an effort to provide quality education to students in a better educational ambience. Jharkhand has around 411 such middle schools where number of students is less than 10. If these schools are merged with high schools, students would get better education,"" said state education secretary AP Singh.

""As per the rules in the right to education (RTE), there should be at least three trained graduate teacher (TGT) in middle schools where number of students is less than 100.

The decision comes at a time when the opposition parties and critics have been criticising the state government for merging the primary schools. Several ruling party elected representatives have also been lobbying with the government against the move. There have been protests in several parts of the state as well, against merger of schools.

The officials, however, argue that, ideally, there should be one middle school and five to seven primary schools in a panchayat. As many as 6,466 middle schools have been identified in Jharkhand, which could be merged with high schools within a 5-km radius in a panchayat, Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) officials said.

The state government has decided to offer bicycles to the students, who would be shifted to other schools so that they do not face any trouble in commuting to the school.

Meanwhile, the JEPC officials said they have completed the merging exercise of 4,600 primary schools.

JEPC director Uma Shankar Singh said there were 39,600 schools in 2016-17 under education department in Jharkhand. ""Of them, 18,000 schools had 60 or few students. These schools had an average of 1 or two teachers per school. Providing quality education was a major challenge. One teacher was handling four to five classes at a time. How could one expect a better education in these schools,"" he said.

The council said four-step process including field inspection, cross-district verification, block and district consultation and final notification to merge the schools.

Singh said 98% students from the 4,600 primary schools have been shifted and 96% students have expressed satisfaction with the consolidation. ""We faced difficulty to shift 150 students due to some technical reasons. Now, the issue is resolved and 120 students were shifted,"" he said.

The reorganisation of primary schools benefited seven lakh students with better teachers' availability and reduced the requirements of teachers by 4,500. Besides, the process saved government's Rs 400 crore through reduced teachers and infrastructure requirements, JEPC officials said.

""This building is small, old, and built on low land, because of which, at times, water accumulates at the entrance,"" he added.

Government Primary School, Satlaka

The 46 students of GPS Satlaka have to brace a school building falling apart at its seams. There are five classrooms, but all classes take place in only one, as the condition of the rest is terrible. ""One can spot cow dung on the floors, broken benches, blackboards and doors. Across the building, the seepage is so heavy that during monsoons this year, the roof of one classroom collapsed,"" said Virender Singh, guest teacher.

TOI also spotted dogs roaming in the classrooms. ""This entire building is unsafe and unfit for tiny tots. Since there is no guard, cows wander in and take shelter inside at night. I'm not paid to clean up the dung,"" said Rahisa, the school's sole sanitation staff. Since the building was constructed in 1972, no teacher has spent more than a year in this school.

Shivji Park Primary School

Shivji Park Primary School doesn't even have its own building. It operates out of Government Senior Secondary School Kadipur, whose classrooms are in a shambles. ""Students are forced to sit in the school hallway or even in the open, as none of the eight classrooms we've been allotted are usable,"" said head teacher Satpal. Even teachers of the Kadipur school are unaware when the crumbling walls were last repaired.

Govt Primary School, Kadipur

One look at the building of GPS Kadipur is enough to tll you that a disaster is waiting to happen. ""There are 180 students in this school. Every now and then, chunks of plaster fall off, making it dangerous for them. The old building has been declared a threat, and a new building is being constructed. Unfortunately, construction work stopped six months ago,"" said a teacher, requesting anonymity.

Govt Primary Feroze Gandhi School Shivaji Park

The 70 tiny tots who study in GPFGS Shivaji Park, have to cross mounds of garbage and pools of stagnant water to enter the premises every day. ""Every day, locals throw trash in front of the school. We've spoken with the authorities, but this doesn't stop,"" said a teacher, requesting anonymity."

LIFE IN COLOUR: Students are encouraged to be well turned out here

For 11 years, Sanjeev Kumar, a teacher at Government Primary School, Ghulal village near Samrala in district Ludhiana, worked to construct a new school building with the help of philanthropists from the village.

In July, a team of NHAI officials told him to vacate the school in two months.

""The NHAI planned to build a toll plaza here. They needed to widen the road for this and the school building was in the way. Over the past decade, we spent around Rs 26 lakh to construct the new building. When I told village residents, they were shattered,"" says Sanjeev Kumar.

Kumar first approached the district education officer and sent a message to secretary, education Krishan Kumar.

""He called me immediately. I went with a few village residents who have been helping us. As we sat there, he sent a letter to the Ludhiana deputy commissioner, asking him to do everything possible to save the school,"" Sanjeev recalls.

Ludhiana DC Pardeep Aggarwal sent SDM, Samrala and other officials to the school. The SDM called NHAI officials to the school. I heard the SDM telling NHAI officials that the school had to be saved at any cost and NHAI officials were asked to shift the toll plaza,"" he says.

Sanjeev pursued the issue till NHAI issued a fresh notification in October saying that the toll plaza would be shifted.

It is an incident secretary, education Krishan Kumar will not forget anytime soon. ""I could see his desperation and determination to save the school. Village residents were also committed to the cause. Such teachers deserve complete support. The Ludhiana deputy commissioner also took great interest in the endeavour and we are all happy with the result,"" he says.

Education dept steps in

It is remarkable that despite their tough circumstances, government school teachers are trying to bring about a qualitative change in their institutions.

""I learnt that a few teachers in the state improved their schools on their own, because of which more students got enrolled. In February, we called a meeting of such teachers. As they spoke about their experiences, we thought the idea was worth replicating across the state and called on principals and teachers to volunteer,"" says Krishan Kumar.

The officer pursued reforms in the education department during his previous stint as director general, school education for almost three years.

""By July, we had 425 schools with buildings turned into learning aids, improved infrastructure, amenities and sports facilities. The idea was to improve students' learning experience. We fixed the ambitious target of ""Mission 4,250"" by the beginning of the next academic session and asked these 425 teachers to motivate their friends and relatives in 10 other schools. Already, 1,700 schools have accomplished the task,"" he says.

According to the secretary, education, these teachers and communities are the biggest stakeholders in improving educational standards.

""Social accountability is much more result-oriented than departmental accountability,"" he said.

Incentives offered to teachers include transfer of choice, promotion and good ACR. ""All these benefits are non-monetary and the huge improvement in schools is without any extra burden on the state exchequer,"" Kumar adds.

The school had just 17 students when Narinder Arora and his wife Manjit Kaur, both ETT teachers, joined in 2006. Now, there are 224 students. In an act that inspired trust, the couple got their daughter enrolled in the same school.

""There was nothing going for the small school but we decided to do everything possible to set things right. Apart from enrolling my daughter here, we motivated a few friends and fellow teachers to enroll their children as well. We assured them that their children's education or overall development would not suffer. Rather, we said they would see a marked improvement. My son is a UKG student here,"" said Narinder.

The teachers' dedication showed in exam results and students' performance in co-curricular activities.

""Soon, educated families also started sending their children to the school. We also had our own uniform,"" says Narinder Arora.

Now, we have enough space,"" he says, adding that they need the education department to provide more teachers as the strength of students is increasing.

""NRIs and other villagers have helped to improve the school. Now, the entire village is involved. People from other villages also come to get their children enrolled here.

""Apart from improving the amenities, I have been focusing on the core issue - improving learning outcomes among students,"" he adds. The school has a sprawling park and playground. Students have mid-day meals on tables with granite tops.

Rurka Kalan (Jalandhar)

The village has two government primary schools - one for girls and one for boys. In ambience and facilities, these schools could give private schools a run for their money.

Walls of both government primary schools have been turned into learning aids for children. They also have libraries and reading rooms. The girls' school also has an LCD screen to screen educational programmes.

""When I joined on July 1, 2006, the school building was in bad shape, with doors and windows missing. There were around 80 students but not a single bench. The first thing to do was to get desks for students before winter. The Youth Football Club of Rurka Kalan, which is working to promote football in the area, helped us procure desks at a cost of Rs 50,000,"" says school teacher Sanjiv Kumar, the man behind the transformation.

This was just the beginning. Over the years, infrastructure, education and sports in the school were upgraded.

""Philanthropists spent Rs 19 lakh on the school. With the way things have come up, more donors are volunteering,"" he says.

At Government Primary School for Girls, Buta Ram, who was promoted as centre head teacher and shifted to the boys' school a few days back, brought about the transformation.

""My daughter studies in this school. After I joined here in 2013, we managed to mobilize resources and undertake works worth around Rs 22 lakh,"" he says.

The school has its own logo and calendar. Numbers and letters are painted on the walls and a park based on the theme of mathematics is being constructed. Sanjiv and I are competing with each other to improve our schools,"" smiles Buta Ram.

Both schools have well-furnished and neat kitchens to cook mid-day meals.

The boys' school is in stark contrast with the street. The backyard of the adjoining senior secondary school is also overrun with weeds like a dark reminder of how things used to be and what could happen if these efforts are not sustained.

SETTING AN EXAMPLE

Secretary education, Krishan Kumar gets pictures from the pathbreaking schools. Every day, he picks the picture of one school and forwards it on WhatsApp groups of the education department. This motivates the others and generates healthy competition. The schools are promoting extra-curricular activities and helping students speak English

TAKING THE LEAD

As school infrastructure is improved, teachers feel more motivated. They share ideas and help each other even while competing. Sometimes, we spend from our own pockets as bonding with schools and children has improved,"" says Ashok Basra, principal, Government Senior Secondary School, Jamsher Khaas near Jalandhar.

He has now been asked to guide other schools in the district"

They aren't sure if the authorities would do all that is needed to enhance the quality of government schools and bring them on a par with private ones.

Notably, Section 3 of the Act, which is considered the core of the legislation, provides children the fundamental right to free and compulsory education in a neighbourhood school.

According to the proposal, if there's a government school in neighbourhood of a child -- within 1km for primary education and 3km for higher primary -- he/she should get admitted to that instead of a private school.

Nagasimha G Rao, state convener of the RTE task force, said, ""The government is citing the example of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where government schools are in high demand. We're in touch with RTE activists there too. But the Karnataka scenario is different. Parents prefer English medium schools over government institutions.""

Mohammed Yousuf, a Marappa Garden resident and parent of a child who's an RTE beneficiary, said, ""I don't think government schools are up to the mark. They don't have good English teachers and lack infrastructure. Moreover, the nearest government school in our area is located on defence land, can be accessed by every passerby and has a dumpsite too. My son will not be safe.""

Education department officials admit that no new government school has been opened in the state in the past three years.

Citing a 2017 study by the RTE Forum, a national organization, which states that 90% of RTE students paid fees to private schools,Y Mariswamy, chairperson (in charge), Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights said, ""We get a lot of complaints from parents. It is sad that students are still made to pay fees at private schools despite being admitted under RTE. As we are the monitoring body for RTE and as well as child protection laws, I feel this move will give a boost to government schools and put in place systems required in these institutions.""

Niranjan Aradhya, senior fellow and programme head, Universalisation of Equitable Quality Education Programme, Centre for Child and the Law, NLSIU, said: ""This is a chance for government schools to improve. The government just needs to do a few basic things like recruit more English teachers and upgrade schools to the level of Kendriya Vidyalayas. To make RTE effective, they need to implement section 12(2) of the RTE Act which mandates private unaided schools receiving government largesse to reserve seats for weaker sections from their neighbourhood without the state having the obligation to reimburse them. Delhi has been following this since 2004."""

But this doesn't translate into government owning and running schools.

No matter which way one looks at it, there is no widespread market failure in school education. There is the matter of supporting poor children, but as far as the supply of high-quality supply is concerned, there is overwhelming evidence that the market is competent to do so without any government involvement.

On the other hand, there is overwhelming evidence of the failure of government education. As the Secretary to the government of Assam for Education in the early 1990s, I quickly became aware of how the Minister of Education (in a Congress government in my time) used the appointment and transfers of teachers as the key mechanism to extract bribes. The director of education of Assam was the conduit for this. The entire system was totally broken: many schools only existed on paper and ""teachers"" drew salaries when there was nothing on the ground.

The seriously misguided policy idea that the government must directly own and run schools came about as a result of a grievous error of analysis made by Lord Macaulay nearly two hundred years ago. This misconception continues till today among the ""educated"" who are not aware of the ground reality. The socialist Aam Aadmi Party's misplaced passion for government schools is one such example, and discuss my meeting on this issue with a senior AAP leader some other time.

The ""educated"" typically have a belief that parents won't send their children to school unless they are compelled by the state to do so. It is believed that given a chance, poor parents prefer to deploy their children as child labour. But the reality is that - as James Tooley's research has confirmed this fact that was well-known to many of us - all over India hundreds of millions of poor parents are sending their children to for-profit low-cost private schools. Roughly a third of India's poor children attend such schools.

Further, that some parents may indeed deploy their children as labour (extremely rare today) is actually the inevitable consequence of socialist policies that make parents view education dimly - as not being worthwhile since it won't improve their children's job prospects. There is a strong factual basis for this perception since millions of low quality ""graduates"", who are totally unsuited for the job market, are found unemployed today across India in second-tier towns and in the villages. Let's us, therefore, agree that there is no one more keenly interested in the welfare of their children than the parents. We must harness this powerful force instead of rejecting it.

Second, there is a mistaken belief that a school must have significant infrastructure and paraphernalia, or that its teachers must necessarily be ""highly qualified"". But as Gandhi said in a speech at Chatham House in 1931: ""the schools established after the European pattern were too expensive for the people"" and ""The village schools were not good enough for the British administrator, so he came out with his programme. Every school must have so much paraphernalia, building, and so forth"".

Gandhi, therefore, said: ""I defy anybody to fulfil a programme of compulsory primary education of these masses inside of a century. This very poor country of mine is ill able to sustain such an expensive method of education. Our State would revive the old village schoolmaster and dot every village with a school both for boys and girls"". What a brilliant thought! - except that there must not be any direct role for the state even in such schools.

James Tooley's book, The Beautiful Tree, shows that children who attend low cost for-profit private schools (including in India) achieve much higher educational outcomes than children from comparable government schools, despite such private schools having virtually no infrastructure and the teachers of such schools not even being ""adequately"" qualified. The reason these schools succeed while government schools fail is that teachers in the private schools are held to account for outcomes by the Principal, who is often the school owner. These for-profit undertakings depend critically on demonstrating real results in order to continue to get the custom of the poor parents who pay a small fee on a monthly basis and will quickly switch their child to a competing school if they don't' see significant progress each month.

Tooley's research enables us to totally dispense with the myth that government schools are required to educate children. This research has also confirmed Gandhi's assertion that excellent village schools operated in India prior to British rule. These schools functioned from the houses of the teachers, did not need a vast paraphernalia of infrastructure, and all sections of the community were able to send their children to these schools to avail high quality, low-cost education. In Shanti Niketan, Rabindranath Tagore was basically attempting to replicate this form of education, with a focus on learning and not on facilities or infrastructure.

Unfortunately, Macaulay's misplaced paternalism injected government into schools in India and was also copied by the UK, which had an entirely private (or local) school education system prior to that. In both cases, the effect was harmful, as the number of students and quality of education plummeted. Till today, an average government school across the world performs much worse than an average private school, barring a few exceptions.

We noted at the outset that the government must support the poor to access education - to ensure equality of opportunity. There is a simple and direct way to achieve this without owning and running schools, by providing vouchers of certain nominal value (depending on the income level of parents) for each poor child up to year 12 that can only be exchanged for school education (including for vocational education). This is our party's policy. These vouchers would enable the children of poor parents to attend a good for-profit private school.

The idea of vouchers has a long history and has also been tried out in a number of ways across the world, although not in the full-blown manner that's our party's policy. Milton Friedman is probably best known for his advocacy of this system but his ideas did not go far enough. He was willing to allow competition between private and government schools but our party does not see any role whatsoever for even a single government school. Our party is committed to the total privatisation of all government schools - in a well-structured manner.

The alignment of incentives when parents choose (and themselves fund, even if to a small extent) for-profit private schools is the best way to quickly and significantly improve India's dismal quality of school education.

Our party would, of course, remove most regulations in this area, such as requirements for infrastructure, playgrounds or even for the qualification of teachers. The market will determine who is best placed to teach. All we would require is that each school pick an affiliating board (such as CBSE, but that would need to be disbanded and private boards would emerge) and demonstrate high quality student outcomes in order to be eligible for the school vouchers. This would be an outcomes-based regulatory system, with detailed management (including things like the medium of instruction) left to schools and parents: the parties with the deepest direct interest in outcomes.

We therefore disagree with things like the Right to Education Act which we see as a socialist anachronism. India needs to fully liberate the education sector to allow the best private sector initiatives to emerge, unfettered by the misguided notions of any delusional (and mostly corrupt) bureaucrat or minister.

The government has sufficient core work to perform, in which it has repeatedly failed. When Indian governments can't deliver security and justice, how can they possibly deliver education? Today India is led by a government which can't distinguish between mythology and cosmetic surgery, between homeopathy and medicine. So what makes us think it can teach our children?"

The Government of Maharashtra is mulling to make Marathi a compulsory subject in schools for students studying classes one to ten, India Today has reported.

On Tuesday (20 November), Minister for Education Vinod Tawde said that the proposal is being considered by the government.

The minister gave the above reply while addressing a question raised by Shiv Sena MLA Vilas Potnis, claimed the report. He had highlighted that states like Bengal, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Kerala has made it compulsory for the students between Class I and X to learn the local language.

However, the minister later told reporters that the proposal is 'difficult' to implement.

It was reported in 2016 that an earlier proposal of teaching everyone Marathi till class 7 was opposed by certain education institutions in the state. They contended that such a move should not be made mandatory for students coming from other states or outside India. One school also complained that it had found it tough to hire a Marathi teacher.

The survey found that 88% students were allegedly beaten up, as a matter of routine, multiple times a week in some government schools, while in other government schools, around 30% experienced corporal punishment multiple times. All 50 students from low-cost public schools, who were part of the survey, reported that they were beaten up.

On an average, almost half of the children interviewed were allegedly beaten by teachers multiple times a week. The report, Choking Childhood, is based on the findings of research undertaken by social organisation Agrasar, which works with disadvantaged communities.

A total of 521 children and 100 parents sampled randomly were surveyed, and an informal group interview with 12 teachers from two different government schools was undertaken.

There are around 130 primary government schools in Gurugram, from which the students were randomly selected. There are around 18,000 students in the primary schools, as per estimates.

The Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, prohibits 'physical punishment' & 'mental harassment' under Section 17(1) and makes it a punishable offence under Section 17(2).

""The report studies the impact of corporal punishment on the psyche of children who are doubly disadvantaged by virtue of them being children who are predominantly from poor migrant communities and first-generation learners,"" said Prerit Rana, co-founder and CEO of Agrasar. He added that corporal punishment in schools was not only a violation of human rights, but also impaired the health and education of the children.

According to the report, 70% of the children reported that they were beaten at home after parents learnt that they were beaten in school. More than 70% of the parents said that they beat their children, as they believe punishment is for their child's well being.

The report also outlined the challenging working conditions and lack of professional conduct among teachers in government schools fostered an environment that puts deprived children at risk of experiencing corporal punishment.

Responding to the findings of the report, Premlata Yadav, the district elementary education officer said, ""I will have to see the report to know how the survey was conducted. I do not agree with the findings of the report. One can expect 1-2% of such cases but it is incorrect to say that 80% of the children are beaten.""

Yadav added that teachers are not allowed to punish students and strict action is taken if such a complaint is raised. ""If we receive information of this nature, we warn the teachers and sometimes, it can also lead to their suspension. We take strict action on reports of corporal punishment,"" she said.

A Sanskrit teacher at a government school said that corporal punishment is rarely doled out. ""Teachers rarely beat students. However, sometimes children do not understand and teachers are compelled to take matters into their hands. I do not raise my hands at my students. I either ask them to do rounds of the ground with their hands raised up or call their parents,"" she said."

Subject-wise performance evaluation of students from government and private schools from the state, revealed the performance of government school students to be poorer than private schools in all districts, apart from Hyderabad where the performance was on par.

Looking at the data, it should not be a surprise that parents prefer shelling out more money in sending their children to private schools for education than government for better education. As per available data, more than half of the about 48 lakh students studying in various schools in Telangana, are studying in private schools.

For example, while the performance of students from government schools in Nalgonda was 31 per cent and 33 per cent in Mathematics and Science, it was 39 per cent and 40 percent respectively by private school students. Similarly, while the performance of government school students in Karimnagar in Social Science and English subjects was 38 per cent and 34 per cent respectively, it was 46 per cent and 56 per cent in private schools.

Only in Hyderabad, the difference between performance of government and private school students was not significant.

Urban-rural divide also deep

Significant difference in performance of students in various subjects has also been observed with respect to whether a student belongs to rural or urban area, indicating the disparity in quality of education received by students depending on where they belong from.

In the NAS it has been observed that in all districts of the state the performance of students in urban areas is higher than those from rural areas. For example, in Rangareddy district while the performance of students in Mathematics and Science in rural areas was found to be 33 per cent and 35 per cent respectively, in the urban areas it was 41 per cent in each subject. Similar is the case in all other districts.

Caste affects spoken English

The NAS also highlights the need for ensuring that education reaches every student equitably, regardless of the caste of the student. Significant difference has been found in the performance of students from the general category and those from the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes.

A difference of almost 5-10 per cent was observed in the performances of students from general categories as compared to those from reserved categories. The difference was prominent in all the subjects that students study at the high school level.

However, the difference is most pronounced, as much as 15 per cent, in case of English language. For example, while the students belonging to the general category had an average performance percentage in Mathematics of 41 per cent while English had 50 per cent. On the other hand, among the students from Scheduled Castes it was 31 per cent and 35 per cent respectively."

At a time when Government talks about ""Digital Literacy "" how is it possible that people especially students don't have access to electricity? Despite the obvious connection between electricity and educational achievement, however, the troubling scenes in Jammu and Kashmir are repeated as there are thousands of Government run schools without electricity. Present and past Governments in J&K, have been focusing on administrative affairs of education department or even pedagogy, but very little focus has been given to electricity in Government schools. The absence of focus on this issue is detrimental because, a study has put it like this, ""education is also widely recognized as one of the most essential components for poverty reduction"". Lack of electricity at primary, middle and secondary schools therefore creates considerable obstacles towards escaping poverty and correlates with many factors that contribute directly towards it. It is a big impediment towards digital literacy as well because when there is no electricity in a Government school, the children will have no access to computers and other digital equipment. The report on link between education and poverty assesses the direct link between electricity and education.

Based on the most recently available survey data from the World Bank and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the report first describes the current state of electrification of schools. According to the this data, roughly four out of every five primary and secondary schools in African countries (Govt and Private schools) surveyed lacked access to electricity, along with almost three quarters of village schools in India. This is much worst in Jammu & Kashmir state as more than 70 percent Government schools are un-electrified in this 21st century. When it comes to Kashmir division, more than 80 percent of Government schools are un electrified and these details I have been provided officially by several Chief Education Officer (CEOs) when I sought details under Right to Information Act (RTI). In Jammu province also the majority of Government schools in Rajouri , Poonch , Doda , Ramban , Reasi , Kishtwar and Doda are still un electrified.

Based on a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and policy literature concerning electricity and education, the report mentioned above assesses the educational benefits of electrification of primary and secondary schools, including lighting and access to information and communications technologies (ICT) as well improvement in staff retention and student completion and graduation rates. The final two main parts of the report, drawn from energy policy, development studies, and innovations in financing and public private partnerships literature, discuss the challenges facing school electrification, such as lack of financing and technical problems with equipment, along with the solutions and incentives with the potential to overcome them, such as Public Private Partnerships (PPPs).

Rajouri , Srinagar

At a time when Government of India is celebrating achievement of 100 percent electrification feat across country, information available reveals some astonishing facts. As per the Government figures, there are 1720 Govt schools in Rajouri district and out of them 1484 (over 86 percent) don't have access to electricity. Out of 1720 Government schools in Rajouri district , there are 995 primary, 557 middle, 117 high and 41 higher secondary schools. In addition to these there are 6 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalyas (KGBV) across the district.

In Srinagar district, more than 300 Government schools have not been provided electricity connection by Government till date. More than two years have passed since Government had ordered to get all the schools electrified. In Srinagar there are around 519 Govt run schools out of which there are 204 primary schools, 211 middle schools, 74 high schools and 30 higher secondary schools. Out of the 519 Govt schools, there are around 305 schools which are still un electrified.

Budgam, Ganderbal

In Budgam district there are more than 81 percent Government run schools which are un-electrified. This is an official information that was provided to me by Chief Education Officer (CEO) of Budgam under RTI Act. CEO Budgam informed me in his reply that there are around 1,036 schools in the district out of total 1278 that are ""without proper electricity connection"". Actually I had sought the details of all the un electrified Govt schools in Kashmir valley under RTI Act. I filed application before the designated Public Information Officer (PIO) in the Directorate of School Education Kashmir (DSEK). Instead of providing the information , PIO passed the buck to all the Chief Education Officers (CEOs) of Kashmir valley plus Leh and Kargil . That is why I got the details from each district. I also sought information about the number of girls' schools without a toilet facility and the number of schools without a proper electricity connection, boundary wall and drinking water facility. CEO Budgam in his reply said that ""all"" the girls' schools had a washroom facility, ""there are dysfunctional toilets "".

In Ganderbal district out of 587 government schools, 434 schools are un electrified which means around 83 percent Government schools have no access to electricity. These details were revealed by Chief Education Officer (CEO) Ganderbal in a reply to my Right to Information (RTI) application.

Conclusion

Why is Government compromising on providing the basic infrastructure to Government schools while as no such compromise is done when it comes to perks and salaries of Government employees especially Govt school teachers ? Infrastructure and level of education is coming down in Govt schools , but this is not the case with Government's own employees ? Their salaries continue to be hiked. Govt spends more than Rs 1.40 lakhs every month on an average Government school in J&K. Do poor kids enrolled in these schools get the desired facilities ? On contrary to this, not even Rs 50,000 is spent on an average private school in J&K by local school management, but the results are quite different. Board of School Education (BOSE) collected an amount of Rs 16.81 crores from students in shape of exam fees in Kashmir valley recently, but the class Xth & XIIth students were forced to write exams under candle light as there is no facility of gen-sets in the exam centers. Not even heaters are made available in Govt schools (exam centers) by BOSE and children are made to shiver in the cold. I have been forced to seek intervention of J&K State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) where I filed a petition recently.

I hope to get some good direction soon from SHRC. Imagine kind of trauma poor kids are facing in classrooms during June , July and August when temperature rises above 30 degree in valley and more than 40 in Jammu plains or in Rajouri , Ramban or Poonch districts ? After missing the initial deadline of May 2017, the Narendra Modi government on April 29th this year announced ""electrification"" of all inhabited villages in India has been completed.After having all the data available vis a vis un electrified schools in J&K , it clearly indicates that announcement by Government was largely symbolic. In a state where 75 to 80 percent Government schools are still un electrified how can Government claim to have achieved 100 percent electrification target ? How can Government claim to achieve digital literacy target in future if Govt schools are not electrified?

""My children go to a private school Madam, it is close to home, they learn English and mathematics"", says Selvi with a big smile on her face. Selvi, a Marathahalli-based domestic worker, like many others from low income households in Bangalore, finds private schools a better choice for her child.

Research has often pointed out that there is not much difference in the learning outcomes of children in government schools and in private schools. Yet in Bengaluru, like many urban centres in the country, children across income groups are flocking to private schools. While the number of private schools are rapidly rising, government schools are increasingly being merged/shut down in the name of low student enrolment. The narrative around government schools remains one of poor accountability and infrastructure, poorly trained or absent teachers, poor attendance and pass rates of students.

In 2016-17, Bangalore Urban had 1403 government schools, and almost thrice as many - 3426 - private schools. Student enrolments illustrate the trend better. That year, only 1.8 lakh children were enrolled in government schools, compared to nearly 11 lakh children in private schools.

The most commonly cited concern about government schools is the lack of sufficient, well-qualified teachers.

Dr V P Niranjan Aradhya, Programme Head (Right To Education) at the Centre for Child and Law, NLSIU, points out that there were over 28,000 vacancies for government elementary school teachers in Karnataka as of 2016-17. ""The number of sanctioned posts was 1.94 lakh, but only 1.66 lakh teachers were working then. The department has been talking about plans to recruit teachers, but currently poorly-paid guest teachers are being appointed in many vacancies,"" he says.

Given the low rate of enrolment in government schools in the city, there are schools with only 10-15 students spread across grade 1-5, or schools that have only 30 students overall from class 1-7. Such schools often have only one or two teachers. These teachers have to teach every subject to students across all grades, even if they are not qualified for it, says Aradhya. Teachers are also burdened with additional duties and administrative tasks. There are even schools in the city that lack a Headmaster, requiring one among the skeletal teaching staff to do the additional administrative tasks of the HM.

Anurag Behar, Vice Chancellor at Azim Premji University, says the low quality of schools comes down to the poor quality of teacher education. Behar was part of the implementation committee for the Justice J S Verma Commission report on teacher education. The Justice Verma Commission, set up by the Supreme Court, had pointed out in its 2012 report that the majority of Teacher Education Institutions (TEI) in the country were highly commercial private establishments.

Behar says: ""In the 1960s, India had only about 1300 TEIs. In the early 1990s, it was about 1500. Then, between 1993 and 2011, this number rose to about 16,000. In this period, the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) gave licenses to many private institutions that were fraudulent and corrupt; many of these institutions don't even hold classes."" He says that out of nearly 18,000 TEIs in the country now, about 92% are private.

Other issues pointed out by the Verma Commission Report include: teacher education curriculum remaining unchanged for over 65 years, TEIs being standalone institutions rather than being part of universities, the generalist nature of M.Ed programmes etc. The Commission had in fact reviewed 291 TEIs in Maharashtra, and recommended that 85% of these should be shut down.

Though much of the Commission's recommendations have been ignored, there have been a few initiatives such as the centre's budget announcement this year to introduce an integrated B.Ed course. ""But what about the existing 16,000-odd TEIs that are of low quality? Nothing much has been done about those,"" says Behar.

While shortage of qualified teachers is a major concern, both Aradhya and Behar say that teachers are not respected or incentivised enough in the education system. Teacher absenteeism - i.e., absence without a valid reason - has been blamed for much of the shortcomings of government schools.

But a 2016 study by Azim Premji Foundation (APF) across over 600 schools in six states including Karnataka, had shown that teacher absenteeism was only 2.5%. However, the overall teacher absence was around 19%, which was due to other administrative or departmental work they were assigned, trainings, or legitimate leaves; that is, teachers were absent due to systemic issues rather than a lack of professionalism.

The current system, wherein teachers' promotions are based entirely on tenure, hardly incentivises high-performing teachers as well.

Bengaluru's government schools are also affected by bureaucratic procedures like frequent teacher transfers. ""The transfer process is lengthy, and happens just a few months into the academic year. Events like elections can delay it even more. Neither the teacher nor the students would know if the teacher would remain in the school that year. This affects consistency in academic inputs,"" says Kapil Dawda, Bengaluru City Director for the non-profit Teach for India. Teach for India's fellows work as full-time teachers in low-income schools; currently they work with 24 government schools in the city.

Jean Boddu, Senior Program Manager at Mentor Together, another non-profit that works with government schools, says the distribution of bags and books to students also gets delayed by 2-3 months from the start of the academic year. ""Also, there is a huge dropout of students in 9th standard, as students who are academically weak are neglected, and fail exams."" Boddu says such students are not supported well enough as the school is worried that its 10th standard pass percentage may drop down if they continue there.

In terms of infrastructure, Bengaluru's government schools do have basic infrastructure like toilets and electricity, but in many cases the infrastructure is not functional. For example, schools that have toilets may lack water; or the toilet is kept locked. There is little investment in the operation and maintenance of existing infrastructure. In Bengaluru, corporates have adopted many government schools, providing funds, books, infrastructure etc.

Dawda says that schools located in areas like Whitefield which have a high concentration of corporates, tend to have better essential infrastructure because of this. ""Government schools in these areas often have a science lab, computer lab etc., which schools in areas like Ejipura or Goripalya don't have,"" he says. Since such philanthropic work is not streamlined and coordinated by the Department of Public Instruction, the results are often skewed and less effective.

In education system, the Cluster Resource Person (CRP) who oversees some 10-12 government schools per cluster, is the academic authority, says Aradhya. ""CRP has to monitor the quality of learning process, but he usually ends up doing administrative work and collecting data from schools. Parents also don't know that it's the CRP they have to approach, to hold their child's school accountable,"" he says.

The Karnataka School Quality Assessment and Accreditation Council (KSQAAC) routinely assesses government schools in the state and accredits them. Schools have to undergo both a self-assessment and external assessment, and are graded on multiple aspects like learning achievement, learning environment and physical environment. They are then given accreditation in grades ranging from A+ to D.

The Council has routinely ranked schools poorly. In 2014-15, for example, it had assessed 1220 government schools, 917 aided schools and 24 unaided schools in the state. In Bangalore Urban overall (Bangalore North and South educational districts combined), out of 78 schools, no schools got A or A+ grade, and only eight got B+. Sixteen schools got B grade, 33 got C+, 17 got C and four schools got D grade.

Aradhya opines that the accreditation system is useless as long as there is no initiative to improve the quality of schools. ""If the government is providing functional infrastructure, recruiting teachers and monitoring the learning process in schools, then it has the right to give accreditation. Else, continuing this exercise without doing anything to improve quality, only sends the message that government schools are bad,"" he says.

While government schools compulsorily have to submit to the KSQAAC accreditation process, private schools are not bound to. In the current system, private schools can participate in the accreditation process if they want to, by paying a fee to KSQAAC. Very few usually do.

Currently there isn't a system to assess private schools on their quality. The majority of private schools in Bangalore are low-income schools without adequate infrastructure or well-qualified teachers. However parents are keen to send their children to these schools because of the English language education offered, and the general perception that these schools are better.

Accountability remains the core difference between public schools and private ones, according to Shashi Kumar D, General Secretary of KAMS (Associated Management of Private Schools in Karnataka). ""There are issues with private schools, they are not isolated from the problems of running a school. For example there may be a lacuna with the lessons offered, or the hire of unskilled teachers. But because of the pervasive accountability in these establishments the teachers increase their skills, knowledge and teaching ability,"" Kumar says.

However, research has often showed that there isn't much of a difference in the quality of education in government and private schools. World Bank's World Development Report 2018 says that, in the 40 countries it researched on, including India, there were no differences in the learning outcomes of children in private and public schools, given that they had matching familial backgrounds. Any marginal difference was because private schools mainly admitted students from advantaged backgrounds. That is, student performance depended on the student's household, and not the quality of education offered by the school. Another study by APF in rural Andhra Pradesh in 2015 had shown similar results.

Behar says, ""There would be less than 2% private schools that are elite and actually have the resources to run a high quality school. But even their quality of education is suspect. The remaining low-fee private schools are mostly much worse in quality."" Behar says there would be only 10-15% private schools that are truly committed to providing good quality education. ""For the rest, it is a business,"" he says.

Dr Shalini Rajneesh, Principal Secretary (Primary and Secondary Education Department), says that government school students often lack a good support system. ""First-generation school goers cannot study the way a typical private school student studies - by rote. There are no support systems for public school students, no remedies and no help at home.

The government had introduced digital classrooms in high schools, infused of ICT as part of pedagogy, brought in subjects like robotics in residential schools, and most recently, made over government schools by turning their walls into canvases.

However, it seems their efforts don't prove much because the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE), National Achievement Survey (NAS) by MHRD, and the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) have thoroughly highlighted the poor quality of government schools in Telangana, with respect to infrastructure as well as quality of education being imparted.

In fact, compared to the data published in the UDISE for the academic year 2014-15, this year's report revealed that not much has changed in government schools since TRS had come to power. One glaring example is that of computer availability in government schools, which has actually gone down to 36 percent from being 37.5 percent in 2014, as per the UDISE numbers. In secondary schools, it has increased slightly from 29 to 31 percent.

When it comes to matters of infrastructure in primary schools such as having boundary walls, single-room classrooms, playgrounds, and kitchen sheds, the data indicates stagnancy. While studies showed that there was a steady improvement in the performance of residential schools run by the social welfare department -- where just about 15 per cent of students studied -- other government schools like the zilla parishad schools were constantly ignored.

Another example is that of science laboratories in secondary schools. The percentage of schools having Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Computer and Maths labs have down to 17.6, 17.5, 16.9. 11.7 and 6.3 percent from 19.3, 19.2, 18.5, 12.7 and 8 percent respectively.

Poor quality of education

Various reports released in the last four years raised questions over the quality of education being imparted in government schools of Telangana. For example the NAS report released this year pointed out that performance of school students in Telangana in all the subjects was poorer than that of students from most districts of other southern states.

Even the Comptroller and Auditor General in its audit report released this year pulled up the Telangana government as it found that 14-26 percent children in primary schools and 21-47 percent children in upper primary schools scored less than 40 percent in the years 2014-17. It also pointed out issues like unhygienic conditions of kitchens in schools used for cooking midday meals.

TRS government can't walk the talk?

It's no news that the TRS government has never forgone an opportunity to talk about its achievements in residential educational institutions run by the social welfare department. Good performance of students in SSC exams, competitive exams, academic and extra-curricular initiatives has often been the talk of the town during TRS rule.

However, government teachers point out that these residential schools -- home to jus10 percent of the 22 lakh students enrolled in different government schools across the State -- are not run by the Department of School Education (DSE) and receive ample funds, as a result they deliver better results. The government is all-talk when it comes to these schools and mum when it comes schools that come under the DSE.

The stark difference could be seen in this year's SSC results as the pass percentage in residential schools was above 90 percent whereas in zilla parishad schools it was just about 75 percent.

Telangana State United Teachers Federation, general secretary, Chava Ravi, said, ""Around 20,000 teacher positions are vacant in government schools. The TRS government has not recruited a single teacher since 2014, even though the TRT was announced for 8,972 posts last year.""

""There are several schools where one to two teachers teach 5 classes and cover 18 subjects. Moreover, in this academic year, school maintenance funds have not been released yet by the State government and the amount is expected to go down with the merger of SSA (Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan) and RMSA (Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan).

Negative marks for TRS government on school fee regulation issue : Parents

Parents across the State have been crying hoarse demanding fee regulation. The Hyderabad Schools Parents Association (HSPA) has conducted many protests on this issue, including writing a post card to the Chief Minister and producing a song chiding him for not taking any action on the issue. The post even went viral on social media.

These protests and promises by the government -- especially the education minister -- notwithstanding, the TRS government has failed to address problems of exorbitant fee. The State government constituted a committee to look into the issue, headed by former Osmania University Vice Chancellor, Prof Tirupati Rao. The committee was formed in March 2017 and was supposed to submit its report in the next one month. It actually did so only in December. It's a year since the report was submitted, but it has not been made public yet. The government did not even form the district fee regulatory committees."

Furthermore, the bench directed the authorities concerned to file their counter affidavit by December 6. It also impleaded the Director of State Council for Education, Research and Training, as a party.

According to the petitioner, there are about 37,211 government schools, 8,403 government aided and 12,419 private self-financing schools, imparting education to about 1.25 crore students. Around 40 lakh students study in 12,419 private schools. The State spends Rs 27,000 crore for education per annum.

Although as per the State's education policy, English is taught as the second language from Class 2 to 12 in Tamil medium aided and unaided schools, despite having successfully completing Plus Two with high marks, a student was unable to speak or understand any communication in English.

Moreover, he was also unable to converse or write fluently in English.

This leads to communication problems for him when he pursues professional courses or higher education that are imparted only in English.

However, the students who study in CBSE schools find it easier to understand and communicate in English. Therefore, a need has arisen to lay emphasis on spoken English, said the petitioner."

""Scotland will become the first country in the world to have LGBTI inclusive education embedded in the curriculum,"" said a statement released on Thursday.

Just that morning a few of them had visited the Government Urdu Higher Primary School at Nachanahalli Palya on Manandavadi Road and soon after lunch, nearly ten of them led by Dame Hilary Blume (Director, The Green Hotel and Founder, Charities Advisory Trust in UK) were ready to hop into the mini bus and visit a few more schools run by the Government of Karnataka.

As the bus drove towards the congested Kyathamaranahalli and entered a small lane, the women, who alighted from the bus, were surprised to see a clean, well-maintained Government Higher Primary School. There was a welcome committee with the Head Master of the School V. Ramaswamy, a disciplined, dedicated teacher and H. Saraswathi, the Director of RLHP (Rural Literacy and Health Programme) who is coordinating with Charities Advisory Trust, greeting the group of lively women.

Walking up a flight of stairs that led to the library of the school at the far end, the students, both boys and girls, all dressed neatly in green uniforms got up shyly but most of them immediately recognised the familiar of face of Dame Hilary Blume, who is no stranger to Mysuru.

""Do you recognise Madam Hilary?"" asked the Head Master and most of the students immediately recalled her earlier visit to the school. The library is well- equipped with books, desks and benches (all funded by the Charities Advisory Trust) and the visitors were keen to see how many students were really into reading the books.

A few of the students got up to demonstrate how helpful the reading habits they had been inculcated with had worked. A girl from eighth standard picked up a book in English and read without any mistakes in clear diction while a few others read from books in Kannada related to freedom fighters and scientists. Then they sang a few patriotic songs.

Now, it was the turn of the motley group of exuberant women, mostly in their sixties and seventies, to become children. They started singing the nursery rhyme for kids, 'Head, Shoulder, Knees and Toes.' Led by 'Good Giver' Annie Taylor, who had taught little children in Ethiopia, they began on a slow pitch and accelerated. The children who joined them sang with gusto and joy.

Impressed by the kind of work done by the school and RLHP, Hilary Blume asked the Head Master, what else they required for their school. He said that they needed a water filter and a LCD screen projector. She promised to install both through the profits earned in The Green Hotel.

""The profit of every meal eaten in The Green Hotel helps buy an egg for a child or for the books of children,"" she told SOM.

The children then wanted to know more about the visitors and they introduced themselves. There were two Elizabeths, one from Canada and another from England, both of whom were doctors. There was Ann Kingston, who was the knitting teacher for the ""Knit for Peace"" group and Danielle Liebech, who had visited The Green Hotel five times and there was also the young L. Marie, originally from France, who is working with Hilary Blume.

After a satisfying visit at Kyathamaranahalli, the group moved towards Sathagalli, where there is a slum and another Government Higher Primary School. It was around 4.30 pm. The RLHP runs a nutrition programme here in the school premises. A few of the infants and children were sitting there along with their mothers. A young woman, fondly called Akhila aunty by the Sathagalli slum residents, had brought ragi porridge which had a healthy mix of pulses and greens like drumstick leaves.

Along with the porridge, the kids were also given boiled eggs. A few of the mothers told this reporter how useful this programme was, as it had helped their malnourished children gain weight and improve their health.

Then right next door was the Government Higher Primary School where in the evening free supplementary classes are run for the children. Children in the age group of six to 14 were sitting there quietly waiting for the classes to begin.

All of them in unison welcomed the idea of the evening classes and how they were all happy to be there studying.

RLHP Director Saraswathi asked one of the students to get up and welcome the visitors. A tenth standard student B.B. Mehak got up and welcomed the group. This girl, who is the Malala Yousafzai, (Nobel Laureate from Pakistan who is an activist for female education) of Mysuru, had stopped a child marriage in her area a couple of years ago.

One of the teachers, Seema, was a child labourer, who used to roll agarbathis. But today she has completed her Pre-University education because of the support of RLHP and Charities Advisory Trust.

The slum children here are so vibrant that when they were asked to sing a song, four girls got up and began singing Jalle Kabbu..., a folk song in faultless Kannada and dancing to choreographed steps. Asked for their names, they said Luhia, Simran, Husna and Rafia.

Everyone was moved by the effort that had gone into preparing the deprived sections of the society to face the world boldly.

""The Charities Advisory Trust is supporting many causes including the beauticians' course, nutrition programme, sponsoring health camps from the funds collected through Good Gift India. Their focus is also on libraries and they have helped setting it up in nearly 100 Government Higher Primary Schools,"" said Saraswathi.

Later, speaking to Star of Mysore, Hilary Blume said that 'Knit for Peace' is an initiative of the Charities Advisory Trust started as an income generation project for Hutu and Tutsi widows, victims of the Rwandan genocide and civil war.

""At our suggestion, the widows knitted school jumpers for the many orphans and we paid them by raising funds through featuring the project in Good Gift Catalogue, another of the Trust's initiative,"" said Hilary Blume.

""Good Gifts is an initiative started by me. This is a concept where the giver knows exactly where the money goes. Hence, we came out with Good Gifts Catalogue where people can identify with a range of causes; in fact, there are over 400 ways to help people take their first step out of poverty, enjoy better health and increased opportunities,"" she said and added, ""I ask the givers to come and see how the concept works. That is how I bring such people to visit Mysuru to see the schools and slums and how the money they have given is spent. Our next visit with the 'Knit for Peace' group is in early January,"" she said

Asked whether she believed like many others who are doing charity work that charity is also a business, Hilary Blume said, ""These are causes that I was introduced to, and continue to support, as I believe in them. I believe that once I give money, then the money is out of my hands to control. So it is important that I can trust those organisations I support. Administration is critical to keep a charity going, but too many big charities waste too much money.""

On whether she has written any books on charity having worked for more than 40 years in the field, she recalled five books titled, 'Fund Raising - A Comprehensive Handbook,' 'Accounting and Financial Management for Charities,' 'Charity Trading Handbook,' 'Museum Trading Handbook' and 'Charity Shop Handbook' she has written. Hilary Blume also revealed that she is penning the sixth one now called 'The Ethics of Charity Giving.'"

Next month, the DCPCR will undertake a rigorous assessment of 5,800 schools in the capital -- all of which are administered by the state government's education ministry and/or New Delhi's three municipal corporations- as a precursor to creating the country's first ever 'School Development Index' for a state.

Owing to the sheer number of schools involved and data required, earlier indices compiled by the government have focussed on the state or districts as a whole rather than individual schools.

Unde the School Development Index, Delhi's schools will be ranked according to three parameters, as devised by the Adhyayan Foundation - an NGO that focuses on capacity building of schools.

The first parameter is safety and security, the second is teaching and learning outcomes while the third parameter is community participation and social integration. Each school will be given a rank between 1 to 4 for each criteria, with 1 indicating that it has the most room for improvement.

The assessment of Delhi's schools is expected to continue into next year, with a final report from the DCPCR due in May. The government body has made sure to clarify that the exercise is not a punitive one but an instructive one. The exercise will give the administrators of these schools an insight into best practices and facilitate an environment for collaboration.

Education has long been a priority for the current state government of Delhi. When contesting state elections for Delhi in 2015, the made the improvement of education outcomes one of the core aspects of their platform.

So far, it seems that they have kept their word. For example, in July this year, the government launched libraries in 100 primary schools in the city, in addition to a 100 last year. In June, it announced the planned launch of a ' happiness curriculum' in government schools, which involves meditation and life skills training.

All of them boast of language labs, upgraded auditoriums, relatively well-stocked libraries and, most importantly, a teacher-student ratio of 1:35. They take in students from Classes VI to XII and admissions are through an entrance test. Students are eligible only if they have studied in a government school for a minimum of two years.

When RPVVs were started as schools for high performers, they had the same shortcomings as other government schools -- poor infrastructure, undefined learning outcomes, dated teaching methods. ""But the last four or five years have seen a lot of change,"" says geography teacher Neerja Lamba, who has been with the school since 2003. ""We have a stress-free learning and teaching environment now. There are cultural activities and exchange programmes; students want to come to school,"" she says. Singh points out that the Delhi government has given the schools a free hand for improvements. ""For example, for any expenditure below ₹50,000, I don't have to write to the government. Little things like this make it so much easier.""

Over the past four years, the Delhi government has steadily increased funding for education, from 20% budgetary allocation in 2015 to 23.5% in 2017 and 26% in 2018.

The schools' improved infrastructure is testament to that. In the Dwarka branch, there's a fully air-conditioned auditorium, a conference hall open to both teachers and students, and a spanking new running track that instantly catches the eye. The labs have the latest equipment; there's a 'project development' room where students are recycling paper; and there are working water purifiers on every floor.

Robot Gangnam Style

The change is nowhere more perceptible than in the Rohini Sector 11 school, halfway across the city, where I find Class X student Prashant Kumar elbow-deep in a half-built drone. He is working after school hours in what the school calls the 'Atal Tinkering Lab'. ""I'm pretty sure I can get it to fly in a day or two; I just need to stabilise the gyro sensor,"" Kumar says confidently. His supervisor Vivek smiles behind him. ""That's going to need another month or two,"" he says. Close by, Class XII student Pratham Chopra's robot is dancing to 'Gangnam Style'. The coding took four months, says Chopra.

In the corner there is an actual 3D printer, the table around it littered with prototypes of printed whistles. The design's final version is now being used by the school's PT teachers. Science teacher Sadaf Fathima shows us a keychain printed in the shape of her name. The lab is the school's pride and joy, set up as part of the Central government's Atal Innovation Mission. Nearly 10,000 schools across the country applied for the grant, and RPVV-Rohini was among those to bag it in the first round.

Food, water, lessons

The one-year-old lab has sparked an interest in science among students, helping also to bring more girls in, say teachers. There are only three girls in the Class XII science stream this year, but the trend is beginning to slowly change in the younger classes, they say.

Social sciences teacher Shivani Singh says such facilities help immensely to address one of the biggest

problems of government schools: dropouts. In the Dwarka school, 63% of students come from families with monthly incomes below ₹5,000; their parents are rickshaw-pullers, labourers, sweepers, tailors, mechanics, domestic help, etc. When these students come into Class VI, they are undernourished, unable to take home school work, and, in some cases, have to contribute to the household income by taking up odd jobs.

But even as the dropout rate in Delhi government schools has been increasing, from 2.9% in 2014-15 to 3.4% in 2016-17 (Praja.org study), with worse results in municipal corporation schools, the RPVVs don't have any dropouts. ""Children want to do more than just study from textbooks. The 'more' is what we provide,"" says Shivani. ""They get clean water and nutritious food like dal chawal, daliya porridge, poori-sabzi. Girls get sanitary napkins,"" she says.

Walking through the school's corridors, both at Dwarka and Rohini, there is a steady stream of 'good morning' greetings around us. The students, free for the day after a gruelling exam, are not reticent and engage with their teachers comfortably. ""That took a lot of hard work,"" says Principal Singh. It was not just academics but also student-teacher relationships that needed overhauling. From improving teachers' listening and communication skills to newer teaching methods and learning objectives, ""we needed a change in pedagogy,"" says Singh.

A new pedagogy

It was this need that led him to begin the Cluster Leadership Development Programme, running now in all schools under the Directorate of Education in Delhi. ""We select 10 or so principals, area-wise, and get them to work with a facilitator-trainer. The principals, in turn, go back to their schools and work with the teachers,"" he says.

This has reduced teacher-student conflict, Singh says. ""And communication skills among students have improved; it's not great, but it's much better than what it used to be.""

The clubs and extra-curricular activities also play a big role. RPVV Rohini, for instance, has a Legal Advocacy Club where lawyers and judges address the children once a month. The Bal Bhavan Kendra is an arts and crafts initiative sponsored by the government's National Bal Bhavan in addition to regular art classes. I find a classroom filled with Madhubani paintings, wall hangings, home decor items, and more.

We walk into a room full of Class X students, and when they hear of their school's ranking, they break into ear-to-ear grins. Asked about their ambitions, they list scientists, doctors and more, but among them a handful says 'teacher'. They are as excited to teach in this school as they are to learn. The teachers accompanying us couldn't have been prouder."

The decision to convert hundreds of primary schools into English medium schools in districts like Karimnagar, Warangal and Nizamabad by teachers and its success led to the government giving the official nod to other schools across the State to follow suit.

As expected the enrolment rate in government schools has shot up. But the education experts think that despite the change in medium of instruction, it has had little effect on learning outcomes of government school students.

In 2016-17, for instance, 4,872 schools in the State were given permission to convert to English medium. Earlier back in 2008, in the united Andhra Pradesh, for the first time the then government had granted permission to run high schools with parallel mediums - 5,500 in Andhra and 2,200 Telagana area.

A social audit of learning outcomes carried out on 1,302 students from Class V to X by Campaign for Learning Outcomes, released last week confirmed this belief. It revealed that while 650 students could neither read nor write English, 271 could read only small sentences but not entire paragraphs.

Problem of parallel medium

Apart from granting the approval for change of medium of instruction, teaching community alleges, that the government did little to ensure that the move actually benefits students. In fact, the decision to run two parallel mediums is part of the problem. With the teacher-student ratio dismal in government schools, forcing one teacher to handle not just several classes but to even teach in two different languages.

""Most teachers are from Telugu medium background so for the sake for convenience they end up teaching in Telugu. Also, they find it difficult to alternate between Telugu in one period and English in the next. Students are not able to get acquainted with the language"" said T Venkateshwar Rao, President, English Language Teachers Association.

Proper training needed

The problem is further compounded by insufficient training of the lack thereof. For instance, in 2016, select primary teachers were provided five-day English language training. This was supplemented a year later by another five-day training for the same set of teachers.

""Now only a couple of teachers are trained from each school and later they too were transferred. Last academic year in Warangal, teachers from 132 primary schools have been trained but soon they got transferred to Telugu medium schools. This beats the very purpose of having English medium schools,"" said Nagati Narayana, an educationist.

Since a number of teachers themselves took the initiative to start classes in English medium and when it started showing positive results, teachers feel the government became complacent.

On Monday, the government schools teachers' association (GSTA) held a meeting attended by hundreds of teachers to raise concerns over their security at school campuses. ""Teachers at government schools are suffering because of the government's apathy. Saturday's incident was not the first time when a teacher was assaulted by a student.

The revamped 'CBSE Affiliation Bye-Laws 2018', brought out recently by the board has given more control to the state government over the functioning of such schools and also upcoming ones in the state.

The new bye-laws have also designated the state as the 'appropriate government' which would solely decide if the existing 1,300 CBSE schools in the state, as well as those in the pipeline, meet the prescribed norms in terms of infrastructure, safety, sanitation and land ownership. ""The CBSE would not re-check any aspects vetted by the state government during its inspection of schools,"" the bye-laws state.

The state government has also been given the power to bring in regulations on fees levied in CBSE schools. As per the bye-laws, fees would be charged as per the regulation of the appropriate government (state) and fee revision shall be subject to its laws, regulations and directions.

The 'Recognition' clause

Moreover, CBSE's insistence on 'recognition certificate' would be another crucial aspect which would enable the state government to make errant CBSE schools fall in line. Though CBSE schools in Kerala obtained a one-year relaxation from the board, all 1,300 plus schools will have to obtain it fairly soon from the state. ""Earlier, once the NOC was obtained, we had no business with the state government. We only needed to renew our affiliation every three years with the CBSE. Now, the state can cancel the NOC and prescribe a new set of rules while granting fresh NOC or during issuance of recognition certificate,"" said the manager of a leading CBSE school.

""If the school managements have concerns about the state government getting a decisive role in affiliation process, it can be addressed through dialogue with all stakeholders,"" she said.

'NOC a policy matter'

General Education Secretary A Shajahan said the grant of NOC to CBSE schools is a 'policy decision' which needs to be taken at the highest level. Since the LDF Government assumed power, fresh NOC has not been granted to any CBSE school. Aggrieved school managements had taken legal recourse and obtained a court verdict that schools which meet the prescribed norms are eligible for NOC.

""The government is planning to approach the court seeking more time for implementation of the order. Though we have no issues with the functioning of existing CBSE schools, permission for new ones will be subject to strict scrutiny as we do not want mushrooming of such schools without any regulation,"" said a top source in the government."

Santosh Gupta, principal of a Seelampur school, admitted that for inclusive education, it was important to embrace the transgender community. ""I agree that education is the only way in which we can empower people from disadvantaged communities.

""The first and the foremost of the problems is there is no separate column for the third gender in school forms.

As part of its first step, the state government will start 1,000 pre-primary schools in the state with adequate facilities and necessary infrastructure by coordinating with the available anganwadis in the vicinity of government schools.

The schools will give stress on educating children through activities, games without using text books or slates. However, the government could not give a timeframe as to when it start the new system owing to delay in the release of fund from the Union Government. The schools will focus on a unified child-friendly curriculum encompassing physical, social, intellectual, and emotional development of the child.

The General Education Department has also decided to provide space for anganwadis in government schools where excess accommodation was available and pre-primary school was not functioning.

SCERT Director J Prasad told Express that the new curriculum will focus on activity cards rather than using textbooks.

""In an effort to make the pre-primary education system scientific, we are introducing a new curriculum. As part of this, we have already started activity cards named 'Kalithoni'. The cards have 30 different themes and the first part is the collection of 10 themes.

Special shelves with levels for each class have been marked by using different colours such as Green for Class I, containing books that only have pictures, followed by Red, Orange, White and Yellow.

""The children are free to take books of their own choice. It's separate from a common library available to all classes and younger children find it more engaging,"" said the library in-charge at the school.

Speaking with the teachers and students at the school, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said, ""The children's library is a great place to read and learn, understand and explain.""

The Room to Read had last year signed a MoU with the Delhi government to build 450 libraries in partnership with the Directorate of Education. An official said, ""100 such libraries were built last year... The aim here is to develop literacy and a habit of reading."""

(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). With effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions.

The Samagra Shiksha scheme focuses on improvement of quality of education by providing support for different interventions like; in-service training of teachers and schools heads, conduct of achievement surveys at National and State level, provision of textbooks as per Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, ICT and digital initiatives, vocational education, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment has been increased and from this year provisions for library grants and grants for sports and physical education have also been introduced.

The Government has also launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities.

e PATHSHALA: a single point repository of e ­resources containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-­print materials.

The Central Government, supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme namely 'Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat' (PBBB) in foundational years of schooling.

(iii) MHRD, has launched a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform popularly known as SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) on 9 July, 2017. The portal is offering various online courses for school education and higher education. NCERT has been developing course modules for Massive Open and Online Course (MOOCs) for school education system in 12 subject areas (Accountancy, business studies, biology, chemistry, economic, history, geography, mathematics, physics, political science, psychology and sociology) for classes IX-XII. Twelve (12) courses and twenty one (21) courses have been completed in the first cycle and second cycle (completed on 30 Nov. 2018) on SWAYAM platform (https://swayam.gov.in/) respectively. Nearly 22,000 students and 30,000 students were registered in the first cycle and second cycle respectively.

(iv) CIET-NCERT has been assigned the task of developing e-resources for Master of Education (M.Ed.) course jointly with Allahabad University. One course (Educational Administration, Management and Leadership in School Education) has been completed first cycle on SWAYAM platform in which 2115 were enrolled. The second cycle of this course is offered from 2 July 2018.

Besides, an online course on action research for teachers is conducted in regular intervals in the MOODLE platform (http://ictcurriculum.gov.in/ ). Post Graduate Diploma in Guidance and Counselling for in-service teachers is also offered through the same course portal. Several other online courses are developed for inservice teachers professional development and delivered through the portal https://itpd.ncert.org.in/.

(v) A programme for utilization of satellite communication technologies for transmission of educational e-contents through 32 National Channels i.e. SWAYAM PRABHA DTH-TV has been launched. CIET-NCERT is the national coordinator for one DTH TV channel i.e., Kishore Manch (#31) and has started feeding a 24x7 educational TV channel w.e.f. 09 July, 2018. Everyday four hour fresh slot is telecast and repeated six times in 24 hours to provide learning opportunities for the stake holders, as per their convenience. Besides, NIOS is running 5 channels for teachers, for Secondary and Sr. Secondary levels and for sign language.

(vi) MHRD has launched Diksha Portal for providing digital platform to teachers giving them an opportunity to learn and train themselves and connect with teacher community. The portal envisages to help teachers boost their teaching skills and create their own separate profile with their skills and knowledge, and help in improving quality of education with use of latest technologies in education sector.

State governments have increased their budgets for school education in the past three years, but the allotment of funds has not been enough to attract permanent qualified teaching staff to government schools, finds a recent study conducted across six States.

The report, prepared jointly by Child Rights and You (CRY) and the Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability (CBGA), examines budgeting for school education in six States -- West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra -- during the 14th Finance Commission recommendation period, which started in April 2015.

The study finds that there has been an overall increase in revenue with the States following the 14th Finance Commission recommendations. This was a result of an increase in the share of the States in the divisible pool of Central taxes from 32% to 42%. At the same time, a reduction in the Union government's contribution to the States for Central schemes in social sectors forced the States to improve their tax revenue collection. The study analyses whether the availability of additional funds translated into prioritising of school education in these six States.

Between 2015-16 and 2017-18, there was a net decline in the share of school education budget in the total State Budget for three of the six States, according to the detailed demand for Grants and State Budget documents. Bihar saw a dip of 3.1%, Maharashtra a drop of 1% and West Bengal 0.9%. On the other hand, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh saw an increase in the size of school education budget by 0.4%, 2.6% and 3.2%, respectively.

The report examines whether the increase in the size of school education budget was more than the rise in size of the total budget, indicating a higher priority for the sector. It concluded that between 2014-15 and 2017-18, Uttar Pradesh saw a 98.8% increase in budget for schools, whereas its total budget increased by 63.3%. West Bengal's budget for school education increased by 49.4% while its total budget increased by 48.2% and in Tamil Nadu, the former increased by 38.7% but the total budget increased by 38.5%, indicating that school education was a priority for these three States.

At the same time, all the six States showed an increase in the magnitude of per-child and per-student spending for education between 2014-15 and 2016-17.

Despite a varying level of commitment towards school education across the six States, all of them struggle with a shortage of teachers. The report cites data from the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development to show that as on March 2017, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have from 19% to 34% of total teacher positions at the elementary level vacant. Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu were relatively better with 5.9% and 2.6% posts unfilled.

Data from the District Information System for Education show that at the upper primary level, there is a severe paucity of subject-specific teachers required under the Right to Education Act -- 77% upper primary schools in Maharashtra, 46% in Uttar Pradesh, 40% in West Bengal and 37% in Bihar do not have subject teachers.

More than one lakh schools in India are run with only one teacher and all the six States surveyed have shown the number of such schools on the rise. The shortage of teachers is more acute at the secondary level -- Bihar has 20,494 teaching posts vacant, Chhattisgarh 8,278 and Uttar Pradesh 12,008.

The figures don't entirely capture the severity of the shortfall as they do not reflect the shortage of subject teachers."

Following the mode of campaigns run by privately-managed educational institutions, government schools across the state have started a massive advertising campaign ahead of commencement of the new academic session on January 1, featuring achievements and facilities of the schools.

Sources in the education department said the state government's recent decision to provide annual administrative grants to schools on the basis of enrolled positions has added an impetus to this campaign.

Some school authorities have also launched a social media campaign, named Utsav Vidyarambha, an annual enrolment drive conducted every year with the help of local community and students, to enhance enrolment in schools.

Yet the evidence is mounting that UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath cares more about the welfare of cows than people inhabiting his state. Consider his latest order that in case of encroachers on grazing land, the encroachments be removed immediately and strict action initiated against the accused. As Adityanath continued to drive his administration hard on ill-conceived cow schemes, irate farmers in Aligarh locked up stray cows inside classrooms while schoolchildren and teachers were left in the lurch.

In truth, the scale of the problem unleashed by Hindutva-inspired curbs on cattle trade is unmanageable. A 2012 livestock census found 3.9 crore cows in UP. Six years later, imagine many of these cows past their productive age roaming the countryside and cities in search of food. No government is in a position to earmark shelters or grazing lands for such a huge population. Adityanath's desperate search for cow welfare solutions is bound to fail and he must instead focus on the rising farm anger against stray cows now directed at government property like schools and hospitals. Even those encroaching grazing land deserve a better reason than stray cows to be asked to go.

Farmers have paid dearly for this proliferation of stray cows. Unable to sell unproductive cows and now struggling to fend off stray cows from fields, it has been a double whammy for them. Reviving the cattle trade will solve these problems. In light of growing agrarian distress BJP should not lose sight of the fact that it is humans, not cows, who will be voting at the hustings."

After four rounds of admissions, less than a quarter of the 1,400 reserved seats on offer in the city's private schools for differently abled students were filled this year. This has prompted the government to carry forward the vacant seats to the next academic year.

Hindustan Times had reported last week that the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) had invited fresh online applications for 1,268 entry-level reserved seats for a fourth round of admissions to the current academic year which has just three months left.

On Wednesday, the draw of lots were held for these seats but only 123 were filled. The DoE cited ""lack of applications"" for the large number of seats going vacant.

""Of the 125 applications we received during the fresh round of admission, 123 candidates were absorbed. The selected candidates have to approach the allotted school on or before December 31,"" DoE director Sanjay Goel said.

According to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (PWD) Act, 2016, three per cent of the total number of seats meant for the economically weaker section and disadvantaged groups (EWS/DG) category are reserved for children with disabilities.

Goel said that the department will carry forward the remaining reserved seats to next academic session (2019-20). ""The seats will be counted in the category during next year's admission,"" he said. The notification of admission in the entry level classes under the 25% reserved seats for the EWS/DG category is likely to be announced in the first week of January, next year.

Officials in the DoE said that they are planning to organise awareness campaigns among parents to motivate them to apply.

""There is lack of awareness among parents about the reserved seats because this was the first time the quota was introduced within the 25% EWS/DG seats. We are planning to organise campaigns to aware parents from the coming admission session,"" an official said.

Experts, however, said that the ""lack of inclusiveness"" in schools make parents reluctant from applying. ""Though the situation in private schools is better than the government schools, parents of children with disabilities are still reluctant from applying there. They think their kids will only be able to adjust in special schools. More efforts need to be put in to make campuses more inclusive by appointing trained special educators and providing better infrastructure facilities,"" said Dr Satender Singh, disability rights activist."

The two schools, along with numerous other establishments like the handloom weaving centre, which bore the brunt of the floods, are on the path of fast revival -- thanks to the effective intervention of voluntary agencies and the local people.

While rebuilding by the government agencies in different parts of the state is only in the initial stages, the UP and LP schools which remained half submerged in the flood waters for over five days suffering huge damage to their facilities, have come back to life. In the forefront of the effort to revive them was the Deepalaya Trust in Delhi which lost no time in identifying the devastated schools and offering its help.

In a commendable operation coordinated by A J Philip, Deepalaya executive officer and eminent journalist; Dr George Mathew, Chairman, Institute of Social Sciences, New Delhi; and A J Abraham, social activist in Ernakulam, the rebuilding of the school started in right earnest in September itself and the work was completed within two months.

The so-called government red-tapes and delays were overcome with the strong support provided by the school authorities, including the AEO Latha, school headmaster V K Santhosh, panchayat president T G Anoop, Cartoonist Academy and the local people.

The Trust spent Rs 33 lakh in replacing the damaged computers, reconstructing the collapsed compound walls, removing the slush and debris from the compound and classrooms, laying tiles on the floors, painting the walls and re-equipping the library. Soon, other NGOs joined hands, including 'Human Values' and 'Rapid Response' of Pondicherry, which replaced the old furniture, desks and benches with modern ones.

Now the schools sport a completely new look and none who visits the place will realise that these were the ones the floods had ravaged only a few months ago. To celebrate its rejuvenation, the school organised a function on Saturday, which was attended by Sethu, writer and former chairman of South Indian Bank, Dr George Mathew, Cartoon Academy members, panchayat president, ward members, school children, parents, teachers and local people."

After merger of 4,600 primary schools, the Jharkhand government is planning to shut over 6,466 middle schools (classes 6 to 8), having less than 100 students.

These schools would be merged with upgraded high schools in phases, starting with the institutions, which have less than 50 students, education department officials said on Thursday.

Initially, 3,732 middle schools having less than 50 students would be undertaken for merger. The process of merging has already been started.

""Merger is an effort to provide quality education to students in a better educational ambience. Jharkhand has around 411 such middle schools where number of students is less than 10. If these schools are merged with high schools, students would get better education,"" said state education secretary AP Singh.

""As per the rules in the right to education (RTE), there should be at least three trained graduate teacher (TGT) in middle schools where number of students is less than 100. It means, we would have to afford additional Rs 18 lakh on teachers' salary even in the schools where number of students is less than 10, which is not logical,"" he added.

The decision comes at a time when the opposition parties and critics have been criticising the state government for merging the primary schools. Several ruling party elected representatives have also been lobbying with the government against the move. There have been protests in several parts of the state as well, against merger of schools.

The officials, however, argue that, ideally, there should be one middle school and five to seven primary schools in a panchayat. As many as 6,466 middle schools have been identified in Jharkhand, which could be merged with high schools within a 5-km radius in a panchayat, Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) officials said.

The state government has decided to offer bicycles to the students, who would be shifted to other schools so that they do not face any trouble in commuting to the school.

Meanwhile, the JEPC officials said they have completed the merging exercise of 4,600 primary schools.

JEPC director Uma Shankar Singh said there were 39,600 schools in 2016-17 under education department in Jharkhand. ""Of them, 18,000 schools had 60 or few students. These schools had an average of 1 or two teachers per school. Providing quality education was a major challenge. One teacher was handling four to five classes at a time. How could one expect a better education in these schools,"" he said.

The council said four-step process including field inspection, cross-district verification, block and district consultation and final notification to merge the schools.

Singh said 98% students from the 4,600 primary schools have been shifted and 96% students have expressed satisfaction with the consolidation. ""We faced difficulty to shift 150 students due to some technical reasons. Now, the issue is resolved and 120 students were shifted,"" he said.

The reorganisation of primary schools benefited seven lakh students with better teachers' availability and reduced the requirements of teachers by 4,500. Besides, the process saved government's Rs 400 crore through reduced teachers and infrastructure requirements, JEPC officials said.

Education Dept ropes in IIM Ranchi for merged school evaluation

State education secretary AP Singh said the department has roped in Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ranchi, for evaluation of the merged schools. The IIM, Ranchi would see if the reorganization process brought any difference in improving the education of students, who were shifted in merging process.

The first list of selected children, along with marks secured by them, will be out on February 4. The second list will be out on February 21 and the nursery admission process will conclude on March 31.

Twenty-five per cent seats in pre-school, pre-primary and class 1 will be reserved for economically weaker sections/disadvantaged groups. The directorate had instructed all private schools to upload their criteria -- with points for each criterion -- for admission in open seats, on its official website by December 14. There is however, no clarity yet on the schedule of the EWS admissions. The government has also set an upper age limit of less than four years to be eligible for nursery, less than five years for kindergarten, and less than six years for admission to class 1.

The proposal for an upper age limit was challenged in the court last year. Though a Delhi High Court order last year had allowed the imposition of the upper age limit, the DoE had decided that the order will be applicable only from 2019 academic session. Apart from the abolished criteria, the schools have been given autonomy to come up with their own points system."

Primary school teacher makes NHAI shift toll plaza

he grit, tenacity and commitment T of a government primary school teacher forced National Highways Authority of India to change its acquisition plan on Ludhiana-Chandigarh national highway, which is still being built.

LIFE IN COLOUR: Students are encouraged to be well turned out here

For 11 years, Sanjeev Kumar, a teacher at Government Primary School, Ghulal village near Samrala in district Ludhiana, worked to construct a new school building with the help of philanthropists from the village.

In July, a team of NHAI officials told him to vacate the school in two months.

""The NHAI planned to build a toll plaza here. They needed to widen the road for this and the school building was in the way. Over the past decade, we spent around Rs 26 lakh to construct the new building. When I told village residents, they were shattered,"" says Sanjeev Kumar.

Kumar first approached the district education officer and sent a message to secretary, education Krishan Kumar.

""He called me immediately. I went with a few village residents who have been helping us. As we sat there, he sent a letter to the Ludhiana deputy commissioner, asking him to do everything possible to save the school,"" Sanjeev recalls.

Ludhiana DC Pardeep Aggarwal sent SDM, Samrala and other officials to the school. The SDM called NHAI officials to the school. I heard the SDM telling NHAI officials that the school had to be saved at any cost and NHAI officials were asked to shift the toll plaza,"" he says.

Sanjeev pursued the issue till NHAI issued a fresh notification in October saying that the toll plaza would be shifted.

It is an incident secretary, education Krishan Kumar will not forget anytime soon. ""I could see his desperation and determination to save the school. Village residents were also committed to the cause. Such teachers deserve complete support. The Ludhiana deputy commissioner also took great interest in the endeavour and we are all happy with the result,"" he says.

Education dept steps in

It is remarkable that despite their tough circumstances, government school teachers are trying to bring about a qualitative change in their institutions.

""I learnt that a few teachers in the state improved their schools on their own, because of which more students got enrolled. In February, we called a meeting of such teachers. As they spoke about their experiences, we thought the idea was worth replicating across the state and called on principals and teachers to volunteer,"" says Krishan Kumar.

The officer pursued reforms in the education department during his previous stint as director general, school education for almost three years.

""By July, we had 425 schools with buildings turned into learning aids, improved infrastructure, amenities and sports facilities. The idea was to improve students' learning experience. We fixed the ambitious target of ""Mission 4,250"" by the beginning of the next academic session and asked these 425 teachers to motivate their friends and relatives in 10 other schools. Already, 1,700 schools have accomplished the task,"" he says.

According to the secretary, education, these teachers and communities are the biggest stakeholders in improving educational standards.

""Social accountability is much more result-oriented than departmental accountability,"" he said.

Incentives offered to teachers include transfer of choice, promotion and good ACR. ""All these benefits are non-monetary and the huge improvement in schools is without any extra burden on the state exchequer,"" Kumar adds.

Govt primary school, Jhans, Hoshiarpur

The school had just 17 students when Narinder Arora and his wife Manjit Kaur, both ETT teachers, joined in 2006. Now, there are 224 students. In an act that inspired trust, the couple got their daughter enrolled in the same school.

""There was nothing going for the small school but we decided to do everything possible to set things right. Apart from enrolling my daughter here, we motivated a few friends and fellow teachers to enroll their children as well. We assured them that their children's education or overall development would not suffer. Rather, we said they would see a marked improvement. My son is a UKG student here,"" said Narinder.

The teachers' dedication showed in exam results and students' performance in co-curricular activities.

""Soon, educated families also started sending their children to the school. We also had our own uniform,"" says Narinder Arora.

With this, village residents started pooling money for infrastructure upgrade. ""Philanthropists opened their hearts and pockets to us. Jalandharbased Satpal Singh Multani constructed two rooms. Jagjeet Singh

The Mathematics room in the school is its latest addition. The walls of the verandah have pictures of donors and those of well turned out students on a board with the title, Ajj De Sohne Bache (the smart children of today).

""We write names of five children on this board every day to inspire the children to remain clean,"" says teacher Ajmer Singh who started the transformation in 2007.

""When I joined the school, two snakes were found in the storeroom,"" he recalls. It is now an office.

Outer walls and walls inside the classrooms have paintings, poems and messages painted on them. ""We want to attract students. Coming to school should be a pleasant experience for them,"" he says. It has worked with the children. ""Tanvi, a Class II student sustained an injury on her Jeeta and his family in the village opened their house for us to accommodate 100 students as the school did not have enough space,"" Arora said, estimating that people spent around Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh on the school.

Two years back, they started kindergarten classes on the lines of private schools. ""Now, we get children in nursery and have around 125 kids in kindergarten,"" he says. In June, Arora was promoted as master in a secondary school.

""It was very difficult for me to leave the school and children. Residents literally pleaded with me to stay. When a village elder asked me to stay in a choked voice, I decided to decline the promotion. After this, village residents provided 56 marlas of land to the school and raised a boundary wall. Now, we have enough space,"" he says, adding that they need the education department to provide more teachers as the strength of students is increasing.

""NRIs and other villagers have helped to improve the school. Now, the entire village is involved. People from other villages also come to get their children enrolled here. We have transferred 56 marlas of land to the school. If the number increases, we will provide an acre-and-a-half more of Panchayat land to the school,"" says Jagjeet Singh.

finger last year. But she came to school the next day,"" Ajmer says. According to him, NRIs and philanthropists from outside the village pitched in and around Rs 22 lakh has been spent so far.

""Apart from improving the amenities, I have been focusing on the core issue - improving learning outcomes among students,"" he adds. The school has a sprawling park and playground. Students have mid-day meals on tables with granite tops.

Rurka Kalan (Jalandhar)

The village has two government primary schools - one for girls and one for boys. In ambience and facilities, these schools could give private schools a run for their money.

Walls of both government primary schools have been turned into learning aids for children. They also have libraries and reading rooms. The girls' school also has an LCD screen to screen educational programmes.

""When I joined on July 1, 2006, the school building was in bad shape, with doors and windows missing. There were around 80 students but not a single bench. The first thing to do was to get desks for students before winter. The Youth Football Club of Rurka Kalan, which is working to promote football in the area, helped us procure desks at a cost of Rs 50,000,"" says school teacher Sanjiv Kumar, the man behind the transformation.

This was just the beginning. Over the years, infrastructure, education and sports in the school were upgraded.

""Philanthropists spent Rs 19 lakh on the school. With the way things have come up, more donors are volunteering,"" he says.

At Government Primary School for Girls, Buta Ram, who was promoted as centre head teacher and shifted to the boys' school a few days back, brought about the transformation.

""My daughter studies in this school. After I joined here in 2013, we managed to mobilize resources and undertake works worth around Rs 22 lakh,"" he says.

The school has its own logo and calendar. Numbers and letters are painted on the walls and a park based on the theme of mathematics is being constructed. Sanjiv and I are competing with each other to improve our schools,"" smiles Buta Ram.

Both schools have well-furnished and neat kitchens to cook mid-day meals.

The boys' school is in stark contrast with the street. The backyard of the adjoining senior secondary school is also overrun with weeds like a dark reminder of how things used to be and what could happen if these efforts are not sustained.

SETTING AN EXAMPLE

Secretary education, Krishan Kumar gets pictures from the pathbreaking schools. Every day, he picks the picture of one school and forwards it on WhatsApp groups of the education department. This motivates the others and generates healthy competition. The schools are promoting extra-curricular activities and helping students speak English

They aren't sure if the authorities would do all that is needed to enhance the quality of government schools and bring them on a par with private ones.

Notably, Section 3 of the Act, which is considered the core of the legislation, provides children the fundamental right to free and compulsory education in a neighbourhood school.

According to the proposal, if there's a government school in neighbourhood of a child -- within 1km for primary education and 3km for higher primary -- he/she should get admitted to that instead of a private school.

Nagasimha G Rao, state convener of the RTE task force, said, ""The government is citing the example of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where government schools are in high demand. We're in touch with RTE activists there too. But the Karnataka scenario is different. Parents prefer English medium schools over government institutions.""

Mohammed Yousuf, a Marappa Garden resident and parent of a child who's an RTE beneficiary, said, ""I don't think government schools are up to the mark. They don't have good English teachers and lack infrastructure. Moreover, the nearest government school in our area is located on defence land, can be accessed by every passerby and has a dumpsite too. My son will not be safe.""

Education department officials admit that no new government school has been opened in the state in the past three years.

Citing a 2017 study by the RTE Forum, a national organization, which states that 90% of RTE students paid fees to private schools,Y Mariswamy, chairperson (in charge), Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights said, ""We get a lot of complaints from parents. It is sad that students are still made to pay fees at private schools despite being admitted under RTE. As we are the monitoring body for RTE and as well as child protection laws, I feel this move will give a boost to government schools and put in place systems required in these institutions.""

Niranjan Aradhya, senior fellow and programme head, Universalisation of Equitable Quality Education Programme, Centre for Child and the Law, NLSIU, said: ""This is a chance for government schools to improve. The government just needs to do a few basic things like recruit more English teachers and upgrade schools to the level of Kendriya Vidyalayas. To make RTE effective, they need to implement section 12(2) of the RTE Act which mandates private unaided schools receiving government largesse to reserve seats for weaker sections from their neighbourhood without the state having the obligation to reimburse them.

fund of I95 lakh has been utilised for procuring seven buses.

Smart classrooms and laptops

As part of Inspire Perumbavoor programme, smart classrooms were introduced in numerous schools. As many as 41 classrooms were upgraded to hi-tech classrooms in lower primary level.

The Directorate of Elementary Education under the School and Mass Education (S&ME) department has issued an order to the District Education Officers (DEOs) and Block Education Officers (BEOs) in this regard seeking an action taken report at the earliest.

Sources said the move came after the Chief Minister's Office (CMO) intervened into the matter and asked the department to look into it. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, which came into force in 2016, has provisions for appointment of special educators in schools at primary and upper primary levels to improve the standard of education for children with special needs. As per provisions, the Government will ensure appointment of at least one special educator in each primary and upper primary school. However, not a single special educator has been appointed in these schools so far, sources added.

In June, the Secretary of Social Security and Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (SSEPD) had urged the S&ME department to implement the provisions and submit an action taken report in this regard. However, the department had failed to act, sources said.

Sources in the Directorate of the Elementary Education said there is a provision of '3,000 per year for every child with special needs studying in Government and Government-aided schools for his/her study materials and stipend."

But this doesn't translate into government owning and running schools.

No matter which way one looks at it, there is no widespread market failure in school education. There is the matter of supporting poor children, but as far as the supply of high-quality supply is concerned, there is overwhelming evidence that the market is competent to do so without any government involvement.

On the other hand, there is overwhelming evidence of the failure of government education. As the Secretary to the government of Assam for Education in the early 1990s, I quickly became aware of how the Minister of Education (in a Congress government in my time) used the appointment and transfers of teachers as the key mechanism to extract bribes. The director of education of Assam was the conduit for this. The entire system was totally broken: many schools only existed on paper and ""teachers"" drew salaries when there was nothing on the ground.

The seriously misguided policy idea that the government must directly own and run schools came about as a result of a grievous error of analysis made by Lord Macaulay nearly two hundred years ago. This misconception continues till today among the ""educated"" who are not aware of the ground reality. The socialist Aam Aadmi Party's misplaced passion for government schools is one such example, and discuss my meeting on this issue with a senior AAP leader some other time.

The ""educated"" typically have a belief that parents won't send their children to school unless they are compelled by the state to do so. It is believed that given a chance, poor parents prefer to deploy their children as child labour. But the reality is that - as James Tooley's research has confirmed this fact that was well-known to many of us - all over India hundreds of millions of poor parents are sending their children to for-profit low-cost private schools. Roughly a third of India's poor children attend such schools.

Further, that some parents may indeed deploy their children as labour (extremely rare today) is actually the inevitable consequence of socialist policies that make parents view education dimly - as not being worthwhile since it won't improve their children's job prospects. There is a strong factual basis for this perception since millions of low quality ""graduates"", who are totally unsuited for the job market, are found unemployed today across India in second-tier towns and in the villages. Let's us, therefore, agree that there is no one more keenly interested in the welfare of their children than the parents. We must harness this powerful force instead of rejecting it.

Second, there is a mistaken belief that a school must have significant infrastructure and paraphernalia, or that its teachers must necessarily be ""highly qualified"". But as Gandhi said in a speech at Chatham House in 1931: ""the schools established after the European pattern were too expensive for the people"" and ""The village schools were not good enough for the British administrator, so he came out with his programme. Every school must have so much paraphernalia, building, and so forth"".

Gandhi, therefore, said: ""I defy anybody to fulfil a programme of compulsory primary education of these masses inside of a century. This very poor country of mine is ill able to sustain such an expensive method of education. Our State would revive the old village schoolmaster and dot every village with a school both for boys and girls"". What a brilliant thought! - except that there must not be any direct role for the state even in such schools.

James Tooley's book, The Beautiful Tree, shows that children who attend low cost for-profit private schools (including in India) achieve much higher educational outcomes than children from comparable government schools, despite such private schools having virtually no infrastructure and the teachers of such schools not even being ""adequately"" qualified. The reason these schools succeed while government schools fail is that teachers in the private schools are held to account for outcomes by the Principal, who is often the school owner. These for-profit undertakings depend critically on demonstrating real results in order to continue to get the custom of the poor parents who pay a small fee on a monthly basis and will quickly switch their child to a competing school if they don't' see significant progress each month.

Tooley's research enables us to totally dispense with the myth that government schools are required to educate children. This research has also confirmed Gandhi's assertion that excellent village schools operated in India prior to British rule. These schools functioned from the houses of the teachers, did not need a vast paraphernalia of infrastructure, and all sections of the community were able to send their children to these schools to avail high quality, low-cost education. In Shanti Niketan, Rabindranath Tagore was basically attempting to replicate this form of education, with a focus on learning and not on facilities or infrastructure.

Unfortunately, Macaulay's misplaced paternalism injected government into schools in India and was also copied by the UK, which had an entirely private (or local) school education system prior to that. In both cases, the effect was harmful, as the number of students and quality of education plummeted. Till today, an average government school across the world performs much worse than an average private school, barring a few exceptions.

We noted at the outset that the government must support the poor to access education - to ensure equality of opportunity. There is a simple and direct way to achieve this without owning and running schools, by providing vouchers of certain nominal value (depending on the income level of parents) for each poor child up to year 12 that can only be exchanged for school education (including for vocational education). This is our party's policy. These vouchers would enable the children of poor parents to attend a good for-profit private school.

The idea of vouchers has a long history and has also been tried out in a number of ways across the world, although not in the full-blown manner that's our party's policy. Milton Friedman is probably best known for his advocacy of this system but his ideas did not go far enough. He was willing to allow competition between private and government schools but our party does not see any role whatsoever for even a single government school. Our party is committed to the total privatisation of all government schools - in a well-structured manner.

The alignment of incentives when parents choose (and themselves fund, even if to a small extent) for-profit private schools is the best way to quickly and significantly improve India's dismal quality of school education.

Our party would, of course, remove most regulations in this area, such as requirements for infrastructure, playgrounds or even for the qualification of teachers. The market will determine who is best placed to teach. All we would require is that each school pick an affiliating board (such as CBSE, but that would need to be disbanded and private boards would emerge) and demonstrate high quality student outcomes in order to be eligible for the school vouchers. This would be an outcomes-based regulatory system, with detailed management (including things like the medium of instruction) left to schools and parents: the parties with the deepest direct interest in outcomes.

We therefore disagree with things like the Right to Education Act which we see as a socialist anachronism. India needs to fully liberate the education sector to allow the best private sector initiatives to emerge, unfettered by the misguided notions of any delusional (and mostly corrupt) bureaucrat or minister.

The government has sufficient core work to perform, in which it has repeatedly failed. When Indian governments can't deliver security and justice, how can they possibly deliver education? Today India is led by a government which can't distinguish between mythology and cosmetic surgery, between homeopathy and medicine. So what makes us think it can teach our children?"

The survey found that 88% students were allegedly beaten up, as a matter of routine, multiple times a week in some government schools, while in other government schools, around 30% experienced corporal punishment multiple times. All 50 students from low-cost public schools, who were part of the survey, reported that they were beaten up.

On an average, almost half of the children interviewed were allegedly beaten by teachers multiple times a week. The report, Choking Childhood, is based on the findings of research undertaken by social organisation Agrasar, which works with disadvantaged communities.

A total of 521 children and 100 parents sampled randomly were surveyed, and an informal group interview with 12 teachers from two different government schools was undertaken.

There are around 130 primary government schools in Gurugram, from which the students were randomly selected. There are around 18,000 students in the primary schools, as per estimates.

The Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, prohibits 'physical punishment' & 'mental harassment' under Section 17(1) and makes it a punishable offence under Section 17(2).

""The report studies the impact of corporal punishment on the psyche of children who are doubly disadvantaged by virtue of them being children who are predominantly from poor migrant communities and first-generation learners,"" said Prerit Rana, co-founder and CEO of Agrasar. He added that corporal punishment in schools was not only a violation of human rights, but also impaired the health and education of the children.

According to the report, 70% of the children reported that they were beaten at home after parents learnt that they were beaten in school. More than 70% of the parents said that they beat their children, as they believe punishment is for their child's well being.

The report also outlined the challenging working conditions and lack of professional conduct among teachers in government schools fostered an environment that puts deprived children at risk of experiencing corporal punishment.

Responding to the findings of the report, Premlata Yadav, the district elementary education officer said, ""I will have to see the report to know how the survey was conducted. I do not agree with the findings of the report. One can expect 1-2% of such cases but it is incorrect to say that 80% of the children are beaten.""

Yadav added that teachers are not allowed to punish students and strict action is taken if such a complaint is raised. ""If we receive information of this nature, we warn the teachers and sometimes, it can also lead to their suspension. We take strict action on reports of corporal punishment,"" she said.

A Sanskrit teacher at a government school said that corporal punishment is rarely doled out. ""Teachers rarely beat students. However, sometimes children do not understand and teachers are compelled to take matters into their hands. I do not raise my hands at my students. I either ask them to do rounds of the ground with their hands raised up or call their parents,"" she said."

Subject-wise performance evaluation of students from government and private schools from the state, revealed the performance of government school students to be poorer than private schools in all districts, apart from Hyderabad where the performance was on par.

Looking at the data, it should not be a surprise that parents prefer shelling out more money in sending their children to private schools for education than government for better education. As per available data, more than half of the about 48 lakh students studying in various schools in Telangana, are studying in private schools.

For example, while the performance of students from government schools in Nalgonda was 31 per cent and 33 per cent in Mathematics and Science, it was 39 per cent and 40 percent respectively by private school students. Similarly, while the performance of government school students in Karimnagar in Social Science and English subjects was 38 per cent and 34 per cent respectively, it was 46 per cent and 56 per cent in private schools.

Only in Hyderabad, the difference between performance of government and private school students was not significant.

Urban-rural divide also deep

Significant difference in performance of students in various subjects has also been observed with respect to whether a student belongs to rural or urban area, indicating the disparity in quality of education received by students depending on where they belong from.

In the NAS it has been observed that in all districts of the state the performance of students in urban areas is higher than those from rural areas. For example, in Rangareddy district while the performance of students in Mathematics and Science in rural areas was found to be 33 per cent and 35 per cent respectively, in the urban areas it was 41 per cent in each subject. Similar is the case in all other districts.

Caste affects spoken English

The NAS also highlights the need for ensuring that education reaches every student equitably, regardless of the caste of the student. Significant difference has been found in the performance of students from the general category and those from the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes.

A difference of almost 5-10 per cent was observed in the performances of students from general categories as compared to those from reserved categories. The difference was prominent in all the subjects that students study at the high school level.

However, the difference is most pronounced, as much as 15 per cent, in case of English language. For example, while the students belonging to the general category had an average performance percentage in Mathematics of 41 per cent while English had 50 per cent. On the other hand, among the students from Scheduled Castes it was 31 per cent and 35 per cent respectively."

At a time when Government talks about ""Digital Literacy "" how is it possible that people especially students don't have access to electricity? Despite the obvious connection between electricity and educational achievement, however, the troubling scenes in Jammu and Kashmir are repeated as there are thousands of Government run schools without electricity. Present and past Governments in J&K, have been focusing on administrative affairs of education department or even pedagogy, but very little focus has been given to electricity in Government schools. The absence of focus on this issue is detrimental because, a study has put it like this, ""education is also widely recognized as one of the most essential components for poverty reduction"". Lack of electricity at primary, middle and secondary schools therefore creates considerable obstacles towards escaping poverty and correlates with many factors that contribute directly towards it. It is a big impediment towards digital literacy as well because when there is no electricity in a Government school, the children will have no access to computers and other digital equipment. The report on link between education and poverty assesses the direct link between electricity and education.

Based on the most recently available survey data from the World Bank and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the report first describes the current state of electrification of schools. According to the this data, roughly four out of every five primary and secondary schools in African countries (Govt and Private schools) surveyed lacked access to electricity, along with almost three quarters of village schools in India. This is much worst in Jammu & Kashmir state as more than 70 percent Government schools are un-electrified in this 21st century. When it comes to Kashmir division, more than 80 percent of Government schools are un electrified and these details I have been provided officially by several Chief Education Officer (CEOs) when I sought details under Right to Information Act (RTI). In Jammu province also the majority of Government schools in Rajouri , Poonch , Doda , Ramban , Reasi , Kishtwar and Doda are still un electrified.

Based on a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and policy literature concerning electricity and education, the report mentioned above assesses the educational benefits of electrification of primary and secondary schools, including lighting and access to information and communications technologies (ICT) as well improvement in staff retention and student completion and graduation rates. The final two main parts of the report, drawn from energy policy, development studies, and innovations in financing and public private partnerships literature, discuss the challenges facing school electrification, such as lack of financing and technical problems with equipment, along with the solutions and incentives with the potential to overcome them, such as Public Private Partnerships (PPPs).

Rajouri , Srinagar

At a time when Government of India is celebrating achievement of 100 percent electrification feat across country, information available reveals some astonishing facts. As per the Government figures, there are 1720 Govt schools in Rajouri district and out of them 1484 (over 86 percent) don't have access to electricity. Out of 1720 Government schools in Rajouri district , there are 995 primary, 557 middle, 117 high and 41 higher secondary schools. In addition to these there are 6 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalyas (KGBV) across the district.

In Srinagar district, more than 300 Government schools have not been provided electricity connection by Government till date. More than two years have passed since Government had ordered to get all the schools electrified. In Srinagar there are around 519 Govt run schools out of which there are 204 primary schools, 211 middle schools, 74 high schools and 30 higher secondary schools. Out of the 519 Govt schools, there are around 305 schools which are still un electrified.

Budgam, Ganderbal

In Budgam district there are more than 81 percent Government run schools which are un-electrified. This is an official information that was provided to me by Chief Education Officer (CEO) of Budgam under RTI Act. CEO Budgam informed me in his reply that there are around 1,036 schools in the district out of total 1278 that are ""without proper electricity connection"". Actually I had sought the details of all the un electrified Govt schools in Kashmir valley under RTI Act. I filed application before the designated Public Information Officer (PIO) in the Directorate of School Education Kashmir (DSEK). Instead of providing the information , PIO passed the buck to all the Chief Education Officers (CEOs) of Kashmir valley plus Leh and Kargil . That is why I got the details from each district. I also sought information about the number of girls' schools without a toilet facility and the number of schools without a proper electricity connection, boundary wall and drinking water facility. CEO Budgam in his reply said that ""all"" the girls' schools had a washroom facility, ""there are dysfunctional toilets "".

In Ganderbal district out of 587 government schools, 434 schools are un electrified which means around 83 percent Government schools have no access to electricity. These details were revealed by Chief Education Officer (CEO) Ganderbal in a reply to my Right to Information (RTI) application.

Conclusion

Why is Government compromising on providing the basic infrastructure to Government schools while as no such compromise is done when it comes to perks and salaries of Government employees especially Govt school teachers ? Infrastructure and level of education is coming down in Govt schools , but this is not the case with Government's own employees ? Their salaries continue to be hiked. Govt spends more than Rs 1.40 lakhs every month on an average Government school in J&K. Do poor kids enrolled in these schools get the desired facilities ? On contrary to this, not even Rs 50,000 is spent on an average private school in J&K by local school management, but the results are quite different. Board of School Education (BOSE) collected an amount of Rs 16.81 crores from students in shape of exam fees in Kashmir valley recently, but the class Xth & XIIth students were forced to write exams under candle light as there is no facility of gen-sets in the exam centers. Not even heaters are made available in Govt schools (exam centers) by BOSE and children are made to shiver in the cold. I have been forced to seek intervention of J&K State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) where I filed a petition recently.

I hope to get some good direction soon from SHRC. Imagine kind of trauma poor kids are facing in classrooms during June , July and August when temperature rises above 30 degree in valley and more than 40 in Jammu plains or in Rajouri , Ramban or Poonch districts ? After missing the initial deadline of May 2017, the Narendra Modi government on April 29th this year announced ""electrification"" of all inhabited villages in India has been completed.After having all the data available vis a vis un electrified schools in J&K , it clearly indicates that announcement by Government was largely symbolic. In a state where 75 to 80 percent Government schools are still un electrified how can Government claim to have achieved 100 percent electrification target ? How can Government claim to achieve digital literacy target in future if Govt schools are not electrified?

""My children go to a private school Madam, it is close to home, they learn English and mathematics"", says Selvi with a big smile on her face. Selvi, a Marathahalli-based domestic worker, like many others from low income households in Bangalore, finds private schools a better choice for her child.

Research has often pointed out that there is not much difference in the learning outcomes of children in government schools and in private schools. Yet in Bengaluru, like many urban centres in the country, children across income groups are flocking to private schools. While the number of private schools are rapidly rising, government schools are increasingly being merged/shut down in the name of low student enrolment. The narrative around government schools remains one of poor accountability and infrastructure, poorly trained or absent teachers, poor attendance and pass rates of students.

In 2016-17, Bangalore Urban had 1403 government schools, and almost thrice as many - 3426 - private schools. Student enrolments illustrate the trend better. That year, only 1.8 lakh children were enrolled in government schools, compared to nearly 11 lakh children in private schools.

The most commonly cited concern about government schools is the lack of sufficient, well-qualified teachers.

Dr V P Niranjan Aradhya, Programme Head (Right To Education) at the Centre for Child and Law, NLSIU, points out that there were over 28,000 vacancies for government elementary school teachers in Karnataka as of 2016-17. ""The number of sanctioned posts was 1.94 lakh, but only 1.66 lakh teachers were working then. The department has been talking about plans to recruit teachers, but currently poorly-paid guest teachers are being appointed in many vacancies,"" he says.

Given the low rate of enrolment in government schools in the city, there are schools with only 10-15 students spread across grade 1-5, or schools that have only 30 students overall from class 1-7. Such schools often have only one or two teachers. These teachers have to teach every subject to students across all grades, even if they are not qualified for it, says Aradhya. Teachers are also burdened with additional duties and administrative tasks. There are even schools in the city that lack a Headmaster, requiring one among the skeletal teaching staff to do the additional administrative tasks of the HM.

Anurag Behar, Vice Chancellor at Azim Premji University, says the low quality of schools comes down to the poor quality of teacher education. Behar was part of the implementation committee for the Justice J S Verma Commission report on teacher education. The Justice Verma Commission, set up by the Supreme Court, had pointed out in its 2012 report that the majority of Teacher Education Institutions (TEI) in the country were highly commercial private establishments.

Behar says: ""In the 1960s, India had only about 1300 TEIs. In the early 1990s, it was about 1500. Then, between 1993 and 2011, this number rose to about 16,000. In this period, the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) gave licenses to many private institutions that were fraudulent and corrupt; many of these institutions don't even hold classes."" He says that out of nearly 18,000 TEIs in the country now, about 92% are private.

Other issues pointed out by the Verma Commission Report include: teacher education curriculum remaining unchanged for over 65 years, TEIs being standalone institutions rather than being part of universities, the generalist nature of M.Ed programmes etc. The Commission had in fact reviewed 291 TEIs in Maharashtra, and recommended that 85% of these should be shut down.

Though much of the Commission's recommendations have been ignored, there have been a few initiatives such as the centre's budget announcement this year to introduce an integrated B.Ed course. ""But what about the existing 16,000-odd TEIs that are of low quality? Nothing much has been done about those,"" says Behar.

While shortage of qualified teachers is a major concern, both Aradhya and Behar say that teachers are not respected or incentivised enough in the education system. Teacher absenteeism - i.e., absence without a valid reason - has been blamed for much of the shortcomings of government schools.

But a 2016 study by Azim Premji Foundation (APF) across over 600 schools in six states including Karnataka, had shown that teacher absenteeism was only 2.5%. However, the overall teacher absence was around 19%, which was due to other administrative or departmental work they were assigned, trainings, or legitimate leaves; that is, teachers were absent due to systemic issues rather than a lack of professionalism.

The current system, wherein teachers' promotions are based entirely on tenure, hardly incentivises high-performing teachers as well.

Bengaluru's government schools are also affected by bureaucratic procedures like frequent teacher transfers. ""The transfer process is lengthy, and happens just a few months into the academic year. Events like elections can delay it even more. Neither the teacher nor the students would know if the teacher would remain in the school that year. This affects consistency in academic inputs,"" says Kapil Dawda, Bengaluru City Director for the non-profit Teach for India. Teach for India's fellows work as full-time teachers in low-income schools; currently they work with 24 government schools in the city.

Jean Boddu, Senior Program Manager at Mentor Together, another non-profit that works with government schools, says the distribution of bags and books to students also gets delayed by 2-3 months from the start of the academic year. ""Also, there is a huge dropout of students in 9th standard, as students who are academically weak are neglected, and fail exams."" Boddu says such students are not supported well enough as the school is worried that its 10th standard pass percentage may drop down if they continue there.

In terms of infrastructure, Bengaluru's government schools do have basic infrastructure like toilets and electricity, but in many cases the infrastructure is not functional. For example, schools that have toilets may lack water; or the toilet is kept locked. There is little investment in the operation and maintenance of existing infrastructure. In Bengaluru, corporates have adopted many government schools, providing funds, books, infrastructure etc.

Dawda says that schools located in areas like Whitefield which have a high concentration of corporates, tend to have better essential infrastructure because of this. ""Government schools in these areas often have a science lab, computer lab etc., which schools in areas like Ejipura or Goripalya don't have,"" he says. Since such philanthropic work is not streamlined and coordinated by the Department of Public Instruction, the results are often skewed and less effective.

In education system, the Cluster Resource Person (CRP) who oversees some 10-12 government schools per cluster, is the academic authority, says Aradhya. ""CRP has to monitor the quality of learning process, but he usually ends up doing administrative work and collecting data from schools. Parents also don't know that it's the CRP they have to approach, to hold their child's school accountable,"" he says.

The Karnataka School Quality Assessment and Accreditation Council (KSQAAC) routinely assesses government schools in the state and accredits them. Schools have to undergo both a self-assessment and external assessment, and are graded on multiple aspects like learning achievement, learning environment and physical environment. They are then given accreditation in grades ranging from A+ to D.

The Council has routinely ranked schools poorly. In 2014-15, for example, it had assessed 1220 government schools, 917 aided schools and 24 unaided schools in the state. In Bangalore Urban overall (Bangalore North and South educational districts combined), out of 78 schools, no schools got A or A+ grade, and only eight got B+. Sixteen schools got B grade, 33 got C+, 17 got C and four schools got D grade.

Aradhya opines that the accreditation system is useless as long as there is no initiative to improve the quality of schools. ""If the government is providing functional infrastructure, recruiting teachers and monitoring the learning process in schools, then it has the right to give accreditation. Else, continuing this exercise without doing anything to improve quality, only sends the message that government schools are bad,"" he says.

While government schools compulsorily have to submit to the KSQAAC accreditation process, private schools are not bound to. In the current system, private schools can participate in the accreditation process if they want to, by paying a fee to KSQAAC. Very few usually do.

Currently there isn't a system to assess private schools on their quality. The majority of private schools in Bangalore are low-income schools without adequate infrastructure or well-qualified teachers. However parents are keen to send their children to these schools because of the English language education offered, and the general perception that these schools are better.

Accountability remains the core difference between public schools and private ones, according to Shashi Kumar D, General Secretary of KAMS (Associated Management of Private Schools in Karnataka). ""There are issues with private schools, they are not isolated from the problems of running a school. For example there may be a lacuna with the lessons offered, or the hire of unskilled teachers. But because of the pervasive accountability in these establishments the teachers increase their skills, knowledge and teaching ability,"" Kumar says.

However, research has often showed that there isn't much of a difference in the quality of education in government and private schools. World Bank's World Development Report 2018 says that, in the 40 countries it researched on, including India, there were no differences in the learning outcomes of children in private and public schools, given that they had matching familial backgrounds. Any marginal difference was because private schools mainly admitted students from advantaged backgrounds. That is, student performance depended on the student's household, and not the quality of education offered by the school. Another study by APF in rural Andhra Pradesh in 2015 had shown similar results.

Behar says, ""There would be less than 2% private schools that are elite and actually have the resources to run a high quality school. But even their quality of education is suspect. The remaining low-fee private schools are mostly much worse in quality."" Behar says there would be only 10-15% private schools that are truly committed to providing good quality education. ""For the rest, it is a business,"" he says.

Dr Shalini Rajneesh, Principal Secretary (Primary and Secondary Education Department), says that government school students often lack a good support system. ""First-generation school goers cannot study the way a typical private school student studies - by rote. There are no support systems for public school students, no remedies and no help at home. That is why, now we are attempting to bring a more holistic form of learning; and we are doing this along with NGOs across the city, like Akshara.""

Whether government schools will in fact get the right support, or whether they will continue to be shut down further in the name of low enrolment, remains to be seen."

The government had introduced digital classrooms in high schools, infused of ICT as part of pedagogy, brought in subjects like robotics in residential schools, and most recently, made over government schools by turning their walls into canvases.

However, it seems their efforts don't prove much because the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE), National Achievement Survey (NAS) by MHRD, and the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) have thoroughly highlighted the poor quality of government schools in Telangana, with respect to infrastructure as well as quality of education being imparted.

In fact, compared to the data published in the UDISE for the academic year 2014-15, this year's report revealed that not much has changed in government schools since TRS had come to power. One glaring example is that of computer availability in government schools, which has actually gone down to 36 percent from being 37.5 percent in 2014, as per the UDISE numbers. In secondary schools, it has increased slightly from 29 to 31 percent.

When it comes to matters of infrastructure in primary schools such as having boundary walls, single-room classrooms, playgrounds, and kitchen sheds, the data indicates stagnancy. While studies showed that there was a steady improvement in the performance of residential schools run by the social welfare department -- where just about 15 per cent of students studied -- other government schools like the zilla parishad schools were constantly ignored.

Another example is that of science laboratories in secondary schools. The percentage of schools having Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Computer and Maths labs have down to 17.6, 17.5, 16.9. 11.7 and 6.3 percent from 19.3, 19.2, 18.5, 12.7 and 8 percent respectively.

Poor quality of education

Various reports released in the last four years raised questions over the quality of education being imparted in government schools of Telangana. For example the NAS report released this year pointed out that performance of school students in Telangana in all the subjects was poorer than that of students from most districts of other southern states.

Even the Comptroller and Auditor General in its audit report released this year pulled up the Telangana government as it found that 14-26 percent children in primary schools and 21-47 percent children in upper primary schools scored less than 40 percent in the years 2014-17. It also pointed out issues like unhygienic conditions of kitchens in schools used for cooking midday meals.

TRS government can't walk the talk?

It's no news that the TRS government has never forgone an opportunity to talk about its achievements in residential educational institutions run by the social welfare department. Good performance of students in SSC exams, competitive exams, academic and extra-curricular initiatives has often been the talk of the town during TRS rule.

However, government teachers point out that these residential schools -- home to jus10 percent of the 22 lakh students enrolled in different government schools across the State -- are not run by the Department of School Education (DSE) and receive ample funds, as a result they deliver better results. The government is all-talk when it comes to these schools and mum when it comes schools that come under the DSE.

The stark difference could be seen in this year's SSC results as the pass percentage in residential schools was above 90 percent whereas in zilla parishad schools it was just about 75 percent.

Telangana State United Teachers Federation, general secretary, Chava Ravi, said, ""Around 20,000 teacher positions are vacant in government schools. The TRS government has not recruited a single teacher since 2014, even though the TRT was announced for 8,972 posts last year.""

""There are several schools where one to two teachers teach 5 classes and cover 18 subjects. Moreover, in this academic year, school maintenance funds have not been released yet by the State government and the amount is expected to go down with the merger of SSA (Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan) and RMSA (Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan).

Negative marks for TRS government on school fee regulation issue : Parents

Parents across the State have been crying hoarse demanding fee regulation. The Hyderabad Schools Parents Association (HSPA) has conducted many protests on this issue, including writing a post card to the Chief Minister and producing a song chiding him for not taking any action on the issue. The post even went viral on social media.

These protests and promises by the government -- especially the education minister -- notwithstanding, the TRS government has failed to address problems of exorbitant fee. The State government constituted a committee to look into the issue, headed by former Osmania University Vice Chancellor, Prof Tirupati Rao. The committee was formed in March 2017 and was supposed to submit its report in the next one month. It actually did so only in December. It's a year since the report was submitted, but it has not been made public yet. The government did not even form the district fee regulatory committees."

Furthermore, the bench directed the authorities concerned to file their counter affidavit by December 6. It also impleaded the Director of State Council for Education, Research and Training, as a party.

According to the petitioner, there are about 37,211 government schools, 8,403 government aided and 12,419 private self-financing schools, imparting education to about 1.25 crore students. Around 40 lakh students study in 12,419 private schools. The State spends Rs 27,000 crore for education per annum.

Although as per the State's education policy, English is taught as the second language from Class 2 to 12 in Tamil medium aided and unaided schools, despite having successfully completing Plus Two with high marks, a student was unable to speak or understand any communication in English.

Moreover, he was also unable to converse or write fluently in English.

This leads to communication problems for him when he pursues professional courses or higher education that are imparted only in English.

However, the students who study in CBSE schools find it easier to understand and communicate in English. Therefore, a need has arisen to lay emphasis on spoken English, said the petitioner."

""Scotland will become the first country in the world to have LGBTI inclusive education embedded in the curriculum,"" said a statement released on Thursday.

Just that morning a few of them had visited the Government Urdu Higher Primary School at Nachanahalli Palya on Manandavadi Road and soon after lunch, nearly ten of them led by Dame Hilary Blume (Director, The Green Hotel and Founder, Charities Advisory Trust in UK) were ready to hop into the mini bus and visit a few more schools run by the Government of Karnataka.

As the bus drove towards the congested Kyathamaranahalli and entered a small lane, the women, who alighted from the bus, were surprised to see a clean, well-maintained Government Higher Primary School. There was a welcome committee with the Head Master of the School V. Ramaswamy, a disciplined, dedicated teacher and H. Saraswathi, the Director of RLHP (Rural Literacy and Health Programme) who is coordinating with Charities Advisory Trust, greeting the group of lively women.

Walking up a flight of stairs that led to the library of the school at the far end, the students, both boys and girls, all dressed neatly in green uniforms got up shyly but most of them immediately recognised the familiar of face of Dame Hilary Blume, who is no stranger to Mysuru.

""Do you recognise Madam Hilary?"" asked the Head Master and most of the students immediately recalled her earlier visit to the school. The library is well- equipped with books, desks and benches (all funded by the Charities Advisory Trust) and the visitors were keen to see how many students were really into reading the books.

A few of the students got up to demonstrate how helpful the reading habits they had been inculcated with had worked. A girl from eighth standard picked up a book in English and read without any mistakes in clear diction while a few others read from books in Kannada related to freedom fighters and scientists. Then they sang a few patriotic songs.

Now, it was the turn of the motley group of exuberant women, mostly in their sixties and seventies, to become children. They started singing the nursery rhyme for kids, 'Head, Shoulder, Knees and Toes.' Led by 'Good Giver' Annie Taylor, who had taught little children in Ethiopia, they began on a slow pitch and accelerated. The children who joined them sang with gusto and joy.

Impressed by the kind of work done by the school and RLHP, Hilary Blume asked the Head Master, what else they required for their school. He said that they needed a water filter and a LCD screen projector. She promised to install both through the profits earned in The Green Hotel.

""The profit of every meal eaten in The Green Hotel helps buy an egg for a child or for the books of children,"" she told SOM.

The children then wanted to know more about the visitors and they introduced themselves. There were two Elizabeths, one from Canada and another from England, both of whom were doctors. There was Ann Kingston, who was the knitting teacher for the ""Knit for Peace"" group and Danielle Liebech, who had visited The Green Hotel five times and there was also the young L. Marie, originally from France, who is working with Hilary Blume.

After a satisfying visit at Kyathamaranahalli, the group moved towards Sathagalli, where there is a slum and another Government Higher Primary School. It was around 4.30 pm. The RLHP runs a nutrition programme here in the school premises. A few of the infants and children were sitting there along with their mothers. A young woman, fondly called Akhila aunty by the Sathagalli slum residents, had brought ragi porridge which had a healthy mix of pulses and greens like drumstick leaves.

Along with the porridge, the kids were also given boiled eggs. A few of the mothers told this reporter how useful this programme was, as it had helped their malnourished children gain weight and improve their health.

Then right next door was the Government Higher Primary School where in the evening free supplementary classes are run for the children. Children in the age group of six to 14 were sitting there quietly waiting for the classes to begin.

All of them in unison welcomed the idea of the evening classes and how they were all happy to be there studying.

RLHP Director Saraswathi asked one of the students to get up and welcome the visitors. A tenth standard student B.B. Mehak got up and welcomed the group. This girl, who is the Malala Yousafzai, (Nobel Laureate from Pakistan who is an activist for female education) of Mysuru, had stopped a child marriage in her area a couple of years ago.

One of the teachers, Seema, was a child labourer, who used to roll agarbathis. But today she has completed her Pre-University education because of the support of RLHP and Charities Advisory Trust.

The slum children here are so vibrant that when they were asked to sing a song, four girls got up and began singing Jalle Kabbu..., a folk song in faultless Kannada and dancing to choreographed steps. Asked for their names, they said Luhia, Simran, Husna and Rafia.

Everyone was moved by the effort that had gone into preparing the deprived sections of the society to face the world boldly.

""The Charities Advisory Trust is supporting many causes including the beauticians' course, nutrition programme, sponsoring health camps from the funds collected through Good Gift India. Their focus is also on libraries and they have helped setting it up in nearly 100 Government Higher Primary Schools,"" said Saraswathi.

Later, speaking to Star of Mysore, Hilary Blume said that 'Knit for Peace' is an initiative of the Charities Advisory Trust started as an income generation project for Hutu and Tutsi widows, victims of the Rwandan genocide and civil war.

""At our suggestion, the widows knitted school jumpers for the many orphans and we paid them by raising funds through featuring the project in Good Gift Catalogue, another of the Trust's initiative,"" said Hilary Blume.

""Good Gifts is an initiative started by me. This is a concept where the giver knows exactly where the money goes. Hence, we came out with Good Gifts Catalogue where people can identify with a range of causes; in fact, there are over 400 ways to help people take their first step out of poverty, enjoy better health and increased opportunities,"" she said and added, ""I ask the givers to come and see how the concept works. That is how I bring such people to visit Mysuru to see the schools and slums and how the money they have given is spent. Our next visit with the 'Knit for Peace' group is in early January,"" she said

Asked whether she believed like many others who are doing charity work that charity is also a business, Hilary Blume said, ""These are causes that I was introduced to, and continue to support, as I believe in them. I believe that once I give money, then the money is out of my hands to control. So it is important that I can trust those organisations I support. Administration is critical to keep a charity going, but too many big charities waste too much money.""

On whether she has written any books on charity having worked for more than 40 years in the field, she recalled five books titled, 'Fund Raising - A Comprehensive Handbook,' 'Accounting and Financial Management for Charities,' 'Charity Trading Handbook,' 'Museum Trading Handbook' and 'Charity Shop Handbook' she has written. Hilary Blume also revealed that she is penning the sixth one now called 'The Ethics of Charity Giving.'"

However, the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR), a state government department constituted under the Child Rights Act of 2005, aims to change this.

Next month, the DCPCR will undertake a rigorous assessment of 5,800 schools in the capital -- all of which are administered by the state government's education ministry and/or New Delhi's three municipal corporations- as a precursor to creating the country's first ever 'School Development Index' for a state.

Owing to the sheer number of schools involved and data required, earlier indices compiled by the government have focussed on the state or districts as a whole rather than individual schools.

Unde the School Development Index, Delhi's schools will be ranked according to three parameters, as devised by the Adhyayan Foundation - an NGO that focuses on capacity building of schools.

The first parameter is safety and security, the second is teaching and learning outcomes while the third parameter is community participation and social integration. Each school will be given a rank between 1 to 4 for each criteria, with 1 indicating that it has the most room for improvement.

The assessment of Delhi's schools is expected to continue into next year, with a final report from the DCPCR due in May. The government body has made sure to clarify that the exercise is not a punitive one but an instructive one. The exercise will give the administrators of these schools an insight into best practices and facilitate an environment for collaboration.

Education has long been a priority for the current state government of Delhi. When contesting state elections for Delhi in 2015, the made the improvement of education outcomes one of the core aspects of their platform.

So far, it seems that they have kept their word. For example, in July this year, the government launched libraries in 100 primary schools in the city, in addition to a 100 last year. In June, it announced the planned launch of a ' happiness curriculum' in government schools, which involves meditation and life skills training. They have also instituted school management committees, improved the infrastructure of schools and invested in teacher training."

Scenes from two government schools in Delhi

The walls of the entryway of the school are covered with bright charts that talk about everything from sustainable development and 'Swachh Bharat' to 'happiness goals' and exam schedules. The cream-coloured floor gleams and the sun peeps out from the clouds behind the rows of students -- dupattas pinned, shirts tucked in, not a hair out of place -- sitting quietly for morning assembly. It's 8 a.m. on a hazy Delhi morning and this school in Dwarka Sector 10 is about to flip my perception of government schools completely.

""Government schools in India get a bad rap,"" says Principal T.P. Singh. ""But with RPVV, we try to do better."" The results are evident. The Dwarka branch of RPVV or Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya, along with its counterparts in Lajpat Nagar and Rohini Sector 11, are the three schools from Delhi that have made it to the nationwide list of top 12 government schools that's been compiled by EducationWorld portal as part of its India School Rankings 2017-18. In fact, the Dwarka school tops the list, with the Lajpat Nagar and Rohini schools at No. 6 and No. 12, respectively.

Labs and libraries

The RPVV schools, a Delhi government initiative to provide quality education to marginalised sections, were first opened in 1997, with one each in Rohini, Paschim Vihar and Surajmal Vihar. Twenty-one years later, there are 22 schools, with five of them launched last year alone.

All of them boast of language labs, upgraded auditoriums, relatively well-stocked libraries and, most importantly, a teacher-student ratio of 1:35. They take in students from Classes VI to XII and admissions are through an entrance test. Students are eligible only if they have studied in a government school for a minimum of two years.

When RPVVs were started as schools for high performers, they had the same shortcomings as other government schools -- poor infrastructure, undefined learning outcomes, dated teaching methods. ""But the last four or five years have seen a lot of change,"" says geography teacher Neerja Lamba, who has been with the school since 2003. ""We have a stress-free learning and teaching environment now. There are cultural activities and exchange programmes; students want to come to school,"" she says. Singh points out that the Delhi government has given the schools a free hand for improvements. ""For example, for any expenditure below ₹50,000, I don't have to write to the government. Little things like this make it so much easier.""

Over the past four years, the Delhi government has steadily increased funding for education, from 20% budgetary allocation in 2015 to 23.5% in 2017 and 26% in 2018.

The schools' improved infrastructure is testament to that. In the Dwarka branch, there's a fully air-conditioned auditorium, a conference hall open to both teachers and students, and a spanking new running track that instantly catches the eye. The labs have the latest equipment; there's a 'project development' room where students are recycling paper; and there are working water purifiers on every floor.

Robot Gangnam Style

The change is nowhere more perceptible than in the Rohini Sector 11 school, halfway across the city, where I find Class X student Prashant Kumar elbow-deep in a half-built drone. He is working after school hours in what the school calls the 'Atal Tinkering Lab'. ""I'm pretty sure I can get it to fly in a day or two; I just need to stabilise the gyro sensor,"" Kumar says confidently. His supervisor Vivek smiles behind him. ""That's going to need another month or two,"" he says. Close by, Class XII student Pratham Chopra's robot is dancing to 'Gangnam Style'. The coding took four months, says Chopra.

In the corner there is an actual 3D printer, the table around it littered with prototypes of printed whistles. The design's final version is now being used by the school's PT teachers. Science teacher Sadaf Fathima shows us a keychain printed in the shape of her name. The lab is the school's pride and joy, set up as part of the Central government's Atal Innovation Mission. Nearly 10,000 schools across the country applied for the grant, and RPVV-Rohini was among those to bag it in the first round.

Food, water, lessons

The one-year-old lab has sparked an interest in science among students, helping also to bring more girls in, say teachers. There are only three girls in the Class XII science stream this year, but the trend is beginning to slowly change in the younger classes, they say.

Social sciences teacher Shivani Singh says such facilities help immensely to address one of the biggest

problems of government schools: dropouts. In the Dwarka school, 63% of students come from families with monthly incomes below ₹5,000; their parents are rickshaw-pullers, labourers, sweepers, tailors, mechanics, domestic help, etc. When these students come into Class VI, they are undernourished, unable to take home school work, and, in some cases, have to contribute to the household income by taking up odd jobs.

But even as the dropout rate in Delhi government schools has been increasing, from 2.9% in 2014-15 to 3.4% in 2016-17 (Praja.org study), with worse results in municipal corporation schools, the RPVVs don't have any dropouts. ""Children want to do more than just study from textbooks. The 'more' is what we provide,"" says Shivani. ""They get clean water and nutritious food like dal chawal, daliya porridge, poori-sabzi. Girls get sanitary napkins,"" she says.

Walking through the school's corridors, both at Dwarka and Rohini, there is a steady stream of 'good morning' greetings around us. The students, free for the day after a gruelling exam, are not reticent and engage with their teachers comfortably. ""That took a lot of hard work,"" says Principal Singh. It was not just academics but also student-teacher relationships that needed overhauling. From improving teachers' listening and communication skills to newer teaching methods and learning objectives, ""we needed a change in pedagogy,"" says Singh.

A new pedagogy

It was this need that led him to begin the Cluster Leadership Development Programme, running now in all schools under the Directorate of Education in Delhi. ""We select 10 or so principals, area-wise, and get them to work with a facilitator-trainer. The principals, in turn, go back to their schools and work with the teachers,"" he says.

This has reduced teacher-student conflict, Singh says. ""And communication skills among students have improved; it's not great, but it's much better than what it used to be.""

The clubs and extra-curricular activities also play a big role. RPVV Rohini, for instance, has a Legal Advocacy Club where lawyers and judges address the children once a month. The Bal Bhavan Kendra is an arts and crafts initiative sponsored by the government's National Bal Bhavan in addition to regular art classes. I find a classroom filled with Madhubani paintings, wall hangings, home decor items, and more.

We walk into a room full of Class X students, and when they hear of their school's ranking, they break into ear-to-ear grins. Asked about their ambitions, they list scientists, doctors and more, but among them a handful says 'teacher'. They are as excited to teach in this school as they are to learn. The teachers accompanying us couldn't have been prouder."

The decision to convert hundreds of primary schools into English medium schools in districts like Karimnagar, Warangal and Nizamabad by teachers and its success led to the government giving the official nod to other schools across the State to follow suit.

As expected the enrolment rate in government schools has shot up. But the education experts think that despite the change in medium of instruction, it has had little effect on learning outcomes of government school students.

In 2016-17, for instance, 4,872 schools in the State were given permission to convert to English medium. Earlier back in 2008, in the united Andhra Pradesh, for the first time the then government had granted permission to run high schools with parallel mediums - 5,500 in Andhra and 2,200 Telagana area.

A social audit of learning outcomes carried out on 1,302 students from Class V to X by Campaign for Learning Outcomes, released last week confirmed this belief. It revealed that while 650 students could neither read nor write English, 271 could read only small sentences but not entire paragraphs.

Problem of parallel medium

Apart from granting the approval for change of medium of instruction, teaching community alleges, that the government did little to ensure that the move actually benefits students. In fact, the decision to run two parallel mediums is part of the problem. With the teacher-student ratio dismal in government schools, forcing one teacher to handle not just several classes but to even teach in two different languages.

""Most teachers are from Telugu medium background so for the sake for convenience they end up teaching in Telugu. Also, they find it difficult to alternate between Telugu in one period and English in the next. Students are not able to get acquainted with the language"" said T Venkateshwar Rao, President, English Language Teachers Association.

Proper training needed

The problem is further compounded by insufficient training of the lack thereof. For instance, in 2016, select primary teachers were provided five-day English language training. This was supplemented a year later by another five-day training for the same set of teachers.

""Now only a couple of teachers are trained from each school and later they too were transferred. Last academic year in Warangal, teachers from 132 primary schools have been trained but soon they got transferred to Telugu medium schools. This beats the very purpose of having English medium schools,"" said Nagati Narayana, an educationist.

Since a number of teachers themselves took the initiative to start classes in English medium and when it started showing positive results, teachers feel the government became complacent.

Teachers, however, said that the government should itself decide what measures can be taken for their safety. ""The government cannot deprive us from our right to live a dignified life. We are not here to be humiliated and assaulted by students and their parents,"" Singh said.

In September, a government school teacher was injured when a chunk of roof fell on her head. ""After this incident, we had written to the education department demanding teachers' safety but to no avail. This time we will not end the protest as long as something concrete is done by the government,"" he said."

The revamped 'CBSE Affiliation Bye-Laws 2018', brought out recently by the board has given more control to the state government over the functioning of such schools and also upcoming ones in the state.

The new bye-laws have also designated the state as the 'appropriate government' which would solely decide if the existing 1,300 CBSE schools in the state, as well as those in the pipeline, meet the prescribed norms in terms of infrastructure, safety, sanitation and land ownership. ""The CBSE would not re-check any aspects vetted by the state government during its inspection of schools,"" the bye-laws state.

The state government has also been given the power to bring in regulations on fees levied in CBSE schools. As per the bye-laws, fees would be charged as per the regulation of the appropriate government (state) and fee revision shall be subject to its laws, regulations and directions.

The 'Recognition' clause

Moreover, CBSE's insistence on 'recognition certificate' would be another crucial aspect which would enable the state government to make errant CBSE schools fall in line. Though CBSE schools in Kerala obtained a one-year relaxation from the board, all 1,300 plus schools will have to obtain it fairly soon from the state. ""Earlier, once the NOC was obtained, we had no business with the state government. We only needed to renew our affiliation every three years with the CBSE. Now, the state can cancel the NOC and prescribe a new set of rules while granting fresh NOC or during issuance of recognition certificate,"" said the manager of a leading CBSE school.

Kerala CBSE School Managements Association general secretary Indira Rajan said the new bye-laws have reduced procedural delay in getting affiliation. ""If the school managements have concerns about the state government getting a decisive role in affiliation process, it can be addressed through dialogue with all stakeholders,"" she said.

'NOC a policy matter'

General Education Secretary A Shajahan said the grant of NOC to CBSE schools is a 'policy decision' which needs to be taken at the highest level. Since the LDF Government assumed power, fresh NOC has not been granted to any CBSE school. Aggrieved school managements had taken legal recourse and obtained a court verdict that schools which meet the prescribed norms are eligible for NOC.

""The government is planning to approach the court seeking more time for implementation of the order. Though we have no issues with the functioning of existing CBSE schools, permission for new ones will be subject to strict scrutiny as we do not want mushrooming of such schools without any regulation,"" said a top source in the government."

The first phase of the project, targeted at the ones in a leadership position, will create awareness among principals and teach them about gender identities, including transgenders and homosexuals, and issues like Article 377. On Tuesday, the principals were encouraged to designate one toilet in their school as a unisex one, to frame anti-trans bullying rules and to organise multi-gender activities in their institutions.

Santosh Gupta, principal of a Seelampur school, admitted that for inclusive education, it was important to embrace the transgender community. ""I agree that education is the only way in which we can empower people from disadvantaged communities. Along with us, it is also important that the parents are included in this awareness programme,"" said Gupta.

In another phase, sensitisation events will be held for the nodal teachers of a school and then for the secondary students of the schools involved. Following this, a school that is determined to be ""trans friendly"" will be given an award.

Sanjay Goel, director, DOE, asked the principals to accept people from gender communities and work for their empowerment. ""They have their own way of living and they should be accepted as an important part of inclusive education,"" said Goel.

Meanwhile, lauding the government for accommodating of the rights of transgender, Anjaan Joshi of SPACE pointed out that people belonging to that community faced several hurdles. ""The first and the foremost of the problems is there is no separate column for the third gender in school forms. Also, it has been quite a challenge to advocate the issue of transgender rights and inclusion in public schools,"" said Joshi."

The project will be implemented jointly with the Social Justice Department.

As part of its first step, the state government will start 1,000 pre-primary schools in the state with adequate facilities and necessary infrastructure by coordinating with the available anganwadis in the vicinity of government schools.

The schools will give stress on educating children through activities, games without using text books or slates. However, the government could not give a timeframe as to when it start the new system owing to delay in the release of fund from the Union Government. The schools will focus on a unified child-friendly curriculum encompassing physical, social, intellectual, and emotional development of the child.

The General Education Department has also decided to provide space for anganwadis in government schools where excess accommodation was available and pre-primary school was not functioning.

SCERT Director J Prasad told Express that the new curriculum will focus on activity cards rather than using textbooks.

""In an effort to make the pre-primary education system scientific, we are introducing a new curriculum. As part of this, we have already started activity cards named 'Kalithoni'. The cards have 30 different themes and the first part is the collection of 10 themes.

""The cards aim at children's physical, creative, language, scientific and social and emotional development. Besides children, the new programme will also benefit the pre-primary school teachers"", Prasad said.

He, however, is apprehensive about the fund for implementing the project. ""We had long back submitted a project report to the union government for the funds.

""Apart from benefiting the children, it could also help to give a good pay to the teachers. The engaging of pre-primary staff by the PTAs could not be termed as statutory appointments by the government.

""Therefore, their claim for salary was not sustainable. Similarly, employees in the government sector, such as anganwadi workers, helpers and alternative school teachers, were paid only honorarium. So a hike in honorarium will be considered along with the project,"" Shahjahan said."
