A suspended student from the direction department of Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) belonging to the 2016 batch, has linked the action taken against her with a sexual harassment complaint she had lodged with the Internal Complaint Committee, in an open letter to the committee and the Union ministry of information and broadcasting. She has accused the institute's director Bhupendra Kainthola of creating a hostile work environment for her and inflicting an undeserved harsh punishment. Kainthola has refuted that the disciplinary action has nothing to do with the sexual harassment complaint, which was dealt with due process.

The 30-year-old woman was notified in the first week of August that she will be suspended for the whole sixth semester. She was asked to vacate her hostel accommodation at the close of the fifth semester. ""It also informed me that I will not be allowed to make my diploma film, none of my films will be sent to any festival, nor will I get any scholarship or be eligible for any foreign exchange programme,"" she informed. While the action was ascribed to an issue with her dialogue film exercise, she is convinced that this has more to do with her filing a sexual harassment complaint against a classmate and also for supporting another complainant on similar charges against a former faculty member (who she said was known to be close to Kainthola).

Accusing Kainthola of intimidation and obstructing her work on campus, she pointed out in the letter, ""Since the harassment is being perpetrated by the highest authority at the institute, I am forced to address the I&B ministry and the chairperson of the ICC.""

In his rebuttal, Kainthola observed, ""It is unfortunate that ICC is getting dragged into a purely academic issue, wherein action was taken against the student after she was found guilty of academic misconduct by an inquiry committee. Her statement is highly misleading and entirely at variance with the facts.""

He pointed out that a three-member inquiry committee was set up after it was found the she had conspired with another student from the sound department to replace the sound mix of a film, made as part of the dialogue exercise, with an unauthorised sound work. ""The committee found that she had attempted to bypass the norms and discipline of the dialogue film exercise,"" he recounted.

The committee saw this as a serious breach of trust, complete disregard for general and academic discipline and display of scant respect for her department and particularly the department mentor guiding her on this exercise, he added. Kainthola reiterated that the action taken against her was at the behest of the inquiry committee, including her expulsion for a specific period and denying her participation in the dialogue and other subsequent exercises, in film festivals and exchange programmes.

Kainthola also underscored that her complaint of sexual harassment against the classmate was dealt with by ICC. The woman has also accepted in her letter that the boy was suspended for a while. In the other case too, the faculty has been removed from the campus, her letter pointed out. The director took the opportunity to stress that due process is followed in every complaint of sexual harassment.

Against this backdrop, the director dismissed the woman's accusations against him as merely 'wild and imaginary'. ""It begs credibility. This is an attempt to cover up her act of professional fraud that she was found guilty of by the inquiry committee. She has tried to obfuscate matters by mixing up two unconnected issues involving her,"" he stated.

Betraying her own desperation, the direction student pleaded, ""This is my last chance to complain against the injustice meted out to me. It is my right to complete my diploma film. If students with criminal cases against them have been allowed to complete their diploma film. The order issued by FTII is too harsh for a matter that was sorted in the presence of six faculty members.""

Kainthola has described the allegations as ""wild and imaginary"".

In a four-page complaint letter sent to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, the 2016-batch student has said her harassment started after she testified against a faculty member who was accused of sexual harassment by three women students in September last year. In April this year, the girl had approached the internal complaints committee (ICC) of FTII with her own complaint of sexual misconduct by a male batchmate, who, she alleged, had assaulted her by entering her hotel room in the dead of the night when a group of students was visiting Aurangabad along with a faculty member in April 2018.

The senior faculty member in question has since been removed, while the male student was suspended from the hostel for three months and asked to attend ""therapy sessions"". However, in August this year, the complainant herself was punished with expulsion for an entire semester for ""professional misconduct"" and ""academic indiscipline"" during the production of an academic project.

The FTII administration had also barred her from working on her diploma film, and from sending her projects for film festivals. In her letter to the ministry, the complainant said the punishment given to her was ""unheard of in the history of FTII"". and came despite the fact that the issue had been ""settled after detailed deliberations held by faculty members of the concerned departments"".

She has written that this action against her had ""confirmed her fears"" that Kainthola had been targeting her for having raised her voice against sexual harassment consistently. ""The order (of her expulsion and other punishments) clearly was meant to destroy my career and I immediately sought legal advice on how to appeal against this. I was told that the appellate authority in this was Kainthola. But when I called him,

he harassed me further. He made accusations against me and refused to inform me the details of the inquiry that was obstructing my work. 'You don't have to know that', he said when it is my right to know these details about the inquiry,"" she wrote in her complaint to the ministry.

Kainthola said there was no truth in the allegations. ""It begs credibility. This is an attempt to cover up her act of professional fraud for which she was found guilty by the inquiry committee,"" Kainthola said in a written response to questions sent by The Indian Express.

He claimed that there was ""no connection whatsoever"" between the girl's complaint against her batchmate and the action against her when it was discovered that she had taken ""unauthorised external assistance"" while completing her academic project.

He said the three-member inquiry committee had concluded that there was a ""serious breach of trust, lack of respect, breaking of norms, and severe disregard for general and academic indiscipline"" by the girl student. ""Her one-sided statement is highly misleading and entirely at variance with the facts,"" Kainthola said.

The girl maintained that the action against her had come because of her complaint of sexual harassment and the fact that she had testified against a ""close friend (the senior faculty member)"" of the director. She has requested the ministry to ensure that the director is asked to step down from his ""position of power"" in order to facilitate a fair inquiry into her complaints."
